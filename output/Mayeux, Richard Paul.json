[{"PMID": "38902234", "Title": "Gliovascular transcriptional perturbations in Alzheimer's disease reveal molecular mechanisms of blood brain barrier dysfunction.", "Abstract": "To uncover molecular changes underlying blood-brain-barrier dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing in 24 Alzheimer's disease and control brains and focused on vascular and astrocyte clusters as main cell types of blood-brain-barrier gliovascular-unit. The majority of the vascular transcriptional changes were in pericytes. Of the vascular molecular targets predicted to interact with astrocytic ligands, SMAD3, upregulated in Alzheimer's disease pericytes, has the highest number of ligands including VEGFA, downregulated in Alzheimer's disease astrocytes. We validated these findings with external datasets comprising 4,730 pericyte and 150,664 astrocyte nuclei. Blood SMAD3 levels are associated with\u00a0Alzheimer's disease-related neuroimaging outcomes. We determined inverse relationships between pericytic SMAD3 and astrocytic VEGFA in human iPSC and zebrafish models. Here, we detect vast transcriptome changes in Alzheimer's disease at the gliovascular-unit, prioritize perturbed pericytic SMAD3-astrocytic VEGFA interactions, and validate these in cross-species models to provide a molecular mechanism of blood-brain-barrier disintegrity in Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Humans", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Smad3

"The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly increases in individuals carrying the APOE\u03b54 allele. Elderly cognitively healthy individuals with APOE\u03b54 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOE\u03b54; however, these mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOE\u03b54 carriers without dementia might carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOE\u03b54-mediated AD pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in the National\u00a0Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD\u00a0FBS), Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOE\u03b54 carriers. In homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain (COL6A2) and are known to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and in vivo functional studies. An independent analysis in a large cohort of 7185 APOE\u03b54 homozygous carriers found that rs140926439 variant in FN1 was protective of AD (OR\u2009=\u20090.29; 95% CI [0.11, 0.78], P\u2009=\u20090.014) and delayed age at onset of disease by 3.37 years (95% CI [0.42, 6.32], P\u2009=\u20090.025). The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels were increased at the BBB in APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD. Brain expression of cognitively unaffected homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers had significantly lower FN1 deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOE\u03b54-mediated AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b-the ortholog for human FN1. We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced gliovascular remodeling, and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting that pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance, which is ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests that vascular deposition of FN1 is related to the pathogenicity of APOE\u03b54, and LOF variants in FN1 may reduce APOE\u03b54-related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential therapeutic interventions targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Animals", "Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Fibronectins", "Genetic Variation", "Gliosis", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamil Iniyan", "Last Name": "Gunasekaran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Belloy", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes-Dumeyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "D\u00f6rthe", "Last Name": "J\u00fclich", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fcseyin", "Last Name": "Tayran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elanur", "Last Name": "Yilmaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bengisu", "Last Name": "Turgutalp", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gauthaman", "Last Name": "Sukumar", "Affiliation": "Henry M.

Elderly cognitively healthy individuals with APOE\u03b54 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOE\u03b54 ; however, these mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOE\u03b54 carriers without dementia might carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOE\u03b54- mediated AD pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD FBS), Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOE\u03b54 carriers. In homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain ( COL6A2 ) and are known to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and in vivo functional studies. The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels were increased at the BBB in APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD. Brain expression of cognitively unaffected homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers had significantly lower FN1 deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOE\u03b54 -mediated AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b - the ortholog for human FN1 . We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced gliovascular remodeling and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting that pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance, which is ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests vascular deposition of FN1 is related to the pathogenicity of APOE\u03b54 , LOF variants in FN1 may reduce APOE\u03b54 -related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential therapeutic interventions targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tamil Iniyan", "Last Name": "Gunasekaran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes-Dumeyer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "D\u00f6rthe", "Last Name": "J\u00fclich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H\u00fcseyin", "Last Name": "Tayran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elanur", "Last Name": "Yilmaz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Lantigua", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Medrano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Diones", "Last Name": "Rivera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Recio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nil\u00fcfer", "Last Name": "Ertekin-Taner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dennis W", "Last Name": "Dickson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott", "Last Name": "Holley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan02"}, {"PMID": "38260408", "Title": "ABCA7-dependent Neuropeptide-Y signalling is a resilience mechanism required for synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a complex challenge characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Genetic variations have emerged as crucial players in the etiology of AD, enabling hope for a better understanding of the disease mechanisms; yet the specific mechanism of action for those genetic variants remain uncertain. Animal models with reminiscent disease pathology could uncover previously uncharacterized roles of these genes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we generated a knockout model for abca7, orthologous to human ABCA7 - an established AD-risk gene. The abca7 +/- zebrafish showed reduced astroglial proliferation, synaptic density, and microglial abundance in response to amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed abca7 -dependent neuronal and glial cellular crosstalk through neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling. The abca7 knockout reduced the expression of npy, bdnf and ngfra , which are required for synaptic integrity and astroglial proliferation. With clinical data in humans, we showed reduced NPY in AD correlates with elevated Braak stage, predicted regulatory interaction between NPY and BDNF , identified genetic variants in NPY associated with AD, found segregation of variants in ABCA7, BDNF and NGFR in AD families, and discovered epigenetic changes in the promoter regions of NPY, NGFR and BDNF in humans with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCA7 . These results suggest that ABCA7-dependent NPY signaling is required for synaptic integrity, the impairment of which generates a risk factor for AD through compromised brain resilience.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H\u00fcseyin", "Last Name": "Tayran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elanur", "Last Name": "Yilmaz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuhao", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yiyi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nastasia", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nada", "Last Name": "Kassara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruya Merve", "Last Name": "Dogru", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes-Dumeyer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph S", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tamil Iniyan", "Last Name": "Gunasekaran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zikun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "\u00d6zkan", "Last Name": "\u0130\u015f", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nil\u00fcfer", "Last Name": "Ertekin-Taner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan02"}, {"PMID": "38215053", "Title": "Asian Cohort for Alzheimer's Disease (ACAD) pilot study on genetic and non-genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease among Asian Americans and Canadians.", "Abstract": "Clinical research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) lacks cohort diversity despite being a global health crisis.

We constructed and analyzed a multi-ancestry GWAS dataset in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to test for novel shared and ancestry-specific AD susceptibility loci and evaluate underlying genetic architecture in 37,382 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 6,728 African American, 8,899 Hispanic (HIS), and 3,232 East Asian individuals, performing within-ancestry fixed-effects meta-analysis followed by a cross-ancestry random-effects meta-analysis. We identified 13 loci with cross-ancestry associations including known loci at/near CR1 , BIN1 , TREM2 , CD2AP , PTK2B , CLU , SHARPIN , MS4A6A , PICALM , ABCA7 , APOE and two novel loci not previously reported at 11p12 ( LRRC4C ) and 12q24.13 ( LHX5-AS1 ). Reflecting the power of diverse ancestry in GWAS, we observed the SHARPIN locus using 7.1% the sample size of the original discovering single-ancestry GWAS (n=788,989). We additionally identified three GWS ancestry-specific loci at/near ( PTPRK ( P =2.4\u00d710 -8 ) and GRB14 ( P =1.7\u00d710 -8 ) in HIS), and KIAA0825 ( P =2.9\u00d710 -8 in NHW). Pathway analysis implicated multiple amyloid regulation pathways (strongest with P adjusted =1.6\u00d710 -4 ) and the classical complement pathway ( P adjusted =1.3\u00d710 -3 ). Genes at/near our novel loci have known roles in neuronal development ( LRRC4C, LHX5-AS1 , and PTPRK ) and insulin receptor activity regulation ( GRB14 ).

plasticity by suppressing reactive astroglial Lcn2/Slc22a17 signaling in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Neurogenesis, crucial for brain resilience, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that induces astroglial reactivity at the expense of the pro-neurogenic potential, and restoring neurogenesis could counteract neurodegenerative pathology. However, the molecular mechanisms promoting pro-neurogenic astroglial fate despite AD pathology are unknown. In this study, we used APP/PS1dE9 mouse model and induced Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) expression in the hippocampus. Ngfr, which promotes neurogenic fate of astroglia during the amyloid pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish brain, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcomes. Histological analyses of the changes in proliferation and neurogenesis, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies showed that the induced expression of Ngfr reduced the reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), which we found was sufficient to reduce neurogenesis in astroglia. Anti-neurogenic effects of Lcn2 was mediated by Slc22a17, blockage of which recapitulated the pro-neurogenicity by Ngfr. Long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Postmortem human AD hippocampi and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with reactive gliosis and reduced neurogenesis. Comparing transcriptional changes in mouse, zebrafish, and human AD brains for cell intrinsic differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression networks revealed common altered downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, such as PFKP, which can enhance proliferation and neurogenesis in vitro when blocked. Our study suggests that the reactive non-neurogenic astroglia in AD can be coaxed to a pro-neurogenic fate and AD pathology can be alleviated with Ngfr. We suggest that enhancing pro-neurogenic astroglial fate may have therapeutic ramifications in AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tohid", "Last Name": "Siddiqui", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stanislava", "Last Name": "Popova", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Elanur", "Last Name": "Yilmaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annie J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuhao", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariet", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA."}, {"First Name": "\u00d6zkan", "Last Name": "\u0130\u015f", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeynep Tansu", "Last Name": "Atasavum", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Rodriguez-Muela", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ismael", "Last Name": "Santa-Maria", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Uwe", "Last Name": "Freudenberg", "Affiliation": "Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Polymerforschung Dresden e.V., Hohe Str. 6, D-01069, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Carsten", "Last Name": "Werner", "Affiliation": "Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Polymerforschung Dresden e.V., Hohe Str. 6, D-01069, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nil\u00fcfer", "Last Name": "Ertekin-Taner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, FL, 32224, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, 01307, Dresden, Germany. ck2893@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "NPJ Regenerative medicine", "PubDate": "2023Jul10"}, {"PMID": "37390458", "Title": "The Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Whole-Genome Sequencing Project: Study design and methodology.", "Abstract": "Sequencing efforts to identify genetic variants and pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely focused on late-onset AD although early-onset AD (EOAD), accounting for \u223c10% of cases, is largely unexplained by known mutations, resulting in a lack of understanding of its molecular etiology.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "early-onset Alzheimer's disease", "genetics", "study design", "whole-genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Mutation", "Age of Onset"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas R", "Last Name": "Ray", "Affiliation": "Gertrude H.

In Alzheimer's disease dementia, both semantic and episodic memory become impaired early in the disease process. Given the need to develop sensitive and accessible cognitive markers for early detection of dementia, we investigated among older adults without dementia whether item-level metrics of semantic fluency related to episodic memory decline above and beyond existing neuropsychological measures and total fluency score. Participants were drawn from the community-based Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project cohort (N = 583 English speakers, Mage = 76.3 \u00b1 6.8) followed up to five visits across up to 11 years. We examined the association of semantic fluency metrics with subsequent declines in memory performance using latent growth curve models covaried for age and recruitment wave. Results showed that item-level metrics (e.g., lexical frequency, age of acquisition, and semantic neighborhood density) were associated with a decline in episodic memory-even when covarying for other cognitive tests-while the standard total score was not. Moderation analyses showed that the relationship of semantic fluency metrics with memory decline did not differ across race, sex/gender, or education. In conclusion, item-level data hold a wealth of information with potential to reveal subtle semantic memory impairment, which tracks with episodic memory impairment, among older adults without dementia beyond existing neuropsychological measures. Implementation of psycholinguistic metrics may point to cognitive tools that have better prognostic value or are more sensitive to cognitive change in the context of clinical trials or observational studies.

Sadly, there is still no cure or means of prevention. As in other complex diseases, uncovering genetic causes of AD could identify underlying pathological mechanisms and lead to potential treatments. Rare, autosomal dominant forms of AD occur in middle age as a result of highly penetrant genetic mutations, but the most common form of AD occurs later in life. Large-scale, genome-wide analyses indicate that 70 or more genes or loci contribute to AD. One of the major factors limiting progress is that most genetic data have been obtained from non-Hispanic white individuals in Europe and North America, preventing the development of personalized approaches to AD in individuals of other ethnicities. Fortunately, emerging genetic data from other regions - including Africa, Asia, India and South America - are now providing information on the disease from a broader range of ethnicities. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on AD genetics in populations across the world. We predominantly focus on replicated genetic discoveries but also include studies in ethnic groups where replication might not be feasible. We attempt to identify gaps that need to be addressed to achieve a complete picture of the genetic and molecular factors that drive AD in individuals across the globe.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Middle Aged", "Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Mutation", "Ethnicity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaret A", "Last Name": "Pericak-Vance", "Affiliation": "The John P.

Here, we performed an unsupervised clustering of individuals with multi-region brain transcriptomes to assess whether a broader approach, simultaneously considering data from multiple regions involved in cognition would uncover such subsets. We implemented a canonical correlation-based analysis in a Discovery cohort of 459 participants from two longitudinal studies of cognitive aging that have RNA sequence profiles in three brain regions. 690 additional participants that have data in only one or two of these regions were used in the Replication effort. These clustering analyses identified two meta-clusters, MC-1 and MC-2. The two sets of participants differ primarily in their trajectories of cognitive decline, with MC-2 having a delay of 3 years to the median age of incident dementia. This is due, in part, to a greater impact of tau pathology on neuronal chromatin architecture and to broader brain changes including greater loss of white matter integrity in MC-1. Further evidence of biological differences includes a significantly larger impact of APOE\u03b54 risk on cognitive decline in MC-1. These findings suggest that our proposed population structure captures an aspect of the more distributed molecular state of the aging brain that either enhances the effect of risk factors in MC-1 or of protective effects in MC-2. These observations may inform the design of therapeutic development efforts and of trials as both become increasingly more targeted molecularly.

The genetic component of AD has been mainly assessed using genome-wide association studies, which do not capture the risk contributed by rare variants2. Here, we compared the gene-based burden of rare damaging variants in exome sequencing data from 32,558 individuals-16,036 AD cases and 16,522 controls. Next to variants in TREM2, SORL1 and ABCA7, we observed a significant association of rare, predicted damaging variants in ATP8B4 and ABCA1 with AD risk, and a suggestive signal in ADAM10. Additionally, the rare-variant burden in RIN3, CLU, ZCWPW1 and ACE highlighted these genes as potential drivers of respective AD-genome-wide association study loci. Variants associated with the strongest effect on AD risk, in particular loss-of-function variants, are enriched in early-onset AD cases. Our results provide additional evidence for a major role for amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein processing, amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation, lipid metabolism and microglial function in AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Alzheimer Disease", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Risk Factors", "Exosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Henne", "Last Name": "Holstege", "Affiliation": "Genomics of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Aging, Human Genetics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC location VUmc, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. h.holstege@amsterdamumc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Hulsman", "Affiliation": "Genomics of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Aging, Human Genetics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC location VUmc, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. m.hulsman1@amsterdamumc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Camille", "Last Name": "Charbonnier", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Rouen Normandie, INSERM U1245 and CHU Rouen, Department of Genetics and CNRMAJ, Rouen, France."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Grenier-Boley", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Lille, INSERM, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1167-RID-AGE facteurs de risque et d\u00e9terminants mol\u00e9culaires des maladies li\u00e9es au vieillissement, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Quenez", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Rouen Normandie, INSERM U1245 and CHU Rouen, Department of Genetics and CNRMAJ, Rouen, France."}, {"First Name": "Detelina", "Last Name": "Grozeva", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics,, Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jeroen G J", "Last Name": "van Rooij", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics,, Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Shahzad", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Najaf", "Last Name": "Amin", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Penny J", "Last Name": "Norsworthy", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Prion Unit at University College London, University College London Institute of Prion Diseases, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Oriol", "Last Name": "Dols-Icardo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, II B Sant Pau, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Holger", "Last Name": "Hummerich", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Prion Unit at University College London, University College London Institute of Prion Diseases, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Amit", "Last Name": "Kawalia", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurogenetics and Molecular Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Amouyel", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Lille, INSERM, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1167-RID-AGE facteurs de risque et d\u00e9terminants mol\u00e9culaires des maladies li\u00e9es au vieillissement, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Beecham", "Affiliation": "The John P.

Neuropsychological assessments occurred every 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 years for up to 6 visits (follow-up time: 4.2 \u00b1 3.2 years). Linear mixed-effects models were stratified by race/ethnicity groups. Higher amyloid was associated with faster memory decline in all 3 racial/ethnic groups, but was related to faster cognitive decline beyond memory in minoritized racial/ethnic groups. Higher WMH was associated with faster language, processing speed/executive function, and visuospatial ability decline in Non-Hispanic Black participants, while infarcts were associated with faster processing speed/executive function decline in Non-Hispanic White participants. Complementary information from AD, neurodegenerative, and cerebrovascular biomarkers explain decline in multiple cognitive domains, which may differ within each racial/ethnic group.

An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates. Therefore, in AD cerebrovascular risk factors promote cerebrovascular pathology which in turn, interacts with FMNL2 altering the normal astroglial-vascular mechanisms underlying the clearance of amyloid and tau increasing their deposition in brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood\u2013brain-barrier", "Cerebrovascular risk factors", "FMNL2", "GWAS", "Gliovascular

elderly adults are cognitively unimpaired at time of death despite the presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology at autopsy. Studying individuals who are resilient to the cognitive consequences of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology may uncover novel therapeutic targets to treat Alzheimer's disease. It is well established that there are sex differences in response to Alzheimer's disease pathology, and growing evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to these differences. Taken together, we sought to elucidate sex-specific genetic drivers of resilience. We extended our recent large scale genomic analysis of resilience in which we harmonized cognitive data across four cohorts of cognitive ageing, in vivo amyloid PET across two cohorts, and autopsy measures of amyloid neuritic plaque burden across two cohorts. These data were leveraged to build robust, continuous resilience phenotypes. With these phenotypes, we performed sex-stratified [n (males)\u2009=\u20092093, n (females)\u2009=\u20092931] and sex-interaction [n (both sexes)\u2009=\u20095024] genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses to clarify the variants, genes and molecular pathways that relate to resilience in a sex-specific manner. Estimated among cognitively normal individuals of both sexes, resilience was 20-25% heritable, and when estimated in either sex among cognitively normal individuals, resilience was 15-44% heritable. In our GWAS, we identified a female-specific locus on chromosome 10 [rs827389, \u03b2 (females)\u2009=\u20090.08, P (females)\u2009=\u20095.76 \u00d7 10-09, \u03b2 (males)\u2009=\u2009-0.01, P(males)\u2009=\u20090.70, \u03b2 (interaction)\u2009=\u20090.09, P (interaction)\u2009=\u20091.01 \u00d7 10-04] in which the minor allele was associated with higher resilience scores among females. This locus is located within chromatin loops that interact with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing, including GATA3. Finally, our genetic correlation analyses revealed shared genetic architecture between resilience phenotypes and other complex traits, including a female-specific association with frontotemporal dementia and male-specific associations with heart rate variability traits. We also observed opposing associations between sexes for multiple sclerosis, such that more resilient females had a lower genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, and more resilient males had a higher genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Overall, we identified sex differences in the genetic architecture of resilience, identified a female-specific resilience locus and highlighted numerous sex-specific molecular pathways that may underly resilience to Alzheimer's disease pathology. This study illustrates the need to conduct sex-aware genomic analyses to identify novel targets that are unidentified in sex-agnostic models. Our findings support the theory that the most successful treatment for an individual with Alzheimer's disease may be personalized based on their biological sex and genetic context.", "Keywords":

Ancestry may explain these differences across ethnic groups. To this end, we studied a large cohort of Caribbean Hispanics (CH, N\u2009=\u20098813) and tested the association between Local Ancestry (LA) and LOAD (\"admixture mapping\") to identify LOAD-associated ancestral blocks, separately for ancestral components (European [EUR], African [AFR], Native American[NA]) and jointly (AFR\u2009+\u2009NA). Ancestral blocks significant after permutation were fine-mapped employing multi-ethnic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify rare variants associated with LOAD (SKAT-O) and replicated in the UK Biobank WES dataset. Candidate genes were validated studying (A) protein expression in human LOAD and control brains; (B) two animal AD models, Drosophila and Zebrafish. In the joint AFR\u2009+\u2009NA model, we identified four significant ancestral blocks located on chromosomes 1 (p value\u2009=\u20098.94E-05), 6 (p value\u2009=\u20098.63E-05), 21 (p value\u2009=\u20094.64E-05) and 22 (p value\u2009=\u20091.77E-05). Fine-mapping prioritized the GCAT gene on chromosome 22 (SKAT-O p value\u2009=\u20093.45E-05) and replicated in the UK Biobank (SKAT-O p value\u2009=\u20090.05). In LOAD brains, a decrease of 28% in GCAT protein expression was observed (p value\u2009=\u20090.038), and GCAT knockdown in Amyloid-\u03b242 Drosophila exacerbated rough eye phenotype (68% increase, p value\u2009=\u20094.84E-09). In zebrafish, gcat expression increased after acute amyloidosis (34%, p value\u2009=\u20090.0049), and decreased upon anti-inflammatory Interleukin-4 (39%, p value\u2009=\u20092.3E-05). Admixture mapping uncovered genomic regions harboring new LOAD-associated loci that might explain the observed different frequency of LOAD across ethnic groups. Our results suggest that the inflammation-related activity of GCAT is a response to amyloid toxicity, and reduced GCAT expression exacerbates AD pathology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Caribbean Region", "Drosophila", "Ethnicity", "Humans", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West168 th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sanjeev", "Last Name": "Sariya", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West168 th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoon A", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West168 th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Farid", "Last Name": "Rajabli", "Affiliation": "John P.

Furthermore, 54% of the rare variants in ADSP WES are singletons. However, both single variant and unit-based tests are limited in their statistical power to detect an association between rare variants and phenotypes. To best use missense rare variants and investigate their biological effect, we examine their association with phenotypes in the context of protein structures. We developed a protein structure-based approach, protein optimized kernel evaluation of missense nucleotides (POKEMON), which evaluates rare missense variants based on their spatial distribution within a protein rather than their allele frequency. The hypothesis behind this test is that the three-dimensional spatial distribution of variants within a protein structure provides functional context to power an association test. POKEMON identified three candidate genes (TREM2, SORL1, and EXOC3L4) and another suggestive gene from the ADSP WES data. For TREM2 and SORL1, two known Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes, the signal from the spatial cluster is stable even if we exclude known AD risk variants, indicating the presence of additional low-frequency risk variants within these genes. EXOC3L4 is a novel AD risk gene that has a cluster of variants primarily shared by case subjects around the Sec6 domain.

response could be a disease modifying intervention. To study the mechanisms of pathology-induced neuro-regeneration in vertebrate brains, zebrafish is an excellent model due to its extensive neural regeneration capacity. Here, we report that Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan, negatively regulates neural stem cell (NSC) plasticity in adult zebrafish brain through its receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (Ahr2). The production of KYNA is suppressed after amyloid-toxicity through reduction of the levels of Kynurenine amino transferase 2 (KAT2), the key enzyme producing KYNA. NSC proliferation is enhanced by an antagonist for Ahr2 and is reduced with Ahr2 agonists or KYNA. A subset of Ahr2-expressing zebrafish NSCs do not express other regulatory receptors such as il4r or ngfra, indicating that ahr2-positive NSCs constitute a new subset of neural progenitors that are responsive to amyloid-toxicity. By performing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in three late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) brain autopsy cohorts, we also found that several genes that are components of KYNA metabolism or AHR signaling are differentially expressed in LOAD, suggesting a strong link between KYNA/Ahr2 signaling axis to neurogenesis in LOAD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "kynurenic acid", "neural stem cell", "neurogenesis", "plasticity", "proliferation", "regeneration", "transcriptome-wide association study", "zebrafish"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Brain", "Cell Proliferation", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Kynurenic Acid", "Models, Biological", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon", "Signal Transduction", "Transcriptome", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tohid", "Last Name": "Siddiqui", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stanislava", "Last Name": "Popova", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sanjeev", "Last Name": "Sariya", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yixin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "B-CUBE, Center for Molecular Bioengineering, TU Dresden, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2021Oct14"}, {"PMID": "34609497", "Title": "Association of Regional White Matter Hyperintensities With Longitudinal Alzheimer-Like Pattern of Neurodegeneration in Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Small vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), is associated with cognitive decline and risk of clinical Alzheimer disease (AD).

"Genome-wide association identifies the first risk loci for psychosis in Alzheimer disease.", "Abstract": "Psychotic symptoms, defined as the occurrence of delusions or hallucinations, are frequent in Alzheimer disease (AD with psychosis, AD\u2009+\u2009P). AD\u2009+\u2009P affects ~50% of individuals with AD, identifies a subgroup with poor outcomes, and is associated with a greater degree of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms, compared to subjects without psychosis (AD\u2009-\u2009P). Although the estimated heritability of AD\u2009+\u2009P is 61%, genetic sources of risk are unknown. We report a genome-wide meta-analysis of 12,317 AD subjects, 5445 AD\u2009+\u2009P. Results showed common genetic variation accounted for a significant portion of heritability. Two loci, one in ENPP6 (rs9994623, O.R. (95%CI) 1.16 (1.10, 1.22), p\u2009=\u20091.26\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) and one spanning the 3'-UTR of an alternatively spliced transcript of SUMF1 (rs201109606, O.R. 0.65 (0.56-0.76), p\u2009=\u20093.24\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8), had genome-wide significant associations with AD\u2009+\u2009P. Gene-based analysis identified a significant association with APOE, due to the APOE risk haplotype \u03b54. AD\u2009+\u2009P demonstrated negative genetic correlations with cognitive and educational attainment and positive genetic correlation with depressive symptoms. We previously observed a negative genetic correlation with schizophrenia; instead, we now found a stronger negative correlation with the related phenotype of bipolar disorder. Analysis of polygenic risk scores supported this genetic correlation and documented a positive genetic correlation with risk variation for AD, beyond the effect of \u03b54. We also document a small set of SNPs likely to affect risk for AD\u2009+\u2009P and AD or schizophrenia. These findings provide the first unbiased identification of the association of psychosis in AD with common genetic variation and provide insights into its genetic architecture.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

The current gold standard for detecting and rating cerebral microbleeds in a research context is visual inspection by trained raters, a process that is both time consuming and subject to poor reliability. We present here a novel method to automate microbleed detection on GRE and SWI images. We demonstrate in a community-based cohort of older adults that the method is highly sensitive (greater than 92% of all microbleeds accurately detected) across both modalities, with reasonable precision (fewer than 20 and 10 false positives per scan on GRE and SWI, respectively). We also demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to identify microbleeds over longitudinal scans with a higher level of sensitivity than visual ratings (50% of longitudinal microbleeds correctly labeled by the algorithm, while manual ratings was 30% or lower).

Data were harmonized across 5108 participants from a clinical trial of Alzheimer's disease and three longitudinal cohort studies of cognitive ageing. All analyses were run across all participants and repeated restricting the sample to individuals with unimpaired cognition to identify variants at the earliest stages of disease. As expected, all resilience metrics were genetically correlated with cognitive performance and education attainment traits (P-values < 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-20), and we observed novel correlations with neuropsychiatric conditions (P-values < 7.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). Notably, neither resilience metric was genetically correlated with clinical Alzheimer's disease (P-values > 0.42) nor associated with APOE (P-values > 0.13). In single variant analyses, we observed a genome-wide significant locus among participants with unimpaired cognition on chromosome 18 upstream of ATP8B1 (index single nucleotide polymorphism rs2571244, minor allele frequency = 0.08, P\u2009=\u20092.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). The top variant at this locus (rs2571244) was significantly associated with methylation in prefrontal cortex tissue at multiple CpG sites, including one just upstream of ATPB81 (cg19596477; P\u2009=\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u200910-13). Overall, this comprehensive genetic analysis of resilience implicates a putative role of vascular risk, metabolism, and mental health in protection from the cognitive consequences of neuropathology, while also providing evidence for a novel resilience gene along the bile acid metabolism pathway. Furthermore, the genetic architecture of resilience appears to be distinct from that of clinical Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that a shift in focus to molecular contributors to resilience may identify novel pathways for therapeutic targets.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "GWAS", "amyloid", "reserve", "resilience"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer

RV-QNPL has greater power than the traditional QNPL that tests for excess sharing of minor and major alleles. RV-QNPL is robust to population substructure and admixture, locus heterogeneity, and inclusion of nonpathogenic variants and can be readily applied outside of coding regions. When QNPL was used to analyze common variants, it often led to loci mapping to large intervals, e.g., >40\u2009Mb. In contrast, when RVs are analyzed, regions are well defined, e.g., a gene. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that RV-QNPL is substantially more powerful than applying traditional QNPL methods to analyze RVs. RV-QNPL was also applied to analyze age-at-onset (AAO) data for 107 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pedigrees of Caribbean Hispanic and European ancestry with whole-genome sequence data. When AAO of AD was analyzed regardless of APOE \u03b54 status, suggestive linkage (LOD\u2009=\u20092.4) was observed with RVs in KNDC1 and nominally significant linkage (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed with RVs in LOAD genes ABCA7 and IQCK. When AAO of AD was analyzed for APOE \u03b54 positive family members, nominally significant linkage was observed with RVs in APOE, while when AAO of AD was analyzed for APOE \u03b54 negative family members, nominal significance was observed for IQCK and ADAMTS1.

Despite the emerging importance of polygenic predictions for Alzheimer's disease, sex-dependent polygenic effects have not been demonstrated. Here, using a sex crossover analysis, we show that sex-dependent autosomal genetic effects on Alzheimer's disease can be revealed by characterizing disease progress via the hazard function. We first performed sex-stratified genome-wide associations, and then applied derived sex-dependent weights to two independent cohorts. Relative to sex-mismatched scores, sex-matched polygenic hazard scores showed significantly stronger associations with age-at-disease-onset, clinical progression, amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and composite neuropathological scores, independent of apolipoprotein E. Models without using hazard weights, i.e. polygenic risk scores, showed lower predictive power than polygenic hazard scores with no evidence for sex differences. Our results indicate that revealing sex-dependent genetic architecture requires the consideration of temporal processes of Alzheimer's disease. This has strong implications not only for the genetic underpinning of Alzheimer's disease but also for how we estimate sex-dependent polygenic effects for clinical use.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "cognitive decline", "hazard score", "polygenic scores", "sex differences"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Sex Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chun Chieh", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Development, University of California, San Diego, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah J", "Last Name": "Banks", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, University of California, San Diego, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wesley K", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Hua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linda K", "Last Name": "McEvoy", "Affiliation": "Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chin Hong", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Walter", "Last Name": "Kukull", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Science, Rush Medical College, Chicago, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lindsay A", "Last Name": "Farrer", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Genetics, Boston University, Boston, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and the Taub Institute at Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gerard D", "Last Name": "Schellenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ole A", "Last Name": "Andreassen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Rahul", "Last Name": "Desikan", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anders M", "Last Name": "Dale", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2020Jul01"}, {"PMID": "32573913", "Title": "Genome-wide association study of rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients identifies novel genes and pathways.", "Abstract": "Variability exists in the disease trajectories of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.

The RV-NPL differs from the NPL in that RVs are analyzed, and allele sharing among affected relative-pairs is estimated only for minor alleles. Analyzing families can increase power because causal variants with familial aggregation usually have larger effect sizes than those underlying sporadic diseases. Differing from association analysis, for NPL only affected individuals are analyzed, which can increase power, since unaffected family members can be susceptibility variant carriers. RV-NPL is robust to population substructure and admixture, inclusion of nonpathogenic variants, as well as allelic and locus heterogeneity and can readily be applied outside of coding regions. In contrast to analyzing common variants using NPL, where loci localize to large genomic regions (e.g., >50 Mb), mapped regions are well defined for RV-NPL. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that RV-NPL is substantially more powerful than applying traditional NPL methods to analyze RVs. The RV-NPL was applied to analyze 107 late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) pedigrees of Caribbean Hispanic and European ancestry with WGS data, and statistically significant linkage (LOD \u2265 3.8) was found with RVs in PSMF1 and PTPN21 which have been shown to be involved in LOAD etiology. Additionally, nominally significant linkage was observed with RVs in ABCA7, ACE, EPHA1, and SORL1, genes that were previously reported to be associated with LOAD.

We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50.

We conducted a genome-wide association study using a sliding-window approach to measure the combined effects of CGSes on AD risk in a discovery sample of 24 European ancestry cohorts (12,181 cases, 12,601 controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and replication sample of seven European ancestry cohorts (7,554 cases, 27,382 controls) from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). The potential functional relevance of significant associations was evaluated by analysis of methylation and expression levels in brain tissue of the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), and in whole blood of Framingham Heart Study participants (FHS). Genome-wide significant (p\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8 ) associations were identified with 171 1.0\u00a0kb-length windows spanning 932\u00a0kb in the APOE region (top p\u00a0<\u00a02.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-308 ), five windows at BIN1 (top p\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-13 ), two windows at MS4A6A (top p\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10 ), two windows near MS4A4A (top p\u00a0=\u00a06.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10 ), and one window at PICALM (p\u00a0=\u00a06.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-9 ). The total number of CGS-derived CpG dinucleotides in the window near MS4A4A was associated with AD risk (p\u00a0=\u00a02.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10 ), brain DNA methylation (p\u00a0=\u00a02.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-10 ), and gene expression in brain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and blood (p\u00a0=\u00a02.53\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-4 ).

To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and A\u03b2 processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P\u2009=\u20091.32\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified.

Characterization of non-disease associated cognitive changes is crucial to gain a more complete understanding of brain aging. Episodic memory was investigated in 13,037 ethnically diverse elderly (ages 72 to 85 years) with two to 15 years of follow-up, and with known dementia status, age, sex, education, and APOE genotypes. Adjusted trajectories of episodic memory performance over time were estimated using Latent Class Mixed Models. Analysis was conducted using two samples at baseline evaluation: i) non-cognitively impaired individuals, and ii) all individuals regardless of dementia status. We calculated the age-specific annual incidence rates of dementia in the non-demented elderly (n = 10,220). Two major episodic memory trajectories were estimated: 1) Stable-consisting of individuals exhibiting a constant or improved memory function, and 2) Decliner-consisting of individuals whose memory function declined. The majority of the study participants maintain their memory performance over time. Compared to those with Stable trajectory, individuals characterized as Decliners were more likely to have non-white ethnic background, fewer years of education, a higher frequency of \u03b54 allele at APOE gene and five times more likely to develop dementia. The steepest decline in episodic memory was observed in Caribbean-Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites (p = 4.3 x 10(-15)). The highest incident rates of dementia were observed in the oldest age group, among those of Caribbean-Hispanics ancestry and among Decliners who exhibited rates five times higher than those with Stable trajectories (11 per 100 person-years versus 3 per 100 person-years. Age, education, ethnic background and APOE genotype influence the maintenance of episodic memory. Declining memory is one of the strongest predictors of incident dementia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alleles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoproteins E", "Educational Status", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genotype", "Humans", "Incidence", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Sex Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seonjoo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene and the Department of Biostatics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xingtao", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "The Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yizhe", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Badri", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes-Dumeyer", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kumar B", "Last Name": "Rajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California at Davis, Davis, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Denis A", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Rush Institute for Healthy Aging, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lilah M", "Last Name": "Besser", "Affiliation": "School of Urban and Regional Planning, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Walter A", "Last Name": "Kukull", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Schupf", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Barral", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "30417072", "Title": "Utility of perfusion PET measures to assess neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is commonly used to estimate neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

and lifestyle-associated risk factors (RFs) are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beyond the \u03b54 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), comparatively little is known about whether CV-associated genes also increase risk for AD. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated\u00a0tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV-associated RFs, namely body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes. In meta-analyses across three independent cohorts, we found four novel loci within MBLAC1 (chromosome 7, meta-p\u2009=\u20091.44\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9), MINK1 (chromosome 17, meta-p\u2009=\u20091.98\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7) and two chromosome 11 SNPs within the MTCH2/SPI1 region (closest gene\u2009=\u2009DDB2, meta-p\u2009=\u20097.01\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7 and closest gene\u2009=\u2009MYBPC3, meta-p\u2009=\u20095.62\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). In a large 'AD-by-proxy' cohort from the UK Biobank, we replicated three of the four novel AD/CV pleiotropic SNPs, namely variants within MINK1, MBLAC1, and DDB2. Expression of MBLAC1, SPI1, MINK1 and DDB2 was differentially altered within postmortem AD brains. Beyond APOE, we show that the polygenic component of AD is enriched for lipid-associated RFs. We pinpoint a subset of cardiovascular-associated genes that strongly increase the risk for AD.

Ninety older adult participants with and without AD dementia and with and without a strong family history of AD dementia received MRI scans and clinical evaluation. We quantified markers of cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], presence of infarct, and presence of microbleed) and neurodegeneration (entorhinal cortex volume) and compared them across groups. Patients with AD dementia had smaller entorhinal cortex and greater WMH volumes compared with controls, regardless of family history status.

These rare resilient cases do not demonstrate the patterns of neuronal/synaptic loss that are normally found in the brains of typical demented Alzheimer's patients. Moreover, they exhibit decreased astrocyte and microglial activation markers GFAP and CD68, suggesting that a suppressed neuroinflammatory response may be implicated in human brain resilience to Alzheimer's pathology. In the present work, we used a multiplexed immunoassay to profile a panel of 27 cytokines in the brains of controls, typical demented Alzheimer's cases, and two groups of resilient cases, which possessed pathology consistent with either high probability (HP, Braak stage V-VI and CERAD 2-3) or intermediate probability (IP, Braak state III-IV and CERAD 1-3) of Alzheimer's disease in the absence of dementia. We used a multivariate partial least squares regression approach to study differences in cytokine expression between resilient cases and both Alzheimer's and control cases. Our analysis identified distinct profiles of cytokines in the entorhinal cortex (one of the earliest and most severely affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease) that are up-regulated in both HP and IP resilient cases relative to Alzheimer's and control cases. These cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-4 in HP resilient cases and IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10 in IP resilient cases, delineate differential inflammatory activity in brains resilient to Alzheimer's pathology compared to Alzheimer's cases. Of note, these cytokines all have been associated with pathogen clearance and/or the resolution of inflammation. Moreover, our analysis in the superior temporal sulcus (a multimodal association cortex that consistently accumulates Alzheimer's pathology at later stages of the disease along with overt symptoms of dementia) revealed increased expression of neurotrophic factors, such as PDGF-bb and basic FGF in resilient compared to AD cases. The same region also had reduced expression of chemokines associated with microglial recruitment, including MCP-1 in HP resilient cases and MIP-1\u03b1 in IP resilient cases compared to AD. Altogether, our data suggest that different patterns of cytokine expression exist in the brains of resilient and Alzheimer's cases, link these differences to reduced glial activation, increased neuronal survival and preserved cognition in resilient cases, and reveal specific cytokine targets that may prove relevant to the identification of novel mechanisms of brain resiliency to Alzheimer's pathology.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Neuroinflammation", "Partial least squares regression", "Resilience"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Cytokines", "Encephalitis", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation Mediators", "Least-Squares Analysis", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Severity of Illness Index", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabel", "Last Name": "Barroeta-Espar", "Affiliation": "Massachusetts General Hospital ADRC, Harvard University, 15 Parkman St #835, Boston, MA 02114, United States."}, {"First Name": "Laura D", "Last Name": "Weinstock", "Affiliation": "Parker H.

The high phenotypic heterogeneity of C9orf72 patients includes a wide range in age of onset, modifiers of which are largely unknown. Age of onset could be influenced by environmental and genetic factors both of which may trigger DNA methylation changes at CpG sites. We tested the hypothesis that age of onset in C9orf72 patients is associated with some common single nucleotide polymorphisms causing a gain or loss of CpG sites and thus resulting in DNA methylation alterations. Combined analyses of epigenetic and genetic data have the advantage of detecting functional variants with reduced likelihood of false negative results due to excessive correction for multiple testing in genome-wide association studies. First, we estimated the association between age of onset in C9orf72 patients (n = 46) and the DNA methylation levels at all 7603 CpG sites available on the 450 k BeadChip that are mapped to common single nucleotide polymorphisms. This was followed by a genetic association study of the discovery (n = 144) and replication (n = 187) C9orf72 cohorts. We found that age of onset was reproducibly associated with polymorphisms within a 124.7 kb linkage disequilibrium block tagged by top-significant variation, rs9357140, and containing two overlapping genes (LOC101929163 and C6orf10). A meta-analysis of all 331 C9orf72 carriers revealed that every A-allele of rs9357140 reduced hazard by 30% (P = 0.0002); and the median age of onset in AA-carriers was 6 years later than GG-carriers. In addition, we investigated a cohort of C9orf72 negative patients (n = 2634) affected by frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and also found that the AA-genotype of rs9357140 was associated with a later age of onset (adjusted P = 0.007 for recessive model). Phenotype analyses detected significant association only in the largest subgroup of patients with frontotemporal dementia (n = 2142, adjusted P = 0.01 for recessive model). Gene expression studies of frontal cortex tissues from 25 autopsy cases affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis revealed that the G-allele of rs9357140 is associated with increased brain expression of LOC101929163 (a non-coding RNA) and HLA-DRB1 (involved in initiating immune responses), while the A-allele is associated with their reduced expression. Our findings suggest that carriers of the rs9357140 GG-genotype (linked to an earlier age of onset) might be more prone to be in a pro-inflammatory state (e.g. by microglia) than AA-carriers. Further, investigating the functional links within the C6orf10/LOC101929163/HLA-DRB1 pathway will be critical to better define age-dependent pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "C9orf72 Protein", "CpG Islands", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia",

prodrome or modifiable risk factor such as sleep disturbance. What is the association between sleep and subjective cognitive decline? Cross-sectional design, from two studies of older adults: the WHICAP in the USA and the HELIAD in Greece. A total of 1,576 WHICAP and 1,456 HELIAD participants, without mild cognitive impairment, dementia or severe depression/anxiety, were included. Participants were mostly women, with 12 (WHICAP) and 8 (HELIAD) mean years of education. Sleep problems were estimated using the Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study. Subjective cognitive decline was assessed using a structured complaint questionnaire that queries for subjective memory and other cognitive symptoms. Multinomial or logistic regression models were used to examine whether sleep problems were associated with complaints about general cognition, memory, naming, orientation and calculations. Age, sex, education, sleep medication, use of medications affecting cognition, co-morbidities, depression and anxiety were used as co-variates. Objective cognition was also estimated by summarizing neuropsychological performance into composite z-scores. Sleep problems were associated with two or more complaints: WHICAP: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001; HELIAD: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.83), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001. Sleep problems were associated with complaints in all the cognitive subcategories, except orientation for the WHICAP. The associations were noted regardless of objective cognition. At any given level of objective cognition, sleep disturbance is accompanied by subjective cognitive impairment. The replicability in two ethnically, genetically and culturally different cohorts adds validity to our results. The results have implications for the correlates, and potential aetiology of subjective cognitive decline, which should be considered in the assessment and treatment of older adults with cognitive complaints.", "Keywords": ["elderly", "healthy ageing", "sleep problems", "subjective cognitive decline"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Sleep Wake Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Tsapanou", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division and the Taub Institute, Gertrude H.

Gene-based meta-analysis in 3 independent consortium data sets confirmed the identified interaction: the most significant (pmeta-Bonferroni-corrected=9.02*10-3) was for the single nucleotide polymorphism pair rs1477307 and rs4077746. In functional studies, WW and C2 domain containing 1, aka KIBRA and TLN2 coexpressed in the temporal cortex brain tissue of AD subjects (\u03b2=0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30, p=0.01); modulated Tau toxicity in Drosophila eye experiments; colocalized in brain tissue cells, N2a neuroblastoma, and HeLa cell lines; and coimmunoprecipitated both in brain tissue and HEK293\u00a0cells. Our finding points toward new AD-related pathways and provides clues toward novel medical targets for the cure of AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Epistasis", "Gene-gene interaction", "Protein-protein interaction", "TLN2", "WWC1"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Cohort Studies", "Epistasis, Genetic", "Female", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Phosphoproteins", "Sex Characteristics", "Sex Factors", "Talin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elena S", "Last Name": "Gusareva", "Affiliation": "Medical Genomics Research Unit, GIGA-R, University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium.

An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested ~1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls). The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families). We identified novel and predicted functional genetic variants in genes previously associated with AD. We also detected associations in three novel genes: IGHG3 (p\u2009=\u20099.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), an immunoglobulin gene whose antibodies interact with \u03b2-amyloid, a long non-coding RNA AC099552.4 (p\u2009=\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), and a zinc-finger protein ZNF655 (gene-based p\u2009=\u20095.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6).

This idea, however, is primarily based on lesion studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging, without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency, including overlapping and different regions, in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging.

Linkage analysis, however, is sensitive to misspecification of marker allele frequencies. Pedigrees from recently admixed populations are particularly susceptible to this problem because of the challenge of accurately accounting for population structure. Therefore, increasing emphasis on use of multiethnic samples in genetic studies requires reevaluation of best practices, given data currently available. Typical strategies have been to compute allele frequencies from the sample, or to use marker allele frequencies determined by admixture proportions averaged over the entire sample. However, admixture proportions vary among pedigrees and throughout the genome in a family-specific manner. Here, we evaluate several approaches to model admixture in linkage analysis, providing different levels of detail about ancestral origin. To perform our evaluations, for specification of marker allele frequencies, we used data on 67 Caribbean Hispanic admixed families from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Our results show that choice of admixture model has an effect on the linkage analysis results. Variant-specific admixture proportions, computed for individual families, provide the most detailed regional admixture estimates, and, as such, are the most appropriate allele frequencies for linkage analysis.

reasons are unclear. One possibility is that WMH promote neurodegeneration, which, in turn, affects cognition. We examined whether cortical thickness, a marker of neurodegeneration, mediates the relationship between WMH and cognition among 519 older adults. Using conditional process analysis modeling techniques, we examined the association between WMH volume and global cognition and tested whether cortical thickness mediates this relationship statistically. We also tested specific regional hypotheses to determine whether cortical thickness or volume in the medial temporal lobe mediates the relationship between WMH volume and memory. Increased total WMH volume was associated with poorer global cognition and memory. Global cortical thickness and medial temporal lobe thickness/volume mediated the relationship of WMH volume on global cognition and memory functioning. The mediating relationship was similar across racial and ethnic groups and across diagnostic groups (i.e., mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease). The findings suggest that WMH promote atrophy, which, in turn, drives cognitive decline and highlight a potential pathway in which small vessel cerebrovascular disease affects cognition by promoting neurodegenerative changes directly.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cognition", "Cortical thickness", "Memory", "White matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Memory", "Organ Size", "Racial Groups", "Temporal Lobe", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Batool", "Last Name": "Rizvi", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Narkhede", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Briana S", "Last Name": "Last", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Budge", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P < 1 \u00d7 10-4) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P < 5 \u00d7 10-8) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 \u00d7 10-10, odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)cases = 0.0059, MAFcontrols = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 \u00d7 10-10, OR = 1.43, MAFcases = 0.011, MAFcontrols = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 \u00d7 10-14, OR = 1.67, MAFcases = 0.0143, MAFcontrols = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Case-Control Studies", "Exome", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Microglia", "Odds Ratio", "Phospholipase C gamma", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Interaction Maps", "Receptors, Immunologic", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sven J", "Last Name": "van der Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Adam C", "Last Name": "Naj", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology/Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "C\u00e9line", "Last Name": "Bellenguez", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1167, RID-AGE-Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging-Related Diseases, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Nandini", "Last Name": "Badarinarayan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Johanna", "Last Name": "Jakobsdottir", "Affiliation": "Icelandic Heart Association, Kopavogur, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Brian W", "Last Name": "Kunkle", "Affiliation": "John P.

Linkage disequilibrium score regression of 220 cell types implicated the regulation of myeloid gene expression in AD risk. The minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, showed association with delayed AD onset and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes and macrophages. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability was enriched within the PU.1 cistrome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in AD. Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels affected the expression of mouse orthologs of many AD risk genes and the phagocytic activity of mouse microglial cells. Our results suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces AD risk by regulating myeloid gene expression and cell function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Male", "Mice", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Risk Factors", "Trans-Activators", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kuan-Lin", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edoardo", "Last Name": "Marcora", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York,New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna A", "Last Name": "Pimenova", "Affiliation": "Ronald M.

High-resolution structural MRI was collected on 680 non-demented elderly (mean age 80.1years) participants of a community-based, multiethnic cohort. Approximately three quarters of these participants also had peripheral inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL6, and ACT) measured using ELISA. Structural measures including brain volumes and cortical thickness (with both global and regional measures) were derived from MRI scans, and repeated MRI measures were obtained after 4.5years. Mean fractional anisotropy was used as the indicator of white matter integrity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging. We examined the association of inflammatory biomarkers with brain volume, cortical thickness, and white matter integrity using regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, education, APOE genotype, and intracranial volume. A doubling in CRP (b=-2.48, p=0.002) was associated with a smaller total gray matter volume, equivalent to approximately 1.5years of aging. A doubling in IL6 was associated with smaller total brain volume (b=-14.96, p<0.0001), equivalent to approximately 9years of aging. Higher IL6 was also associated with smaller gray matter (b=-6.52, p=0.002) and white matter volumes (b=-7.47, p=0.004). The volumes of most cortical regions including frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal, as well as subcortical regions including pallidum and thalamus were associated with IL6. In a model additionally adjusted for depression, vascular factors, BMI, and smoking status, the association between IL6 and brain volumes remained, and a doubling in ACT was marginally associated with 0.054 (p=0.001) millimeter thinner mean cortical thickness, equivalent to that of approximately 2.7years of aging. None of the biomarkers was associated with mean fractional anisotropy or longitudinal change of brain volumes and thickness. Among older adults, increased circulating inflammatory biomarkers were associated with smaller brain volume and cortical thickness but not the white matter tract integrity. Our preliminary findings suggest that peripheral inflammatory processes may be involved in the brain atrophy in the elderly.", "Keywords": ["Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin", "Brain atrophy", "Brain morphometry", "C-reactive protein", "Cortical thickness", "Interleukin-6", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Neuroepidemiology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrophy", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "White Matter", "alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yian", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; The Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (A\u03b242), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with A\u03b242 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.059, P\u00a0=\u00a02.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.025, P\u00a0=\u00a01.72\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.105, P\u00a0=\u00a03.43\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2), disease progression (GLIS1: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.277, P\u00a0=\u00a01.92\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.043, P\u00a0=\u00a04.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an A\u03b2-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF A\u03b242 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results.

Causal variants that aggregate in families usually have larger effect sizes than those found in sporadic cases, so family-based designs can be a more powerful approach than population-based designs. Moreover, some family-based designs are robust to confounding due to population admixture or substructure. We developed a RV extension of the generalized disequilibrium test (GDT) to analyze sequence data obtained from nuclear and extended families. The GDT utilizes genotype differences of all discordant relative pairs to assess associations within a family, and the RV extension combines the single-variant GDT statistic over a genomic region of interest. The RV-GDT has increased power by efficiently incorporating information beyond first-degree relatives and allows for the inclusion of covariates. Using simulated genetic data, we demonstrated that the RV-GDT method has well-controlled type I error rates, even when applied to admixed populations and populations with substructure. It is more powerful than existing family-based RV association methods, particularly for the analysis of extended pedigrees and pedigrees with missing data. We analyzed whole-genome sequence data from families affected by Alzheimer disease to illustrate the application of the RV-GDT. Given the capability of the RV-GDT to adequately control for population admixture or substructure and analyze pedigrees with missing genotype data and its superior power over other family-based methods, it is an effective tool for elucidating the involvement of RVs in the etiology of complex traits.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "TNK1", "exome sequence data", "extended and nuclear pedigrees", "family-based association analysis", "generalized disequilibrium test", "missing data", "pedigree disequilibrium test", "rare variants", "whole-genome sequence data"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Axin Protein", "Computer Simulation", "Databases, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zongxiao", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan E", "Last Name": "Renton", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linhai", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gao T", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alison M", "Last Name": "Goate", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and Gertrude H.

We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising common genetic variants associated with AD, evaluated its association with incident AD and assessed its capacity to improve risk prediction over traditional models based on age, sex, education, and APOE\u025b4. In eight prospective cohorts included in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), we derived weighted sum of risk alleles from the 19 top SNPs reported by the IGAP GWAS in participants aged 65 and older without prevalent dementia. Hazard ratios (HR) of incident AD were estimated in Cox models. Improvement in risk prediction was measured by the difference in C-index (\u0394-C), the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI>0). Overall, 19,687 participants at risk were included, of whom 2,782 developed AD. The GRS was associated with a 17% increase in AD risk (pooled HR\u200a=\u200a1.17; 95% CI\u200a= \u200a [1.13-1.21] per standard deviation increase in GRS; p-value\u200a= \u200a2.86\u00d710-16). This association was stronger among persons with at least one APOE\u025b4 allele (HRGRS\u200a=\u200a1.24; 95% CI\u200a= \u200a [1.15-1.34]) than in others (HRGRS\u200a=\u200a1.13; 95% CI\u200a= \u200a [1.08-1.18]; pinteraction\u200a=\u200a3.45\u00d710-2). Risk prediction after seven years of follow-up showed a small improvement when adding the GRS to age, sex, APOE\u025b4, and education (\u0394-Cindex\u200a= \u200a0.0043 [0.0019-0.0067]). Similar patterns were observed for IDI and NRI>0. In conclusion, a risk score incorporating common genetic variation outside the APOE\u025b4 locus improved AD risk prediction and may facilitate risk stratification for prevention trials.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "IGAP", "clinical utility", "cohort studies", "genetic risk score", "meta-analysis", "risk prediction"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Cohort Studies", "Educational Status", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Chouraki", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fleur", "Last Name": "Maury", "Affiliation": "Lille University, Inserm, Lille University Hospital, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U1167 - RID-AGE - Risk factors and molecular determinants of aging-related diseases;

gene-gene interactions across multiple independent data sets of late onset Alzheimer disease from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium.", "Abstract": "Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) has a complex genetic etiology, involving locus heterogeneity, polygenic inheritance, and gene-gene interactions; however, the investigation of interactions in recent genome-wide association studies has been limited. We used a biological knowledge-driven approach to evaluate gene-gene interactions for consistency across 13 data sets from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP pairs within 3 gene-gene combinations were identified: SIRT1\u00a0\u00d7 ABCB1, PSAP\u00a0\u00d7 PEBP4, and GRIN2B\u00a0\u00d7 ADRA1A. In addition, we extend a previously identified interaction from an endophenotype analysis between RYR3\u00a0\u00d7 CACNA1C. Finally, post hoc gene expression analyses of the implicated SNPs further implicate SIRT1 and ABCB1, and implicate CDH23 which was most recently identified as an AD risk locus in an epigenetic analysis of AD. The observed interactions in this article highlight ways in which genotypic variation related to disease may depend on the genetic context in which it occurs. Further, our results highlight the utility of evaluating genetic interactions to explain additional variance in AD risk and identify novel molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Biofilter", "Epistasis", "Gene-gene interactions"], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cadherin Related Proteins", "Cadherins", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Datasets as Topic", "Disease Progression", "Epistasis, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Risk", "Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel", "Saposins", "Sirtuin 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Timothy J", "Last Name": "Hohman", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Bush", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin D", "Last Name": "Brown-Gentry", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric S", "Last Name": "Torstenson", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott M", "Last Name": "Dudek", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shubhabrata", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Naj", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian W", "Last Name": "Kunkle", "Affiliation": "Dr. John T.

Although the risk for psychosis in LOAD is genetically mediated, no genes have been identified. To identify loci potentially containing genetic variants associated with risk of psychosis in LOAD, a total of 263 families from the National Institute of Aging-LOAD cohort were classified into psychotic (LOAD+P, n\u00a0= 215) and nonpsychotic (LOAD-P, n\u00a0= 48) families based on the presence/absence of psychosis during the course of LOAD. The LOAD+P families yielded strong evidence of linkage on chromosome 19q13 (two-point [2-pt] \u200blogarithm of odds [LOD]\u00a0= 3.8, rs2285513 and multipoint LOD\u00a0= 2.7, rs541169). Joint linkage and association in 19q13 region detected strong association with rs2945988 (p\u00a0= 8.7\u00a0\u00d7 10(-7)). Linkage results for the LOAD-P families yielded nonsignificant 19q13 LOD scores. Several 19q13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms generalized the association of LOAD+P in a Caribbean Hispanic (CH) cohort, and the strongest signal was rs10410711 (pmeta\u00a0= 5.1\u00a0\u00d7 10(-5)). A variant located 24 kb upstream of rs10410711 and rs10421862 was strongly associated with LOAD+P (pmeta\u00a0=\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-5)) in a meta-analysis of the CH cohort and an additional non-Hispanic Caucasian dataset. Identified variants rs2945988 and rs10421862 affect brain gene expression levels.

Individuals from the Washington Heights and Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) served as validation sample. Patterns of presentation of EPS were identified employing categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA). Six principal components were identified in both mild and moderate AD samples: (I) hand movements, alternating movements, finger tapping, leg agility (\"limbs bradykinesia\"); (II) posture, postural instability, arising from chair, gait and body bradykinesia/hypokinesia (\"axial\"); (III) limb rigidity (\"rigidity\"); (IV) postural tremor; (V) resting tremor; (VI) speech and facial expression. Similar results were obtained in the WHICAP cohort.

Heterogeneity in memory trajectories allowed us to identify four groups: Stable-High (43.5 %), Stable-Low (17.1 %), Decliner (26.8 %), and Rapid Decliner (12.5 %). Decliners had more brain atrophy and higher rates of conversion to dementia. This study highlights the heterogeneity in cognitive aging and provides evidence that most elderly maintain memory function as they age. Associations with dementia and imaging measures validate subgroups of older adults identified with GMM based on their memory trajectories. Future research should use these memory trajectory phenotypes to determine whether dementia risk and protective factors differ for individuals following different memory trajectories.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Cognitive aging", "MRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Atrophy", "Dementia", "Disease Progression", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "New York City"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura B", "Last Name": "Zahodne", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie M", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Schupf", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA. amb2139@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2015Nov"}, {"PMID": "26239175", "Title": "Heritability of telomere length in a study of long-lived families.", "Abstract": "Chromosomal telomere length shortens with repeated cell divisions. Human leukocyte DNA telomere length (LTL) has been shown to shorten during aging. LTL shortening has correlated with decreased longevity, dementia, and other age-associated processes. Because LTL varies widely between individuals in a given age group, it has been hypothesized to be a marker of biological aging. However, the principal basis for the variation of human LTL has not been established, although various studies have reported heritability. Here, we use a family-based study of longevity to study heritability of LTL in 3037 individuals. We show that LTL is shorter in older individuals, and in males, and has a high heritability (overall h(2)\u00a0= 0.54). In the offspring generation, who are in middle-life, we find an ordinal relationship: persons more-closely-related to elderly probands have longer LTL than persons less-closely-related, who nonetheless have longer LTL than unrelated spouses of the offspring generation. These results support a prominent genetic underpinning of LTL. Elucidation of such genetic bases may provide avenues for intervening in the aging process.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Heritability", "Longevity", "Telomere"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "DNA", "Female", "Humans", "Leukocytes", "Longevity", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Telomere Homeostasis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lawrence S", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

The study of persons at 50% risk for inheriting autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations allows characterization of these symptoms before progressive decline in a population destined to develop illness. We sought to characterize early behavioural features in carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations. Two hundred and sixty-one persons unaware of their mutation status enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, a study of persons with or at-risk for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire, the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). Ninety-seven asymptomatic (CDR = 0), 25 mildly symptomatic (CDR = 0.5), and 33 overtly affected (CDR > 0.5) autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers were compared to 106 non-carriers with regard to frequency of behavioural symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire and severity of depressive symptoms on the Geriatric Depression Scale using generalized linear regression models with appropriate distributions and link functions. Results from the adjusted analyses indicated that depressive symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire were less common in cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers than in non-carriers (5% versus 17%, P = 0.014) and the odds of experiencing at least one behavioural sign in cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers was lower than in non-carriers (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.98, P = 0.042). Depression (56% versus 17%, P = 0.0003), apathy (40% versus 4%, P < 0.0001), disinhibition (16% versus 2%, P = 0.009), irritability (48% versus 9%, P = 0.0001), sleep changes (28% versus 7%, P = 0.003), and agitation (24% versus 6%, P = 0.008) were more common and the degree of self-rated depression more severe (mean Geriatric Depression Scale score of 2.8 versus 1.4, P = 0.006) in mildly symptomatic mutation carriers relative to non-carriers. Anxiety, appetite changes, delusions, and repetitive motor activity were additionally more common in overtly impaired mutation carriers. Similar to studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, we demonstrated increased rates of depression, apathy, and other behavioural symptoms in the mildly symptomatic, prodromal phase of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease that increased with disease severity. We did not identify any increased psychopathology in mutation carriers over non-carriers during the presymptomatic stage, suggesting these symptoms result when a threshold of neurodegeneration is reached rather than as life-long qualities. Unexpectedly, we found lower rates of depressive symptoms in cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer", "behaviour", "depression", "familial", "prodromal"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cohort Studies", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Ringman", "Affiliation": "1 Mary S.

As positron emission tomography (PET) scanners have limited spatial resolution, measured signals are distorted by partial volume effects. Various techniques have been proposed for correcting partial volume effects, but there is no consensus as to whether these techniques are necessary in amyloid imaging, and, if so, how they should be implemented. We evaluated a two-component partial volume correction technique and a regional spread function technique using both simulated and human Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging data. Both correction techniques compensated for partial volume effects and yielded improved detection of subtle changes in PiB retention. However, the regional spread function technique was more accurate in application to simulated data. Because PiB retention estimates depend on the correction technique, standardization is necessary to compare results across groups. Partial volume correction has sometimes been avoided because it increases the sensitivity to inaccuracy in image registration and segmentation. However, our results indicate that appropriate PVC may enhance our ability to detect changes in amyloid deposition.", "Keywords": ["Amyloid imaging", "PET", "Partial volume correction", "PiB"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Amyloid Neuropathies", "Aniline Compounds", "Benzothiazoles", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cohort Studies", "Computer Simulation", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Humans", "Individuality", "Longitudinal Studies", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reproducibility of Results", "Thiazoles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO 63110, USA.

On the basis of these data and the enriched hippocampal expression of UNC5C in the adult nervous system, we propose that one possible mechanism in which T835M UNC5C contributes to the risk of Alzheimer's disease is by increasing susceptibility to neuronal cell death, particularly in vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer's disease brain.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "CA3 Region, Hippocampal", "Cell Death", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Glutamic Acid", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Netrin Receptors", "Neurons", "Rats", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor", "Staurosporine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Monica K", "Last Name": "Wetzel-Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Hunkapiller", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tushar R", "Last Name": "Bhangale", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karpagam", "Last Name": "Srinivasan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janice A", "Last Name": "Maloney", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jasvinder K", "Last Name": "Atwal", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan M", "Last Name": "Sa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Murat B", "Last Name": "Yaylaoglu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oded", "Last Name": "Foreman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ward", "Last Name": "Ortmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nisha", "Last Name": "Rathore", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "David V", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Tessier-Lavigne", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Brain Development and Repair, Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Neurology, Taub Institute on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

However, the frequency and risk associated with these mutations vary widely. In addition, mutations in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) genes - the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), granulin (GRN) - have also been found to be associated with clinical AD. Here, we conducted targeted resequencing of the exons in genes encoding APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, and MAPT in 183 individuals from families with four or more affected relatives, presumed to be AD, and living in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. We then performed linkage and family-based association analyses in carrier families, and genotyped 498 similarly aged unrelated controls from the same ethnic background. Twelve potentially pathogenic mutations were found to be associated with disease in 53 individuals in the five genes. The most frequently observed mutation was the p.Gly206Ala variant in PSEN1 present in 30 (57%) of those sequenced. In the combined linkage and association analyses several rare variants were associated with dementia. In Caribbean Hispanics with familial AD, potentially pathogenic variants were present in 29.2%, four were novel mutations, while eight had been previously observed.

We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample: CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4 with 9 of these 12 loci showing larger odds ratio in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Chromosome Mapping", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9", "Dementia", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases", "Odds Ratio", "Phenotype", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Quantitative Trait Loci"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Beecham", "Affiliation": "John P.

Cross-sectional volumetric measures of WMH, particularly in the parietal lobes, are associated with increased risk of AD. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the longitudinal regional progression of WMH predicts incident AD above-and-beyond traditional radiological markers of neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal atrophy and cortical thickness). Three hundred three nondemented older adults (mean age = 79.24 \u00b1 5.29) received high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and then again 4.6 years (standard deviation = 1.01) later. Over the follow-up interval 26 participants progressed to AD. Using structural equation modeling, we calculated latent difference scores of parietal and nonparietal WMH, hippocampus volumes, and cortical thickness values in AD-related regions. Within the structural equation modeling framework, we determined whether baseline or change scores or both predicted AD conversion, while controlling for several time-invariant relevant variables. Smaller baseline hippocampus volume, change in hippocampus volume (i.e., atrophy), higher baseline parietal lobe WMH, and increasing parietal lobe WMH volume but not WMH in other regions or measures of cortical thickness, independently predicted progression to AD. The findings provide strong evidence that regionally accumulating WMH predict AD onset in addition to hallmark neurodegenerative changes typically associated with AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Hippocampus atrophy", "Longitudinal", "White matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Male", "Parietal Lobe", "Risk", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

We report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) with HS-Aging pathology as an endophenotype. In collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, data were analyzed from large autopsy cohorts: (#1) National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC); (#2) Rush University Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; (#3) Group Health Research Institute Adult Changes in Thought study; (#4) University of California at Irvine 90+ Study; and (#5) University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center. Altogether, 363 HS-Aging cases and 2,303 controls, all pathologically confirmed, provided statistical power to test for risk alleles with large effect size. A two-tier study design included GWAS from cohorts #1-3 (Stage I) to identify promising SNP candidates, followed by focused evaluation of particular SNPs in cohorts #4-5 (Stage II). Polymorphism in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9 (ABCC9) gene, also known as sulfonylurea receptor 2, was associated with HS-Aging pathology. In the meta-analyzed Stage I GWAS, ABCC9 polymorphisms yielded the lowest p values, and factoring in the Stage II results, the meta-analyzed risk SNP (rs704178:G) attained genome-wide statistical significance (p\u00a0=\u00a01.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-9)), with odds ratio (OR) of 2.13 (recessive mode of inheritance). For SNPs previously linked to hippocampal sclerosis, meta-analyses of Stage I results show OR\u00a0=\u00a01.16 for rs5848 (GRN) and OR\u00a0=\u00a01.22 rs1990622 (TMEM106B), with the risk alleles as previously described. Sulfonylureas, a widely prescribed drug class used to treat diabetes, also modify human ABCC9 protein function. A subsample of patients from the NACC database (n\u00a0=\u00a0624) were identified who were older than age 85 at death with known drug history. Controlling for important confounders such as diabetes itself, exposure to a sulfonylurea drug was associated with risk for HS-Aging pathology (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).

Studies of families with autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) mutations provide a unique and powerful means to investigate AD biomarker changes during the asymptomatic period. In this biomarker study, we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and in vivo amyloid imaging cross-sectional data at baseline in individuals from ADAD families enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. Our study revealed reduced concentrations of CSF amyloid-\u03b21-42 (A\u03b21-42) associated with the presence of A\u03b2 plaques, and elevated concentrations of CSF tau, ptau181 (phosphorylated tau181), and VILIP-1 (visinin-like protein-1), markers of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal injury/death, in asymptomatic mutation carriers 10 to 20 years before their estimated age at symptom onset (EAO) and before the detection of cognitive deficits. When compared longitudinally, however, the concentrations of CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury/death within individuals decreased after their EAO, suggesting a slowing of acute neurodegenerative processes with symptomatic disease progression. These results emphasize the importance of longitudinal, within-person assessment when modeling biomarker trajectories across the course of the disease.

Unlike most studies that have focused on genetic causes of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes in relation to leukocyte telomere length, the present study examined the genome to identify variants that may contribute to variation in leukocyte telomere length among families with exceptional longevity. From the genome wide association analysis in 4,289 LLFS participants, we identified a novel intergenic SNP rs7680468 located near PAPSS1 and DKK2 on 4q25 (p = 4.7E-8). From our linkage analysis, we identified two additional novel loci with HLOD scores exceeding three, including 4.77 for 17q23.2, and 4.36 for 10q11.21. These two loci harbor a number of novel candidate genes with SNPs, and our gene-wise association analysis identified multiple genes, including DCAF7, POLG2, CEP95, and SMURF2 at 17q23.2; and RASGEF1A, HNRNPF, ANF487, CSTF2T, and PRKG1 at 10q11.21. Among these genes, multiple SNPs were associated with leukocyte telomere length, but the strongest association was observed with one contiguous haplotype in CEP95 and SMURF2.

Recent studies have identified a rare coding variant (p.R47H) in TREM2 that confers a high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms in this genomic region are associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and a common intergenic variant found near the TREML2 gene has been identified to be protective for AD. However, little is known about the functional variant underlying the latter association or its relationship with the p.R47H. Here, we report comprehensive analyses using whole-exome sequencing data, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analyses, meta-analyses (16,254 cases and 20,052 controls) and cell-based functional studies to support the role of the TREML2 coding missense variant p.S144G (rs3747742) as a potential driver of the meta-analysis AD-associated genome-wide association studies signal.

The anatomical distribution of imaging biomarkers is described in relation to estimated years from symptom onset. Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carrier individuals have elevated PiB levels in nearly every cortical region 15 y before the estimated age of onset. Reduced cortical glucose metabolism and cortical thinning in the medial and lateral parietal lobe appeared 10 and 5 y, respectively, before estimated age of onset. Importantly, however, a divergent pattern was observed subcortically. All subcortical gray-matter regions exhibited elevated PiB uptake, but despite this, only the hippocampus showed reduced glucose metabolism. Similarly, atrophy was not observed in the caudate and pallidum despite marked amyloid accumulation. Finally, before hypometabolism, a hypermetabolic phase was identified for some cortical regions, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate.

The development of array technologies has helped to identify rare recessive mutations among long runs of homozygosity (ROHs), in which both parental alleles are identical. Caribbean Hispanics are known to have an elevated risk for AD and tend to have large families with evidence of inbreeding. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the late-onset AD in a Caribbean Hispanic population might be explained in part by the homozygosity of unknown loci that could harbor recessive AD risk haplotypes or pathologic mutations. DESIGN We used genome-wide array data to identify ROHs (&gt;1 megabase) and conducted global burden and locus-specific ROH analyses. SETTING A whole-genome case-control ROH study. PARTICIPANTS A Caribbean Hispanic data set of 547 unrelated cases (48.8% with familial AD) and 542 controls collected from a population known to have a 3-fold higher risk of AD vs non-Hispanics in the same community. Based on a Structure program analysis, our data set consisted of African Hispanic (207 cases and 192 controls) and European Hispanic (329 cases and 326 controls) participants. EXPOSURE Alzheimer disease risk genes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the total and mean lengths of the ROHs per sample. Global burden measurements among autosomal chromosomes were investigated in cases vs controls. Pools of overlapping ROH segments (consensus regions) were identified, and the case to control ratio was calculated for each consensus region. We formulated the tested hypothesis before data collection. RESULTS In total, we identified 17 137 autosomal regions with ROHs. The mean length of the ROH per person was significantly greater in cases vs controls (P\u2009=\u2009.0039), and this association was stronger with familial AD (P\u2009=\u2009.0005). Among the European Hispanics, a consensus region at the EXOC4 locus was significantly associated with AD even after correction for multiple testing (empirical P value 1 [EMP1], .0001; EMP2, .002; 21 AD cases vs 2 controls). Among the African Hispanic subset, the most significant but nominal association was observed for CTNNA3, a well-known AD gene candidate (EMP1, .002; 10 AD cases vs 0 controls). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results show that ROHs could significantly contribute to the etiology of AD. Future studies would require the analysis of larger, relatively inbred data sets that might reveal novel recessive AD genes. The next step is to conduct sequencing of top significant loci in a subset of samples with overlapping ROHs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Caribbean Region", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hispanic or Latino", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mahdi", "Last Name": "Ghani", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Gertrude H.

Most studies aiming to identify genetic susceptibility factors for LOAD have focused on non-Hispanic white populations. This is, in part related to differences in linkage disequilibrium and allele frequencies between ethnic groups that could lead to confounding. However, in addition, non-Hispanic white populations are simply more widely studied. As a consequence, minorities are genetically underrepresented despite the fact that in several minority populations living in the same community as whites (including African American and Caribbean Hispanics), LOAD incidence is higher. This review summarizes the current knowledge on genetic risk factors associated with LOAD risk in Caribbean Hispanics and African Americans and provides suggestions for future research.

In Stage 1, we evaluated data for 5,877,918 genotyped and imputed SNPs in Japanese cases (n\u200a=\u200a1,008) and controls (n\u200a=\u200a1,016). Genome-wide significance was observed with 12 SNPs in the APOE region. Seven SNPs from other distinct regions with p-values <2\u00d710(-5) were genotyped in a second Japanese sample (885 cases, 985 controls), and evidence of association was confirmed for one SORL1 SNP (rs3781834, P\u200a=\u200a7.33\u00d710(-7) in the combined sample). Subsequent analysis combining results for several SORL1 SNPs in the Japanese, Korean (339 cases, 1,129 controls) and Caucasians (11,840 AD cases, 10,931 controls) revealed genome wide significance with rs11218343 (P\u200a=\u200a1.77\u00d710(-9)) and rs3781834 (P\u200a=\u200a1.04\u00d710(-8)).

The associated allele for each of these SNPs was the same as in Caucasians.

We have also assessed the regional expression of all the genes in the brain and whether there is evidence of an eQTL explaining the risk. In agreement with other studies we find that coding variability may explain the ABCA7 association, but common coding variability does not explain any of the other loci. We were not able to show that any of the loci had eQTLs within the power of this study.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been associated with gait speed, though few studies have examined changes in gait speed over time in population-based studies comprising participants from diverse cultural backgrounds. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between a decline in gait speed and total and regional WMH volumes in a community-based study of aging. Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0701) underwent gait-speed measurement via a 4-m walk test at the time of initial enrollment and MRI at a second time interval (mean 4.7 [SD\u00a0=\u00a00.5] years apart). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between large WMH volume and regional WMH volume with gait speed <0.5\u00a0m/s (abnormal speed), and a transition to abnormal gait speed. Analyses were adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Large WMH volume was associated with abnormal gait speed and a transition to abnormal gait speed between the two visits, but not after adjustment for modifiable vascular disease risk factors. Increased frontal lobe WMH volume was associated with abnormal gait speed and transition to abnormal gait speed, but not in adjusted models. WMH are associated with slowing of gait over time.
