We developed a two-model ensemble, consisting of a baseline model, where prediction is based on demographic and clinical variables only, and a genetic model, where we also include PRSs. We evaluate the use of a linear versus a non-linear model at both the baseline and the genetic model levels and assess the improvement in performance when incorporating multiple PRSs. We report the ensemble model's performance as percentage variance explained (PVE) on a held-out test dataset. A non-linear baseline model improved the PVEs from 28.1 to 30.1% (SBP) and 14.3% to 17.4% (DBP) compared with a linear baseline model. Including seven PRSs in the genetic model computed based on the largest available GWAS of SBP/DBP improved the genetic model PVE from 4.8 to 5.1% (SBP) and 4.7 to 5% (DBP) compared to using a single PRS. Adding additional 14 PRSs computed based on two independent GWASs further increased the genetic model PVE to 6.3% (SBP) and 5.7% (DBP). PVE differed across self-reported race/ethnicity groups, with primarily all non-White groups benefitting from the inclusion of additional PRSs.

Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) has different binding properties on two IR isoforms, mimicking insulin's function. However, the molecular mechanism underlying IGF2-induced IR activation remains unclear. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of full-length human long isoform IR (IR-B) in both the inactive and IGF2-bound active states, and short isoform IR (IR-A) in the IGF2-bound active state. Under saturated IGF2 concentrations, both the IR-A and IR-B adopt predominantly asymmetric conformations with two or three IGF2s bound at site-1 and site-2, which differs from that insulin saturated IR forms an exclusively T-shaped symmetric conformation. IGF2 exhibits a relatively weak binding to IR site-2 compared to insulin, making it less potent in promoting full IR activation. Cell-based experiments validated the functional importance of IGF2 binding to two distinct binding sites in optimal IR signaling and trafficking. In the inactive state, the C-terminus of \u03b1-CT of IR-B contacts FnIII-2 domain of the same protomer, hindering its threading into the C-loop of IGF2, thus reducing the association rate of IGF2 with IR-B. Collectively, our studies demonstrate the activation mechanism of IR by IGF2 and reveal the molecular basis underlying the different affinity of IGF2 to IR-A and IR-B.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor II", "Protein Isoforms", "Receptor, Insulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Weidong", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "Hung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiayi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Junhee", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liwei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Chen", "Last Name": "Bai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.

Cell division regulators MAD2, BUBR1, and p31comet promote IR endocytosis on insulin stimulation. Here, we show that genetic ablation of the IR-MAD2 interaction in mice delays IR endocytosis, increases IR levels, and prolongs insulin action at the cell surface. This in turn causes a defect in insulin clearance and increases circulating insulin levels, unexpectedly increasing glucagon levels, which alters glucose metabolism modestly.

The initial imaging revealed\u00a0an about\u00a05 cm soft tissue mass at the dorsal midline of the parietal-occipital bone. Subsequent imaging identified a lung mass, and a biopsy of the skull bone confirmed that the mass was metastatic adenocarcinoma originating from the lung. For treatment, the patient underwent occipital partial resection of the mass, followed by wire mesh cranioplasty. Chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy were administered to alleviate symptoms and control the spread of cancer. Lung carcinoma with distant metastasis is generally associated with a poorer prognosis. However, some supporting data suggest that early detection and aggressive management play crucial roles in preventing further metastasis and improving the patient's quality of life and overall survival rate.

To elucidate the mechanism of IR activation by S597, we determine cryo-EM structures of the mouse IR/S597 complex. Unlike the compact T-shaped active IR resulting from the binding of four insulins to two distinct sites, two S597 molecules induce and stabilize an extended T-shaped IR through the simultaneous binding to both the L1 domain of one protomer and the FnIII-1 domain of another. Importantly, S597 fully activates IR mutants that disrupt insulin binding or destabilize the insulin-induced compact T-shape, thus eliciting insulin-like signaling. S597 also selectively activates IR signaling among different tissues and triggers IR endocytosis in the liver. Overall, our structural and functional studies guide future efforts to develop insulin mimetics targeting insulin resistance caused by defects in insulin binding and stabilization of insulin-activated state of IR, demonstrating the potential of structure-based drug design for insulin-resistant diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Mice", "Peptides", "Protein Subunits", "Receptor, Insulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junhee", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Mayer", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kerri A", "Last Name": "Ball", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiayi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael H B", "Last Name": "Stowell", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA. stowellm@colorado.edu."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Chen", "Last Name": "Bai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biophysics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.

Large knowledge gaps exist regarding outcomes expressed as most important to patients. Objectives: To determine the number of days alive and out of institution (DAOIs) and mortality after tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement during critical illness and to evaluate associations between health states before critical illness and outcomes. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) who received a tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or both, we determined the number of DAOIs after procedure date; 90-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality; hospital discharge destination; and hospital length of stay. We used claims from the year before admission to define eight mutually exclusive pre-ICU health states (permutations of one or more of cancer, chronic organ failure, frail, and robust) and assessed their association with DAOIs in 90 days and 1-year mortality. Results: Among 3,365 patients who received a tracheostomy, 6,709 patients who received a gastrostomy tube, and 3,540 patients who received both procedures, the median number of DAOIs in the first 90 days after placement was 3 (interquartile range, 0-46), 12 (0-61), and 0 (0-37), respectively. Over half died within 180 days. One-year mortality was 62%, 60%, and 64%, respectively. When compared with the robust state, all other pre-ICU health states were associated with loss of DAOIs and increased 1-year mortality; however, between the seven non-robust pre-ICU health states, there were no differences in outcomes.

A phosphorylation switch of IRS1/2 orchestrated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Src homology phosphatase 2 (SHP2) ensures selective internalization of activated IR. SHP2 inhibition blocks this feedback regulation and growth-promoting IR signaling, prolongs insulin action on metabolism, and improves insulin sensitivity in mice.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 2 and 3 bound to acetylated BubR1 exclusively in mitosis and led to the polyubiquitination of BubR1. Subsequent degradation of BubR1 resulted in the disassembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex. Importantly, BRCA2 was required for HDAC2/3 association with acetylated BubR1 in nocodazole (Noc)-arrested cells. Plk1, PP2A, P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and BubR1 were found in the mitotic BRCA2 complex, suggesting that BRCA2 acts as a signaling scaffold for BubR1 modification. Furthermore, we show that Plk1 is required for BRCA2 to localize at the prometaphase kinetochore (KT). Inhibition of Plk1 resulted in the loss of BRCA2 from the KT, and so did PCAF, consistent with the loss of BubR1 acetylation. Concordantly, BRCA2-dysfunctional cells exhibited resistance to trichostatin A, which was restored when BRCA2 was introduced. That loss of Brca2 conferred resistance to various HDAC inhibitors was corroborated by the experiments in mouse pancreatic organoids. These results suggest that the BRCA2-BubR1 acetylation-deacetylation pathway is an important decision-making point for the HDAC inhibitor response. Taken together, BRCA2 is a signaling platform for BubR1, and BubR1 deacetylation is a cue for SAC silencing.", "Keywords": ["BRCA2", "BubR1", "checkpoint silencing", "histone deacetylase", "spindle assembly checkpoint"], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Animals", "BRCA2 Protein", "Blotting, Western", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "HeLa Cells", "Histone Deacetylase 2", "Histone Deacetylases", "Humans", "M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Mice", "Nocodazole", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Pancreas", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "RNA Interference", "Spindle Apparatus", "Tubulin Modulators"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Inai", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Mi-Sun", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sangjin", "Last Name": "Paik", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hyeonjong", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hae-Ock", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Eunhee", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hyunsook", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, South Korea."}], "Journal": "The FEBS journal", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "28838226", "Title": "Intradialytic exercise improves physical function and reduces intradialytic hypotension and depression in hemodialysis patients.", "Abstract": "As numbers of maintenance hemodialysis patients are growing, debilitating conditions of muscle wasting and atrophy are becoming some of the greatest concerns in end-stage renal disease patients.

The oncogene KRAS and tumour suppressor STK11, which encodes the kinase LKB1, regulate metabolism and are frequently mutated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Concurrent occurrence of oncogenic KRAS and loss of LKB1 (KL) in cells specifies aggressive oncological behaviour. Here we show that human KL cells and tumours share metabolomic signatures of perturbed nitrogen handling. KL cells express the urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS1), which produces carbamoyl phosphate in the mitochondria from ammonia and bicarbonate, initiating nitrogen disposal. Transcription of CPS1 is suppressed by LKB1 through AMPK, and CPS1 expression correlates inversely with LKB1 in human NSCLC. Silencing CPS1 in KL cells induces cell death and reduces tumour growth. Notably, cell death results from pyrimidine depletion rather than ammonia toxicity, as CPS1 enables an unconventional pathway of nitrogen flow from ammonia into pyrimidines. CPS1 loss reduces the pyrimidine to purine ratio, compromises S-phase progression and induces DNA-polymerase stalling and DNA damage. Exogenous pyrimidines reverse DNA damage and rescue growth. The data indicate that the KL oncological genotype imposes a metabolic vulnerability related to a dependence on a cross-compartmental pathway of pyrimidine metabolism in an aggressive subset of NSCLC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases", "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases", "Ammonia", "Animals", "Bicarbonates", "Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia)", "Carbamyl Phosphate", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Cell Death", "Cell Proliferation", "DNA", "DNA Damage", "DNA Replication", "DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase", "Female", "Gene Silencing", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Metabolomics", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Nitrogen", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Purines", "Pyrimidines", "S Phase", "Transcription, Genetic", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiyeon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Children's Medical Center Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeping", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Children's Medical Center Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Children's Medical Center Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kailong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Children's Medical Center Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eunhee", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Faubert", "Affiliation": "Children's Medical Center Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Divya", "Last Name": "Bezwada", "Affiliation": "Children's Medical Center Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jaime", "Last Name": "Rodriguez-Canales", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 2130 West Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pamela", "Last Name": "Villalobos", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 2130 West Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu-Fen", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "Children's Medical Center Research Institute, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth E", "Last Name": "Huffman", "Affiliation": "Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luc", "Last Name": "Girard", "Affiliation": "Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren A", "Last Name": "Byers", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 2130 West Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keziban", "Last Name": "Unsal-Kacmaz", "Affiliation": "Oncology Research Unit, Pfizer, 401 North Middletown Road, Pearl River, New York 10965, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher G", "Last Name": "Pe\u00f1a", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "John V", "Last Name": "Heymach", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 2130 West Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Els", "Last Name": "Wauters", "Affiliation": "Respiratory Division, University of Gasthuisberg, KU Leuven, Herestraat 49, 3000 Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Johan", "Last Name": "Vansteenkiste", "Affiliation": "Respiratory Division, University of Gasthuisberg, KU Leuven, Herestraat 49, 3000 Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Diego H", "Last Name": "Castrillon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin P C", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ignacio", "Last Name": "Wistuba", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 2130 West Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diether", "Last Name": "Lambrechts", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Translational Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, O&N 4 Herestraat 49 -

Latent growth curve models evaluated predictors of 10-year cognitive trajectories separately by training group. Multiple group modeling examined associations between training gains and locus of control across racial groups. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans evidenced less improvement in memory and reasoning performance after training. These effects were partially mediated by locus of control, controlling for age, sex, education, health, depression, testing site, and initial cognitive ability. African Americans reported more external locus of control, which was associated with smaller training gains. External locus of control also had a stronger negative association with reasoning training gain for African Americans than for Whites.

For this reason, HPV tests targeting the E6 and E7 mRNA of five oncogenic HPV strains (HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45), which are known to be responsible for the oncogenesis of cervical cancer, have been commercialized using a real-time nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) assay. Previous data has shown that the real-time NASBA assay has higher clinical specificity than HPV DNA testing (97.1% vs. 53.7%). However, the sensitivity of the real-time NASBA assay was lower than that of HPV DNA testing (41.1% vs. 100%). Despite the fact that there are more than 16 oncogenic HPV genotypes known to cause cervical cancer (HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 69), the commercialized real-time NASBA kit was designed to detect only five genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, and 45). Therefore, in the present study, CervicGen HPV RT-qDX (Optipharm), a commercial diagnostic kit targeting a HPV E6/E7 mRNA based on RT-qPCR assay was evaluated with RNA extracted from ThinPrep Pap samples, and the results were compared to real-time NASBA data. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-qPCR assay were 91% and 98.6%, respectively, for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN2(+) high-grade cervical lesions. Therefore, the CervicGen HPV RT-qDX assay showed a significantly higher sensitivity (91.1%) compared to the real-time NASBA assay (41.1%). In normal cytohistology cases, the specificity was 98.6% and 53.7% for HPV mRNA RT-qPCR and HPV DNA testing, respectively. These results demonstrate that HPV mRNA RT-qPCR better reflects clinical diagnosis. In conclusion, it is suggested that HPV mRNA RT-qPCR overcomes the shortcomings of lower specificity seen in the DNA assay and the lower sensitivity of the commercialized HPV mRNA real-time NASBA assay when testing from ThinPrep Pap samples.", "Keywords": ["HPV E6/E7 mRNA RT-qPCR", "Human papillomavirus (HPV)", "Molecular diagnosis", "Real-time NASBA"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Human Papillomavirus DNA Tests", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Oncogene Proteins, Viral", "Papanicolaou Test", "RNA, Messenger", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jijgee", "Last Name": "Munkhdelger", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Gangwon 220-701, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Geehyuk", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Yonsei University, Wonju, Gangwon 220-710, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hye-young", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "M&D, Inc., Wonju Eco Environmental Technology Center, Wonju, Gangwon 200-722, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Dongsup", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Yonsei University, Wonju, Gangwon 220-710, Republic of Korea; Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Hyejeon College, Hongseong, Chungnam 350-702, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sunghyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Yonsei University, Wonju, Gangwon 220-710, Republic of Korea; Institute for Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yeonim", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, Songho College, Hoengseong, Gangwon 225-704, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Eunhee", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Institute of Lifestyle Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju, Gangwon 220-701, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sunyoung", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Yonsei University, Wonju, Gangwon 220-710, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hyunwoo", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Catholic University of Pusan, Pusan."}, {"First Name": "Kwang Hwa", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Gangwon 220-701, Republic of Korea.

Mice heterozygous for the acetylation-deficient BubR1 allele (K243R/+) spontaneously developed tumors with massive chromosome missegregations. K243R/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited a weakened spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) with shortened mitotic timing. The generation of the SAC signal was intact, as Mad2 localization to the unattached kinetochore (KT) was unaltered; however, because of the premature degradation of K243R-BubR1, the mitotic checkpoint complex disassociated prematurely in the nocodazole-treated condition, suggesting that maintenance of the SAC is compromised. BubR1 acetylation was also required to counteract excessive Aurora B activity at the KT for stable chromosome-spindle attachments. The association of acetylation-deficient BubR1 with PP2A-B56\u03b1 phosphatase was reduced, and the phosphorylated Ndc80 at the KT was elevated in K243R/+ MEFs. In relation, there was a marked increase of micronuclei and p53 mutation was frequently detected in primary tumors of K243R/+ mice.

Recently, the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) was demonstrated in tumors of gastrointestinal tract. CD133 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a CSC marker in various malignancies. However, the expression of CD133 in neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) of digestive tract has not been studied. We evaluated tissue expression of CD133 by immunohistochemistry in 90 NENs of digestive tract with their matched non-neoplastic mucosa including stomach (n=15), small intestine (n=7), appendix (n=3), colon (n=8), rectum (n=41), pancreas (n=2), gallbladder (n=4) and liver (n=10). Tumors were divided according to 2010 WHO classification. CD133 was expressed in 30.3% (17/56) of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), 26.1% (6/23) of poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) and 63.6% (7/11) of mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANECs). MANEC refers to existence of both adenocarcinoma and NEC together, each one comprising at least 30% of the tumor. CD133 was expressed in cytoplasm, luminal-side of cell membrane, or both and the staining pattern correlated with tumor growth pattern. CD133 expression was not significantly correlated with tumor grade, site, expression of neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin-A and synaptophysin) and patients' survival. Thus, CD133 expression may lack prognostic significance in GEP-NETs. Importantly, CD133 was not detectable in non-neoplastic neuroendocrine cells of digestive system including pancreatic islets. In conclusion, CD133 is expressed in poorly-differentiated NECs and well-differentiated NETs of the digestive tract.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AC133 Antigen", "Antigens, CD", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Digestive System Neoplasms", "Glycoproteins", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Peptides", "Republic of Korea"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Khalilullah", "Last Name": "Mia-Jan", "Affiliation": "Department of pathology, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Gangwon-do, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jijgee", "Last Name": "Munkhdelger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mi-Ra", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sun-Young", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tae Young", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "EunHee", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mee-Yon", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23537343", "Title": "CD133 expression is not an independent prognostic factor in stage II and III colorectal cancer but may predict the better outcome in patients with adjuvant therapy.", "Abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are notorious for their capacity of tumor progression, metastasis or resistance to chemo-radiotherapy.
