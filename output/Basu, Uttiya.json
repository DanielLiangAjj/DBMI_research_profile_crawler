The inherent DNA damaging activity of this enzyme can also have off-target effects in B-cells, producing lymphomagenic chromosomal translocations that are characteristic features of various classes of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL), and generating oncogenic mutations, so-called aberrant somatic hypermutation (aSHM). Additionally, AID has been found to affect gene expression through demethylation as well as altered interactions between gene regulatory elements. These changes have been most thoroughly studied in B-NHL arising from GC B-cells. Here, we describe the most common classes of GC-derived B-NHL and explore the consequences of on- and off-target AID activity in B and plasma cell neoplasms. The relationships between AID expression, including effects of infection and other exposures/agents, mutagenic activity and lymphoma biology are also discussed.", "Keywords": ["Aberrant somatic hypermutation", "Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)", "B cells", "Class switch recombination", "Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma", "Somatic hypermutation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cytidine Deaminase", "Germinal Center", "Lymphoma, B-Cell", "Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Immunoglobulin Class Switching"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca J", "Last Name": "Leeman-Neill", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

Activated B cells in germinal centers express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to accomplish physiological somatic hypermutation (SHM) of their antibody-encoding genes. In attempting to diversify their immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy- and light-chain genes, several B-cell clones successfully optimize their antigen-binding affinities. However, SHM can sometimes occur at non-Ig loci, causing genetic alternations that lay the foundation for lymphomagenesis, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, SHM acts as a double-edged sword, bestowing superb humoral immunity at the potential risk of initiating disease. We refer to off-target, non-Ig AID mutations - that are often but not always associated with disease - as aberrant SHM (aSHM). A key challenge in understanding SHM and aSHM is determining how AID targets and mutates specific DNA sequences in the Ig loci to generate antibody diversity and non-Ig genes to initiate lymphomagenesis.

This will be helpful for future studies of R-loops status on whole genome as well as on IgH locus in B cells.", "Keywords": ["B cells", "Class switch recombination", "DRIP-seq", "Nondenaturing sodium bisulfite probing"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "DNA", "Immunoglobulin Class Switching", "Immunoprecipitation", "Mammals", "R-Loop Structures", "RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junghyun", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brice", "Last Name": "Laffleur", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Uttiya", "Last Name": "Basu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. ub2121@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Kefei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA. yuke@msu.edu."}], "Journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35658015", "Title": "RNA exosome drives early B cell development via noncoding RNA processing mechanisms.", "Abstract": "B cell development is linked to successful V(D)J recombination, allowing B cell receptor expression and ultimately antibody secretion for adaptive immunity. Germline noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are produced at immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during V(D)J recombination, but their function and posttranscriptional regulation are incompletely understood. Patients with trichohepatoenteric syndrome, characterized by RNA exosome pathway component mutations, exhibit lymphopenia, thus demonstrating the importance of ncRNA surveillance in B cell development in humans. To understand the role of RNA exosome in early B cell development in greater detail, we generated mouse models harboring a B cell-specific cre allele (Mb1cre), coupled to conditional inversion-deletion alleles of one RNA exosome core component (Exosc3) or RNase catalytic subunits (Exosc10 or Dis3). We noticed increased expression of RNA exosome subunits during V(D)J recombination, whereas a B cell developmental blockade at the pro-B cell stage was observed in the different knockout mice, overlapping with a lack of productive rearrangements of VDJ genes at the Ig heavy chain (Igh). This unsuccessful recombination prevented differentiation into pre-B cells, with accumulation of ncRNAs and up-regulation of the p53 pathway. Introduction of a prearranged Igh VDJ allele partly rescued the pre-B cell population in Dis3-deficient cells, although V-J recombination defects were observed at Ig light chain kappa (Ig\u03ba), preventing subsequent B cell development. These observations demonstrated that the RNA exosome complex is important for Igh and Ig\u03ba recombination and establish the relevance of RNA processing for optimal diversification at these loci

Here we show that immunohistochemistry for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK), a marker of MAPK/ERK pathway activation, is predictive of overall survival following adjuvant PD-1 blockade in two independent rGBM patient cohorts. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence analyses revealed that p-ERK was mainly localized in tumor cells and that high-p-ERK GBMs contained tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia with elevated expression of MHC class\u2009II and associated genes.

The recognition is driven by interaction of the MPP6 adaptor protein with nuclear m6A reader YTHDC1. MPP6 and YTHDC1 promote CSR by recruiting AID and the RNA exosome to actively transcribe S\u03bcGLT. Direct suppression of m6A modification of S\u03bcGLT or of m6A reader YTHDC1 reduces CSR. Moreover, METTL3, an essential gene for B cell development in the bone marrow and germinal center, suppresses IgH-associated aberrant DNA breaks and prevents genomic instability.

Subsets of PCRP mAbs were further tested in ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, STORM super-resolution microscopy, immunoblots, and protein binding microarray (PBM) experiments. About 5% of the tested antibodies displayed high-confidence target (i.e., cognate antigen) enrichment across at least one assay and are strong candidates for additional validation. An additional 34% produced ChIP-exo data that were distinct from background and thus warrant further testing.

Exosc3-deficient B cells lack the ability to undergo normal levels of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, two mutagenic DNA processes used to generate antibody diversity via the B-cell mutator protein activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The transcriptome of Exosc3-deficient B cells has revealed the presence of many novel RNA exosome substrate ncRNAs. RNA exosome substrate RNAs include xTSS-RNAs, transcription start site (TSS)-associated antisense transcripts that can exceed 500 base pairs in length and are transcribed divergently from cognate coding gene transcripts. xTSS-RNAs are most strongly expressed at genes that accumulate AID-mediated somatic mutations and/or are frequent translocation partners of DNA double-strand breaks generated at Igh in B cells. Strikingly, translocations near TSSs or within gene bodies occur over regions of RNA exosome substrate ncRNA expression. These RNA exosome-regulated, antisense-transcribed regions of the B-cell genome recruit AID and accumulate single-strand DNA structures containing RNA-DNA hybrids.
