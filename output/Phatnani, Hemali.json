It is characterized by the progressive decline of the nervous system that leads to the weakening of muscles which impacts physical function. Approximately, 15% of individuals diagnosed with ALS have a known genetic variant that contributes to their disease. As therapies that slow or prevent symptoms\u00a0continue to develop, such as antisense oligonucleotides, it is important to discover novel genes that could be targets for treatment. Additionally, as cohorts continue to grow, performing analyses in ALS subtypes, such as primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), becomes possible due to an increase in power. These analyses could highlight novel pathways in disease manifestation.", "Keywords": ["ALS", "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Burden testing", "PLS", "Peripheral lateral sclerosis", "Rare-variant

To differentiate FUS fALS and healthy control fibroblasts, machine-learning classifiers were trained separately on high-content imaging and transcriptional profiles. \"Molecular ALS phenotype\" scores, derived from these classifiers, captured a spectrum from disease to health. Interestingly, these scores negatively correlated with age of onset, identified several pre-symptomatic individuals and sporadic ALS (sALS) patients with FUS-like fibroblasts, and quantified \"movement\" of FUS fALS and \"FUS-like\" sALS toward health upon FUS ASO treatment.

Much of our understanding of senescent cell biology still originates from tissue culture studies, where each cell in the culture is driven to an irreversible cell cycle arrest. By contrast, in tissues, these cells are relatively rare and difficult to characterize, and it is now established that fully differentiated, postmitotic cells can also acquire a senescence phenotype. The SenNet Biomarkers Working Group was formed to provide recommendations for the use of cellular senescence markers to identify and characterize senescent cells in tissues. Here, we provide recommendations for detecting senescent cells in different tissues based on a comprehensive analysis of existing literature reporting senescence markers in 14 tissues in mice and humans. We discuss some of the recent advances in detecting and characterizing cellular senescence, including molecular senescence signatures and morphological features, and the use of circulating markers.

We review genetic, epigenomic, and gene expression findings related to AD pathogenesis and explore how their integration enables a better understanding of the multicellular imbalances contributing to this heterogeneous condition. The frontiers opening on the back of these research milestones promise a future of AD care that is both more personalized and predictive.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Humans", "Genome, Human", "Genomics", "Animals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cl\u00e1udio", "Last Name": "Gouveia Roque", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics of Neurodegenerative Disease, New York Genome Center, New York, NY 10013, USA; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Single-cell technologies have allowed unprecedented characterization of senescence; however, many methodologies fail to provide spatial insights. The spatial component is essential, as senescent cells communicate with neighboring cells, impacting their function and the composition of extracellular space. The Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet), a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund initiative, aims to map senescent cells across the lifespan of humans and mice. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing and emerging methodologies for spatial imaging and their application toward mapping senescent cells.

State of the art -omics methods combine fluorescence microscopy with complex protocols to visualize tens to thousands of features in each of millions of pixels across samples. These -omics methods require precise control of temperature, reagent application, and image acquisition parameters during iterative chemistry and imaging cycles conducted over the course of days or weeks. Automated execution of such methods enables robust and reproducible data generation. However, few commercial solutions exist for temperature controlled, fluidics coupled fluorescence imaging, and implementation of bespoke instrumentation requires specialized engineering expertise. Here we present PySeq2500, an open source Python code base and flow cell design that converts the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument, comprising an epifluorescence microscope with integrated fluidics, into an open platform for programmable applications without need for specialized engineering or software development expertise. Customizable PySeq2500 protocols enable experimental designs involving simultaneous 4-channel image acquisition, temperature control, reagent exchange, stable positioning, and sample integrity over extended experiments. To demonstrate accessible automation of complex, multi-day workflows, we use the PySeq2500 system for unattended execution of iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i). Our automated 4i method uses off-the-shelf antibodies over multiple cycles of staining, imaging, and antibody elution to build highly multiplexed maps of cell types and pathological features in mouse and postmortem human spinal cord sections. Given the widespread availability of HiSeq 2500 platforms and the simplicity of the modifications required to repurpose these systems, PySeq2500 enables non-specialists to develop and implement state of the art fluidics coupled imaging methods in a widely available benchtop system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Feces", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Mice", "Optical Imaging", "Software", "Workflow"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kunal", "Last Name": "Pandit", "Affiliation": "Technology Innovation Lab, New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA. kpandit@nygenome.org."}, {"First Name": "Joana", "Last Name": "Petrescu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Cuevas", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Stephenson", "Affiliation": "Technology Innovation Lab, New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Smibert", "Affiliation": "Technology Innovation Lab, New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hemali", "Last Name": "Phatnani", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. hphatnani@nygenome.org."}, {"First Name": "Silas", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Technology Innovation Lab, New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA. smaniatis@nygenome.org."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2022Mar24"}, {"PMID": "35197628", "Title": "TDP-43 loss and ALS-risk SNPs drive mis-splicing and depletion of UNC13A.", "Abstract": "Variants of UNC13A, a critical gene for synapse function, increase the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia1-3, two related neurodegenerative diseases defined by mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein TDP-434,5.

However, miR-218 relevance to human motor neuron disease was not yet explored. Here, we demonstrate by neuropathology that miR-218 is abundant in healthy human motor neurons. However, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) motor neurons, miR-218 is down-regulated and its mRNA targets are reciprocally up-regulated (derepressed). We further identify the potassium channel Kv10.1 as a new miR-218 direct target that controls neuronal activity. In addition, we screened thousands of ALS genomes and identified six rare variants in the human miR-218-2 sequence. miR-218 gene variants fail to regulate neuron activity, suggesting the importance of this small endogenous RNA for neuronal robustness. The underlying mechanisms involve inhibition of miR-218 biogenesis and reduced processing by DICER.

Through gene level analyses, we replicated known ALS genes including SOD1, NEK1 and FUS. We also observed multiple distinct protein-truncating variants in a highly constrained gene, DNAJC7. The signal in DNAJC7 exceeded genome-wide significance, and immunoblotting assays showed depletion of DNAJC7 protein in fibroblasts in a patient with ALS carrying the p.Arg156Ter variant. DNAJC7 encodes a member of the heat-shock protein family, HSP40, which, along with HSP70 proteins, facilitates protein homeostasis, including folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and clearance of degraded proteins.

This study highlights the utility of induced pluripotent stem cell-based in vitro disease models to investigate mechanisms of disease in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Astrocytes", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Coculture Techniques", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Serio", "Affiliation": "Euan MacDonald Centre for Motor Neurone Disease Research, Centre for Neuroregeneration, and Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4UU, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Bilada", "Last Name": "Bilican", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sami J", "Last Name": "Barmada", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dale Michael", "Last Name": "Ando", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rick", "Last Name": "Siller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Burr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ghazal", "Last Name": "Haghi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Story", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Agnes Lumi", "Last Name": "Nishimura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Monica A", "Last Name": "Carrasco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hemali P", "Last Name": "Phatnani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carole", "Last Name": "Shum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Wilmut", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Finkbeiner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Siddharthan", "Last Name": "Chandran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Mar19"}, {"PMID": "23388633", "Title": "Intricate interplay between astrocytes and motor neurons in ALS.", "Abstract": "ALS results from the selective and progressive degeneration of motor neurons. Although the underlying disease mechanisms remain unknown, glial cells have been implicated in ALS disease progression. Here, we examine the effects of glial cell/motor neuron interactions on gene expression using the hSOD1(G93A) (the G93A allele of the human superoxide dismutase gene) mouse model of ALS. We detect striking cell autonomous and nonautonomous changes in gene expression in cocultured motor neurons and glia, revealing that the two cell types profoundly affect each other. In addition, we found a remarkable concordance between the cell culture data and expression profiles of whole spinal cords and acutely isolated spinal cord cells during disease progression in the G93A mouse model, providing validation of the cell culture approach. Bioinformatics analyses identified changes in the expression of specific genes and signaling pathways that may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS, among which are TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Mice", "Motor Neurons", "Proteoglycans", "Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta", "Spinal Cord", "Superoxide Dismutase", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hemali P", "Last Name": "Phatnani", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paolo", "Last Name": "Guarnieri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brad A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Monica A", "Last Name": "Carrasco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Muratet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "O'Keeffe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiamaka", "Last Name": "Nwakeze", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Florencia", "Last Name": "Pauli-Behn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kimberly M", "Last Name": "Newberry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarah K", "Last Name": "Meadows", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juan Carlos", "Last Name": "Tapia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Feb19"}]
