[{"PMID": "38949051", "Title": "Tuning Octahedron Sites of CoV2O4 via Cationic Competition for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction.", "Abstract": "Doping transition metal oxide spinels with metal ions represents a significant strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Herein, a bimetallic Fe and Ru doping strategy to fine-tune the crystal structure of CoV2O4 spinel for highly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is presented performance. The incorporation of Fe and Ru is observed at octahedral sites within the CoV2O4 structure, effectively modulating the electronic configuration of Co. Density functional theory calculations have confirmed that Fe acts as a novel reactive site, replacing V. Additionally, the synergistic effect of Fe, Co, and Ru effectively optimizes the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate species, reduces the reaction energy barrier, and accelerates the kinetics toward OER. As expected, the best-performing CoVFe0.5Ru0.5O4 displays a low overpotential of 240\u00a0mV (@10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm-2) and a remarkably low Tafel slope of 38.9\u00a0mV\u00a0dec-1, surpassing that of commercial RuO2. Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding long-term durability lasting for 72\u00a0h.

It has been suggested that PFOS is associated with liver inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, PFOS was found to elevate the oligomerization tendency of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in the mice liver and human normal liver cells L-02. Inhibition of VDAC1 oligomerization alleviated PFOS-induced nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. Cytoplasmic membrane VDAC1 translocated to mitochondria was also observed in response to PFOS. Therefore, the oligomerization of VDAC1 occurred mainly in the mitochondria. VDAC1 was found to interact with the ATP synthase beta subunit (ATP5B) under PFOS treatment. Knockdown of ATP5B or immobilization of ATP5B to the cytoplasmic membrane alleviated the increased VDAC1 oligomerization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, our results suggested that PFOS induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation through VDAC1 oligomerization, a process dependent on ATP5B to transfer VDAC1 from the plasma membrane to the mitochondria. The findings offer novel perspectives on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the regulatory mode on VDAC1 oligomerization, and the mechanism of PFOS toxicity.", "Keywords": ["ATP5B", "Liver", "NLRP3 inflammasome", "Perfluorooctane sulfonate", "VDAC1 oligomers"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Peiyao", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Ruzhen", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Tianming", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Jingyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Xiance", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Qiujuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Nutrition Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Nutrition Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaofeng", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Occupation and Environment Health Department, Dalian Medical University,\u00a09 Lushun-South Road,\u00a0Dalian,\u00a0China.

Cancer susceptibility candidate 15 (CASC15), a long non-coding RNA closely associated with tumour development, has been implicated in PCOS onset and development. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying PCOS by downregulating CASC15 expression in both in vitro and in vivo models. We explored the potential regulatory relationship between CASC15 expression and PCOS by examining cell proliferation, cell cycle dynamics, cell autophagy, steroid hormone secretion capacity, and overall ovarian function in mice. We found that CASC15 expression in granulosa cells derived from patients with PCOS was significantly higher than those of the normal group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In vitro experiments revealed that downregulating CASC15 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest, and influenced cellular autophagy levels. Moreover, downregulating CASC15 affected the follicular development process in newborn mouse ovaries. In vivo studies in mice demonstrated that disrupting CASC15 expression improved PCOS-related symptoms such as polycystic changes and hyperandrogenism, and significantly affected ovulation induction and embryo implantation in pregnant mice.

Limited space within the system restricts the number of X-ray sources, leading to sparse-view CT imaging challenges. Recent diffusion models for reconstructing sparse-view CT have generally focused separately on sinogram or image domains. Sinogram-centric models effectively estimate missing projections but may introduce artifacts, lacking mechanisms to ensure image correctness. Conversely, image-domain models, while capturing detailed image features, often struggle with complex data distribution, leading to inaccuracies in projections. Addressing these issues, the Dual-domain Collaborative Diffusion Sampling (DCDS) model integrates sinogram and image domain diffusion processes for enhanced sparse-view reconstruction. This model combines the strengths of both domains in an optimized mathematical framework. A collaborative diffusion mechanism underpins this model, improving sinogram recovery and image generative capabilities. This mechanism facilitates feedback-driven image generation from the sinogram domain and uses image domain results to complete missing projections. Optimization of the DCDS model is further achieved through the alternative direction iteration method, focusing on data consistency updates. Extensive testing, including numerical simulations, real phantoms, and clinical cardiac datasets, demonstrates the DCDS model's effectiveness.

The microtissues obtained from BMSC-laden GMs were then injected into articular cartilage defect areas in rats and achieved superior performance in alleviating inflammation and repairing cartilage.

They have evolved obligate bipedal saltation and acute senses, and been well-adapted to vast desert-like habitats. Using a newly sequenced chromosome-scale genome of the Mongolian five-toed jerboa (Orientallactaga sibirica), our comparative genomic analyses and in vitro functional assays showed that the genetic innovations in both protein-coding and non-coding regions played an important role in jerboa morphological and physiological adaptation. Jerboa-specific amino acid substitutions, and segment insertions/deletions (indels) in conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) were found in components of proteoglycan biosynthesis pathway (XYLT1 and CHSY1), which plays an important role in limb development. Meanwhile, we found specific evolutionary changes functionally associated with energy or water metabolism (e.g., specific amino acid substitutions in ND5 and indels in CNEs physically near ROR2) and senses (e.g., expansion of vomeronasal receptors and the FAM136A gene family) in jerboas. Further dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that some of the CNEs with jerboa-specific segment indels exerted a significantly different influence on luciferase activity, suggesting changes in their regulatory function in jerboas.

The flow field characteristics mainly refer to the spatial and temporal variation of the related physical parameters. In the HFM field, the physical parameter mainly refers to the variation characteristics of the shear force, flow velocity and turbulence caused by hydraulics. The factors affecting the flow field characteristics will be discussed from three levels: the micro-flow field near the interface of membrane (micro-interface), the flow field around the membrane module and the reactor design related to flow field, which involves surface morphology, crossflow, aeration, fiber packing density, membrane vibration, structural design and other related parameters.

Rapeseed is an important oil crop, providing high-quality edible oil for human consumption. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of salt stress on the phenotypic traits and physiological processes of rapeseed. The soil salinity was manipulated by setting three different levels: 0 g NaCl kg-1 soil (referred to as S0), 1.5 g NaCl kg-1 soil (referred to as S1), and 3.0 g NaCl kg-1 soil (referred to as S2). In general, the results indicated that the plant height, leaf area, and root neck diameter decreased with an increase in soil salinity. In addition, the biomass of various organs at all growth stages decreased as soil salinity increased from S0 to S2. The increasing soil salinity improved the distribution of biomass in the root and leaf at the seedling and flowering stages, indicating that rapeseed plants subjected to salt stress during the vegetative stage are capable of adapting their growth pattern to sustain their capacity for nutrient and water uptake, as well as leaf photosynthesis. However, as the soil salinity increased, there was a decrease in the distribution of biomass in the pod and seed at the maturity stage, while an increase was observed in the root and stem, suggesting that salt stress inhibited carbohydrate transport into reproductive organs. Moreover, the C and N accumulation at the flowering and maturity stages exhibited a reduction in direct correlation with the increase in soil salinity. High soil salinity resulted in a reduction in the C/N, indicating that salt stress exerted a greater adverse effect on C assimilation compared to N assimilation, leading to an increase in seed protein content and a decrease in oil content. Furthermore, as soil salinity increased from S0 to S2, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and the content of soluble protein and sugar increased by 58.39%, 33.38%, 15.57%, and 13.88% at the seedling stage, and 38.69%, 22.85%, 12.04%, and 8.26% at the flowering stage, respectively. In summary, this study revealed that salt stress inhibited C and N assimilation, leading to a suppressed phenotype and biomass accumulation. The imbalanced C and N assimilation under salt stress contributed to the alterations in the seed oil and protein content.

Here, based on cocrystal structures and biochemical experiments, we developed a series of ASP3026 analogues to improve the selectivity and potency of LysRS inhibition. The leading compound 36 showed a dissociation constant of 15.9\u2009nM with PfLysRS. The inhibitory efficacy on PfLysRS and parasites has been enhanced.

Machine learning (ML) presents an emerging solution, offering the prospect of predicting CDI performance with minimal investment in electrode material synthesis and testing. Herein, four ML models are used for predicting the CDI performance of porous carbons. Among them, the gradient boosting model delivers the best performance on test set with low root mean square error values of 2.13\u00a0mg g-1 and 0.073\u00a0mg g-1 min-1 for predicting desalination capacity and rate, respectively. Furthermore, SHapley Additive exPlanations is introduced to analyze the significance of electrode properties and operational conditions. It highlights that electrolyte concentration and specific surface area exert a substantially more influential role in determining desalination performance compared to other features.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether curcumin can prevent the renal injury caused by PAT, and to explore potential mechanisms. In vivo, supplementation with curcumin attenuated PAT-induced ferroptosis. Mechanically, curcumin inhibited autophagy, led to the accumulation of p62 and its interaction with Keap1, promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), and increased the expression of antioxidant stress factors in the process of ferroptosis. These results have also been confirmed in HKC cell experiments. Furthermore, knockdown of Nrf2 in HKC cells abrogated the protective effect of curcumin on ferroptosis.

Dark fermentation is a potential technology to treat antibiotic fermentation residue in terms of renewable H2 generation and waste management. However, the inherent antibiotic in antibiotic fermentation residue may inhibit its dark fermentation performance, and current understanding on this topic is limited. This investigation examined the impact of the inherent antibiotic on the dark H2 fermentation of Cephalosporin C (CEPC) fermentation residue, and explored the mechanisms from the perspectives of bacterial communities and functional genes. It was found that CEP-C in the antibiotic fermentation residue significantly inhibited the H2 production, with the H2 yield decreasing from 17.2\u00a0mL/g-VSadded to 12.5 and 9.6\u00a0mL/g-VSadded at CEP-C concentrations of 100 and 200\u00a0mg/L, respectively. CEP-C also prolonged the H2-producing lag period. Microbiological analysis indicated that CEP-C remarkably decreased the abundances of high-yielding H2-producing bacteria, as well as downregulated the genes involved in hydrogen generation from the\"pyruvate pathway\" and\"NADH pathway\", essentially leading to the decline of H2 productivity.

Materials and Methods From August 2021 to October 2022, 271 participants were prospectively enrolled (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05159323) and underwent breast diffusion spectral imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. MAP MRI metrics and ADC were derived from the diffusion MRI data. All participants were divided into high-TSR (stromal component < 50%) and low-TSR (stromal component \u2265 50%) groups based on pathologic examination. Clinicopathologic characteristics were collected, and MRI findings were assessed. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent variables for distinguishing TSR status. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared between the MAP MRI metrics, either alone or combined with clinicopathologic characteristics, and ADC, using the DeLong and McNemar test. Results A total of 181 female participants (mean age, 49 years \u00b1 10 [SD]) were included. All diffusion MRI metrics differed between the high-TSR and low-TSR groups (P < .001 to P = .01). Radial non-Gaussianity from MAP MRI and lymphovascular invasion were significant independent variables for discriminating the two groups, with a higher AUC (0.81 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.87] vs 0.61 [95% CI: 0.53, 0.68], P < .001) and accuracy (138 of 181 [76%] vs 106 of 181 [59%], P < .001) than that of the ADC. Conclusion MAP MRI may serve as a better approach than conventional diffusion-weighted imaging in evaluating the TSR of breast carcinoma.

Machine/deep learning has been proven effective in FFR pullback curve estimation. However, the existing methods suffer from inadequate incorporation of intrinsic geometry associations and physics knowledge. In this paper, we propose a constraint-aware learning framework to improve the estimation of the FFR pullback curve from invasive coronary imaging. It incorporates both geometrical and physical constraints to approximate the relationships between the geometric structure and FFR values along the coronary artery centerline. Our method also leverages the power of synthetic data in model training to reduce the collection costs of clinical data. Moreover, to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real data distributions when testing on real-world imaging data, we also employ a diffusion-driven test-time data adaptation method that preserves the knowledge learned in synthetic data. Specifically, this method learns a diffusion model of the synthetic data distribution and then projects real data to the synthetic data distribution at test time. Extensive experimental studies on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset of 382 patients covering three imaging modalities have shown the better performance of our method for FFR estimation of stenotic coronary arteries, compared with other machine/deep learning-based FFR estimation models and computational fluid dynamics-based model. The results also provide high agreement and correlation between the FFR predictions of our method and the invasively measured FFR values.

In recent years, with the development of deep learning technology, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made considerable progress in improving the accuracy of building extraction from remote sensing imagery. However, most existing methods require numerous parameters and large amounts of computing and storage resources. This affects their efficiency and limits their practical application. In this study, to balance the accuracy and amount of computation required for building extraction, a novel efficient lightweight residual network (ELRNet) with an encoder-decoder structure is proposed for building extraction. ELRNet consists of a series of downsampling blocks and lightweight feature extraction modules (LFEMs) for the encoder and an appropriate combination of LFEMs and upsampling blocks for the decoder. The key to the proposed ELRNet is the LFEM which has depthwise-factorised convolution incorporated in its design. In addition, the effective channel attention (ECA) added to LFEM, performs local cross-channel interactions, thereby fully extracting the relevant information between channels. The performance of ELRNet was evaluated on the public WHU Building dataset, achieving 88.24% IoU with 2.92 GFLOPs and 0.23 million parameters. The proposed ELRNet was compared with six state-of-the-art baseline networks (SegNet, U-Net, ENet, EDANet, ESFNet, and ERFNet). The results show that ELRNet offers a better tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in the automatic extraction of buildings in very highresolution remote sensing images.

The latter mechanism is based on ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs), where glyme solvents were explored and proved to deliver unsatisfactory cyclability in LIBs. Herein, we report a novel intercalation mechanism, that is, in situ synthesis of t-GIC in the tetrahydrofuran (THF) electrolyte via a spontaneous, controllable reaction between binary-GIC (b-GIC) and free THF molecules during initial graphite lithiation. The spontaneous transformation from b-GIC to t-GIC, which is different from conventional cointercalation chemistry, is characterized and quantified via operando synchrotron X-ray and electrochemical analyses. The resulting t-GIC chemistry obviates the necessity for complete Li-ion desolvation, facilitating rapid kinetics and synchronous charge/discharge of graphite particles, even under high current densities. Consequently, the graphite anode demonstrates unprecedented fast charging (1 min), dendrite-free low-temperature performance, and ultralong lifetimes exceeding 10\u2009000 cycles. Full cells coupled with a layered cathode display remarkable cycling stability upon a 15 min charging and excellent rate capability even at -40 \u00b0C. Furthermore, our chemical strategies are shown to extend beyond Li-ion batteries to encompass Na-ion and K-ion batteries, underscoring their broad applicability.

Populus simonii Carr is one of the most dominant silvicultural species in the region. The aim of this study is to understand the soil characteristics and soil fertility of Populus simonii shelter forests at different growth stages and to establish a scientific basis for soil nutrient regulation and sustainable management of Populus simonii shelter forests at the southern edge of the Horqin Sandy Land. Sample plots were selected for young (\u226415 a), middle-aged (16-25 a), near-mature (26-30 a), mature (31-40 a), and over-mature (\u226541 a) forests. Each forest studied was in a state of natural restoration with uniform stand conditions and no artificial fertilizer was applied. These sites were selected to study changes in the soil characteristics in soil depths of 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm. In order to avoid the problem of multicollinearity between soil variables and to reduce redundancy, principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson's correlation analysis, and Norm value calculation were used to select the least correlated indicators with the highest factor loadings. This was used to establish the minimum data set. The soil fertility quality of these shelterbelts in different forest ages was quantified using the soil quality index (SQI). In the growth stage from young to nearly mature forests, the soil bulk weight and pH decreased with increasing forest age. Soil capillary porosity, noncapillary porosity, total porosity, water content, field water holding capacity, and organic carbon content increased with increasing forest age and soil nutrient content gradually improved. At the stage of near-mature to over-mature forests, the effect of forest age on soil bulk density was not significant and all other soil characteristics decreased to varying degrees as the forest age increased. The soil also developed from alkaline to neutral. The SQI of the total data set and the SQI of the minimum data set consistently showed that near-mature forests (NMF) > middle-aged forests (MAF) > mature forests (MF) > over-mature forests (OMF) > young forests (YF). The results of the two evaluation systems showed a significant positive correlation (P < 0.05, R 2 = 0.8263) indicating that it is feasible to use the minimum data set to evaluate the soil fertility of shelter forests of different forest ages. The age of the forest has an obvious effect on the soil characteristics and overall soil fertility of shelter forests. The Populus simonii shelter forests on the southern edge of the Horqin Sandy Land have great soil development at the early stage of afforestation and the soil nutrient content gradually increases. The soil fertility reaches a peak when the forest is nearly mature and the soil fertility declines after the age of the forest reaches 30 years.", "Keywords": ["Forest age", "Horqin sandy land", "Shelter forest", "Soil characteristics", "Soil fertility"], "MeSH terms": ["Populus", "China", "Soil", "Forests", "Conservation of Natural Resources"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinyu", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "College of Desert Control Science and Engineering, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Desert Control Science and Engineering, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China."}, {"First Name": "Ji", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "College of Desert Control Science and Engineering, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China."}, {"First Name": "Shi", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "College of Desert Control Science and Engineering, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Tao", "Affiliation": "Forest General Site of Ordos City, Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China."}], "Journal": "PeerJ", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38831762", "Title": "Using artificial intelligence and predictive modelling to enable learning healthcare systems (LHS) for pandemic preparedness.", "Abstract": "In anticipation of potential future pandemics, we examined the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 outbreak.

This study elucidates the achievement of a full electrical manipulation of the perpendicular exchange bias in the multilayers with an ultrathin antiferromagnetic layer. Owing to the anisotropic epitaxial strain in the 2-nm-thick IrMn3 layer, the considerable exchange bias effect is clearly achieved at room temperature.

This study utilizes data from the public GWAS database and employs bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the causal relationship between immune cells and prostatitis. The causal relationship between 731 immune cell features and prostatitis was primarily investigated through inverse variance weighting (IVW), complemented by MR-Egger regression, a simple model, the weighted median method, and a weighted model. Ultimately, the results underwent sensitivity analysis to assess the heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and stability of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune cells and prostatitis. MR analysis revealed 17 immune cells exhibiting significant causal effects on prostatitis. In contrast, findings from reverse MR indicated a significant causal relationship between prostatitis and 13 immune cells. Our study utilizes bidirectional Mendelian Randomization to establish causal relationships between specific immune cell phenotypes and prostatitis, highlighting the reciprocal influence between immune system behavior and the disease.

However, the application of the MEGs in the wearable field is still challenging due to the low electric output and the lack of wearable attributes such as breathability and flame retardancy. Herein, we demonstrated a wearable MEG with high power-output, breathability and flame retardancy, which was fabricated by designing an asymmetrical nanofiber assembly using hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol/phytic acid (PVA/PA) and hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) nanofiber membranes. Owing to the synergistic effects of strong water absorption, enhanced ion release and numerous micro-nano transport channels, a single MEG of 1\u00a0cm2 could constantly generate high direct-current (DC) power, i.e., a voltage of 1.0\u00a0V, a current of 15.5 \u03bcA, and a power density of 3.0\u00a0\u03bcW\u00a0cm-2, outperforming other reported nanofiber-based MEGs. More importantly, the asymmetric nanofiber structure ensured the moisture circulation inside MEG and thus produced a sustained voltage output for 7\u00a0days without any deterioration. The MEG also showed good flexibility, air/moisture permeability and flame retardancy, which give it necessary wearable attributes. Furthermore, large-scale integration of MEG units could be readily realized to fabricate a power source device for driving different portable electronics, while the moisture sensitivity made the MEG well used for sensing applications (e.g., respiration monitoring, fire warning).", "Keywords": ["Breathability", "Flame retardancy", "Moist-electric", "Nanofiber", "Wearable electronics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Renquan", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Separation Membranes and Membrane Processes/National Center for International Joint Research on Separation Membranes, School of Textile Science and Engineering, Tiangong University, Tianjin 300387, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Separation Membranes and Membrane Processes/National Center for International Joint Research on Separation Membranes, School of Textile Science and Engineering, Tiangong University, Tianjin 300387, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Separation Membranes and Membrane Processes/National Center for International Joint Research on Separation Membranes, School of Textile Science and Engineering, Tiangong University, Tianjin 300387, China."}, {"First Name": "Run", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Separation Membranes and Membrane Processes/National Center for International Joint Research on Separation Membranes, School of Textile Science and Engineering, Tiangong University, Tianjin 300387, China."}, {"First Name": "Xupin", "Last Name": "Zhuang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Separation Membranes and Membrane Processes/National Center for International Joint Research on Separation Membranes, School of Textile Science and Engineering, Tiangong University, Tianjin 300387, China.

Zooplankton plays a vital role in the food web of the Southern Ocean and is crucial for maintaining ecosystem stability. Investigating the circumpolar-scale species composition and biodiversity of zooplankton is crucial for ensuring ecosystem-based conservation and management of the Southern Ocean in a changing climate. Here, we utilized eDNA metabarcoding to assess the biodiversity of zooplankton in the surface seawater surrounding the Antarctica based on samples collected during two expeditions spanning from 2021 to 2022. The main purpose of this paper is to provide more baseline information about circumpolar zooplankton biodiversity based on the emerging eDNA metabarcoding tool. This comprehensive approach led to the identification of over 300 distinct zooplankton species, forming a diverse community dominated by Jellyfish, Mollusca and Polychaete. Surprisingly, common dominant taxonomic groups such as krill and copepods in the Southern Ocean did not show high relative abundance (reads) in surface seawater. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlation analysis highlighted that water temperature and chlorophyll a had the most significant impact on the reads and diversity of zooplankton. Notably, the influence of water temperature on zooplankton seemed to be primarily indirect, potentially mediated by its effects on primary productivity. Increasing in primary production might lead to lower zooplankton biodiversity in the Southern Ocean in future. This research underscores the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding as a valuable tool for monitoring zooplankton diversity in open seas. Given the ongoing changes in temperature, sea ice extent and their impact on primary production, our findings lay a crucial foundation for using eDNA techniques to establish long-term biodiversity monitoring programs across extensive marine ecosystems in the future.", "Keywords": ["Biodiversity", "Environmental factors", "Southern ocean", "Zooplankton", "eDNA"], "MeSH terms": ["Zooplankton", "Animals", "Biodiversity", "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic", "Antarctic Regions", "Oceans and Seas", "Seawater"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zishang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Environmental and Safety Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266042, China; Key Laboratory of Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao, 266071, China; Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266071, China; Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao, 266071, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongchao", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "College of Environmental and Safety Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266042, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyue", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao, 266071, China; College of Safety and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China."}, {"First Name": "Yilin", "Last Name": "Ruan", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao, 266071, China; Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266071, China; Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao, 266071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 10049, China."}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Rong", "Affiliation": "College of Ocean and Earth Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao, 266071, China; Laboratory for Marine Ecology and Environmental Science, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266071, China; Center for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao, 266071, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 10049, China.

However, the key fractions in biochars and how they control arsenic transformation remain poorly understood. In this study, a biochar produced from pomelo peel was rich in colloids and was used to evaluate the roles of the colloidal and residual fractions of biochar in arsenic transformation in anoxic paddy soil. Bulk biochar showed a markedly higher maximum adsorption capacity for As(III) at 1732\u00a0mg/kg than for As(V) at 75.7\u00a0mg/kg, mainly because of the colloidal fraction on the surface. When compared with the control and treatments with the colloidal/residual fraction, the addition of bulk biochar facilitated As(V) reduction and release in the soil during days 0-12, but decreased the dissolved As(III) concentration during days 12-20. The colloidal fraction revealed significantly higher electron donating capacity (8.26 \u03bcmole-/g) than that of bulk biochar (0.88 \u03bcmole-/g) and residual fraction (0.65 \u03bcmole-/g), acting as electron shuttle to promote As(V) reduction. Because the colloidal fraction was rich in aliphatic carbon, fulvic acid-like compounds, potassium, and calcium, it favored As(III) adsorption when more As(III) was released, probably via organic-cation-As(III) complexation.

Herein, tissue-engineered cartilage constructs with high cell viability are fabricated from cell-laden gelatin microcarriers (GMs) through Faraday wave bioassembly, a typical acoustic \"bottom-up\" manufacturing process. Assembly modules are first prepared by incorporating cartilage precursor cells, the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5, or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), into GMs. Patterned structures are formed by Faraday wave bioassembly of the cell-laden GMs. Due to the gentle and efficient assembly process and the protective effects of microcarriers, cells in the patterned structures maintain high activity. Subsequently, tissue-engineered cartilage constructs are obtained by inducing cell differentiation of the patterned structures. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted to verify chondrocyte differentiation and the formation of cartilage tissue constructs in terms of cell viability, morphological analysis, gene expression, and matrix production. Finally, implantation studies with a rat cartilage defect model demonstrate that these tissue-engineered cartilage constructs are beneficial for the repair of articular cartilage damage in vivo.

Ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death function independently of the apoptotic machinery, has been accepted as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention; the ferroptosis pathway can enhance cell immune activity of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in HCC. In this study we investigated whether and how bevacizumab regulated ferroptosis and immune activity in liver cancer. Firstly, we performed RNA-sequencing in bevacizumab-treated human liver cancer cell line HepG2 cells, and found that bevacizumab significantly altered the expression of a number of genes including VEGF, PI3K, HAT1, SLC7A11 and IL-9 in liver cancer, bevacizumab upregulated 37 ferroptosis-related drivers, and downregulated 17 ferroptosis-related suppressors in particular. We demonstrated that bevacizumab triggered ferroptosis in liver cancer cells by driving VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/SLC7A11 axis. Clinical data confirmed that the expression levels of VEGF were positively associated with those of PI3K, HAT1 and SLC7A11 in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, we found that bevacizumab enhanced immune cell activity in tumor immune-microenvironment. We identified that HAT1 up-regulated miR-143 targeting IL-9 mRNA 3'UTR in liver cancer cells; bevacizumab treatment resulted in the increase of IL-9 levels and its secretion via VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/miR-143/IL-9 axis, which led to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo through increasing the release of IL-2 and Granzyme B from activated CD8+ T cells. We conclude that in addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms by which bevacizumab synergistically modulates ferroptosis and CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer.", "Keywords": ["HAT1", "IL-9", "bevacizumab", "ferroptosis", "immune activity", "liver cancer"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chun-Yu", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China."}, {"First Name": "Pan", "Last Name": "Lv", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China."}, {"First Name": "Hong-Feng", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China."}, {"First Name": "Li-Na", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu-Fei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui-Hui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China. yangguang@tjmuch.com."}, {"First Name": "Xiao-Dong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Draggability Evaluation and Systematic Translational Medicine, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Digestive Cancer, Department of Gastrointestinal Cancer Biology, Tianjin Cancer Institute, Liver Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, 300060, China. zhangxiaodong@tjmuch.com."}], "Journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "PubDate": "2024May17"}, {"PMID": "38754666", "Title": "Direct electrospinning for producing multiple activity nanofibers consisting of aggregated luteolin/hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin inclusion complex.", "Abstract": "Hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b3CD) inclusion complex nanofibers (Lut/HP\u03b3CD-IC-NF) containing Luteolin (Lut) were prepared by electrospinning technology.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the morphology of Lut/HP\u03b3CD-IC-NF was uniform and bead-free, suggesting that self-assembled aggregates, macromolecules with higher molecular weights, were formed by strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images showed that Lut was distributed in Lut/HP\u03b3CD-IC-NF. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy revealed the change in chemical shift of the proton peak between Lut and HP\u03b3CD, confirming the formation of inclusion complex. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) proved that Lut/HP\u03b3CD-IC-NF had good thermal stability. The phase solubility test confirmed that HP\u03b3CD had a solubilizing effect on Lut. When the solubility of HP\u03b3CD reached 10\u00a0mM, the solubility of Lut increased by 15-fold. The drug loading test showed that the content of Lut in fibers reached 8.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0%. The rapid dissolution experiment showed that Lut/HP\u03b3CD-IC-NF dissolved within 3\u00a0s. The molecular simulation provides three-dimensional evidence for the formation of inclusion complexes between Lut and HP\u03b3CD. Antibacterial experiments showed that Lut/HP\u03b3CD-IC-NF had enhanced antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Lut/HP\u03b3CD-IC-NF exhibited excellent antioxidant properties with a free radical scavenging ability of 89.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0%.

The rat CIVP model was established using a mixture of 5% (w/v) 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and 50% ethanol at a volume ratio of 2:1 via enema. Rats in the moxibustion group received herb-partitioned moxibustion at Tianshu (ST25, bilateral) and Qihai (CV6) points. The abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR), mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) were adopted for pain behavior observation and pain sensitivity assessment. The circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression profiles were detected using the high-throughput sequencing technique. Relevant databases and bioinformatics analysis methods were used to screen for differentially expressed (DE) RNAs and build a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA (competing endogenous RNA)\u00a0ceRNA regulatory network. The real-time quantitative PCR was employed to verify the sequencing result. CIVP rat models had a significantly higher AWR and lower TWL and MWT than normal rats. Between normal and model rats, there were 103 DE-circRNAs, 16 DE-miRNAs, and 397 DE-mRNAs in the spinal cord. Compared with the model group, the moxibustion group had a lower AWR and higher TWL and MWT; between these two groups, there were 118 DE-circRNAs, 15 DE-miRNAs, and 804 DE-mRNAs in the spinal cord. Two ceRNA networks were chosen to be verified.

Our previous research has shown that exposure to NaAsO2 triggers the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a crucial event in the development of LF. However, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most crucial post-transcriptional modification in liver disease. Nevertheless, the precise function of m6A alteration in triggering HSCs and initiating LF caused by NaAsO2 remains unknown. Here, we found that NaAsO2 induced LF and HSCs activation through TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling, which could be reversed by TGF-\u03b21 knockdown. Furthermore, NaAsO2 treatment enhanced the m6A modification level both in vivo and in vitro. Significantly, NaAsO2 promoted the specific interaction of METTL14 and IGF2BP2 with TGF-\u03b21 and enhanced the TGF-\u03b21 mRNA stability.

Here, this is achieved by cetyltrimethylammonium-chloride (CTAC) assisted in situ metabolic labeling and incorporation of mesoporous SiO2-nanoparticles, dual-loaded with glucose-oxidase and Fe3O4-nanoparticles as cascade-reaction containers, inside bacterial cell walls. First, azide-functionalized d-alanine (D-Ala-N3) was inserted in cell wall peptidoglycan layers of growing Gram-positive pathogens. In Gram-negatives, this could only be achieved after outer lipid-membrane permeabilization, using a low concentration of CTAC. Low concentrations of CTAC had no adverse effect on in vitro blood clotting or hemolysis nor on the health of mice when blood-injected. Next, dibenzocyclooctyne-polyethylene-glycol modified, SiO2-nanoparticles were in situ click-reacted with d-Ala-N3 in bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan layers. Herewith, a two-step cascade-reaction is facilitated inside bacteria, in which glucose-oxidase generates H2O2 at endogenously-available glucose concentrations, while subsequently Fe3O4-nanoparticles catalyze generation of \u2022OH from the H2O2 generated. Generation of \u2022OH inside bacterial cell walls by dual-loaded mesoporous SiO2-nanoparticles yielded more effective in vitro killing of both planktonic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria suspended in 10 % plasma than SiO2-nanoparticles solely loaded with glucose-oxidase. Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterially induced sepsis in mice could be effectively treated by in situ pre-treatment with tail-vein injected CTAC and d-Ala-N3, followed by injection of dual-loaded cascade-reaction containers without using antibiotics. This makes in situ metabolic incorporation of cascade-reaction containers as described attractive for further investigation with respect to the control of other types of infections comprising planktonic bacteria. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In situ metabolic-incorporation of cascade-reaction-containers loaded with glucose-oxidase and Fe3O4 nanoparticles into bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan is described, yielding ROS-generation from endogenous glucose, non-antibiotically killing bacteria before ROS inactivates. Hitherto, only Gram-positives could be metabolically-labeled, because Gram-negatives possess two lipid-membranes. The outer membrane impedes direct access to the peptidoglycan. This problem was solved by outer-membrane permeabilization using a quaternary-ammonium compound. Several studies on metabolic-labeling perform crucial labeling steps during bacterial-culturing that in real-life should be part of a treatment. In situ metabolic-incorporation as described, can be applied in well-plates during in vitro experiments or in the body as during in vivo animal experiments. Surprisingly, metabolic-incorporation proceeded unhampered in blood and a murine, bacterially-induced sepsis could be well treated.", "Keywords": ["Azide-functionalized D-alanine", "Cascade-reaction", "Click chemistry", "Mesoporous nanoparticles", "Sepsis", "metabolic-labeling"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Peptidoglycan", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Sepsis", "Mice", "Nanoparticles", "Silicon Dioxide", "Gram-Positive Bacteria", "Gram-Negative Bacteria"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Polymer Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China; University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Biomaterials & Biomedical Technology, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, 9713 AV Groningen, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Da-Yuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Polymer Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China; University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Biomaterials & Biomedical Technology, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, 9713 AV Groningen, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Polymer Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yijin", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Orthodontics, Hanzeplein 1, 9700 RB Groningen, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Yingli", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials, Ministry of Education, Institute of Polymer Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Henk J", "Last Name": "Busscher", "Affiliation": "University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Biomaterials & Biomedical Technology, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, 9713 AV Groningen, the Netherlands.

Computational methods are promising to assist in difficult biological identification. When building recognition models, these methods rely on non-promoter generation to cope with the lack of real non-promoters. Nevertheless, the factitious significant difference between promoters and non-promoters causes over-optimistic prediction. Moreover, designed for E. coli or B. subtilis, existing methods cannot uncover novel, distinct motifs among cyanobacterial promoters. To address these issues, this work first proposes a novel non-promoter generation strategy called phantom sampling, which can eliminate the factitious difference between promoters and generated non-promoters. Furthermore, it elaborates a novel promoter prediction model based on the Siamese network (SiamProm), which can amplify the hidden difference between promoters and non-promoters through a joint characterization of global associations, upstream and downstream contexts, and neighboring associations w.r.t. k-mer tokens.

Previous studies have suggested that lncRNA PCAT19 is abnormally expressed in NP conduction and affects the occurrence and development of pain. The aim of this study is to analyze the role and mechanism of PCAT19 in NP induced by chronic compressive nerve injury (CCI) in mice. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were applied to establish the CCI model. sh-PCAT19 was intrathecally injected once a day for 5 consecutive days from the second day after surgery. We discovered that PCat19 level was gradually up-regulated with the passage of modeling time. Downregulation of Iba-1-positive expression, M1/M2 ratio of microglia, and pro-inflammatory factors in the spinal cords of CCI-mice after PCat19 knock-downed was observed. Mechanically, the expression of miR-378a-3p was negatively correlated with KDM3A and PCat19. Deletion of KDM3A prevented H3K9me2 demethylation of BDNF promoter and suppressed BDNF expression. Further, KDM3A promotes CCI-induced neuroinflammation and microglia activation by mediating Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) demethylation.

However, vascular structure segmentation in IVUS images has the challenge of structure-dependent distractions. Structure-dependent distractions are categorized into two cases, structural intrinsic distractions and inter-structural distractions. Traditional machine learning methods often rely solely on low-level features, overlooking high-level features. This way limits the generalization of these methods. The existing semantic segmentation methods integrate low-level and high-level features to enhance generalization performance. But these methods also introduce additional interference, which is harmful to solving structural intrinsic distractions. Distraction cue methods attempt to address structural intrinsic distractions by removing interference from the features through a unique decoder. However, they tend to overlook the problem of inter-structural distractions. In this paper, we propose distraction-aware hierarchical learning (DHL) for vascular structure segmentation in IVUS images. Inspired by distraction cue methods for removing interference in a decoder, the DHL is designed as a hierarchical decoder that gradually removes structure-dependent distractions. The DHL includes global perception process, distraction perception process and structural perception process. The global perception process and distraction perception process remove structural intrinsic distractions then the structural perception process removes inter-structural distractions. In the global perception process, the DHL searches for the coarse structural region of the vascular structures on the slice of IVUS sequence. In the distraction perception process, the DHL progressively refines the coarse structural region of the vascular structures to remove structural distractions. In the structural perception process, the DHL detects regions of inter-structural distractions in fused structure features then separates them. Extensive experiments on 361 subjects show that the DHL is effective (e.g., the average Dice is greater than 0.95), and superior to ten state-of-the-art IVUS vascular structure segmentation methods.", "Keywords": ["Distraction cue", "Distraction-aware hierarchical learning", "Intravascular ultrasound", "Myocardial bridge", "Side branch", "Vascular structure segmentation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Ultrasonography, Interventional", "Machine Learning", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhao", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, 518055, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Heye", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, 518055, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhifan", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, 518055, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "William Kongto", "Last Name": "Hau", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Bioengineering Department and Imperial-X, Imperial College London, W12 7SL London, UK; Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton Hospital, SW3 6NP London, UK; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, SW7 2AZ London, UK; School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London, WC2R 2LS London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Xiujian", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, 518055, Guangdong, China.

Here, we use molecular phylogeny, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and biochemical characterization to follow the evolution of a specialized group of flavoprotein monooxygenases, the bacterial Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs). These enzymes catalyze an intricate chemical reaction relying on three different elements: a reduced nicotinamide cofactor, dioxygen, and a substrate.

The inefficiency in acquiring gene-edited nuclear donors is attributed to low editing and delivery efficiency, both closely linked to the selection of CRISPR/Cas9 forms. However, there is currently no direct method to evaluate the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 editing in porcine genomes. A platform based on fluorescence reporting signals and micropattern arrays was developed in this study, to visually assess the efficiency of gene editing. The optimal specifications for culturing porcine cells, determined by the quantity and state of cells grown on micropattern arrays, were a diameter of 200\u00a0\u00b5m and a spacing of 150\u00a0\u00b5m. By visualizing the area of fluorescence loss and measuring the gray value of the micropattern arrays, it was quickly determined that the mRNA form targeting porcine cells exhibited the highest editing efficiency compared to DNA and Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) forms of CRISPR/Cas9. Subsequently, four homozygotes of the \u03b24GalNT2 gene knockout were successfully obtained through the mRNA form, laying the groundwork for the subsequent generation of gene-edited pigs.

The molding quality of the prepared TCM gel plaster is evaluated by subjective and objective measures.

By measuring the rheological properties of the plaster, the molding quality of the TCM gel plaster can be predicted, with an accuracy of 83.72% after seven days of modeling and 88.37% after 30 days of modeling. When the parameters such as G' and G\u2033 of the plaster are large, and the [J(t)] is small, the molding quality of the plaster is better. When the plaster coating point is no less than 3, it is difficult to be coated.

Persistent antigen exposure in the tumor microenvironment results in sustained LAG3 expression on T cells, contributing to T cell dysfunction. Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) has been identified as a major ligand of LAG3, and FGL1/LAG3 interaction forms a novel immune checkpoint pathway that results in tumor immune evasion. In addition, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) plays a crucial role in cancer development. In this study we investigated the role of USP7 in modulation of FGL1-mediated liver cancer immune evasion. We showed that knockdown of USP7 or treatment with USP7 inhibitor P5091 suppressed liver cancer growth by promoting CD8+ T cell activity in Hepa1-6 xenograft mice and in HepG2 or Huh7 cells co-cultured with T cells, whereas USP7 overexpression produced the opposite effect. We found that USP7 upregulated FGL1 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells by deubiquitination of transcriptional factor PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1), which transcriptionally activated FGL1, and attenuated the CD8+ T cell activity, leading to the liver cancer growth. Interestingly, USP7 could be transcriptionally stimulated by PRDM1 as well in a positive feedback loop. P5091, an inhibitor of USP7, was able to downregulate FGL1 expression, thus enhancing CD8+ T cell activity. In an immunocompetent liver cancer mouse model, the dual blockade of USP7 and LAG3 resulted in a superior antitumor activity compared with anti-LAG3 therapy alone. We conclude that USP7 diminishes CD8+ T cell activity by a USP7/PRDM1 positive feedback loop on FGL1 production in liver cancer; USP7 might be a promising target for liver cancer immunotherapy.",

Herein, we achieved the cascade morphological transformation and surface engineering of a nucleobase-containing polymeric glycovesicle through exploiting the bioinspired complementary multiple hydrogen bonds of complementary nucleobases. First, the synthesized thymine-containing glycopolymers (PGal30-b-PTAm249) are capable of self-assembling into well-defined glycovesicles. Several kinds of amphiphilic adenine-containing block copolymers with neutral, positive, and negative charges were synthesized to engineer the glycovesicles through the multiple hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymine. A cascade of morphological transformations from vesicles to ruptured vesicles with tails, to worm-like micelles, and finally to spherical micelles were observed via continuously adding the adenine-containing polymer into the thymine-containing glycovesicles. Furthermore, the surface charge properties of these glyconano-objects can be facilely regulated through incorporating various adenine-containing polymers.

We focused on participants' perception of the time, effort, and energy-intensiveness of cancer care activities, organization of care requirements, and preferences in how to manage the logistic burdens of their cancer care. Participant interview transcripts were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. Burdens related to travel, appointment schedules, healthcare system navigation, and consequences for relationships had roots both at the system-level (e.g. labs that were chronically delayed, protocol-centered rather than patient-centered bureaucratic requirements) and in individual circumstances (e.g. greater stressors among those working and/or have young children versus those who are retired) that determined subjective burdensomeness, which was highest among patients who experienced multiple sources of burdens simultaneously. Our study illustrates how objective burdens of cancer care translate into subjective burden depending on patient circumstances, emphasizing that to study burdens of care, an exclusive focus on objective measures does not capture the complexity of these issues.

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology is a widely employed tool for generating gene-edited pigs. Nevertheless, delivering CRISPR/Cas9 to pre-implantation embryos has traditionally posed challenges due to its reliance on intricate micromanipulation equipment and specialized techniques, resulting in high costs and time-consuming procedures. This study aims to introduce a novel one-step approach for generating genetically modified pigs by transducing CRISPR/Cas9 components into pre-implantation porcine embryos through oviductal injection of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV). Methods: We first used rAAV-1, rAAV-6, rAAV-8, rAAV-9 expressing EGFP to screen for rAAV serotypes that efficiently target porcine embryos, and then, to achieve efficient expression of CRISPR/Cas9 in vivo for a short period, we packaged sgRNAs targeting the GHR genes to self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV), and Cas9 proteins to single-stranded adeno-associated virus (ssAAV). The efficiency of porcine embryos -based editing was then validated in vitro. The feasibility of this one-step method to produce gene-edited pigs using rAAV-CRISPR/Cas9 oviductal injection into sows within 24\u00a0h of conception was then validated. Results: Our research firstly establishes the efficient delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 to pig zygotes, both in vivo and in vitro, using rAAV6. Successful gene editing in pigs was achieved through oviductal injection of rAAV-CRISPR/Cas9.

Laponite (Lap), CyP-loaded mesoporous silica (CyP@MSNs) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO@SiO2) were incorporated into a bioink containing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to fabricate functional scaffolds denoted as C@M/GLU using 3D bioprinting technology. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, the composite scaffold has demonstrated a significant enhancement of bone regeneration through the controlled release of silicon (Si) and magnesium (Mg) ions.

To identify genes of PD linked with endoplasmic reticulum stress, we employed random forest (RF) along with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was then used to find associations among diagnostic markers with immune cell penetration. A grand total of 2 stress-related endoplasmic reticulum signature transcripts were identified.

As GBM tumor is aggressive and shows high biological heterogeneity, the overall survival (OS) time is extremely low even with the most aggressive treatment. If the OS time can be predicted before surgery, developing personalized treatment plans for GBM patients will be beneficial. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly used diagnostic tool for brain tumors with high-resolution and sound imaging effects. However, in clinical practice, doctors mainly rely on manually segmenting the tumor regions in MRI and predicting the OS time of GBM patients, which is time-consuming, subjective and repetitive, limiting the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to segment the brain tumor regions in MRI, and an accurate pre-operative prediction of OS time for personalized treatment is highly desired. In this study, we present a multimodal MRI radiomics-based automatic framework for non-invasive prediction of the OS time for GBM patients.

By using in\u00a0vitro, in\u00a0vivo models, and patient datasets, we identified a distinct polarization of the mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism and a fine-tuning of the amino acid uptake in intestinal epithelial cells tailored to support GSH and NADPH metabolism upon ER stress. This metabolic phenotype strongly correlates with IBD severity and therapy response. Mechanistically, we uncover that both chronic ER stress and serine limitation disrupt cGAS-STING signaling, impairing the epithelial response against viral and bacterial infection and fueling experimental enteritis.

For their clinical application, nanoliposomes must be able to realize on-demand release of drugs at disease sites to maximize drug-delivery efficacy and minimize side effects. Therefore, responsive drug-release strategies for inflammation treatment have been explored; however, no specific design has been realized for a responsive drug-delivery system based on pyroptosis-related inflammation. Herein, we report a pioneering strategy for self-adaptive pyroptosis-responsive liposomes (R8-cardiolipin-containing nanoliposomes encapsulating dimethyl fumarate, RC-NL@DMF) that precisely release encapsulated anti-pyroptotic drugs into pyroptotic cells. The activated key pyroptotic protein, the N-terminal domain of gasdermin E, selectively integrates with the cardiolipin of liposomes, thus forming pores for controlled drug release, pyroptosis, and inflammation inhibition. Therefore, RC-NL@DMF exhibited effective therapeutic efficacies to alleviate autoimmune inflammatory damages in zymosan-induced arthritis mice and dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammatory bowel disease mice.

Nevertheless, our understanding of the external and internal factors influencing these dynamics, as well as their spatiotemporal variations, is still limited. In the present study, variations in the social structure of an endangered Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin population in Xiamen Bay, China, were monitored over two distinct periods (2007-2010 and 2017-2019) to analyze the effects of habitat utilization and the composition of individuals within the population. In both periods, the population demonstrated a strikingly similar pattern of social differentiation, characterized by the division of individuals into two main clusters and one small cluster. Spatially, the two primary clusters occupied the eastern and western waters, respectively, although the core distribution area of the eastern cluster shifted further eastward between the two periods. Despite this distribution shift, the temporal stability of the social structure and inter-associations within the eastern cluster remained unaffected.

Herein, a meters-long sheath-core structured carbon nanotube (CNT)/nylon composite yarn muscle is continuously prepared. The nylon core not only reduces the consumption of CNTs but also amplifies the surface area for interaction between the CNT yarn and the electrolyte, leading to an enhanced effective actuation volume. When driven electrochemically, the CNT@nylon yarn muscle demonstrates a maximum contractile stroke of 26.4%, a maximum contractile rate of 15.8% s-1, and a maximum power density of 0.37 W g-1, surpassing pure CNT yarn muscles by 1.59, 1.82, and 5.5 times, respectively.

The Chemistry-Segment Anything Model (ChemSAM) achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly available benchmark datasets and real-world tasks, underscoring its effectiveness in accurately segmenting chemical structures from text-based sources. Moreover, this deep learning-based approach obviates the need for handcrafted features and demonstrates robustness against variations in image quality and style. During the detection phase, a ViT-based encoder-decoder model is used to identify and locate chemical structure depictions on the input page. This model generates masks to ascertain whether each pixel belongs to a chemical structure, thereby offering a pixel-level classification and indicating the presence or absence of chemical structures at each position. Subsequently, the generated masks are clustered based on their connectivity, and each mask cluster is updated to encapsulate a single structure in the post-processing workflow. This two-step process facilitates the effective automatic extraction of chemical structure depictions from documents.

This study aimed to investigate the parametric design method of porous root-shaped implants to reduce the stress-shielding effect and improve the biocompatibility and long-term stability and effectiveness of the implants. Firstly, the porous structure part was parametrically designed, and the control of porosity gradient distribution was achieved by using the fitting relationship between porosity and bias and the position function of bias. In addition, the optimal distribution law of the porous structure was explored through mechanical and hydrodynamic analyses of the porous structure. Finally, the biomechanical properties were verified using simulated implant-bone tissue interface micromotion values. The results showed that the effects of marginal and central porosity on yield strength were linear, with the elastic modulus decreasing from 18.9 to 10.1 GPa in the range of 20-35% for marginal porosity, with a maximum decrease of 46.6%; the changes in the central porosity had a more consistent effect on the elastic modulus, ranging from 18.9 to 15.3 GPa in the range of 50-90%, with a maximum downward shift of 19%. The central porosity had a more significant effect on permeability, ranging from 1.9 \u00d7 10-7 m2 to 4.9 \u00d7 10-7 m2 with a maximum enhancement of 61.2%. The analysis showed that the edge structure had a more substantial impact on the mechanical properties. The central structure could increase the permeability more effectively.

Despite its significance, MRI's principal limitation is the protracted data acquisition time, which hampers broader practical application. Promising deep learning (DL) methods for undersampled magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction outperform the traditional approaches in terms of speed and image quality. However, the intricate inter-coil correlations have been insufficiently addressed, leading to an underexploitation of the rich information inherent in multi-coil acquisitions. In this article, we proposed a method called \"Multi-coil Feature Fusion Variation Network\" (MFFVN), which introduces an encoder to extract the feature from multi-coil MR image directly and explicitly, followed by a feature fusion operation. Coil reshaping enables the 2D network to achieve satisfactory reconstruction results, while avoiding the introduction of a significant number of parameters and preserving inter-coil information. Compared with VN, MFFVN yields an improvement in the average PSNR and SSIM of the test set, registering enhancements of 0.2622\u00a0dB and 0.0021\u00a0dB respectively. This uplift can be attributed to the integration of feature extraction and fusion stages into the network's architecture, thereby effectively leveraging and combining the multi-coil information for enhanced image reconstruction quality.

This study investigated the effect of chitosan and alginate (CH-SA) coating combined with the cell-free supernatant of Streptococcus thermophilus FUA329 (CFS) as a preservative on the quailty of white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) refrigerated at 4\u00b0 for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days. Freshly shrimps were randomly divided into four groups: the CFS group (400 mL); the CH-SA group (1% chitosan/1% alginate); the CFS-CH-SA group (1% chitosan/1% alginate with 400 mL CFS) are treatment groups, and the control group (400 mL sterile water). The CFS-CH-SA coating effectively suppressed microbial growth total viable count and chemical accumulation (pH, total volatile basic nitrogen, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) compared with the control. Additionally, the CFS-CH-SA coating improved the texture and sensory characteristics of shrimp during storage. The coated shrimp exhibited significantly reduced water loss (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The combination of CH-SA coating with CFS treatment can extend the shelf life of shrimp. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Recently, edible films have received more consideration as a promising method to enhance the shelf life of seafood. The presence of Lactic acid bacteria metabolites in edible films reduces spoilage and improves consumer health. Our findings encourage the application of edible coating incorporated with cell-free supernatant of Streptococcus thermophilus FUA 329 to design multifubctional foods and preserve the qualities of shrimp.", "Keywords": ["Streptococcus thermophilus FUA 329", "chitosan", "shelf life", "shrimp", "sodium alginate"], "MeSH terms": ["Food Preservation", "Alginates", "Chitosan", "Streptococcus thermophilus", "Life Expectancy", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shuangshuang", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Yingying", "Last Name": "Bian", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Gewen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyue", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiajin", "Last Name": "Gui", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuting", "Last Name": "Mu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Shu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}, {"First Name": "Yaowei", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Environment, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of food science", "PubDate": "2024Apr"}, {"PMID": "38454120", "Title": "The dual HCK/BTK inhibitor KIN-8194 impairs growth and integrin-mediated adhesion of BTKi-resistant mantle cell lymphoma.", "Abstract": "Although Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (BTKi) have significantly improved patient prognosis, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is still considered incurable due to primary and acquired resistance. We have recently shown that aberrant expression of the Src-family tyrosine kinase hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) in MCL correlates with poor prognosis, and that genetic HCK perturbation impairs growth and integrin-mediated adhesion of MCL cells. Here, we show that KIN-8194, a dual inhibitor of BTK and HCK with in vivo activity against Myd88-L265P-driven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia, has a potent growth inhibitory effect in MCL cell lines and primary MCL cells, irrespective of their sensitivity to BTKi (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib). In BTKi-resistant cells this is mediated by inhibition of HCK, which results in repression of AKT-S6 signaling. In addition, KIN-8194 inhibits integrin-mediated adhesion of BTKi-sensitive and insensitive MCL cells to fibronectin and stromal cells in an HCK-dependent manner. Finally, we show that MCL cells with acquired BTKi resistance retain their sensitivity to KIN-8194.

As the demand for nanocellulose continues to rise and its ease of use becomes apparent, there has been a significant increase in research publications centered on this biomaterial. Nanocellulose, in its different forms, has shown tremendous promise as a tissue engineered scaffold for regeneration and repair. Particularly, nanocellulose-based composites and scaffolds have emerged as highly demanding materials for both soft and hard tissue engineering. Medical practitioners have traditionally relied on collagen and its analogue, gelatin, for treating tissue damage. However, the limited mechanical strength of these biopolymers restricts their direct use in various applications. This issue can be overcome by making hybrids of these biopolymers with nanocellulose. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the recent and most relevant publications focusing on hybrid composites of collagen and gelatin with a specific emphasis on their combination with nanocellulose.

In this study, we discovered a potent and selective ATR degrader. Its kinase-independent regulatory functions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were elucidated using this proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule as a probe. The ATR degrader, 8\u2009i, exhibited significantly different cellular phenotypes compared to the ATR kinase inhibitor 1. Mechanistic studies revealed that ATR deletion led to breakdown in the nuclear envelope, causing genome instability and extensive DNA damage. This would increase the expression of p53 and triggered immediately p53-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway, which was earlier and more effective than ATR kinase inhibition. Based on these findings, the in vivo anti-proliferative effects of ATR degrader 8\u2009i were assessed using xenograft models. The degrader significantly inhibited the growth of AML\u2005cells in vivo, unlike the ATR inhibitor.

However, the absence of comparative studies involving various quantitative ultrasound imaging techniques hinders further clinical exploration. In this study, we simultaneously reconstructed ultrasonic Nakagami imaging, ultrasonic horizontally normalized Shannon entropy (hNSE) imaging, and ultrasonic differential attenuation coefficient intercept (DACI) imaging from ultrasound backscattered envelope data collected during high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation treatment. We comprehensively investigated their performance differences through qualitative and quantitative analyses, including the calculation of contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) for ultrasonic images, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with corresponding indicators, the analysis of lesion area fitting relationships, and computational time consumption comparison. The mean CNR of hNSE imaging was 10.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.48\u00a0dB, significantly surpassing the 3.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.40\u00a0dB (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, statistically significant) of Nakagami imaging and the 2.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0dB (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, statistically significant) of DACI imaging. This substantial difference underscores that hNSE imaging offers the highest contrast resolution for lesion recognition. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of multiple ultrasonic parametric imaging to detect thermal ablation lesions using ROC curves. The area under the curve (AUC) for hNSE was 0.874, exceeding the values of 0.848 for Nakagami imaging and 0.832 for DACI imaging. Additionally, hNSE imaging exhibited the strongest linear correlation coefficient (R\u00a0=\u00a00.92) in the comparison of lesion area fitting, outperforming Nakagami imaging (R\u00a0=\u00a00.87) and DACI imaging (R\u00a0=\u00a00.85). hNSE imaging also performs best in real-time monitoring with each frame taking 6.38\u00a0s among multiple ultrasonic parametric imaging.

China's Heilongjiang Province is the northernmost rice-growing region in the world. However, rice cultivars suitable for growth in low-latitude regions may not mature normally due to their distinct climate and short frost-free period. It is necessary to precisely determine the frost-free period for each region to make the best use of the rice growth stage so as to ensure the maturity and yield of different rice cultivars in Heilongjiang Province. The time span of the heading stage is a key parameter for evaluating the adaptability of a rice cultivar to a specific rice-growing region. Given the above facts, it is of high importance to study the associated genes and sites controlling days to heading (DH) and plant height (PH) of rice in Heilongjiang Province. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) combined with high-throughput sequencing can effectively exclude interferences from background genomic differences, making it suitable for analyzing the associated sites of complex agronomic traits in early generations. Methods: In this study, an F3 segregating population was obtained by crossing two main cultivars that are grown under different temperatures and day-light conditions in Heilongjiang. Two pools of extreme phenotypes were built for the DH and PH of the population. For SNP and InDel variants obtained from whole-genome resequencing in the pools, an association analysis was performed using the Euclidean distance (ED) algorithm and the SNP/InDel index algorithm. Results: The intersection of SNP and InDel regions associated with the phenotypes was considered to obtain the final associated sites. After excluding interferences from the cloned genes on chromosomes 2 and 7, a total length of 6.34\u00a0Mb on chromosomes 1, 3, and 10 and 3.16\u00a0Mb on chromosomes 1 and 10 were left associated with PH and DH, respectively. Then, we performed a gene annotation analysis for candidate genes in the remaining regions using multiple genome annotation databases. Our research provides basic data for subsequent gene mapping and cloning.

However, the goose immune responses to different dryland rearing systems remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate and compare the age-dependent effects of MRS and CRS on the splenic histomorphological characteristics and immune-related genes expression profiles among three economically important goose breeds, including Sichuan White goose (SW), Gang goose (GE), and Landes goose (LD). Morphological analysis revealed that the splenic weight and organ index of SW were higher under CRS than under MRS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Histological observations showed that for SW and LD, the splenic corpuscle diameter and area as well as trabecular artery diameter were larger under MRS than under CRS at 30 or 43\u2009weeks of age (p\u2009<\u20090.05), while the splenic red pulp area of GE was larger under CRS than under MRS at 43\u2009weeks of age (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Besides, at 43\u2009weeks of age, higher mRNA expression levels of NGF, SPI1, and VEGFA in spleens of SW were observed under MRS than under CRS (p\u2009<\u20090.05), while higher levels of HSPA2 and NGF in spleens of LD were observed under MRS than under CRS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). For GE, there were higher mRNA expression levels of MYD88 in spleens under CRS at 30\u2009weeks of age (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, our correlation analysis showed that there appeared to be more pronounced positive associations between the splenic histological parameters and expression levels of several key immune-related genes under MRS than under CRS. Therefore, it is speculated that the geese reared under MRS might exhibit enhanced immune functions than those under CRS, particularly for SW and LD.

In mammals, the core clock genes, CLOCK and BMAL1, are regulated by PERIODs (PERs) and CRYPTOCHROMEs (CRYs), but their roles remain unclear in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. To explore this, we studied P.\u00a0xylostella, which possesses a simplified circadian system compared to mammals. In P.\u00a0xylostella, we observed rhythmic expressions of the Pxper and Pxcry2 genes in their heads, with differing phases. In vitro experiments revealed that PxCRY2 repressed monarch butterfly CLK:BMAL1 transcriptional activation, while PxPER and other CRY-like proteins did not. However, PxPER showed an inhibitory effect on PxCLK/PxCYCLE. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we individually and in combination knocked out Pxper and Pxcry2, then conducted gene function studies and circadian transcriptome sequencing. Loss of either Pxper or Pxcry2 eliminated the activity peak after lights-off in light-dark cycles, and Pxcry2 loss reduced overall activity. Pxcry2 was crucial for maintaining endogenous rhythms in constant darkness. Under light-dark conditions, 1 098 genes exhibited rhythmic expression in wild-type P.\u00a0xylostella heads, with 749 relying on Pxper and Pxcry2 for their rhythms. Most core clock genes lost their rhythmicity in Pxper and Pxcry2 mutants, while Pxcry2 sustained rhythmic expression, albeit with reduced amplitude and altered phase. Additionally, rhythmic genes were linked to biological processes like the spliceosome and Toll signaling pathway, with these rhythms depending on Pxper or Pxcry2 function.

SDs are usually detected using invasive electrocorticography recorded at high sampling frequency. Recent pilot studies suggest a possible utility of scalp electrodes generated electroencephalogram (EEG) for non-invasive SD detection. However, noise and attenuation of EEG signals makes this detection task extremely challenging. Previous methods focus on detecting temporal power change of EEG over a fixed high-density map of scalp electrodes, which is not always clinically feasible. Having a specialized spectrogram as an input to the automatic SD detection model, this study is the first to transform SD identification problem from a detection task on a 1-D time-series wave to a task on a sequential 2-D rendered imaging. This study presented a novel ultra-light-weight multi-modal deep-learning network to fuse EEG spectrogram imaging and temporal power vectors to enhance SD identification accuracy over each single electrode, allowing flexible EEG map and paving the way for SD detection on ultra-low-density EEG with variable electrode positioning. Our proposed model has an ultra-fast processing speed (<0.3 sec). Compared to the conventional methods (2 hours), this is a huge advancement towards early SD detection and to facilitate instant brain injury prognosis.

Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) act as upstream regulators closely linked to heat stress, contributing to their immunosuppressive effects. After an initial examination of transcriptome sequencing data from individual samples, 48 genes displaying interactions were found to potentially be associated with heat stress. Subsequently, to delve deeper into this association, we gathered chicken bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs). We combined heat stress with lipopolysaccharides and utilized a 48 \u00d7 48 Fluidigm IFC quantitative microarray to analyze the patterns of gene changes under various treatment conditions. The results of the study revealed that the combination of heat stress and LPSs in a coinfection led to reduced expressions of CRHR1, MEOX1, and MOV10L1. These differentially expressed genes triggered a pro-inflammatory response within cells via the MAPK and IL-17 signaling pathways. This response, in turn, affected the intensity and duration of inflammation when experiencing synergistic stimulation. Therefore, LPSs exacerbate the immunosuppressive effects of heat stress and prolong cellular adaptation to stress. The combination of heat stress and LPS stimulation induced a cellular inflammatory response through pathways involving cAMP, IL-17, MAPK, and others, consequently leading to decreased expression levels of CRHR1, MEOX1, and MOV10L1.", "Keywords": ["LPS", "chicken bone marrow dendritic cells", "heat stress", "immunosuppression"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyi", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}, {"First Name": "Shutao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}, {"First Name": "Anfang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}, {"First Name": "Lingbin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}, {"First Name": "Haiwei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences, Chongqing 402460, China."}, {"First Name": "Qigui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences, Chongqing 402460, China."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Lan", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China."}], "Journal": "Animals : an open access journal from MDPI", "PubDate": "2024Feb06"}, {"PMID": "38394835", "Title": "Reconstruction of venous drainage with arteriovenous anastomosis for Tamai Zone \u2160 fingertip replantation.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Arteriovenous anastomosis", "Fingertip replantation", "Hand injury", "Venous graft"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Arteriovenous Anastomosis", "Replantation", "Fingers", "Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical", "Drainage", "Finger Injuries", "Amputation, Traumatic", "Anastomosis, Surgical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yujie", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Hand and Foot Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hand and Foot Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China."}, {"First Name": "Yueying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Hand and Foot Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hand and Foot Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.

They possess desirable properties similar to native tissues and organs and exhibit unique advantages in applications. However, fabrication of protein-based hydrogels usually suffers from complex protein mutation and modification or chemical synthesis, which limited the scale and yield of production. Meanwhile, the lack of rationally designed noncovalent interactions in networks may result in a deficiency of the dynamic features of materials. Therefore, a highly efficient method is needed to include supramolecular interactions into protein hydrogel to generate a highly dynamic hydrogel possessing integrated tissue-like properties. Here, we report the design and construction of native protein-based supramolecular synthetic protein hydrogels through a simple and efficient one-pot polymerization of acrylamide and ligand monomers in the presence of a ligand-binding protein. The supramolecular interactions in the network yield integrated dynamic properties, including remarkable stretchability over 10,000% of their original length, ultrafast self-healing abilities within 3-4 s, tissue-like fast stress relaxation, satisfactory ability of adhesion to different living and nonliving substrates, injectability, and high biocompatibility. Furthermore, this material demonstrated potential as a biosensor to monitor small finger movements.

However, compared with chickens and ducks, information about the age- and breed-related changes in the goose spleen remains scarce. In this study, we systematically analyzed and compared the age-dependent changes in the morphological, histological, and transcriptomic characteristics between Landes goose (LG; Anser anser) and Sichuan White goose (SWG; Anser cygnoides). The results showed a gradual increase in the splenic weights for both LG and SWG until week 10, while their splenic organ indexes reached the peak at week 6. Meanwhile, the splenic histological indexes of both goose breeds continuously increased with age, reaching the highest levels at week 30. The red pulp (RP) area was significantly higher in SWG than in LG at week 0, while the splenic corpuscle (AL) diameter was significantly larger in LG than in SWG at week 30. At the transcriptomic level, a total of 1710 and 1266 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between week 0 and week 30 were identified in spleens of LG and SWG, respectively. Meanwhile, a total of 911 and 808 DEGs in spleens between LG and SWG were identified at weeks 0 and 30, respectively. Both GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the age-related DEGs of LG or SWG were dominantly enriched in the Cell cycle, TGF-beta signaling, and Wnt signaling pathways, while most of the breed-related DEGs were enriched in the Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, and metabolic pathways. Furthermore, through construction of protein-protein interaction networks using significant DEGs, it was inferred that three hub genes including BUB1, BUB1B, and TTK could play crucial roles in regulating age-dependent goose spleen development while GRIA2, GRIA4, and RYR2 could be crucial for the breed-specific goose spleen development.

Assessment of multiple prognostic genes by next generation sequencing in AML is standard of care, but the turn-around time often cannot support rapid clinical decision making. Studies in haematological neoplasms suggest p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) correlates with TP53 mutational status, but they have used variable criteria to define TP53 overexpression. p53 IHC was performed and interpreted on AZF-fixed, acid decalcified bone marrow biopsies on 47 cases of clonal myeloid neoplasms with TP53 mutations between 2016 and 2019 and 16 control samples. Results were scored by manual and digital analysis. Most TP53-mutated cases (81%) overexpressed p53 by digital analysis and manual analysis gave similar results. Among the nine TP53-mutated IHC-negative cases, seven (78%) were truncating mutations and two (22%) were single-hit missense mutations. Using a digital cut-off of at least 3% \u22651+ positive nuclei, the sensitivity and specificity are 81% and 100%; cases with loss-of-function mutations were more likely to be negative. In this cohort, p53 immunopositivity correlated with TP53 mutational status, especially missense mutations, with excellent specificity. Truncating TP53 mutations explain most IHC-negative cases, impacting the sensitivity. We demonstrate that p53 IHC can screen for TP53 mutations allowing quicker treatment decisions for most patients. However, not all patients will be identified, so molecular studies are required. Furthermore, cut-offs for positivity vary in the literature, consequently laboratories should independently validate their processes before adopting p53 IHC for clinical use. p53 IHC performs well to screen for TP53 mutations in AZF-fixed bone marrow. Performance in our setting differs from the literature, which shows variability of pre-analytic factors and cut-offs used to screen for TP53 mutations. Each laboratory should validate p53 IHC to screen for TP53 mutations in their unique setting.", "Keywords": ["Acute myeloid leukaemia", "TP53", "immunohistochemistry", "myeloid neoplasms", "next-generation sequencing", "p53"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Bone Marrow", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mutation", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Biopsy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Anderson Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fiona", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuyu", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelsey", "Last Name": "McIntyre", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy K", "Last Name": "Beckman", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew C", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophia L", "Last Name": "Yohe", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

Due to the limited coverage of a single video, the integration of multiple surveillance videos is necessary in practical applications. In the realm of pedestrian management using multiple surveillance videos, continuous pedestrian tracking is quite important.

To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a cross-video pedestrian tracking algorithm, which introduces spatial information. The proposed algorithm introduces the coordinate features of pedestrians in different videos and a linear weighting strategy focusing on the overlapping view of the tracking process. The experimental results show that, compared to traditional methods, the method in this paper improves the success rate of target pedestrian matching and enhances the robustness of continuous pedestrian tracking.

"Abstract": "Marine mammals, especially cetaceans, have evolved a very special form of sleep characterized by unihemispheric slow-wave sleep (USWS) and a negligible amount or complete absence of rapid-eye-movement sleep; however, the underlying genetic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we detected unique, significant selection signatures in basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 2 (BMAL2; also called ARNTL2), a key circadian regulator, in marine mammal lineages, and identified two nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions (K204E and K346Q) in the important PER-ARNT-SIM domain of cetacean BMAL2 via sequence comparison with other mammals. In vitro assays revealed that these cetacean-specific mutations specifically enhanced the response to E-box-like enhancer and consequently promoted the transcriptional activation of PER2, which is closely linked to sleep regulation. The increased PER2 expression, which was further confirmed both in vitro and in vivo, is beneficial for allowing cetaceans to maintain continuous movement and alertness during sleep. Concordantly, the locomotor activities of zebrafish overexpressing the cetacean-specific mutant bmal2 were significantly higher than the zebrafish overexpressing the wild-type gene. Subsequently, transcriptome analyses revealed that cetacean-specific mutations caused the upregulation of arousal-related genes and the downregulation of several sleep-promoting genes, which is consistent with the need to maintain hemispheric arousal during USWS. Our findings suggest a potential close relationship between adaptive changes in BMAL2 and the remarkable adaptation of USWS and may provide novel insights into the genetic basis of the evolution of animal sleep.", "Keywords": ["BMAL2", "USWS", "cetacean evolution", "circadian clock regulation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Locomotion", "Mammals", "Sleep", "Sleep, Slow-Wave", "Zebrafish", "ARNTL Transcription Factors", "Cetacea"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daiqing", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, Guangdong 511458, China."}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Yujie", "Last Name": "Chong", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenhua", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Shixia", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, Guangdong 511458, China."}], "Journal": "Sleep", "PubDate": "2024Apr12"}, {"PMID": "38275420", "Title": "Association between Psoriasis and Renal Functions: An Integration Study of Observational Study and Mendelian Randomization.", "Abstract": "Psoriasis is an autoimmune-mediated disease with several comorbidities in addition to typical skin lesions. Increasing evidence shows the relationships between psoriasis and renal functions, but the relationship and causality remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations and causality between psoriasis and four renal functions, including the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). For the population-based study, we analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from five cycles (2003-2006 and 2009-2014) on psoriasis and renal functions. Subgroup analyses were conducted among different categories of participants. Meanwhile, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study in European populations was also performed using summary-level genetic datasets. Causal effects were derived by conducting an inverse-variance weighted (MR-IVW) method. A series of pleiotropy-robust MR methods was employed to validate the robustness. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was conducted to complement the result when five competing risk factors were considered. A total of 20,244 participants were enrolled in the cross-sectional study, where 2.6% of them had psoriasis. In the fully adjusted model, participants with psoriasis had significantly lower eGFR (p = 0.025) compared with the healthy group. Individuals who are nonoverweight are more likely to be affected by psoriasis, leading to an elevation of BUN (Pint = 0.018). In the same line, TSMR showed a negative association between psoriasis and eGFR (p = 0.016), and sensitive analysis also consolidated the finding. No causality was identified between psoriasis and other renal functions, as well as the inverse causality (p > 0.05). The MVMR method further provided quite consistent results when adjusting five confounders (p = 0.042). We detected a significant negative effect of psoriasis on eGFR, with marginal association between BUN, UACR, and CKD.

The physical objects are scanned in the real world using mobile cameras. All scanned objects are then segmented and labeled by a convolutional neural network and replaced (diminished) by their virtual avatars in a DR environment. We formulate three visual comparison strategies, including filtering, re-grouping, and re-ranking, which can be intuitively, flexibly, and seamlessly performed on their avatars. This approach avoids breaking the original layouts of the physical objects. The computation resources in virtual space can be fully utilized to support efficient object searching and multi-attribute visual comparisons.

Optogenetic activation of VTA glutamatergic terminals in the PL alleviates neuropathic pain, whereas inhibiting these terminals in na\u00efve mice induces pain-like responses. Importantly, this pain-modulating effect is independent of dopamine co-release, as demonstrated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletion. Furthermore, we show that VTA neurons primarily project to excitatory neurons in the PL, and their activation restores PL outputs to the anterior cingulate cortex, a key region involved in pain processing.

To enhance heavy oil recovery efficiency, we developed new star-like branched AM-SSS copolymers (SB-PAMs) with reduction in the viscosity of the heavy oil emulsion, which was synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) controlled radical polymerization. The core structure of the branched polymer was RAFT polymerization of acrylamide (AM) and N,N'-methylene bis-acrylamide (BisAM), in the presence of 3-(((benzylthio)carbonothioyl)thio)propanoic acid as a chain transfer agent, followed by chain extension with AM and SSS. The core structures were achieved by incorporation of total monomer ratios [BisAM]/[AM] of 1:11. The expansion of the core structures by copolymerization of AM and SSS resulted in star-like branched polymer SB-PAM-co-SSS with apparent molecular weights ranging from 240 to 2381 kDa. 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) confirmed the synthesized polymer structure. The molecular weight was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The polydispersity coefficient was between 1 and 7, which has a broad molecular weight distribution. The polymer dissolves only 0.75 h in deionized water, faster than conventional polyacrylamide. At 50 \u00b0C, the viscosity of the 1000 mg/L SB-polymer solution can reach up to 45 mPa\u00b7s. First, heavy oil viscosity reduction by 800 mg/L SB polymer can reach 91.7%, at a water dehydration rate of 90.4%; second, with 0.6 PV injection, 800 mg/L SB polymer improved oil recovery up to 23.66% after water flooding; and third, SB-polymer-assisted hot water flooding shows that heavy oil recovery improved by 19.46% at 110 \u00b0C with 0.6 pore volume (PV) SB-polymer injection.

There is no specific treatment for FXS due to the lack of therapeutic targets. We report here that Elongation Factor 1\u03b1 (EF1\u03b1) forms a complex with two other proteins: Tripartite motif-containing protein 3 (TRIM3) and Murine double minute (Mdm2). Both EF1\u03b1-Mdm2 and EF1\u03b1-TRIM3 protein complexes are increased in the brain of Fmr1 knockout mice as a result of FMRP deficiency, which releases the normal translational suppression of EF1\u03b1 mRNA and increases EF1\u03b1 protein levels. Increased EF1\u03b1-Mdm2 complex decreases PSD-95 ubiquitination (Ub-PSD-95) and Ub-PSD-95-C1q interaction. The elevated level of TRIM3-EF1\u03b1 complex is associated with decreased TRIM3-Complement Component 3 (C3) complex that inhibits the activation of C3. Both protein complexes thereby contribute to a reduction in microglia-mediated phagocytosis and dendritic spine pruning. Finally, we created a peptide that disrupts both protein complexes and restores dendritic spine plasticity and behavioural deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice.

Considering local governments' economic, innovation, talent and environmental protection competition, the paper examined the effects of local government multi-objective competition on the transfer of polluting industries in the region, and tested its spatial spillover effects. The results showed that: 1. Different competitions had different effects on the transfer of polluting industries. Economic competition intensified the transfer of polluting industries, while talent, innovation, and environmental protection competition all restrained it, among which environmental protection competition had the strongest restraining effect. 2. Compared with the transfer of polluting industries, the direction of economic competition and environmental protection competition on the transfer of industries did not change, but the degree of influence was reduced, talent competition instead promoted industrial transfer of the research region to some extent. 3. From the basin level, government competition in the upstream region more obviously intensified the transfer of polluting industries; while from the economic scale level, the restraining effect of government competition in the developed region on the transfer of polluting industries was much stronger. 4.

CNNs achieved performance gains in medical image analysis (MIA) over the last years. CNNs can efficiently model local pixel interactions and be trained on small-scale MI data. Despite their important advances, typical CNN have relatively limited capabilities in modelling \"global\" pixel interactions, which restricts their generalisation ability to understand out-of-distribution data with different \"global\" information. The recent progress of Artificial Intelligence gave rise to Transformers, which can learn global relationships from data. However, full Transformer models need to be trained on large-scale data and involve tremendous computational complexity. Attention and Transformer compartments (\"Transf/Attention\") which can well maintain properties for modelling global relationships, have been proposed as lighter alternatives of full Transformers. Recently, there is an increasing trend to co-pollinate complementary local-global properties from CNN and Transf/Attention architectures, which led to a new era of hybrid models. The past years have witnessed substantial growth in hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models across diverse MIA problems. In this systematic review, we survey existing hybrid CNN-Transf/Attention models, review and unravel key architectural designs, analyse breakthroughs, and evaluate current and future opportunities as well as challenges.

The rs11874392 was found to be related to an elevated risk of rectal cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.73, p\u2009=\u20090.003), but not with colon cancer. FPRP analysis demonstrated that all of these associations were statistically significant (FPRP <0.2). Additionally, rs11874392 was the strongest predictive model for CRC.

However, transfer action recognition is a challenging task, especially since the differentiation of actions seriously affects its recognition speed, robustness, and generalization ability. We propose a novel approach for transfer action recognition assisted by a bidirectional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network combined with a multi-head attention mechanism. Firstly, we utilize posture sensors to detect human movements and establish a lightweight three-dimensional (3D) model of the lower limbs. In particular, we adopt a discrete extended Kalman filter (DEKF) to improve the accuracy and foresight of pose solving. Then, we construct an action prediction model that incorporates a fused Bi-LSTM with Multi-head attention (MHA Bi-LSTM). The MHA extracts key information related to differentiated movements from different dimensions and assigns varying weights. Utilizing the Bi-LSTM network effectively combines past and future information to enhance the prediction results of differentiated actions. Finally, comparisons were made by three subjects in the proposed method and with two other time series based neural network models. The reliability of the MHA Bi-LSTM method was verified. These experimental results show that the introduced MHA Bi-LSTM model has a higher accuracy in predicting posture sensor-based excretory care actions.

Higher THSD7A expression was associated with HTPR in an independent gene expression cohort of clopidogrel treated patients (p = 0.004) and supported by increased gene expression on THSD7A in primary human endothelial cells carrying the risk haplotype. Two SNPs (rs1149515 and rs191786) were validated in the MVP cohort. DGE analysis identified an association with decreased LAIR1 expression to HTPR. LAIR1 knockdown in a MEG-01 cells resulted in increased expression of SYK and AKT1, suggesting an inhibitory role of LAIR1 in the Glycoprotein VI pathway.

We evaluate our approach by predicting genes specific to four cell types and demonstrate that the proposed DiGCellNet outperforms other models that combine node embeddings with traditional machine learning algorithms. Moreover, DiGCellNet successfully identifies CALM1 as a gene specific to beta cell type in T2D cases, and this association is confirmed using an independent dataset.

In this contribution, we report a class of biohybrid glycopolymersome-supported AgNPs, which are capable of effectively killing multidrug-resistant bacteria and disrupting related biofilms. First of all, glycopolymersomes with controllable structures were massively fabricated through reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) in an aqueous solution driven by complementary hydrogen bonding interaction between the pyridine and amide groups of N-(2-methylpyridine)-acrylamide (MPA) monomers. Subsequently, Ag+ captured by glycopolymersomes through the coordination between pyridine-N and Ag+ was reduced into AgNPs stabilized by glycopolymersomes upon addition of the NaBH4 reducing agent, leading to the formation of the glycopolymersome@AgNPs biohybrid. As a result, they showed a wide-spectrum and enhanced removal of multidrug-resistant bacteria and biofilms compared to naked AgNPs due to the easier adhesion onto the bacterial surface and diffusion into biofilms through the specific protein-carbohydrate recognition. Moreover, the in vivo results revealed that the obtained biohybrid glycopolymersomes not only demonstrated an effective treatment for inhibiting the cariogenic bacteria but also were able to repair the demineralization of caries via accumulating Ca2+ through the recognition between carbohydrates and Ca2+. Furthermore, glycopolymersomes@AgNPs showed quite low in vitro hemolysis and cytotoxicity and almost negligible acute toxicity in vivo. Overall, this type of biohybrid glycopolymersome@AgNPs nanomaterial provides a new avenue for enhanced antibacterial and antibiofilm activities and the effective treatment of oral microbial-infected

Results show that STC1 expression is markedly increased in the inflamed colonic mucosa of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and chemically-induced mice colitis models. Evaluation of parthanatos severity and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression shows that intestinal-specific Stc1 knockout (Stc1INT-KO ) mice are resistant to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and exhibit lower disease severity. STC1-overexpressing cells show an increased degree of parthanatos and proinflammatory cytokine expression, whereas STC1-knockout cells show a decreased degree of parthanatos. Co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and proteomic analyses indicate that STC1 interacts with PARP1, which activates the JNK pathway via PARP1-JNK interactions. Moreover, inhibition of PARP1 and JNK alleviates parthanatos and inflammatory injuries triggered by STC1 overexpression. Finally, following restoration of Stc1 and Parp1 expression by adeno-associated viruses, and overexpression of Stc1 and Parp1 aggravated DSS-induced colitis in Stc1INT-KO mice.

The nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidation usually causes severe cell encrustation via chemodenitrification and potentially inhibits bacterial activity due to the blocking effect of secondary minerals. However, it remains unclear how Fe(II) oxidation and subsequent cell encrustation affect the functional genes and bacteria for denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Here, bacteria were enriched from different paddy soils with and without Fe(II) under nitrate-reducing conditions. Fe(II) addition decelerated nitrate reduction and increased NO2- accumulation, due to the rapid Fe(II) oxidation and cell encrustation in the periplasm and on the cell surface. The N2O accumulation was lower in the treatment with Fe(II) and nitrate than that in the treatment with nitrate only, although the proportions of N2O and NH4+ to the reduced NO3- were low (3.25% \u223c 6.51%) at the end of incubation regardless of Fe(II) addition. The dominant bacteria varied from soils under nitrate-reducing conditions, while Fe(II) addition shaped a similar microbial community, including Dechloromonas, Azospira, and Pseudomonas. Fe(II) addition increased the relative abundance of napAB, nirS, norBC, nosZ, and nirBD genes but decreased that of narG and nrfA, suggesting that Fe(II) oxidation favored denitrification in the periplasm and NO2--to-NH4+ reduction in the cytoplasm. Dechloromonas dominated the NO2--to-N2O reduction, while Thauera mediated the periplasmic nitrate reduction and cytoplasmic NO2--to-NH4+ during Fe(II) oxidation. However, Thauera showed much lower abundance than the dominant genera, resulting in slow nitrate reduction and limited NH4+ production.

To this end, investigations into the momentum (q) dispersions of excitons and plasmons in confined geometry are required fundamentally. Due to advancements in momentum-resolved spectroscopy techniques, research on the q-dependent excitons or plasmons in low-dimensional materials is beginning to emerge. However, previous simulations of low-dimensional systems are adversely affected by the artificial vacuum spacing employed in the supercell approximation. Furthermore, the significance of layer thickness in determining the excitonic and plasmonic characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) materials remains largely unexplored in the context of finite q. Therefore, an extensive investigation into the momentum and thickness dependent behaviours of both excitons and plasmons in 2D materials, which are free of the influence of vacuum spacing, is lacking at present. In this article, we develop a restoration procedure to eliminate the influence of vacuum spacing, and obtain a comprehensive picture of momentum and layer thickness dependent excitonic and plasmonic properties of 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2). Our restored simulations are not only found to be in excellent agreement with available experiments, but also elucidate the roles of momentum and layer thickness in the excitonic and plasmonic properties of 2D h-BN and MoS2. We further unveil the dimensionality effect on the dispersion characteristics of excitons and plasmons in h-BN and MoS2.

However, translating between two image modalities presents difficulties due to the complex and non-linear domain mappings. Deep learning-based generative modelling has exhibited superior performance in synthetic image contrast applications compared to conventional image synthesis methods. This survey comprehensively reviews deep learning-based medical imaging translation from 2018 to 2023 on pseudo-CT, synthetic MR, and synthetic PET. We provide an overview of synthetic contrasts in medical imaging and the most frequently employed deep learning networks for medical image synthesis. Additionally, we conduct a detailed analysis of each synthesis method, focusing on their diverse model designs based on input domains and network architectures. We also analyse novel network architectures, ranging from conventional CNNs to the recent Transformer and Diffusion models. This analysis includes comparing loss functions, available datasets and anatomical regions, and image quality assessments and performance in other downstream tasks.

Plant volatiles not only regulate the synthesis and release of sex pheromones in insects, but also help them in the search and orientation of sources of sex pheromones. However, after prolonged exposure to plant volatiles, the changes mediating the mating behavior of diamondback moth (DBM) [Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae)] are unclear. DBMs treated with allyl isothiocyanate, a volatile from cruciferous vegetables, did not show improved rates of mating with a limited effect on mating rhythm. This treatment inhibited mating behaviors in 3-day-old DBMs and decreased mating duration in 5-day-old DBMs. After prolonged exposure to allyl isothiocyanate, the total mating duration of DBM was not significantly different from that after prolonged exposure to n-hexane (control). The longest mating duration after emergence in DBM after prolonged exposure to allyl isothiocyanate was delayed by 1\u00a0day compared with exposure to n-hexane. Prolonged exposure to plant volatiles intensified the response behavior of DBM to sex pheromones. However, the amount of Z11-16: Ald, a major component of the sex pheromone blend exhibited no change in female pheromone glands. Pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide gene (PBAN) was down-regulated in DBMs after prolonged exposure to plant volatiles. These findings suggest that prolonged exposure (6\u00a0h) to plant-derived volatiles have little effect on the mating behavior of DBM.

In rice, the Golgi-localized PHOTOSYNTHESIS-AFFECTED MUTANT 71-LIKE 3 (OsPML3), a member of the UNCHARACTERIZED PROTEIN FAMILY (UPF0016), plays a pivotal role in Mn homeostasis, particularly in rapidly developing tissues. This study focused on the functional characterization of another UPF0016 family member in rice, OsPML4, to elucidate its involvement in Mn homeostasis. OsPML4 had a 73% sequence identity with OsPML3 and exhibited expression in both shoots and roots, albeit at a lower transcriptional level than OsPML3. Furthermore, subcellular localization studies confirmed that OsPML4 localizes in the Golgi apparatus. Notably, heterologous expression of OsPML4 restored growth in the Mn uptake-deficient yeast strain \u0394smf1 under Mn-limited conditions. Under Mn-deficient conditions, OsPML4 knockout exacerbated the decline in shoot dry weight and intensified necrosis in young leaves of OsPML3 knockout lines, which displayed stunted growth. The Mn concentration in OsPML3PML4 double knockout lines was lower than in wild-type (WT) and OsPML3 knockout lines. At the reproductive phase, OsPML3PML4 double knockout lines exhibited reduced fertility and grain yield compared to WT and OsPML3 knockout lines. Notably, reductions were observed in the deposition of cell wall polysaccharides and the content of Lea (Lewis A structure)-containing N-glycans in the young leaves of OsPML3PML4 double knockout lines, surpassing the reductions in WT and OsPML3 knockout lines. These findings underscore the significance of OsPML4 in Mn homeostasis in the Golgi apparatus, where it co-functions with OsPML3 to regulate cell wall polysaccharide deposition and late-stage Golgi N-glycosylation.", "Keywords": ["Cell wall polysaccharides", "Golgi apparatus", "Mn homeostasis", "N-glycosylation", "Rice", "Transporter"], "MeSH terms": ["Manganese", "Oryza", "Golgi Apparatus", "Homeostasis", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Cation Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ending", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, College of Life Science, Nanjing Agriculture University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China; Rice Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, Anhui 230031, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Rice Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, Anhui 230031, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, College of Life Science, Nanjing Agriculture University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China."}, {"First Name": "Peijiang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Rice Research Institute, Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hefei, Anhui 230031, China."}, {"First Name": "Minh Ngoc", "Last Name": "Ha", "Affiliation": "VNU Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials for Green Growth, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Science, Vietnam National University, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam."}, {"First Name": "Quynh", "Last Name": "Mai Le", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Science, Faculty of Biology, University of Science, Vietnam National University, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, College of Life Science, Nanjing Agriculture University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, College of Life Science, Nanjing Agriculture University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, China.

Previously, we synthesized an innovative molecule named dihydrocelastrol (DHCE) from celastrol, a triterpene purified from medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii. Herein, we explore the therapeutic properties and latent signal transduction mechanism of DHCE action in bortezomib (BTZ)-resistant (BTZ-R) MM cells. In this study, we first report that DHCE shows antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo and exerts stronger inhibitory effects than celastrol on BTZ-R cells. We find that DHCE inhibits BTZ-R cell viability by promoting apoptosis via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and suppresses BTZ-R MM cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. In addition, inactivation of JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt pathways are involved in the DHCE-mediated antitumor effect. Simultaneously, DHCE acts synergistically with BTZ on BTZ-R cells. PSMB5, a molecular target of BTZ, is overexpressed in BTZ-R MM cells compared with BTZ-S MM cells and is demonstrated to be a target of STAT3. Moreover, DHCE downregulates PSMB5 overexpression in BTZ-R MM cells, which illustrates that DHCE overcomes BTZ resistance through increasing the sensitivity of BTZ in resistant MM via inhibiting STAT3-dependent PSMB5 regulation.

Fe(II) oxidation was observed in the Cell+NO3-\u00a0+Fe(II), Cell+NO2-\u00a0+\u00a0Fe(II), and NO2-\u00a0+\u00a0Fe(II) treatments, resulting in precipitation of amorphous Fe(III) minerals and lepidocrocite on the surface and in the periplasm of cells. The presence of Fe(II) slightly accelerated microbial NO3- reduction in the Cell+NO3-\u00a0+\u00a0Fe(II) treatment relative to the Cell+NO3- treatment, but slowed down the NO2- reduction in the Cell+NO2-\u00a0+\u00a0Fe(II) treatment relative to the Cell+NO2- treatment likely due to cell encrustation that blocking microbial NO2- reduction in the periplasm. The \u03b415N-N2O results in the Cell+NO3-\u00a0+\u00a0Fe(II) treatment were close to those in the Cell+NO3- and Cell+NO2- treatments, indicating that the accumulative N2O is primarily of biological origin during NRFO. The genome analysis found a complete set of denitrification and oxidative phosphorylation genes in strain LI3T, the metabolic pathways of which were closely related with cyc2 and cytc as indicated by protein-protein interactions network analysis. It is proposed that Fe(II) oxidation is catalyzed by the outer membrane protein Cyc2, with the resulting electrons being transferred to the nitrite reductase NirS via CytC in the periplasm, and the CytC can also accept electrons from the oxidative phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic membrane. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the potential pathways of biological Fe(II) oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction in heterotrophic NRFO bacteria.", "Keywords": ["Chemodenitrification", "Genome", "Iron transformation", "N(2)O isotope", "NRFO"], "MeSH terms": ["Nitrates", "Ferric Compounds", "Nitrites", "Nitrogen Isotopes", "Nitrogen Dioxide", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Bacteria", "Nitrogen", "Ferrous Compounds", "Denitrification"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National-Regional Joint Engineering Research Center for Soil Pollution Control and Remediation in South China, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Integrated Agro-Environmental Pollution Control and Management, Institute of Eco-Environmental and Soil Sciences, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China; Institute of Nanfan & Seed Industry, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510316, China."}, {"First Name": "Rumiao", "Last Name": "Niu", "Affiliation": "SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "National-Regional Joint Engineering Research Center for Soil Pollution Control and Remediation in South China, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Integrated Agro-Environmental Pollution Control and Management, Institute of Eco-Environmental and Soil Sciences, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China."}, {"First Name": "Guoyong", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Dandan", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Siyao", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Tongxu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "National-Regional Joint Engineering Research Center for Soil Pollution Control and Remediation in South China, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Integrated Agro-Environmental Pollution Control and Management, Institute of Eco-Environmental and Soil Sciences, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510650, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaomin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "SCNU Environmental Research Institute, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Chemical Pollution and Environmental Safety & MOE Key Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry of Environment, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.

Insects contain various other nutrients and beneficial compounds, such as lipids, vitamins and minerals, chitin, phenolic compounds, and antimicrobial peptides, which contribute to good health. The practice of insect farming is far more resource-efficient compared to traditional agriculture and animal husbandry, requiring less land, energy, and water, and resulting in a significantly lower carbon footprint. In fact, insects are 12 to 25 times more efficient than animals in converting low-protein feed into protein. When it comes to protein production per unit area, insect farming only requires about one-eighth of the land needed for beef production. Moreover, insect farming generates minimal waste, as insects can consume food and biomass that would otherwise go to waste, contributing to a circular economy that promotes resource recycling and reuse. Insects can be fed with agricultural waste, such as unused plant stems and food scraps. Additionally, the excrement produced by insects can be used as fertilizer for crops, completing the circular chain. Despite the undeniable sustainability and nutritional benefits of consuming insects, widespread acceptance of incorporating insects into our daily diets still has a long way to go.

P. putida ARS1 shows high tolerance to arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)), and exhibits efficient As(V) reduction and As(III) efflux activities. When exposed to 0.6 mg/L As(V), As(V) in the medium was completely converted to As(III) by P. putida ARS1 within 4 hr. Genome sequencing showed that P. putida ARS1 has two chromosomal arsenic resistance gene clusters (arsRCBH) that contribute to efficient As(V) reduction and As(III) efflux, and result in high resistance to arsenicals. Wolffia globosa is a strong arsenic accumulator with high potential for arsenic phytoremediation, which takes up As(III) more efficiently than As(V). Co-culture of P. putida ARS1 and W. globosa enhanced arsenic accumulation in W. globosa by 69%, and resulted in 91% removal of arsenic (at initial concentration of 0.6 mg/L As(V)) from water within 3 days.

Taken together, our results suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress-ROS feedback loop caused by PPAR\u03b1 activation played a crucial role in DEHP-induced apoptosis.

Two subgroups were identified: mild ASD (mASD, n\u2009=\u200937) and severe ASD (sASD, n\u2009=\u200935). Compared to TD, mASD showed increased functional connectivity in the beta band, while sASD exhibited decreased connectivity in the alpha band. Significant between-group differences in global and regional topological abnormalities were found in both alpha and beta bands.

Development of synthetic analogs to mimic such color-changing abilities in the infrared (IR) region is pivotal to a variety of technologies ranging from soft robotics, flexible displays, dynamic thermoregulatory systems, to adaptive IR disguise platforms. However, the integration of tissue-like mechanical properties and rapid IR modulation ability into smart materials remains challenging. Here, by drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we develop an all-soft adaptive IR composite that can dynamically change its IR appearance upon equiaxial stretching.

Driven by externally applied strains, the liquid metal inclusions transition between a contracted droplet state with corrugated surface and an expanded platelet state with relatively smooth surface, enabling dynamic variations in the IR reflectance/emissivity of the composite and ultimately resulting in reversible IR adaption.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can alleviate As phytotoxicity to host plants, but their ecological functions in wetland plants under flooding conditions remain largely unknown. Thus, a pot experiment was conducted using Rhizophagus irregularis and Iris tectorum Maxim. exposed to light (15 and 30\u00a0mg/kg As) and high (75 and 100\u00a0mg/kg As) levels of As, to investigate the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant As tolerance under flooding conditions. The mycorrhizal colonization rates ranged from 31.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.92 % to 60.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.58 %, which were higher than the colonization rate (29.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.60%) before flooding. AMF significantly increased biomass of I. tectorum under light As levels, together with increased phosphorus (P) and As uptake. Moreover, expression of arsenate reductase gene RiarsC and a trace of dimethylarsenic (1.87\u00a0mg/kg in shoots) were detected in mycorrhizal plants, suggesting As transformation and detoxification by AMF exposed to light levels of As. However, under high As levels, AMF inhibited As translocation from roots to shoots, and facilitated the formation of iron plaque. The immobilized As concentrations in iron plaque of mycorrhizal plants were respectively 1133.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0179.17\u00a0mg/kg and 869.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0248.90\u00a0mg/kg at 75 and 100\u00a0mg/kg As addition level, both significantly higher than that in non-inoculated plants. Irrespective of As exposure levels, mycorrhizal symbiosis decreased soil As bioavailability. Overall, the study provides insights into the alleviation of As phytotoxicity in natural wetland plants through mycorrhizal symbiosis, and potentially indicates function diversity of AMF under flooding conditions and As stress, supporting the subsequent phytoremediation and restoration of As-contaminated wetlands.", "Keywords": ["Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi", "Arsenic", "Iris tectorum\u00a0Maxim.", "Iron plaque", "Wetlands"], "MeSH terms": ["Arsenic", "Iris Plant", "Symbiosis", "Mycorrhizae", "Alkaloids", "Iron"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shuping", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}, {"First Name": "Qihui", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}, {"First Name": "Chuning", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, China."}, {"First Name": "Luhua", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "NUS Environmental Research Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Jinglong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhipeng", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.

Understanding the distribution of Caragana species' responses to climate change is increasingly relevant to the dynamic of shrub encroachment. In this study, we gathered 1124 geographical distribution records for 5 Caragana species. Through principal component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, 11 environmental variables were identified. We employed the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and utilized the current and future climate dataset from 2041 to 2060 based on two extreme climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) and atmospheric circulation models (BCC_CSM1.1 and IPSLCM5A-LR) to assess the potential distribution patterns and dynamic change with global warming. The results showed the following: (1) Currently, the five Caragana species are mainly distributed in the central and western parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Mongolia, and the southern parts of Russia. (2) In the future, the habitable zone of C. microphylla and C. korshinskii will expand gradually, while the distribution probability of C. stenophylla, C. tibetica, and C. pygmaea will shrink significantly in 60-80% of the area, and the habitable area will fluctuate sharply.

Participants aged 3 months to 2 years with a primary diagnosis of IESS were recruited and assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Both treatment groups received a combination of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4 ) for 2 weeks, and the treatment group also received melatonin (3\u2009mg) between 20:00 and 21:00 daily, 0.5-1\u2009h before bedtime. The study's primary endpoint was the average reduction rate in spasm frequency assessed by seizure diaries. Secondary endpoints included assessment of the response rate, EEG hypsarrhythmia (Kramer score), and psychomotor development (Denver Developmental Screening Test, DDST). Sleep quality was assessed by using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ), the Infant Sleep Assessment Scale (ISAS), and actigraphy. Safety parameters were also evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted on intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. The trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (ChiCTR2000036208). Out of 119 screened patients, 70 were randomized and 66 completed treatments. In the intention-to-treat population, there were no significant differences in the average percentage reduction of spasm frequency (median [interquartile range, IQR: Q3-Q1], 100% [46.7%] vs. 66.7% [55.3%], p\u2009=\u2009.288), the 3-day response rate (51.4% vs. 37.1%, p\u2009=\u2009.229), the 28-day response rate (42.9% vs. 28.6%, p\u2009=\u2009.212), EEG Kramer scores (2 [3.5] vs. 2 [3], p\u2009=\u2009.853), or DDST comprehensive months (5 [2.5] vs. 6 [6], p\u2009=\u2009.239) between the melatonin (n\u2009=\u200935) and placebo (n\u2009=\u200935) groups. However, caregivers reported improved sleep quality after melatonin treatment, with 85.7% reporting regular sleep compared to 42.9% with placebo (42.9%, p\u2009<\u2009.001).

Moreover, the median (IQR) value of sleep-onset latency was shortened by 6.0 (24.5)\u2009min after melatonin treatment, while that in the placebo group was extended by 3.0 (22.0)\u2009min\u00a0(p\u2009=\u2009.030). The serum melatonin (6:00\u2009h) level (pg/mL) of the children in the melatonin group after treatment was significantly higher than in the placebo group (median [IQR], 84.8 [142] vs. 17.5\u00a0[37.6], p\u2009<\u2009.001). No adverse effects related to melatonin were observed in the study, and there were no significant differences in adverse effects between the melatonin and placebo groups.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this efficient wound healing remains underexplored. To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind wound healing in cetaceans, we investigated the evolutionary patterns of 37 wound healing-related genes in representative mammals. We found wound healing-related genes experience adaptive evolution in cetaceans: (1) Three extrinsic coagulation pathway-related genes-tissue factor (F3), coagulation factor VII (F7), and coagulation factor X (F10)-are subject to positive selection in cetaceans, which might promote efficient hemostasis after injury; positive selection in transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-\u03b22), transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-\u03b23), and platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGFD), which play immunological roles in wound healing, may help cetaceans enhance inflammatory response and tissue debridement. (2) Coagulation factor XII (F12) is the initiation factor in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. It had a premature stop codon mutation and was subjected to selective stress relaxation in cetaceans, suggesting that the early termination of F12 may help cetaceans avoid the risk of vascular blockage during diving. (3) Fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) and FIII, which were detected to contain the specific amino acid substitutions in marine mammals, indicating similar evolutionary mechanisms might exist among marine mammals to maintain strong wound-healing ability. Thus, our research provides further impetus to study the evolution of the wound healing system in cetaceans and other marine mammals, extending knowledge of preventing coagulation disorder and atherosclerosis in humans.", "Keywords": ["adaptive evolution", "coagulation", "habitat differences", "marine mammals", "wound healing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jieqiong", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Long", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Boxiong", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenqi", "Last Name": "Rong", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shixia", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenhua", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China."}], "Journal": "Integrative zoology", "PubDate": "2023Oct27"}, {"PMID": "37895761", "Title": "Samarium-Doped Lead Magnesium Niobate-Lead Titanate Ceramics Fabricated by Sintering the Mixture of Two Different Crystalline Phases.", "Abstract": "The fabrication method plays a key role in the performance of lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate-based ceramics.

The substantial costs incurred by the citrus industry as a consequence of this disease have spurred considerable interest in the combined control of D. citri using insecticides and natural enemies. However, the successful implementation of such integrated pest management strategies is dependent on ensuring the compatibility of using natural enemies in the presence of insecticides. In this regard, we evaluated the lethal and sublethal effects of flupyradifurone on Orius strigicollis (Poppius) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae), an important predatory biological control agent, in which we assessed the risk of exposure to flupyradifurone under both in- and off-field scenario. The median lethal rate (LR50) value of flupyradifurone against O. strigicollis (9.089\u00a0g a.i. ha-1), was found to be significantly lower than the maximum field recommended rate (MFRR, 170\u00a0g a.i. ha-1). Additionally, at 0.254\u00a0g a.i. ha-1, flupyradifurone was established to significantly prolong the developmental duration of O. strigicollis from the first to third instar nymphs. Although we detected no significant difference in the survival of immature O. strigicollis subjected to 0.064\u00a0g a.i. ha-1 and control treatments, survival was significantly lower in 0.127 and 0.254\u00a0g a.i. ha-1 treatments. Moreover, whereas there were no significant differences in adult longevity between the 0.127\u00a0g a.i. ha-1 and control treatments, we recorded a significant reduction in fecundity. Furthermore, there were reductions in peak life expectancy, reproductive value, finite rate of increase, intrinsic rate of increase, and net reproduction rate in response to exposure to increasing flupyradifurone rate. Additionally, at 0.127\u00a0g a.i. ha-1, the mean generation time was significantly longer than that under control conditions. Following simulated exposure to flupyradifurone for 100 days, population of O. strigicollis in the 0.064\u00a0g a.i. ha-1 and control treatments were found to be significantly larger than those exposed to 0.127\u00a0g a.i. ha-1. On the basis on LR50 evaluations, whereas the risk of exposure risk was unacceptable for O. strigicollis under in-field scenario, it remained acceptable off-field. Nonetheless, the sublethal effect of prolonged exposure to residual flupyradifurone could pose an unacceptable off-field risk to O. strigicollis (e.g., in adjacent habitats). Consequently, the effects of different flupyradifurone exposure scenarios on O. strigicollis should be thoroughly assessed, and reducing the dosage of flupyradifurone could be advantageous for the control of D. citri when combine with augmentative release of O. strigicollis.", "Keywords": ["Acute toxicity", "Asian citrus psyllid", "Compatibility", "Flower bugs", "Sublethal effect"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Heteroptera", "Biological Control Agents", "Insecticides", "Citrus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Fujian Engineering Research Center for Green Pest Management, Fujian Key Laboratory for Monitoring and Integrated Management of Crop Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou 350013, China; Fuzhou Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Crop Pests of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Fujian 350013, China; State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, Institute of Applied Ecology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"First Name": "Yaqing", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Fujian Engineering Research Center for Green Pest Management, Fujian Key Laboratory for Monitoring and Integrated Management of Crop Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou 350013, China; Fuzhou Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Crop Pests of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Fujian 350013, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinfeng", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Fujian Engineering Research Center for Green Pest Management, Fujian Key Laboratory for Monitoring and Integrated Management of Crop Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou 350013, China; Fuzhou Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Crop Pests of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Fujian 350013, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenhua", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Fujian Engineering Research Center for Green Pest Management, Fujian Key Laboratory for Monitoring and Integrated Management of Crop Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou 350013, China; Fuzhou Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Crop Pests of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Fujian 350013, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Fujian Engineering Research Center for Green Pest Management, Fujian Key Laboratory for Monitoring and Integrated Management of Crop Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou 350013, China; Fuzhou Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Crop Pests of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Fujian 350013, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, Institute of Applied Ecology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Ecological Pest Control for Fujian and Taiwan Crops, Institute of Applied Ecology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"First Name": "Guocheng", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Fujian Engineering Research Center for Green Pest Management, Fujian Key Laboratory for Monitoring and Integrated Management of Crop Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou 350013, China; Fuzhou Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Crop Pests of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Fujian 350013, China.

Moderate growth targets foster innovation in green technology, while aggressive ones encourage investment in fixed assets and new city growth, impeding performance.

However, there are limitations in the currently available diagnostic approaches for UCEC. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in regulating biological processes as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in tumors. To study the potential of lncRNAs as non-invasive diagnostic tumor markers, RNA-sequencing dataset of UCEC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to identify differentially expressed genes. A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was constructed by differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs and miRNAs. Pathway enrichment and functional analysis for the mRNAs in the constructed ceRNA network provide the direction of future research for UCEC by demonstrating the most affected processes and pathways. Seven potential lncRNA biomarkers (C20orf56, LOC100144604, LOC100190940, LOC151534, LOC727677, FLJ35390, LOC158572) were validated in UCEC patients by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, LOC100190940 and LOC158572 were identified as novel RNA molecules with unknown functions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the combined 7 lncRNAs had a high diagnostic value for UCEC patients with area under curve (AUC) of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.875-0.947).

Utilizing real-time PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gene prediction, we revealed shifts in bacterial community structure and function at three Cr exposure levels. Our results showed that the bacterial abundance in all eight soil types was influenced by Cr to varying extents, with yellow\u2012brown soil being the most sensitive. The bacterial community composition of different soil types exhibited diverse responses to Cr, with only the relative abundance of Proteobacteria decreasing with increasing Cr concentration across all soil types. Beta diversity analysis revealed that while Cr concentration impacted the assembly process of bacterial communities to a certain extent, the influence on the compositional structure of bacterial communities was primarily driven by soil type rather than Cr concentration. The study also identified biomarkers for each soil type under three Cr levels, offering a basis for monitoring changes in Cr pollution. By predicting crucial functional genes related to Cr transformation, it was observed that the relative abundance of chrA (chromate transporter) in yellow\u2012brown soil significantly exceeded that in all other soil types, suggesting its potential for Cr adaptation.

In this work, we aim to explore the functional role of NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 1 (NFE2L1) in OSCC progression. Based on databases analysis, we found that NFE2L1 was overexpressed in OSCC tumor tissues, and elevated NFE2L1 level induced poor prognosis of OSCC patients. Our results showed that NFE2L1 is upregulated in OSCC cells and overexpression of NFE2L1 promotes cell proliferation, and reduces the sensitivity of OSCC cells to erastin-induced ferroptosis. NFE2L1 upregulation decreased the levels of Fe2+, lipid reactive oxygen species and content of malondialdehyde, and increased the level of the key negative regulator of ferroptosis, GPX4 and SLC7A11. In NFE2L1 suppressed cells, these trends were reversed. Further results of dual luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that NFE2L1 could bind to the promoter of Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP) to increase the transcriptional activity of HJURP, thus upregulating its expression. Inhibition of HJURP attenuated the proliferation and ferroptosis inhibition in NFE2L1 upregulated cells. In vivo tumorigenicity assay further proved that NFE2L1 promotes OSCC tumor growth. In summary, NFE2L1 restrains ferroptosis by transcriptionally regulating HJURP and participates in the progress of OSCC.

In DF1 cell lines of chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF1 cells) the expression levels of LncIRF1, IRF7, IRF1, and IFN\u03b2 increased when ALV-J infection. Similarly, after LncIRF1 overexpression and the ALV-J challenge, the expression levels of IRF1, IRF7, and IFN\u03b2 increased, while increased LncIRF1 inhibited the proliferation of DF1 cells. Interference with LncIRF1 did not affect IRF1, IRF7, and IFN\u03b2. However, expression levels of IRF1, IRF7, and IFN\u03b2 decreased due to LncIRF1 interference after the ALV-J challenge.

Through the synergistic application of integrated differential phase contrast, in situ transmission electron microscopy characterizations, and computational simulations, a method is unveiled for homogenizing dislocation pinning in NiCoCr multi-principal element alloy (MPEA) through the introduction of a high concentration of oxygen atoms with high diffusion mobility. The doping of massive oxygen atoms creates a high density of strong local pinning points for dislocation motion. Notably, oxygen interstitials exhibit remarkable diffusion and mobility across different octahedral and tetrahedral sites within the distorted crystal lattice of NiCoCrO alloy, even at room temperature. The capability allows for the release of severe stress concentrations arising from dislocation entanglement and the establishment of new strong local pinning points at alternative locations in a uniform way, enabling the material with high strength and outstanding deformability.

Ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) has been identified as a non-Rel subunit of NF-\u03baB. However, the detailed biological roles of RPS3 remain unclear. Here, we report for the first time that RPS3 is necessary for MM survival and drug resistance. RPS3 was highly expressed in MM, and knockout of RPS3 in MM inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of RPS3 mediated the proteasome inhibitor resistance of MM and shortened the survival of MM tumor-bearing animals. Moreover, our present study found an interaction between RPS3 and the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13 (TRIP13), an oncogene related to MM tumorigenesis and drug resistance. We demonstrated that the phosphorylation of RPS3 was mediated by TRIP13 via PKC\u03b4, which played an important role in activating the canonical NF-\u03baB signaling and inducing cell survival and drug resistance in MM. Notably, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling by the small-molecule inhibitor targeting TRIP13, DCZ0415, was capable of triggering synergistic cytotoxicity when combined with bortezomib in drug-resistant MM. This study identifies RPS3 as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in MM.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "NF-kappa B", "Multiple Myeloma", "Proteasome Inhibitors", "Ribosomal Proteins", "Bortezomib", "Drug Resistance", "Cell Line, Tumor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gege", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Xuejie", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Xinyan", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Yingcong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Dandan", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Shuaikang", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Ke", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Guanli", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203."}, {"First Name": "Zhijian", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203."}, {"First Name": "Yumeng", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Huaping", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Ting", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Dongliang", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Xiaosong", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Huabin", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200072."}, {"First Name": "Weiliang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; State Key Laboratory of Drug Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203. wlzhu@simm.ac.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jumei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200120. shijumei@tongji.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Haematologica", "PubDate": "2024Apr01"}, {"PMID": "37764364", "Title": "Insights on Antitumor Activity and Mechanism of Natural Benzophenanthridine Alkaloids.", "Abstract": "Benzophenanthridine alkaloids are a class of isoquinoline compounds, which are widely found in the plants of papaveraceae, corydalis, and rutaceae.

Thereafter, the influence of the eccentric ratios and the wall thickness factors on the mechanical behavior and failure characteristics of both the eccentrically loaded and axially loaded columns was comprehensively analyzed. Finally, prediction formulas for the ultimate load of the columns under eccentric compression were proposed, and a comprehensive comparison of the ultimate loads between the predicted values and experimental values was also conducted. The results indicated that the typical failure characteristics of the eccentrically loaded columns presented lateral deflection together with buckling, while the axially compressed columns displayed expansion and rupture at local positions. Moreover, the ultimate loads of the eccentrically loaded columns decreased by 43.0% and 34.5% in comparison to the columns under axial compression, with the wall thickness factor decreasing from 116.7 to 46.7, respectively. Meanwhile, the ratios of the ultimate loads calculated using design codes to the tested values were in the range of 0.70~0.90, which demonstrated that the design codes could predict the ultimate loads conservatively. Additionally, the ratios of the ultimate loads calculated using the proposed formulas to the tested values were within the range of 0.99~1.08, implying that the proposed formulas were more accurate than the design codes. At the same time, the initial stiffness of the columns under eccentric compression was correspondingly lower than that of the columns undergoing axial compression. The lateral deflections along the height of the columns were almost symmetrical at different loading levels.

Chitosanase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of chitosan, can cleave \u03b2-1,4 linkages to produce COS. In this study, a chitosanase-producing Bacillus paramycoides BP-N07 was isolated from marine mud samples. The chitosanase enzyme (BpCSN) activity was 2648.66 \u00b1 20.45 U/mL at 52 h and was able to effectively degrade chitosan. The molecular weight of purified BpCSN was approximately 37 kDa. The yield and enzyme activity of BpCSN were 0.41 mg/mL and 8133.17 \u00b1 47.83 U/mg, respectively. The optimum temperature and pH of BpCSN were 50 \u00b0C and 6.0, respectively. The results of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of chitosan treated with BpCSN for 3 h showed that it is an endo-chitosanase, and the main degradation products were chitobiose, chitotriose and chitotetraose. BpCSN was used for the preparation of oligosaccharides: 1.0 mg enzyme converted 10.0 g chitosan with 2% acetic acid into oligosaccharides in 3 h at 50 \u00b0C. In summary, this paper reports that BpCSN has wide adaptability to temperature and pH and high activity for hydrolyzing chitosan substrates.

Thirteen major cell types were identified at E16 in Ujumqin sheep, and eight major cell types were identified at E16 in Hulunbuir short-tailed sheep. Function enrichment analysis showed that several pathways were significantly enriched in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, the Hippo signaling pathway, the platelet activation pathway, the riboflavin metabolism pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and the insulin signaling pathway in the notochord cluster. Glutathione metabolism, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism, the citrate cycle, thyroid hormone synthesis, pyruvate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, thermogenesis, and the VEGF signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the spinal cord cluster. Steroid biosynthesis, riboflavin metabolism, the cell cycle, the Hippo signaling pathway, the Hedgehog signaling pathway, the FoxO signaling pathway, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and the Wnt signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the paraxial mesoderm cluster. The notochord cluster, spinal cord cluster, and paraxial mesoderm cluster were found to be highly associated with tail development.

However, the joint effects of combined utilization of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal inoculum, which are considered as two promising remediation strategies of soil heavy metal pollutions, on plant Cr resistance are still poorly understood. In this study, a two-factor pot experiment was conducted to investigate how biochar and AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis regulate Medicago sativa growth, physiological trait, nutrient and Cr uptake, relevant gene expressions, soil properties, and Cr speciation, independently or synergistically. The results showed that biochar notably decreased AM colonization, while biochar and AM fungus could simultaneously increase plant dry biomass. The greatest growth promotion was observed in mycorrhizal shoots at the highest biochar level (50\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1 soil) by 91 times. Both biochar application and AM fungal inoculation enhanced plant photosynthesis and P nutrition, but the promoting effects of AM fungus on them were significantly greater than that of biochar. In addition, the combined application of biochar and AM fungus dramatically reduced shoot and root Cr concentrations by up to 92\u00a0% and 78\u00a0%, respectively, compared to the non-amended treatment. Meanwhile, down-regulated expressions were observed for metal chelating-related genes. Furthermore, Cr translocation from roots to shoots was reduced by both two soil amendments. Transcriptional levels of genes involved in reactive oxygen species and proline metabolisms were also regulated by biochar application and AM fungal colonization, leading to alleviation of Cr phytotoxicity. Furthermore, AM fungal inoculation slightly elevated soil pH but decreased plant-available soil P, which was, by contrast, lifted by biochar addition. The combined application reduced soil acid-extractable Cr concentration by 40\u00a0%.

The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays an essential role in the process of NASH. However, the mechanism by which arsenic promotes NLRP3 expression remains unclear. Three-month NaAsO2 gavage led to the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway activation and NASH. Additionally, NaAsO2 upregulated the level of Filamin A (FLNA) and pyroptosis, thereby activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in SD rat liver. Using FLNA siRNA, NASH-associated inflammation and pyroptosis were clearly mitigated by reducing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, arsenic treatment facilitated activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and promoted p-p65 translocation into the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (Ch-IP) assay indicated that FLNA promoted p65 binding to the NLRP3 gene and upregulated the transcription of NLRP3, ultimately leading to pyroptosis and NASH. Our findings indicate that FLNA and pyroptosis are strongly associated with NASH induced by NaAsO2. Collectively, the findings of this study indicated that FLNA mediates NF-\u03baB signaling pathway-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and ultimately activates pyroptosis and NASH upon NaAsO2 exposure.

Peroxisome proliferator \u03b3-activated receptor coactivator 1-\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is essential for glucose metabolism as well as for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it was unclear whether there is a regulatory connection between PGC-1\u03b1 and ferroptosis. Besides, the definitive mechanism of arsenic-induced hepatic IR progression remains to be determined. Here, we found that hepatic insulin sensitivity impaired by sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) could be reversed by inhibiting ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we found that PGC-1\u03b1 suppression inhibited the protein expression of glutathione s-transferase kappa 1 (GSTK1) via nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), thereby increasing ROS accumulation and promoting ferroptosis. Furthermore, we showed that NaAsO2 induced hepatic IR and ferroptosis via methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) and YTH domain-containing family protein 2 (YTHDF2)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) of PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA. In conclusion, NaAsO2-mediated PGC-1\u03b1 suppression was m6A methylation-dependent and induced ferroptosis via the PGC-1\u03b1/NRF1/GSTK1 pathway in hepatic IR.

In order to overcome these challenges, Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) was developed in recent work but primarily for natural image classification and showed inferior segmentation results. In this paper, we proposed a region-based EDL segmentation framework that can generate reliable uncertainty maps and accurate segmentation results, which is robust to noise and image corruption. We used the Theory of Evidence to interpret the output of a neural network as evidence values gathered from input features. Following Subjective Logic, evidence was parameterized as a Dirichlet distribution, and predicted probabilities were treated as subjective opinions. To evaluate the performance of our model on segmentation and uncertainty estimation, we conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset.

In this study, offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography-ion mobility-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (2D-LC/IM-QTOF-MS) was used to analyze the different parts of G. longipes obtained from Shaanxi province, China. By combining the retention times, mass fragments, collision cross-section values, reference standards, and information concerning literature compounds, 396 components were identified from the three parts of the plant, including 94 groups of isomers, and 217 components were identified or tentatively identified as new compounds. In the rhizomes, leaves, and stems, 240, 220, and 168 compounds, respectively, were identified. Differential analysis of the compounds in the rhizomes and aerial parts was also carried out, and 36 differential components were identified, of which 32 had higher contents in the rhizomes.

In recent years, new methods have extended the reach of pulmonary airway segmentation that is closer to the limit of image resolution. Since EXACT'09 pulmonary airway segmentation, limited effort has been directed to the quantitative comparison of newly emerged algorithms driven by the maturity of deep learning based approaches and extensive clinical efforts for resolving finer details of distal airways for early intervention of pulmonary diseases. Thus far, public annotated datasets are extremely limited, hindering the development of data-driven methods and detailed performance evaluation of new algorithms. To provide a benchmark for the medical imaging community, we organized the Multi-site, Multi-domain Airway Tree Modeling (ATM'22), which was held as an official challenge event during the MICCAI 2022 conference. ATM'22 provides large-scale CT scans with detailed pulmonary airway annotation, including 500 CT scans (300 for training, 50 for validation, and 150 for testing). The dataset was collected from different sites and it further included a portion of noisy COVID-19 CTs with ground-glass opacity and consolidation. Twenty-three teams participated in the entire phase of the challenge and the algorithms for the top ten teams are reviewed in this paper. Both quantitative and qualitative results revealed that deep learning models embedded with the topological continuity enhancement achieved superior performance in general.

Therefore, developing a fast and non-destructive method is essential for rapid and large-scale seed viability detection and is of great significance for agriculture, breeding, and germplasm preservation. In this study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology was used to obtain images and spectral information of maize seeds with different aging stages. To reduce data input and improve model detection speed while obtaining more stable prediction results, successive projections algorithm (SPA) was used to extract key wavelengths that characterize seed viability, then key wavelength images of maize seed were divided into small blocks with 5 pixels \u00d75 pixels and fed into a multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) for further optimizing the discrimination possibility of single-seed viability. The final discriminant result of single-seed viability was determined by comprehensively evaluating the result of all small blocks belonging to the same seed with the voting algorithm. The results showed that the multi-scale 3DCNN model achieved an accuracy of 90.67% for the discrimination of single-seed viability on the test set. Furthermore, an effort to reduce labor and avoid the misclassification caused by human subjective factors, a YOLOv7 model and a Mask R-CNN model were constructed respectively for germination judgment and bud length detection in this study, the result showed that mean average precision (mAP) of YOLOv7 model could reach 99.7%, and the determination coefficient of Mask R-CNN model was 0.98.

Grazing affects land cover and soil structure, with consequence on slope runoff generation and soil water recharge. Little attention has been paid to the effects of rainfall on soil water recharge caused by grazing. In this study, we examined land covers and soil water contents under different grazing intensities (G1-G5: 2.2, 3.0, 4.2, 6.7, 16.7 sheep\u00b7hm-2) and no grazing sites (NG), aiming to analyze soil water recharge under natural rainfall conditions after grazing. The results showed that grazing exerted significant effects on vegetation and biocrust coverage. The vegetation coverage was decreased by 8.3%-16.4% under G1-G5 grazing, while the biocrust coverage was increased by 106.9% under G2 grazing compared to NG. The soil surface roughness under G1-G5 grazing was increased by 53.1%-152.5%, and the thickness of biocrust was decreased by 24.1% under G5. Soil wetting front velocity decreased with increasing rainfall intensity, and that of 0-5 cm layer under the G2 grazing intensity decreased by 60.0% to 83.3% under rainfall between 18.0 mm and 70.3 mm compared to NG. The effect of grazing on soil wetting front velocity was significantly related to biocrust coverage and soil bulk density of 0-5 cm soil layer.

Methods: Herein, we identified key genes relevant to CRC metabolism through a comprehensive analysis of lactate metabolism-related genes from GSEA MsigDB, employing univariate Cox regression analysis and random forest algorithms. Clinical prognostic analysis was performed following identification of three key genes, and consistent clustering enabled the classification of public datasets into three patterns with significant prognostic differences. The molecular pathways and tumor microenvironment (TME) of these patterns were then investigated through correlation analyses. Quantitative PCR was employed to quantify the mRNA expression levels of the three pivotal genes in CRC tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing data and fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry were utilized to analyze relevant T cells and validate the correlation between key genes and CD4+ T cells. Results: Our analysis revealed that MPC1, COQ2, and ADAMTS13 significantly stratify the cohort into three patterns with distinct prognoses. Additionally, the immune infiltration and molecular pathways were significantly different for each pattern. Among the key genes, MPC1 and COQ2 were positively associated with good prognosis, whereas ADAMTS13 was negatively associated with good prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data illustrated that the relationship between three key genes and T cells, which was further confirmed by the results of fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrating a positive correlation between MPC1 and COQ2 with CD4+ T cells and a negative correlation between ADAMTS13 and CD4+ T cells.

If the problem of poor water resistance is solved, this material could be substituted for cement and other traditional energy-consuming cementitious materials in the construction industry. This approach would confer important economic and environmental benefits while promoting the resource utilization of phosphogypsum (PG). In this study, hydrophobic and self-cleaning coatings of H-PDMS/PMHS/OTS hybrid nanosilica were prepared on a post-hydroxylated PG surface using sol-gel and impregnation methods. The water contact angle, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Three-dimensional surface morphology and roughness analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, surface abrasion tests, and tape adhesion tests were used to evaluate the hydrophobicity of the coatings. The results demonstrated that the in situ reaction produced a hydrophobic siloxane/nanosilica hybrid network that bonded to the PG surface via hydrogen bonding, making the otherwise completely hydrophilic PG hydrophobic (PGH-3, contact angle (CA) = 144.1\u00b0). The PGH-3 sample exhibited excellent chemical stability, maintaining a contact angle greater than 135\u00b0 under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions. The contact angle remained at 123.7\u00b0 after 50 tape-bonding tests. After 100 wear cycles, the contact angle remained at 121.9\u00b0. This study presents an environmentally friendly method and a straightforward application procedure to impart hydrophobicity to solid waste PG.

In this work, a pulsed thermoreflectance imaging (PTI) method is proposed, which combines the transient temperature mapping of thermoreflectance thermal imaging with transient pulsed excitation. By executing merely three transient tests, six thermophysical properties, including the film thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, the substrate thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, the film-substrate thermal boundary resistance, and the equivalent thermal conductivity of the insulating layer, can be simultaneously measured in a heterostructure sample. The proposed method applies a pulsed current excitation to a metal heater line on the sample surface and utilizes the thermoreflectance thermal imaging system to measure the temperature of different spatial regions on the sample surface at different time windows. The temporal and spatial variation information of the temperature field is then extracted and combined with finite element method inversion calculation to obtain the thermophysical properties of heterostructures. To validate the accuracy and reliability of this method, we conducted measurements on a GaN-on-SiC heterostructure sample and obtained thermophysical properties consistent with the representative literature data that have previously been reported.

However, few functional PCR genes have been well-characterized in plants. In this study, we identified and cloned 26 BnPCR genes from the rapeseed (Brassica napus) genome. They were divided into four groups (I-IV) based on their phylogenetic relationship. Yeast functional complementation experiments showed that BnPCRs can transport copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) in yeast. The expression levels of the BnPCRs were variable among different organs. Moreover, most of the genes were induced by Cu2+ and Cd2+ stress. Among these genes, BnPCR10.1 was highly expressed in various organs and induced by Cu2+ and Cd2+. Therefore, we studied the function of BnPCR10.1 in more detail. BnPCR10.1 was localized to the plasma membrane (PM), and expression in yeast enhanced yeast cells to export Cu and Cd. Furthermore, overexpression of BnPCR10.1 transgenic lines pro35S::BnPCR10.1;athma5 had lower concentration of Cu in roots than athma5 mutants. In addition, transgenic plants pro35S::BnPCR10.1;atpdr8 had lower concentration of Cd in shoots and roots than atpdr8 mutants. Net Cu2+ and Cd2+ efflux assay showed that there was decreased absorption of Cu2+ and Cd2+ in the transgenic Arabidopsis elongation zone of roots than in athma5 and atpdr8 mutants, respectively. These results provide new information on BnPCRs and their roles in response to heavy metals and reveal the mechanism used by BnPCR10.1 to detoxify Cu and Cd.

Here, we took Handan, a PM2.5 polluted city in northern China, as the research object and analyzed ARGs in PM2.5 in winter (January) from 2013 to 2017. The results showed that the abundance of ARGs was the highest in 2013 (3.7 \u00d7 10-2 copies/16S rRNA), and ARGs were positively correlated with air quality index (AQI) (r = 0.328, P < 0.05) and PM2.5 concentration (r = 0.377, P = 0.020 < 0.05) in the 5-year period. The ARGs carried by PM2.5 in four functional regions of sewage treatment plant, steel works, university, and park showed that sul1 and qepA had higher abundance in each functional region, and the total ARG abundance in sewage treatment plant (1.3 \u00d7 10-1 copies/16S rRNA) was the highest, while lowest in park (2.0 \u00d7 10-3 copies/16S rRNA). Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) model were used to trace the pollutants at the sampling points, which indicated that the surrounding cities contributed more than quarter to the sampling points. Therefore, regional transportation reduces the spatial distribution difference of ARGs in PM2.5. The exposure dose of ARGs in different functional regions illustrated that the total inhaled dose of ARGs in sewage treatment plant (1.7 \u00d7 105 copies/d) was the highest, while lowest in park (3.2 \u00d7 104 copies/d).

Here, we systemically studied the influence of disulfide crosslinking on the in vitro and in vivo performance of integrin-targeting micellar docetaxel (t-MDTX). Of note, t-M5DTX with a high disulfide content was clearly advantageous in terms of stability, intracellular drug release, anti-tumor activity toward \u03b1V\u03b23-overexpressing A549 cells, blood circulation and therapeutic efficacy in orthotopic A549-luc lung tumor-bearing mice. t-MDTX induced extraordinary tumor targetability with tumor-to-normal tissue ratios of 1.7-8.3. Further studies indicated that t-M5DTX could effectively eradicate \u03b1V\u03b23-overexpressing lung and prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX), in which ca. 80% mice became tumor-free. This integrin-targeting disulfide-crosslinked micellar docetaxel emerges as a promising actively targeted nanoformulation for tumor therapy.

In addition to PEGylation and ligand selection, particle size, stability and drug release behavior are also critical to their performance in vivo.

Luciferase assay demonstrated that RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) was the target gene for miR-22-3p. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that miR-22-3p suppressed the cell migration and EMT via downregulation of RAC1 because the inhibitory effect of miR-22-3p on cell migration and EMT of NSCLC cells was reversed by RAC1 overexpression. Based on these novel data, the miR-22-3p/RAC1 axis may be an alternative target in the therapeutic intervention of NSCLC.", "Keywords": ["EMT", "Luciferase assay", "Lung cancer", "Migration", "RAC1", "miR-22-3p"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Lung Neoplasms", "Cell Movement", "MicroRNAs", "rac1 GTP-Binding Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xuejiao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, Baqiao District, Xinsi Road 569, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaobin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, Baqiao District, Xinsi Road 569, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, Baqiao District, Xinsi Road 569, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhipei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, Baqiao District, Xinsi Road 569, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Nianlin", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, Baqiao District, Xinsi Road 569, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. xienianlin@126.com."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Medical University, Baqiao District, Xinsi Road 569, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. guang83731yg@sina.com."}], "Journal": "Functional & integrative genomics", "PubDate": "2023Aug25"}, {"PMID": "37619725", "Title": "A quaternary ammonium salt grafted tannin-based flocculant boosts the conjugative transfer of plasmid-born antibiotic resistance genes: The nonnegligible side of their flocculation-sterilization properties.", "Abstract": "This study developed dual-function tannin-based flocculants, namely tannin-graft-acrylamide-diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (TGCC-A/TGCC-C), endowed with enhanced flocculation-sterilization properties. The impacts of these flocculants on proliferation and transformation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacteria during the flocculation-deposition process were examined. TGCC-A/TGCC-C exhibited remarkable flocculation capacities towards both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, encompassing a logarithmic range of initial cell density (108-109\u00a0CFU/mL) and a broad pH spectrum (pH\u00a02-11). The grafted quaternary ammonium salt groups played pivotal parts in flocculation through charge neutralization and bridging mechanisms, concurrently contributing to sterilization by disrupting cellular membranes. The correlation between flocculation and sterilization entails a sequential progression, where an excess of TGCC, initially employed for flocculation, is subsequently consumed for sterilization purposes. The frequencies of ARGs conjugative transfer were enhanced in bacterial flocs across all TGCC treatments, stemming from augmented bacterial aggregation and cell membrane permeability, elicited stress response, and up-regulated genes encoding plasmid transfer. These findings underscore the indispensable role of flocculation-sterilization effects in mediating the propagation of ARGs, consequently providing substantial support for the scientific evaluation of the environmental risks associated with flocculants in the context of ARGs dissemination during the treatment of raw water featuring high bacterial density.", "Keywords": ["Antibiotic resistance genes", "Conjugative transfer", "Flocculation", "Sterilization", "Tannin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "College of Agricultural Science and Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing 210098, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jialin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resources Development on Shallow Lakes of Ministry of Education, College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing 210098, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Guoxiang", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Regulation and Resources Development on Shallow Lakes of Ministry of Education, College of Environment, Hohai University, Nanjing 210098, People's Republic of China.

However, the causes and underlying mechanism of this clinical observation remain largely unknown. One possible explanation is linked to microbiota dysbiosis, a condition that has been associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether gut microbiota dysbiosis can be transmitted from AD individuals to non-AD individuals and contribute to the development of AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. We, therefore, set out to perform both animal studies and clinical investigation by co-housing wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice, analyzing microbiota via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, measuring short-chain fatty acid amounts, and employing behavioral test, mass spectrometry, site-mutations and other methods. The present study revealed that co-housing between wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice or administrating feces of AD transgenic mice to wild-type mice resulted in AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment in the wild-type mice. Gavage with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium restored these changes in the wild-type mice. The oral and gut microbiota of AD patient partners resembled that of AD patients but differed from healthy controls, indicating the transmission of microbiota. The underlying mechanism of these findings includes that the butyric acid-mediated acetylation of GSK3\u03b2 at lysine 15 regulated its phosphorylation at serine 9, consequently impacting Tau phosphorylation. Pending confirmative studies, these results provide insight into a potential link between the transmission of AD-associated microbiota dysbiosis and development of cognitive impairment, which

Subsequently, we identified that the N-terminal region of FGF13A was essential for its nucleolus location and interaction with NPM1. Furthermore, we found that FGF13A inhibited the generation of nascent ribosomal RNA and suppressed the migration and invasion of BC cells through its N-terminal region.

Although they have high theoretical specific capacities (>300 mA h/g) and moderate operating voltages (\u223c3.5 V vs Li/Li+), DRX cathodes typically require a high carbon content (up to 30 wt %) to fully utilize the active material which has a detrimental impact on cell-level energy density. To assess pathways to reduce the electrode's carbon content, the present study investigates how the carbon's microstructure and loading (10-20 wt %) influence the performance of DRX cathodes with the nominal composition Li1.2Mn0.5Ti0.3O1.9F0.1. While electrodes prepared with conventional disordered carbon additives (C65 and ketjenblack) exhibit rapid capacity fade due to an unstable cathode/electrolyte interface, DRX cathodes containing 10 wt % graphite show superior cycling performance (e.g., reversible capacities \u223c260 mA h/g with 85% capacity retention after 50 cycles) and rate capability (\u223c135 mA h/g at 1000 mA/g). A suite of characterization tools was employed to evaluate the performance differences among these composite electrodes. Overall, these results indicate that the superior performance of the graphite-based cathodes is largely attributed to the: (i) formation of a uniform graphitic coating on DRX particles which protects the surface from parasitic reactions at high states of charge and (ii) homogeneous dispersion of the active material and carbon throughout the composite cathode which provides a robust electronically conductive network that can withstand repeated charge-discharge cycles. Overall, this study provides key scientific insights on how the carbon microstructure and electrode processing influence the performance of DRX cathodes. Based on these results, exploration of alternative routes to apply graphitic coatings is recommended to further optimize the material performance.", "Keywords": ["carbon additives", "cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX)", "coating", "high capacity", "lithium-ion battery cathodes"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shripad", "Last Name": "Patil", "Affiliation": "Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Education, University of Tennessee Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, United States."}, {"First Name": "Krishna Prasad", "Last Name": "Koirala", "Affiliation": "Physical and Computational Sciences Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Crafton", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, United States."}, {"First Name": "Wan-Yu", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bryan D", "Last Name": "McCloskey", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chongmin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jagjit", "Last Name": "Nanda", "Affiliation": "Applied Energy Division, SLAC National Laboratory, 2575 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ethan C", "Last Name": "Self", "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2023Aug23"}, {"PMID": "37558707", "Title": "Unreprogrammed H3K9me3 prevents minor zygotic genome activation and lineage commitment in SCNT embryos.", "Abstract": "Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can be used to reprogram differentiated somatic cells to a totipotent state but has poor efficiency in supporting full-term development. H3K9me3 is considered to be an epigenetic barrier to zygotic genomic activation in 2-cell SCNT embryos. However, the mechanism underlying the failure of H3K9me3 reprogramming during SCNT embryo development remains elusive. Here, we perform genome-wide profiling of H3K9me3 in cumulus cell-derived SCNT embryos. We find redundant H3K9me3 marks are closely related to defective minor zygotic genome activation. Moreover, SCNT blastocysts show severely indistinct lineage-specific H3K9me3 deposition. We identify MAX and MCRS1 as potential H3K9me3-related transcription factors and are essential for early embryogenesis. Overexpression of Max and Mcrs1 significantly benefits SCNT embryo development. Notably, MCRS1 partially rescues lineage-specific H3K9me3 allocation, and further improves the efficiency of full-term development. Importantly, our data confirm the conservation of deficient H3K9me3 differentiation in Sertoli cell-derived SCNT embryos, which may be regulated by alternative mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Several therapeutic treatments, including sorafenib and regorafenib, have only modestly improved survival in patients with HCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profiles and the regulation of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) of the sorafenib-related target genes in HCC. Based on clinical information and expression profiles of HCC clinical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed and identified. Sorafenib-associated DEGs (SADs) were obtained by intersecting the DEGs with the sorafenib target genes from SuperTarget database. The expression patterns of SADs were verified in the Oncomine database. The biological functions of the SADs were annotated by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In addition, a ceRNA network associated with SADs was constructed. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in network that were significantly associated with overall survival were identified as prognosis of patients by Cox regression analysis. Finally, the expression levels of prognostic genes in HCC tissues and cell lines were verified using qRT-PCR. Gene expression differential analysis yielded a total of 146 common DEGs were obtained, including 21 upregulated and 125 downregulated DEGs. Among them, ten SADs were detected to be differentially expressed between tumor and normal tissues, including AXL, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, FGFR2, GMNN, PDGFRA, and TTK. GSEA analysis grouped them into three categories by function. The first category (CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) and second category (GMNN, TTK and EGER2) had the opposite roles in the enriched terms and pathways, while the third class (AXL and PDGFRA) has enrichment terms and pathways that intersect with those of the first and second categories. A ceRNA network associated with SADs was also constructed including 49 lncRNAs, 14 miRNAs, and 8 mRNAs. Three of these lncRNAs, SNHG7, GAS5 and HCP5, were found upregulated in HCC tissues and to be independent predictors in HCC patients. Significant correlations were found in expression between the prognostic lncRNAs and SADs. Ten SADs were systematically identified using expression data from HCC and normal tissues from TCGA and GEO datasets. GSEA analysis provided us with insight into the function of SADs. In the future, we will continue to explore the mechanisms of coordinated regulation of SADs-related prognostic lncRNAs and SADs at the ceRNA axis level and their potential functions in the development of HCC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Liver Neoplasms", "Sorafenib", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9", "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "MicroRNAs", "Gene Expression", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhi", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "General Surgery Center, Capital Medical University Youan Hospital, 100069 Beijing, P.R.

Since the evaporation of metals involves the interaction of driving forces such as vapor back pressure, surface tension, and gravity, the movement of the melt pool is not stable. At the same time, it also produces vaporization products such as vapor plumes and sprays, which cause defects such as bubbles, porosity, lack of fusion, inclusions, etc., during the manufacturing process of the parts, affecting the performance and manufacturing quality of the parts. More and more researchers are using imaging technologies, such as high-speed X-ray, high-speed visible light cameras, and high-speed schlieren imaging, to perform noncontact visual measurements and analyses of the melt pool, vapor plume, and spatter during the metal evaporation process, and the results show that the metal evaporation process can be suppressed by optimizing the process parameters and changing the processing atmosphere, thereby reducing part defects and improving part performance and built part quality.

As these sweeteners can lead to the shift of anaerobic microbiota in the gut similar to that caused by antibiotics, we hypothesize that they may have an antibiotic-like impact on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in anaerobic digestion. However, current understanding on this topic is scarce. This investigation aimed to examine the potential impact of acesulfame, a typical artificial sweetener, on ARGs in anaerobic digestion by using metagenomics sequencing and qPCR. It was found that acesulfame increased the number of detected ARG classes and the abundance of ARGs during anaerobic digestion. The abundance of typical mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and the number of potential hosts of ARGs also increased under acesulfame exposure, suggesting the enhanced potential of horizontal gene transfer of ARGs, which was further confirmed by the correlation analysis between absolute abundances of the targeted ARGs and MGEs. The increased horizontal dissemination of ARGs may be associated with the SOS response induced by the increased ROS production, and the increased cellular membrane permeability.

In this study, we investigated the function of HSPA8 in the development of liver cancer. By analyzing the TCGA transcriptome dataset, we found that HSPA8 was upregulated in 134 clinical liver cancer tissue samples, and positively correlated with poor prognosis. IHC staining showed the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of HSPA8 in liver cancer cells. Knockdown of HSPA8 resulted in a decrease in the proliferation of HepG2 and Huh-7 cells. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis revealed that HSPA8 bound to the promoter of pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2 (PHLDA2) and regulated its expression. The transcription factor ETV4 in HepG2 cells activated PHLDA2 transcription. HSPA8 and ETV4 could interact with each other in the cells and colocalize in the nucleus. From a functional perspective, we demonstrated that HSPA8 upregulated PHDLA2 through the coactivating transcription factor ETV4 to enhance the growth of liver cancer in vitro and in vivo. From a therapeutic perspective, we identified both HSPA8 and PHDLA2 as novel targets in the treatment of HCC.

In this study, the vertical pattern and driving factors of element concentrations in alpine soils of the Tibetan Plateau were investigated. Three snow mountains (Meili, Baima, and Haba) part of the Hengduan Mountain range, were selected as the study area to determine the vertical distribution of 12 typical elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ca, Sr, As, and Se) in topsoil with increasing and decreasing elevation, as well as the dominant driving factors of their spatial heterogeneity. Results showed that all elements, except Se, showed strong vertical heterogeneity, among which Cr, Ni, Cu, and Fe showed peak concentrations at 2700-3000\u00a0m; the highest concentrations of Mn and Zn were at 3200\u00a0m and 2700\u00a0m, with Cd and Pb at 2500\u00a0m. Ca and Sr levels gradually decreased with increasing elevation. According to the structural equation model and random forest analysis, the vertical heterogeneity of soil elements is directly regulated by the variability of climate and soil properties due to changes in elevation. A three-way PERMANOVA further quantized the contributions of climate and soil properties on vertical heterogeneity of all soil elements, which were 35.2\u00a0% and 50.5\u00a0%, respectively.

"Chronic neuroinflammation has been regarded as an important part of the pathological initiation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is associated with the regulation of microglial activation. Preventing microglial activation to inhibit neuroinflammation may become a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Guizhi Fuling capsule (GZFL) has a strong repression on inflammatory responses. Here, the presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, were divided into: WT mice (WT), WT mice+GZFL (WT+GZFL), PS cDKO mice (cDKO), and PS cDKO mice+GZFL (cDKO+GZFL). Mice in the WT+GZFL and cDKO+GZFL group were fed standard chow containing 2000 ppm GZFL for 90 days. After 60 days of GZFL treatment, mice were given to behavioral tests for 30 days in order to explore the effects of GZFL on cognitive and motor function. Then, mice were sacrificed for examining the effects of GZFL on inflammation. Furthermore, primary microglia were obtained from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and pretreated with or without GZFL (50 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 h in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) stimulation to speculate whether the underlying mechanism of GZFL's anti-inflammatory potential was closely associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that GZFL has the ability to alleviate memory deficits in PS cDKO mice, which attributes to the improvement of neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, GZFL could inverse the tau hyperphosphorylation and the lessened expression of synaptic proteins in hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Furthermore, GZFL prevented LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses in primary microglia by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. It is noteworthy that therapeutic effects of GZFL on memory impairment are depended on the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses by the blockage of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, GZFL may be an effective compound Chinese medicine for the improvement and postponement of neurodegenerative progression in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Guizhi Fuling capsule", "JAK2/STAT3 pathway", "memory deficits", "microglial activation", "neuroinflammation"], "MeSH terms": ["Rats", "Mice", "Animals", "Mice, Knockout", "Microglia", "Wolfiporia", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Lipopolysaccharides", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Janus Kinase 2", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Alzheimer Disease", "Inflammation", "Memory Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuting", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Xingyu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Zongtao", "Last Name": "Ba", "Affiliation": "School of Rehabilitation Science, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Reaila", "Last Name": "Ahelijiang", "Affiliation": "School of Rehabilitation Science, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinjuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Waimao", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yining", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "School of Rehabilitation Science, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianmei", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Integrative Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37460894", "Title": "MRI radiomics for brain metastasis sub-pathology classification from non-small cell lung cancer: a machine learning, multicenter study.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately distinguish between different histologic types of brain lesions in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) when it is not safe or feasible to perform a biopsy.

Mice were subjected to the Barnes maze and fear conditioning tests to determine their learning and memory from 2 weeks after the surgery. We found that surgery increased FPR1 in the brain and proinflammatory cytokines in the blood and brain of wild-type mice. Surgery also impaired their learning and memory. cFLFLF attenuated these effects. Surgery did not induce an increase in the proinflammatory cytokines and impairment of learning and memory in FPR1-/- mice.

Leakage events can be reflected quickly by pressure values, and the deployment of pressure sensors is significant for minimizing the leakage ratio of WDNs. Concerning the restriction of realistic factors, including project budgets, available sensor installation locations, and sensor fault uncertainties, a practical methodology is proposed in this paper to optimize pressure sensor deployment for leak identification in terms of these realistic issues. Two indexes are utilized to evaluate the leak identification ability, that is, detection coverage rate (DCR) and total detection sensitivity (TDS), and the principle is to determine priority to ensure an optimal DCR and retain the largest TDS with an identical DCR. Leakage events are generated by a model simulation and the essential sensors for maintaining the DCR are obtained by subtraction. In the event of a surplus budget, and if we suppose the partial sensors have failed, then we can determine the supplementary sensors that can best complement the lost leak identification ability. Moreover, a typical WDN Net3 is employed to show the specific process, and the result shows that the methodology is largely appropriate for real projects.", "Keywords": ["leak identification", "pressure sensor deployment", "water distribution networks"], "MeSH terms": ["Water", "Water Supply", "Computer Simulation", "Uncertainty"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Tongji University, No. 1239, Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, China."}, {"First Name": "Hai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Tongji University, No. 1239, Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "Journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2023Jun18"}, {"PMID": "37408649", "Title": "Whole-Exome sequencing analysis identified TMSB10/TRABD2A locus to be associated with carfilzomib-related cardiotoxicity among patients with multiple myeloma.", "Abstract": "Proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib (CFZ) is effective in treating patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) but has been associated with cardiovascular adverse events (CVAE) such as hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.

However, incomplete decomposition of straw will cause harm to crop growth and soil quality. Currently, there is a lack of technology to timely monitor the rate of straw decomposition. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the most active organic matter in soil and straw is mainly immersed in the soil in the form of DOM. In order to formulate reasonable straw returning management measures , a timely monitoring method of straw decomposition rate was developed in the study. Three water treatment (60%-65%, 70%-75% and 80%-85% maximum field capacity) and two fertilizer (organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer) were set up in the management of straw returning to the field. Litterbag method was used to monitor the weight loss rate of straw decomposition under different water and fertilizer conditions in strawberry growth stage. The changes of DOM components were determined by three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM). From the faster decomposition period to the slower decomposition period, the main components of DOM changed from protein-like components to humus-like components. At the end of the experiment, the relative content of humus-like components under the treatment of organic fertilizer and moderate water was the highest. Convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with 3D-EEM was used to identify the decomposition speed of straw. The classification precision of neural network validation set and test are 85.7% and 81.2%, respectively. In order to predict the decomposition rate of straw under different water and fertilizer conditions, 3D-EEM data of DOM were used as the input of CNN, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and fluorescence region integral (FRI), and dissolved organic carbon data were used as the input of dissolved organic carbon linear prediction. The prediction model based on CNN had the best effect (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.987).

Electrons flow from a thioredoxin reductase to thioredoxin at the expense of a specific electron donor. Most known thioredoxin reductases rely on NADPH as a reducing cofactor. Yet, in 2016, a new type of thioredoxin reductase was discovered in Archaea which utilize instead a reduced deazaflavin cofactor (F420 H2 ). For this reason, the respective enzyme was named deazaflavin-dependent flavin-containing thioredoxin reductase (DFTR). To have a broader understanding of the biochemistry of DFTRs, we identified and characterized two other archaeal representatives. A detailed kinetic study, which included pre-steady state kinetic analyses, revealed that these two DFTRs are highly specific for F420 H2 while displaying marginal activity with NADPH. Nevertheless, they share mechanistic features with the canonical thioredoxin reductases that are dependent on NADPH (NTRs). A detailed structural analysis led to the identification of two key residues that tune cofactor specificity of DFTRs.

However, conventional designs have been limited by weak ion-yarn muscle interactions and inefficient \"rocking-chair\" ion migration. To address these limitations, we present an electrochemical artificial yarn muscle design driven by a dual-ion co-regulation system. By utilizing two reaction channels, this system shortens ion migration pathways, leading to faster and more efficient actuation. During the charging/discharging process, [Formula: see text] ions react with carbon nanotube yarn, while Li+ ions react with an Al foil. The intercalation reaction between [Formula: see text] and collapsed carbon nanotubes allows the yarn muscle to achieve an energy-free high-tension catch state. The dual-ion coordinated yarn muscles exhibit superior contractile stroke, maximum contractile rate, and maximum power densities, exceeding those of \"rocking-chair\" type ion migration yarn muscles. The dual-ion co-regulation system enhances the ion migration rate during actuation, resulting in improved performance. Moreover, the yarn muscles can withstand high levels of isometric stress, displaying a stress of 61 times that of skeletal muscles and 8 times that of \"rocking-chair\" type yarn muscles at higher frequencies.

While some studies have measured heavy metal concentrations in honeybees, few studies have monitored heavy metal concentrations in wild bees or explored their potential effects on wild bee communities. To investigate the impact of heavy metal pollution on wild bee communities, heavy metal concentrations, including vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) in multiple wild bee species were measured. Multiple wild bee species, including: Xylocopa tranquabaroroum, Eucera floralia, Apis cerana, and small bee mixtures (representing multiple small wild bee species) were sampled from 18 sites in Quzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. The findings demonstrated that there were significant differences in heavy metal concentrations among different bee species. The concentrations of V, Zn, Cd, and Pb in X. tranquabaroroum, the largest bee species in this study, were lower than that in the other three sample groups. Furthermore, there were significant negative correlations between heavy metal pollution and wild bee diversity and species richness, but not with abundance. Particularly, there was no significant relationship between heavy metal pollution and the abundance of small bees. Given these worrying findings, monitoring multiple heavy metals in wild bees should be conducted for protecting wild bee diversity and securing their pollination services.", "Keywords": ["Crop pollination", "Oilseed rape", "Pollinator health", "Wild bee abundance", "Wild bee diversity"], "MeSH terms": ["Bees", "Animals", "Ecosystem", "Farms", "Cadmium", "Lead", "Metals, Heavy", "Pollination", "Zinc"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoyu", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Zoological Systematics and Evolution, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China."}, {"First Name": "Changsheng", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Longping Branch Graduate School, College of Biology, Hunan University, Changsha, 410125, China."}, {"First Name": "Williamson", "Last Name": "Gustave", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Environmental & Life Sciences, University of the Bahamas, New Providence, Nassau, P.O.

Furthermore, data heterogeneity across different centres and pathological abnormalities pose significant challenges to achieving accurate and robust segmentation in distal small airways. Accurate segmentation of airway structures is essential for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung diseases. To address these issues, we propose a patch-scale adversarial-based refinement network that takes in preliminary segmentation and original CT images and outputs a refined mask of the airway structure. Our method is validated on three datasets, including healthy cases, pulmonary fibrosis, and COVID-19 cases, and quantitatively evaluated using seven metrics. Our method achieves more than a 15% increase in the detected length ratio and detected branch ratio compared to previously proposed models, demonstrating its promising performance. The visual results show that our refinement approach, guided by a patch-scale discriminator and centreline objective functions, effectively detects discontinuities and missing bronchioles. We also demonstrate the generalizability of our refinement pipeline on three previous models, significantly improving their segmentation completeness. Our method provides a robust and accurate airway segmentation tool that can help improve diagnosis and treatment planning for lung diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "COVID-19"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zeyu", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Nan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "37375041", "Title": "Exopolysaccharides Producing Bacteria: A Review.", "Abstract": "Bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are essential natural biopolymers used in different areas including biomedicine, food, cosmetic, petroleum, and pharmaceuticals and also in environmental remediation.

Although traditional Chinese medicine residues (TCMRs) are known to promote plant growth and soil health, few studies have investigated their effectiveness in continuous monoculture soils. Here, we studied the impact of chemical fertilizers (CF) and four TCMRs with antibacterial activities on the growth of S. miltiorrhiza (a widely used medicinal plant in China), accumulation of active ingredients in plants, and soil health under continuous monoculture conditions. Compared with no fertilizer (CK) and CF, fermented Sophora flavescens radix residue (SFRf) and fermented and unfermented Moutan cortex residue (MCRf and MCRu, respectively) resulted in a reduction of the disease index of root rot, while CF did not. The CF and four TCMR treatments increased the accumulation of nitrogen (N) (42.8-124.6% and 17.0-101.7%), phosphorous (P) (19.8-74.7% and 8.3-27.4%), and potassium (K) (104.1-212.0% and 9.3-51.8%) in shoots and roots compared to CK. The differences in nutrient accumulation between the CF and TCMR treatments were statistically insignificant, excepted for the N accumulation in the roots. All fertilization treatments increased plant biomass compared to CK, with increases of 25.57-89.86% and 2.62-35.28% in shoots and roots, respectively. The SFRf treatment exhibited the most significant enhancement in both shoot and root biomass. CF significantly reduced the accumulation of seven active ingredients in roots by 23.90-78.95% compared to CK, whereas each TCMR increased accumulation of certain active ingredients. The TCMR treatments effectively improved the health of deteriorated soil by enhancing soil physicochemical properties, restoring the balance of the microbial community, recruiting beneficial bacteria, and reducing the relative abundance of the pathogen Fusarium. The SFRf treatment exhibited superior performance in improving soil health than other treatments. Overall, the TCMRs outperformed CF in restoring soil health and promoting the yield and quality of S. miltiorrhiza. These findings offer guidance for improving the health of continuous cropping soil and recycling TCMRs.", "Keywords": ["Chinese medicinal herbal residue", "S. miltiorrhiza", "continuous cropping", "soil microbial community", "soil physicochemical properties"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sha", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Faming", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, Guizhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Fusong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, Guizhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunjuan", "Last Name": "Pu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zihan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ye", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiuteng", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuzhi", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Fengsheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Cultivation Base Department, Laiwu Purple Light Ecological Park Co., Ltd., Jinan, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "You", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Cultivation Base Department, Laiwu Purple Light Ecological Park Co., Ltd., Jinan, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Meilan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Luqi", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in plant science", "PubDate": "2023"}]
