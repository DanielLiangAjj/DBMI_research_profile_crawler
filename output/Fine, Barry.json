We developed BeatProfiler, a suite of cardiac analysis tools designed to quantify contractile function, calcium handling, and force generation for multiple in vitro cardiac models and apply downstream machine learning methods for deep phenotyping and classification. Methods: We first validate BeatProfiler's accuracy, robustness, and speed by benchmarking against existing tools with a fixed dataset. We further confirm its ability to robustly characterize disease and dose-dependent drug response. We then demonstrate that the data acquired by our automatic acquisition pipeline can be further harnessed for machine learning (ML) analysis to phenotype a disease model of restrictive cardiomyopathy and profile cardioactive drug functional response. To accurately classify between these biological signals, we apply feature-based ML and deep learning models (temporal convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory model or TCN-BiLSTM). Results: Benchmarking against existing tools revealed that BeatProfiler detected and analyzed contraction and calcium signals better than existing tools through improved sensitivity in low signal data, reduction in false positives, and analysis speed increase by 7 to 50-fold. Of signals accurately detected by published methods (PMs), BeatProfiler's extracted features showed high correlations to PMs, confirming that it is reliable and consistent with PMs. The features extracted by BeatProfiler classified restrictive cardiomyopathy cardiomyocytes from isogenic healthy controls with 98% accuracy and identified relax90 as a top distinguishing feature in congruence with previous findings. We also show that our TCN-BiLSTM model was able to classify drug-free control and 4 cardiac drugs with different mechanisms of action at 96% accuracy. We further apply Grad-CAM on our convolution-based models to identify signature regions of perturbations by these drugs in calcium signals. Conclusions: We anticipate that the capabilities of BeatProfiler will help advance in vitro studies in cardiac biology through rapid phenotyping, revealing mechanisms underlying cardiac health and disease, and enabling objective classification of cardiac disease and responses to drugs.", "Keywords": ["Calcium handling", "cardiac analysis", "contractile function", "drug response", "machine learning (ML)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Youngbin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Kunlun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Roberta I", "Last Name": "Lock", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Trevor R", "Last Name": "Nash", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Fleischer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan Z", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry M", "Last Name": "Fine", "Affiliation": "Department of MedicineDivision of CardiologyColumbia University Medical Center New York NY 10032 USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical EngineeringColumbia University New York NY 10032 USA."}], "Journal": "IEEE open journal of engineering in medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "36921598", "Title": "Engineered cardiac tissue model of restrictive cardiomyopathy for drug discovery.", "Abstract": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is defined as increased myocardial stiffness and impaired diastolic relaxation leading to elevated ventricular filling pressures.

Here we utilize proteomics prior to transplant to identify new biomarkers that predict post-transplant survival in a multi-institutional cohort. Microvesicles were isolated from serum samples and underwent proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry. Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) was used to predict survival after transplant incorporating select recipient pre-transplant clinical characteristics and serum microvesicle proteomic data. We identified six protein markers with prediction performance above AUROC of 0.6, including Prothrombin (F2), anti-plasmin (SERPINF2), Factor IX, carboxypeptidase 2 (CPB2), HGF activator (HGFAC) and low molecular weight kininogen (LK). No clinical characteristics demonstrated an AUROC\u2009>\u20090.6. Putative biological functions and pathways were assessed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Differential expression analysis identified enriched pathways prior to transplant that were associated with post-transplant survival including activation of platelets and the coagulation pathway prior to transplant. Specifically, upregulation of coagulation cascade components of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and downregulation of kininogen prior to transplant were associated with survival after transplant.

CASE: Our patient is a 53-year-old man with end-stage non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by ventricular tachycardia (VT), post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, and renal insufficiency. After progressing to NYHA Class IV symptoms, he underwent implantation of a durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as bridge to transplant (BTT). On device support, he developed recurrent VT resulting in multiple defibrillator discharges and hospital admission for intravenous anti-arrhythmic therapy. He is subsequently upgraded to a higher status on the waiting list. A suitable donor is identified, with an appropriate predicted heart mass and an anticipated ischemic time of <4\u00a0hours. He is taken to the operating room, where at the time of anesthesia induction he develops vasodilatory shock, requiring high-dose vasopressors, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support for dissection. After surgical anastomosis, cross clamp removal and reperfusion, graft function is extremely poor, there is significant bradycardia requiring pacing, and the patient is unable to be weaned successfully from CPB. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is initiated, and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit. Retrospective flow crossmatch is negative.

PREX2, a widely distributed GEF that activates the GTPase RAC1, binds to and inhibits PTEN. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts and breast cancer cell lines to show that PTEN suppresses cell migration and invasion by blocking PREX2 activity. In addition to metabolizing the phosphoinositide PIP\u2083, PTEN inhibited PREX2-induced invasion by a mechanism that required the tail domain of PTEN, but not its lipid phosphatase activity. Fluorescent nucleotide exchange assays revealed that PTEN inhibited the GEF activity of PREX2 toward RAC1. PREX2 is a frequently mutated GEF in cancer, and examination of human tumor data showed that PREX2 mutation was associated with high PTEN expression. Therefore, we tested whether cancer-derived somatic PREX2 mutants, which accelerate tumor formation of immortalized melanocytes, were inhibited by PTEN. The three stably expressed, somatic PREX2 cancer mutants that we tested were resistant to PTEN-mediated inhibition of invasion but retained the ability to inhibit the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN. In vitro analysis showed that PTEN did not block the GEF activity of two PREX2 cancer mutants and had a reduced binding affinity for the third. Thus, PTEN antagonized migration and invasion by restraining PREX2 GEF activity, and PREX2 mutants are likely selected in cancer to escape PTEN-mediated inhibition of invasion.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "DNA Primers", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Genetic Vectors", "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Immunoprecipitation", "Lentivirus", "Mice", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "rac1 GTP-Binding Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah M", "Last Name": "Mense", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1470 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Douglas", "Last Name": "Barrows", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, 1470 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10029, USA.
