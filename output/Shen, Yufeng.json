Here, we used artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to explore the predictive value of genome sequencing in forecasting clinical outcomes following surgery for congenital heart defects (CHD). We report results for a cohort of 2,253 CHD patients from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium with a broad range of complex heart defects, pre- and post-operative clinical variables and exome sequencing. Damaging genotypes in chromatin-modifying and cilia-related genes were associated with an elevated risk of adverse post-operative outcomes, including mortality, cardiac arrest and prolonged mechanical ventilation. The impact of damaging genotypes was further amplified in the context of specific CHD phenotypes, surgical complexity and extra-cardiac anomalies. The absence of a damaging genotype in chromatin-modifying and cilia-related genes was also informative, reducing the risk for adverse postoperative outcomes.

Previous efforts have focused on predicting a binary pathogenicity classification, but the functional impact of missense variants is multi-dimensional. Pathogenic missense variants in the same gene may act through different modes of action (i.e., gain/loss-of-function) by affecting different aspects of protein function. They may result in distinct clinical conditions that require different treatments. We developed a new method, PreMode, to perform gene-specific mode-of-action predictions. PreMode models effects of coding sequence variants using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks on protein sequences and structures. Using the largest-to-date set of missense variants with known modes of action, we showed that PreMode reached state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of mode-of-action predictions by efficient transfer-learning. Additionally, PreMode's prediction of G/LoF variants in a kinase is consistent with inactive-active conformation transition energy changes.

However, the sensitivity of existing detection techniques is not sufficient, and the criteria for evaluating optimal force have not been yet established. Here, by employing 3D finite element analysis methodology, we found that the apical distal region (A-D region) of mesial roots is particularly sensitive to orthodontic force in rats. Tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts began accumulating in the A-D region under the force of 40 grams (g), leading to alveolar bone resorption and tooth movement. When the force reached 80\u2009g, TRAP-positive osteoclasts started appearing on the root surface in the A-D region. Additionally, micro-computed tomography revealed a significant root resorption at 80\u2009g. Notably, the A-D region was identified as a major contributor to whole root resorption. It was determined that 40\u2009g is the minimum effective force for tooth movement with minimal side effects according to the analysis of tooth movement, inclination, and hyalinization. These findings suggest that the A-D region with its changes on the root surface is an important consideration and sensitive indicator when evaluating orthodontic forces for a rat model.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is among the most common and severe of all structural malformations; however, its underlying mechanisms are unclear. We identified loss-of-function sequence variants in the epigenomic regulator gene SIN3A in two patients with complex CDH. Tissue-specific deletion of Sin3a in mice resulted in defects in diaphragm development, lung hypoplasia, and pulmonary hypertension, the cardinal features of CDH and major causes of CDH-associated mortality. Loss of SIN3A in the lung mesenchyme resulted in reduced cellular differentiation, impaired cell proliferation, and increased DNA damage. Treatment of embryonic Sin3a mutant mice with anacardic acid, an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase, reduced DNA damage, increased cell proliferation and differentiation, improved lung and pulmonary vascular development, and reduced pulmonary hypertension. These findings demonstrate that restoring the balance of histone acetylation can improve lung development in the Sin3a mouse model of CDH.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Histones", "Acetylation", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Lung"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giangela", "Last Name": "Stokes", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhuowei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Talaba", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Genthe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria B", "Last Name": "Brix", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Betty", "Last Name": "Pham", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark D", "Last Name": "Wienhold", "Affiliation": "490 BioTech Inc., Knoxville, TN 37996, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gracia", "Last Name": "Sandok", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Hernan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Wynn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haiyang", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Diana M", "Last Name": "Tabima", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison", "Last Name": "Rodgers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy A", "Last Name": "Hacker", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naomi C", "Last Name": "Chesler", "Affiliation": "Edwards Lifesciences Foundation Cardiovascular Innovation and Research Center and Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rabi", "Last Name": "Murad", "Affiliation": "Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason X-J", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Section of Physiology, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "McCulley", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA 92093, USA."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2024Jan31"}, {"PMID": "38168397", "Title": "A probabilistic graphical model for estimating selection coefficient of missense variants from human population sequence data.", "Abstract": "Accurately predicting the effect of missense variants is a central problem in interpretation of genomic variation. Commonly used computational methods does not capture the quantitative impact on fitness in populations. We developed MisFit to estimate missense fitness effect using biobank-scale human population genome data. MisFit jointly models the effect at molecular level (d) and population level (selection coefficient, s), assuming that in the same gene, missense variants with similar d have similar s. MisFit is a probabilistic graphical model that integrates deep neural network components and population genetics models efficiently with inductive bias based on biological causality of variant effect. We trained it by maximizing probability of observed allele counts in 236,017 European individuals. We show that s is informative in predicting frequency across ancestries and consistent with the fraction of de novo mutations given s. Finally, MisFit outperforms previous methods in prioritizing missense variants in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yige", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Guojie", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Jake", "Last Name": "Hagen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hongbing", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2023Dec22"}, {"PMID": "38091025", "Title": "Plasticity of intragraft alloreactive T cell clones in human gut correlates with transplant outcomes.", "Abstract": "The site of transition between tissue-resident memory (TRM) and circulating phenotypes of T cells is unknown.

Host-versus-graft (HvG)-reactive T cells were mainly distributed to TRM, effector T (Teff)/TRM, and T follicular helper compartments. RNA velocity analysis demonstrated a trajectory from TRM to Teff/TRM clusters in association with rejection. By integrating pre- and post-transplantation (Tx) mixed lymphocyte reaction-determined alloreactive repertoires, we observed that pre-existing HvG-reactive T cells that demonstrated tolerance in the circulation were dominated by TRM profiles in quiescent allografts. Putative de novo HvG-reactive clones showed a transcriptional profile skewed to cytotoxic effectors in rejecting grafts. Inferred protein regulon network analysis revealed upstream regulators that accounted for the effector and tolerant T cell states.

The developmental basis of these congenital anomalies is poorly understood, but recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation similar to EA/TEF patients. We show that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the cell surface where opposite sides of the common foregut tube fuse. Partial loss of endosome trafficking or the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts epithelial polarity and cell division orientation. Mutant cells accumulate at the fusion point, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adhish", "Last Name": "Kashyap", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alissa", "Last Name": "Warren", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zachary N", "Last Name": "Agricola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan P", "Last Name": "Kenny", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aaron M", "Last Name": "Zorn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Nov21"}, {"PMID": "37865656", "Title": "Rare predicted loss of function alleles in Bassoon (BSN) are associated with obesity.", "Abstract": "Bassoon (BSN) is a component of a hetero-dimeric presynaptic cytomatrix protein that orchestrates neurotransmitter release with Piccolo (PCLO) from glutamatergic neurons throughout the brain.

We describe eight unrelated families with an X-linked condition characterized by diaphragm defects, variable anterior body-wall anomalies, and/or facial dysmorphism. Using linkage analysis and exome or genome sequencing, we found that missense variants in plastin 3 (PLS3), a gene encoding an actin bundling protein, co-segregate with disease in all families. Loss-of-function variants in PLS3 have been previously associated with X-linked osteoporosis (MIM: 300910), so we used in silico protein modeling and a mouse model to address these seemingly disparate clinical phenotypes. The missense variants in individuals with CDH are located within the actin-binding domains of the protein but are not predicted to affect protein structure, whereas the variants in individuals with osteoporosis are predicted to result in loss of function. A mouse knockin model of a variant identified in one of the CDH-affected families, c.1497G>C (p.Trp499Cys), shows partial perinatal lethality and recapitulates the key findings of the human phenotype, including diaphragm and abdominal-wall defects. Both the mouse model and one adult human male with a CDH-associated PLS3 variant were observed to have increased rather than decreased bone mineral density. Together, these clinical and functional data in humans and mice reveal that specific missense variants affecting the actin-binding domains of PLS3 might have a gain-of-function effect and cause a Mendelian congenital disorder.", "Keywords": ["PLS3, plastin", "X-linked", "abdominal hernia", "actin-binding protein", "congenital diaphragmatic hernia", "fimbrin", "omphalocele", "umbilical hernia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Male", "Animals", "Mice", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Actins", "Mutation, Missense", "Osteoporosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Florence", "Last Name": "Petit", "Affiliation": "Clinique de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique, CHU de Lille, Lille, France;

As for the composites containing 8 wt % LmGNP, the in-plane thermal conductivity was 3.341 W\u00b7m-1K-1, while the tensile stress was 114.60 MPa, which increased by 297.3 and 146.2%, respectively, compared to pure cellulose. Along with the good stability, insulation, and lightweight properties, the fabricated composites have the potential to become a promising heat dissipation material for wearable electronic devices.", "Keywords": ["cellulose-based composites", "double-cross-linked interface interactions", "heat dissipation", "mechanical properties", "thermal conductivity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinru", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiangpeng", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Zeyi", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Sida", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "BingJi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Changyu", "Last Name": "Pu", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinzhi", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuqiao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinxin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Energy and Environmental Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China."}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2023Sep13"}, {"PMID": "37491581", "Title": "VBASS enables integration of single cell gene expression data in Bayesian association analysis of rare variants.", "Abstract": "Rare or de novo variants have substantial contribution to human diseases, but the statistical power to identify risk genes by rare variants is generally low due to rarity of genotype data.

Recent efforts in single cell atlas in human and model organisms produced large amount of gene expression data.

VBASS models disease risk prior as a function of expression profiles, approximated by deep neural networks. It learns the weights of neural networks and parameters of Gamma-Poisson likelihood models of DNV counts jointly from expression and genetics data. On simulated data, VBASS shows proper error rate control and better power than state-of-the-art methods.

Recent advances in machine learning and the availability of large-scale population genomic sequencing data provide new opportunities to considerably improve computational predictions. Here we describe the graphical missense variant pathogenicity predictor (gMVP), a new method based on graph attention neural networks. Its main component is a graph with nodes that capture predictive features of amino acids and edges weighted by co-evolution strength, enabling effective pooling of information from the local protein context and functionally correlated distal positions. Evaluation of deep mutational scan data shows that gMVP outperforms other published methods in identifying damaging variants in TP53, PTEN, BRCA1 and MSH2. Furthermore, it achieves the best separation of de novo missense variants in neuro developmental disorder cases from those in controls.

Here, we demonstrated that artificial LAN can impair developmental growth plate cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dilation, which in turn compromises bone formation. Excessive LAN exposure induces downregulation of the core circadian clock protein BMAL1, which leads to collagen accumulation in the ER. Further investigations suggest that BMAL1 is the direct transcriptional activator of prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4ha1) in chondrocytes, which orchestrates collagen prolyl hydroxylation and secretion. BMAL1 downregulation induced by LAN markedly inhibits proline hydroxylation and transport of collagen from ER to golgi, thereby inducing ER stress in chondrocytes. Restoration of BMAL1/P4HA1 signaling can effectively rescue the dysregulation of cartilage formation within the developmental growth plate induced by artificial LAN exposure.

Inframe insertion and deletion variants (indels) alter protein sequence and length, but not as deleterious as frameshift indels. Inframe indel Interpretation is challenging due to limitations in the available number of known pathogenic variants for training. Existing prediction methods largely use manually encoded features including conservation, protein structure and function, and allele frequency to infer variant pathogenicity. Recent advances in deep learning modeling of protein sequences and structures provide an opportunity to improve the representation of salient features based on large numbers of protein sequences. We developed a new pathogenicity predictor for SHort Inframe iNsertion and dEletion (SHINE). SHINE uses pretrained protein language models to construct a latent representation of an indel and its protein context from protein sequences and multiple protein sequence alignments, and feeds the latent representation into supervised machine learning models for pathogenicity prediction. We curated training data from ClinVar and gnomAD, and created two test datasets from different sources. SHINE achieved better prediction performance than existing methods for both deletion and insertion variants in these two test datasets.

salmoides rhabdovirus (MSRV) has a high mortality rate and causes huge economic losses to the aquaculture industry. In this study, we identified that ursolic acid (UA) had antiviral efficacy against MSRV in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that UA inhibited MSRV replication in grass carp ovary (GCO) cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.55\u00a0\u03bcM, reduced viral titers and decreased cytopathic effects (CPE). Mechanistically, UA does not directly damage viral particles. On the other hand, UA inhibits MSRV replication by altering viral binding and release. Furthermore, pre- and post-treatment assays revealed that UA had preventive and therapeutic effects. For in vivo studies, UA could enhance the survival rate of MSRV-infected largemouth bass. Similarly, UA reduced the viral load of MSRV in the heart, spleen and brain at 3, 5 and 7 d post-infection.

Many NMOSD patients have antibodies to Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Prior studies show associations of NMOSD with individual Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and with mutations in the complement pathway and potassium channels. HLA allele associations with NMOSD are inconsistent between populations, suggesting complex relationships between the identified alleles and risk of disease. We used a retrospective case-control approach to identify contributing genetic variants in patients who met the diagnostic criteria for NMOSD and their unaffected family members. Potentially deleterious variants identified in NMOSD patients were compared to members of their families who do not have the disease and to existing databases of human genetic variation. HLA sequences from patients from Belgrade, Serbia, were compared to the frequency of HLA haplotypes in the general population in Belgrade. We analyzed exome sequencing on 40 NMOSD patients and identified rare inherited variants in the complement pathway and potassium channel genes. Haplotype analysis further detected two haplotypes, HLA-A*01, B*08, DRB1*03 and HLA-A*01, B*08, C*07, DRB1*03, DQB1*02, which were more prevalent in NMOSD patients than in unaffected individuals. In silico modeling indicates that HLA molecules within these haplotypes are predicted to bind AQP4 at several sites, potentially contributing to the development of autoimmunity.

Accurate detection of copy number variants (CNVs) is important to fully utilize exome sequencing data. However, exome data are noisy. None of the existing methods alone can achieve both high precision and recall rate. A common practice is to perform heuristic filtration followed by manual inspection of read depth of putative CNVs. This approach does not scale in large studies. To address this issue, we developed a transfer learning method, CNV-espresso, for in silico confirming rare CNVs from exome sequencing data. CNV-espresso encodes candidate CNVs from exome data as images and uses pretrained convolutional neural network models to classify copy number states. We trained CNV-espresso using an offspring-parents trio exome sequencing dataset, with inherited CNVs as positives and CNVs with Mendelian errors as negatives. We evaluated the performance using additional samples that have both exome and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Assuming the CNVs detected from WGS data as a proxy of ground truth, CNV-espresso significantly improves precision while keeping recall almost intact, especially for CNVs that span a small number of exons.

With the decreasing cost of sequencing and the improving methods to interpret genetic data, there is an opportunity to add DNA sequencing as a screening method to facilitate the identification of babies with treatable conditions that cannot be identified in any other scalable way, including highly penetrant genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). However, the lack of effective dietary or drug-based treatments has made it nearly impossible to consider NDDs in the current NBS framework, yet it is anticipated that any treatment will be maximally effective if started early. Hence there is a critical need for large scale pilot studies to assess if and how NDDs can be effectively screened at birth, if parents desire that information, and what impact early diagnosis may have. Here we attempt to provide an overview of the recent advances in NDD treatments, explore the possible framework of setting up a pilot study to genetically screen for NDDs, highlight key technical, practical, and ethical considerations and challenges, and examine the policy and health system implications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Humans", "Neonatal Screening", "Pilot Projects", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Parents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan S", "Last Name": "Berg", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey R", "Last Name": "Botkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven E", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey P", "Last Name": "Brosco", "Affiliation": "Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyle B", "Last Name": "Brothers", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Currier", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Gaviglio", "Affiliation": "Connetics Consulting, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walter E", "Last Name": "Kowtoniuk", "Affiliation": "Third Rock Ventures, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Steinhardt Graduate School of Education, New York University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Lloyd-Puryear", "Affiliation": "American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annamarie", "Last Name": "Saarinen", "Affiliation": "Newborn Foundation, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mustafa", "Last Name": "Sahin", "Affiliation": "Rosamund Stone Zander Translational Neuroscience Center, Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elliott H", "Last Name": "Sherr", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Institute of Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Washington University (Adjunct), St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhanzhi", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

Most complex V subunits are nuclear encoded and not yet associated with recognized Mendelian disorders. Using exome sequencing, we identified a rare homozygous splice variant (c.87+3A>G) in ATP5PO, the complex V subunit which encodes the oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein, in three individuals from two unrelated families, with clinical suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. These individuals had a similar, severe infantile and often lethal multi-systemic disorder that included hypotonia, developmental delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, progressive epileptic encephalopathy, progressive cerebral atrophy, and white matter abnormalities on brain MRI consistent with Leigh syndrome. cDNA studies showed a predominant shortened transcript with skipping of exon 2 and low levels of the normal full-length transcript. Fibroblasts from the affected individuals demonstrated decreased ATP5PO protein, defective assembly of complex V with markedly reduced amounts of peripheral stalk proteins, and complex V hydrolytic activity. Further, expression of human ATP5PO cDNA without exon 2 (hATP5PO-\u2206ex2) in yeast cells deleted for yATP5 (ATP5PO homolog) was unable to rescue growth on media which requires oxidative phosphorylation when compared to the wild type construct (hATP5PO-WT), indicating that exon 2 deletion leads to a non-functional protein. Collectively, our findings support the pathogenicity of the ATP5PO c.87+3A>G variant, which significantly reduces but does not eliminate complex V activity. These data along with the recent report of an affected individual with ATP5PO variants, add to the evidence that rare biallelic variants in ATP5PO result in defective complex V assembly, function and

For in vivo studies, MON demonstrated anti-SVCV activity by enhancing the survival rate of zebrafish (Danio rerio) after infection via pelvic fin base injection. These results tended to be consistent with MON decreasing the SVCV titer of infected zebrafish. During this time, viral loads of the spleen and kidney have declined in SVSV-infected zebrafish.

Previous studies indicate that rare or de novo genetic variants significantly contribute to EA/TEF risk, and most individuals with EA/TEF do not have pathogenic genetic variants in established risk genes. To identify the genetic contributions to EA/TEF, we performed whole genome sequencing of 185 trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF, including 59 isolated and 126 complex cases with additional congenital anomalies and/or neurodevelopmental disorders. There was a significant burden of protein-altering de novo coding variants in complex cases (p\u00a0= 3.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-4), especially in genes that are intolerant of loss-of-function variants in the population. We performed simulation analysis of pathway enrichment based on background mutation rate and identified a number of pathways related to endocytosis and intracellular trafficking that as a group have a significant burden of protein-altering de novo variants.

There is no effective or approved therapy to date. In this study, we evaluated the anti-MSRV effects of 22 quinoline derivatives in grass carp ovary (GCO) cells. Among these compounds, 8-hydroxyquinoline exhibited valid inhibition in decreasing MSRV nucleoprotein gene expression levels of 99.3% with a half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 ) value of 4.66\u00a0\u03bcM at 48\u00a0h. Moreover, 8-hydroxyquinoline significantly enhanced a protective effect in GCO cells by reducing the cytopathic effect (CPE). By comparing the anti-MSRV activity of 22 quinoline derivatives, we found that 8-hydroxyquinoline possessed the efficient active site of 8-hydroxyl and inhibited MSRV infection in vitro. For in vivo studies, 8-hydroxyquinoline via intraperitoneal injection exhibited an antiviral effect in MSRV-infected largemouth bass by substantially enhancing the survival rate by 15.0%. Importantly, the viral loads in the infected largemouth bass notably reduced in the spleen on the third days post-infection.

MtDNAcns were calculated and rare, non-synonymous mtDNA mutations were identified in 1,837 CHD-affected proband-parent trios, 116 CHD-affected singletons, and 114 paired cardiovascular tissue/blood samples. The variant allele fraction (VAF) of heteroplasmic variants in mitochondrial RNA from 257 CHD cardiovascular tissue samples was also calculated. On average, mtDNA from blood had 0.14 rare variants and 52.9 mtDNA copies per nuclear genome per proband. No variation with parental age at proband birth or CHD-affected proband age was seen. mtDNAcns in valve/vessel tissue (320 \u00b1 70) were lower than in atrial tissue (1,080 \u00b1 320, p\u00a0= 6.8E-21), which were lower than in ventricle tissue (1,340 \u00b1 280, p\u00a0= 1.4E-4). The frequency of rare variants in CHD-affected individual DNA was indistinguishable from the frequency in an unaffected cohort, and proband mtDNAcns did not vary from those of CHD cohort parents. In both the CHD and the comparison cohorts, mtDNAcns were significantly correlated between mother-child, father-child, and mother-father. mtDNAcns among people with European (mean\u00a0= 52.0), African (53.0), and Asian haplogroups (53.5) were calculated and were significantly different for European and Asian haplogroups (p\u00a0= 2.6E-3). Variant heteroplasmic fraction (HF) in blood correlated well with paired cardiovascular tissue HF (r\u00a0= 0.975) and RNA VAF (r\u00a0= 0.953), which suggests blood HF is a reasonable proxy for HF in heart tissue.

However, current cognitive assessment methods are not feasible at scale. We developed five commonly used machine learning models to predict cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80 and FSIQ<70) and FSIQ scores among 521 children with autism using parent-reported online surveys in SPARK, and evaluated them in an independent set (n\u00a0=\u00a01346) with a missing data rate up to 70%. We assessed accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity by comparing predicted cognitive levels against clinical IQ data. The elastic-net model has good performance (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.876, sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.772, specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.803) using 129 predictive features to impute cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80). Top-ranked predictive features included parent-reported language and cognitive levels, age at autism diagnosis, and history of services. Prediction of FSIQ<70 and FSIQ scores also showed good performance. We show cognitive levels can be imputed with high accuracy for children with autism, using commonly collected parent-reported data and standardized surveys. The current model offers a method for large-scale autism studies seeking estimates of cognitive ability when standardized psychometric testing is not feasible. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism who have more severe learning challenges or cognitive impairment have different needs that are important to consider in research studies. When children in our study were missing standardized cognitive testing scores, we were able to use machine learning with other information to correctly \"guess\" when they have cognitive impairment about 80% of the time. We can use this information in research in the future to develop more appropriate treatments for children with autism and cognitive impairment.", "Keywords": ["autism", "cognitive impairment", "imputation", "intelligence quotient", "machine learning"], "MeSH terms": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Intelligence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "LeeAnne", "Last Name": "Green Snyder", "Affiliation": "Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, Simons Foundation, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "SPARK Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "PubDate": "2022Jan"}, {"PMID": "34618565", "Title": "Grain boundary velocity and curvature are not correlated in Ni polycrystals.", "Abstract": "Grain boundary velocity has been believed to be correlated to curvature, and this is an important relationship for modeling how polycrystalline materials coarsen during annealing. We determined the velocities and curvatures of approximately 52,000 grain boundaries in a nickel polycrystal using three-dimensional orientation maps measured by high-energy diffraction microscopy before and after annealing at 800\u00b0C. Unexpectedly, the grain boundary velocities and curvatures were uncorrelated. Instead, we found strong correlations between the boundary velocity and the five macroscopic parameters that specify grain boundary crystallography. The sensitivity of the velocity to grain boundary crystallography might be the result of defect-mediated grain boundary migration or the anisotropy of the grain boundary energy.

Although the role of genetics in the pathogenesis of CDH has been established, only a small number of disease-associated genes have been identified. To further investigate the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 827 proband-parent trios and confirmed an overall significant enrichment of damaging de novo variants, especially in constrained genes. We identified LONP1 (lon peptidase 1, mitochondrial) and ALYREF (Aly/REF export factor) as candidate CDH-associated genes on the basis of de novo variants at a false discovery rate below 0.05. We also performed ultra-rare variant association analyses in 748 affected individuals and 11,220 ancestry-matched population control individuals and identified LONP1 as a risk gene contributing to CDH through both de novo and ultra-rare inherited largely heterozygous variants clustered in the core of the domains and segregating with CDH in affected familial individuals. Approximately 3% of our CDH cohort who are heterozygous with ultra-rare predicted damaging variants in LONP1 have a range of clinical phenotypes, including other anomalies in some individuals and higher mortality and requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mice with lung epithelium-specific deletion of Lonp1 die immediately after birth, most likely because of the observed severe reduction of lung growth, a known contributor to the high mortality in humans.

anterograde neuronal microtubule (MT) motor protein. Here we characterize the natural history of KAND in 117 individuals using a combination of caregiver or self-reported medical history, a standardized measure of adaptive behavior, clinical records, and neuropathology. We developed a heuristic severity score using a weighted sum of common symptoms to assess disease severity. Focusing on 100 individuals, we compared the average clinical severity score for each variant with in silico predictions of deleteriousness and location in the protein. We found increased severity is strongly associated with variants occurring in protein regions involved with ATP and MT binding: the P loop, switch I, and switch II. For a subset of variants, we generated recombinant proteins, which we used to assess transport in vivo by assessing neurite tip accumulation and to assess MT binding, motor velocity, and processivity using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We find all modeled variants result in defects in protein transport, and we describe three classes of protein dysfunction: reduced MT binding, reduced velocity and processivity, and increased non-motile rigor MT binding. The rigor phenotype is consistently associated with the most severe clinical phenotype, while reduced MT binding is associated with milder clinical phenotypes. Our findings suggest the clinical phenotypic heterogeneity in KAND likely reflects and parallels diverse molecular phenotypes.

We studied the response of primary DCs to the prototypical persistent DNA virus, human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Human pDCs produced high amounts of type I interferon (IFN-I) when incubated with live CMV-infected fibroblasts but not with free CMV; the response involved integrin-mediated adhesion, transfer of DNA-containing virions to pDCs, and the recognition of DNA through TLR9. Compared with transient polyfunctional responses to CpG or free influenza virus, pDC response to CMV-infected cells was long-lasting, dominated by the production of IFN-I and IFN-III, and lacked diversification into functionally distinct populations. Similarly, pDC activation by influenza-infected lung epithelial cells was highly efficient, prolonged, and dominated by interferon production. Prolonged pDC activation by CMV-infected cells facilitated the activation of natural killer cells critical for CMV control. Last, patients with CMV viremia harbored phenotypically activated pDCs and increased circulating IFN-I and IFN-III. Thus, recognition of live infected cells is a mechanism of virus detection by pDCs that elicits a unique antiviral immune response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cells, Cultured", "Coculture Techniques", "CpG Islands", "Cytomegalovirus", "Dendritic Cells", "Fibroblasts", "Host Microbial Interactions", "Humans", "Interferon Type I", "Interferons", "Primary Cell Culture", "Interferon Lambda"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tae Jin", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzu", "Last Name": "Igarashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, BIO5 Institute, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haoquan", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oriana A", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus R", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuel", "Last Name": "Zorn", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Felicia", "Last Name": "Goodrum", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, BIO5 Institute, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adeeb", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Precision Immunology Institute, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, and Human Immune Monitoring Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, and Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Boris", "Last Name": "Reizis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA. boris.reizis@nyulangone.org."}], "Journal": "Science immunology", "PubDate": "2021Apr02"}, {"PMID": "33630757", "Title": "Lymphohematopoietic graft-versus-host responses promote mixed chimerism in patients receiving intestinal transplantation.", "Abstract": "In humans receiving intestinal transplantation (ITx), long-term multilineage blood chimerism often develops. Donor T cell macrochimerism (\u22654%) frequently occurs without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is associated with reduced rejection. Here we demonstrate that patients with macrochimerism had high graft-versus-host (GvH) to host-versus-graft (HvG) T cell clonal ratios in their allografts. These GvH clones entered the circulation, where their peak levels were associated with declines in HvG clones early after transplant, suggesting that GvH reactions may contribute to chimerism and control HvG responses without causing GVHD. Consistently, donor-derived T cells, including GvH clones, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were simultaneously detected in the recipients' BM more than 100 days after transplant. Individual GvH clones appeared in ileal mucosa or PBMCs before detection in recipient BM, consistent with an intestinal mucosal origin, where donor GvH-reactive T cells expanded early upon entry of recipient APCs into the graft. These results, combined with cytotoxic single-cell transcriptional profiles of donor T cells in recipient BM, suggest that tissue-resident GvH-reactive donor T cells migrated into the recipient circulation and BM, where they destroyed recipient hematopoietic cells through cytolytic effector functions and promoted engraftment of graft-derived HSPCs that maintain chimerism.

PPP2R5D-related disorder is an early childhood onset condition characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, autism-spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic features. The disorder is caused by de novo single nucleotide changes in PPP2R5D, which generate heterozygous dominant missense variants. PPP2R5D is known to encode a B'-type (B'56\u03b4) regulatory subunit of a PP2A-serine/threonine phosphatase. To help elucidate the molecular mechanisms altered in PPP2R5D-related disorder, we used a CRISPR-single-base editor to generate HEK-293 cells in which a single transition (c.1258G>A) was introduced into one allele, precisely recapitulating a clinically relevant E420K variant. Unbiased quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of endogenously expressed proteins revealed heterozygous-dominant changes in kinase/phosphatase signaling. These data combined with orthogonal validation studies revealed a previously unrecognized interaction of PPP2R5D with AKT in human cells, leading to constitutively active AKT-mTOR signaling, increased cell size, and uncoordinated cellular growth in E420K-variant cells. Rapamycin reduced cell size and dose-dependently reduced RPS6 phosphorylation in E420K-variant cells, suggesting that inhibition of mTOR1 can suppress both the observed RPS6 hyperphosphorylation and increased cell size. Together, our findings provide a deeper understanding of PPP2R5D and insight into how the E420K-variant alters signaling networks influenced by PPP2R5D. Our comprehensive approach, which combines precise genome editing, isobaric tandem mass tag labeling of peptides generated from endogenously expressed proteins, and concurrent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS3), also provides a roadmap that can be used to rapidly explore the etiologies of additional genetic disorders.", "Keywords": ["AKT-mTOR", "Jordan\u2019s syndrome", "PP2A", "PPP2R5D", "PPP2R5D-intellectual disability", "PPP2R5D-related neurodevelopmental disorder", "phosphatase"], "MeSH terms": ["Autistic Disorder", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Megalencephaly", "Mutation", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Phosphatase 2", "Proteomics", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cinta M", "Last Name": "Papke", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kali A", "Last Name": "Smolen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark R", "Last Name": "Swingle", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Cressey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Heng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mourad", "Last Name": "Toporsian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liyong", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Hagen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arminja N", "Last Name": "Kettenbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.

To identify missing heritability in PAH we integrated deep phenotyping with whole-genome sequencing data using Bayesian statistics. Methods - We analyzed 13,037 participants enrolled in the NIHR BioResource - Rare Diseases (NBR) study, of which 1,148 were recruited to the PAH domain. To test for genetic associations between genes and selected phenotypes of pulmonary hypertension (PH), we used the Bayesian rare-variant association method BeviMed. Results - Heterozygous, high impact, likely loss-of-function variants in the Kinase Insert Domain Receptor (KDR) gene were strongly associated with significantly reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (KCO, posterior probability (PP)=0.989) and older age at diagnosis (PP=0.912). We also provide evidence for familial segregation of a rare nonsense KDR variant with these phenotypes. On computed tomographic imaging of the lungs, a range of parenchymal abnormalities were observed in the five patients harboring these predicted deleterious variants in KDR. Four additional PAH cases with rare likely loss-of-function variants in KDR were independently identified in the US PAH Biobank cohort with similar phenotypic characteristics. Conclusions - The Bayesian inference approach allowed us to independently validate KDR, which encodes for the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as a novel PAH candidate gene. Furthermore, this approach specifically associated high impact likely loss-of-function variants in the genetically constrained gene with distinct phenotypes.

The genetic etiology of CDH is complex. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs) in more than 150 genes have been associated with CDH, although few genes are recurrently mutated in multiple individuals and mutated genes are incompletely penetrant. This suggests that multiple genetic variants in combination, other not-yet-investigated classes of variants, and/or nongenetic factors contribute to CDH etiology. However, no studies have comprehensively investigated in affected individuals the contribution of all possible classes of variants throughout the genome to CDH etiology. In our study, we used a unique cohort of four individuals with isolated CDH with samples from blood, skin, and diaphragm connective tissue and parental blood and deep whole-genome sequencing to assess germline and somatic de novo and inherited SNVs, indels, and SVs. In each individual we found a different mutational landscape that included germline de novo and inherited SNVs and indels in multiple genes. We also found in two individuals a 343 bp deletion interrupting an annotated enhancer of the CDH-associated gene GATA4, and we hypothesize that this common SV (found in 1%-2% of the population) acts as a sensitizing allele for CDH. Overall, our comprehensive reconstruction of the genetic architecture of four CDH individuals demonstrates that the etiology of CDH is heterogeneous and multifactorial.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eric L", "Last Name": "Bogenschutz", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zac D", "Last Name": "Fox", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Farrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Wynn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gudrun", "Last Name": "Aspelund", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabor", "Last Name": "Marth", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Yandell", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabrielle", "Last Name": "Kardon", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA."}], "Journal": "HGG advances", "PubDate": "2020Oct22"}, {"PMID": "33084842", "Title": "Association of Damaging Variants in Genes With Increased Cancer Risk Among Patients With Congenital Heart Disease.", "Abstract": "Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), the most common birth defect, have increased risks for cancer.

Producing zeolite crystals with sizes less than 100\u2009nm, however, is non-trivial, often requires the use of complex organics and typically results in a small product yield. Here we present an alternative, facile approach to enhance the mass-transport properties of zeolites by the epitaxial growth of fin-like protrusions on seed crystals. We validate this generalizable methodology on two common zeolites and confirm that fins are in crystallographic registry with the underlying seeds, and that secondary growth does not impede access to the micropores. Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin.

collectively known as esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) constitute a rare group of birth defects of largely unknown etiology. Previous studies have identified a small number of rare genetic variants causing syndromes associated with EA/TEF. We performed a pilot exome sequencing study of 45 unrelated simplex trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF. Thirteen had isolated and 32 had nonisolated EA/TEF; none had a family history of EA/TEF. We identified de novo variants in protein-coding regions, including 19 missense variants predicted to be deleterious (D-mis) and 3 likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants. Consistent with previous studies of structural birth defects, there is a trend of increased burden of de novo D-mis in cases (1.57-fold increase over the background mutation rate), and the burden is greater in constrained genes (2.55-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.003). There is a frameshift de novo variant in EFTUD2, a known EA/TEF risk gene involved in mRNA splicing. Strikingly, 15 out of 19 de novo D-mis variants are located in genes that are putative target genes of EFTUD2 or SOX2 (another known EA/TEF gene), much greater than expected by chance (3.34-fold, p value\u2009=\u20097.20e-5). We estimated that 33% of patients can be attributed to de novo deleterious variants in known and novel genes. We identified APC2, AMER3, PCDH1, GTF3C1, POLR2B, RAB3GAP2, and ITSN1 as plausible candidate genes in the etiology of EA/TEF. We conclude that further genomic analysis to identify de novo variants will likely identify previously undescribed genetic causes of EA/TEF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Cadherins", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Esophageal Atresia", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Peptide Elongation Factors", "Protocadherins", "RNA Polymerase II", "Ribonucleoprotein, U5 Small Nuclear", "SOXB1 Transcription Factors", "Tracheoesophageal Fistula", "Transcription Factors, TFIII", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "rab3 GTP-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiayao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Priyanka R", "Last Name": "Ahimaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Somaye", "Last Name": "Hashemifar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Khlevner", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Picoraro", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Middlesworth", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mahmoud M", "Last Name": "Elfiky", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. ys2411@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. wkc15@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "European journal of human genetics : EJHG", "PubDate": "2021Jan"}, {"PMID": "32601476", "Title": "Genomic analyses implicate noncoding de novo variants in congenital heart disease.", "Abstract": "A genetic etiology is identified for one-third of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), with 8% of cases attributable to coding de novo variants (DNVs).

Our previous studies indicated that imidazole arctigenin derivatives possessed antiviral activities against aquatic rhabdoviruses. Based on the data of structure-activity relationship, a new imidazole arctigenin derivative, 4-(8-(2-bromoimidazole)octyloxy)-arctigenin (BOA), was designed and synthesized. And its antiviral activities against aquatic rhabdoviruses (SVCV, IHNV and MSRV) were evaluated in vitro. By comparing inhibitory concentration at half-maximal activity (IC 50), we found that BOA (IC50 = 1.11 \u03bcM) possessed a higher anti-IHNV activity than the antiviral imidazole arctigenin derivatives which were found in our previous study. Besides, BOA could cause profound inhibition of SVCV and MSRV replication. By the reduction assays on cytopathic effect, BOA exhibited a protective effect on two host cell lines. As a typical rhabdovirus, SVCV was chosen as a model to illuminate the anti-rhabdovirus mechanism of BOA. BOA was discovered to not impact directly on viral particles or interfere with SVCV adsorption. And it worked within the 2-6 h of the early phase of virus replication. In addition, after repression of cell cycle S phase and recovery of caspase-3/8/9 activities activated by SVCV, BOA inhibited SVCV-induced apoptosis and then reduced the release of viral particles at the late stage of virus replication. Altogether, BOA was expected to be a highly efficient antiviral agent against multiple rhabdoviruses in the field of aquaculture.", "Keywords": ["Antiviral activity", "Apoptosis", "Arctigenin derivatives", "Rhabdovirus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Aquaculture", "Cell Line", "Fish Diseases", "Fishes", "Furans", "Lignans", "Rhabdoviridae", "Rhabdoviridae Infections", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yu-Feng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Xinong Road 22nd, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yi-Hang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Xinong Road 22nd, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Bo-Yang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Xinong Road 22nd, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Tian-Qiang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Xinong Road 22nd, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.

The rational design of these OSDAs often entails the identification of molecules with a geometry that is commensurate with the channels and cages of the target zeolite structure. Syntheses tend to employ only a single OSDA, but there are a few examples where two or more organics operate synergistically to yield a desired product. Using a combination of state-of-the-art characterization techniques and molecular modeling, we show that the coupling of N,N,N-trimethyl-1,1-adamantammonium and 1,2-hexanediol, each yielding distinct zeolites when used alone, results in the cooperative direction of a third structure, HOU-4, with the mordenite framework type (MOR). Rietveld refinement using synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveals the spatial arrangement of the organics in the HOU-4 crystals, with amines located in the large channels and alcohols oriented in the side pockets lining the one-dimensional pores. These results are in excellent agreement with molecular dynamics calculations, which predict similar spatial distributions of organics with an energetically favorable packing density that agrees with experimental measurements of OSDA loading, as well as with solid-state two-dimensional 27Al{29Si}, 27Al{1H}, and 13C{1H} NMR correlation spectra, which establish the proximities and interactions of occluded OSDAs. A combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to quantify the size of the HOU-4 crystals, which exhibit a platelike morphology, and to index the crystal facets. Our findings reveal that the combined OSDAs work in tandem to produce ultrathin, nonfaulted HOU-4 crystals that exhibit improved catalytic activity for cumene cracking in comparison to mordenite crystals prepared via conventional syntheses. This novel demonstration of cooperativity highlights the potential possibilities for expanding the use of dual structure-directing agents in zeolite synthesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Manjesh", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , University of Houston , 4726 Calhoun Road , Houston , Texas 77204 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Zachariah J", "Last Name": "Berkson", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering , University of California, Santa Barbara , Santa Barbara , California 93106 , United States."}, {"First Name": "R John", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , University of Houston , 4726 Calhoun Road , Houston , Texas 77204 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , University of Houston , 4726 Calhoun Road , Houston , Texas 77204 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Nathan A", "Last Name": "Prisco", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering , University of California, Santa Barbara , Santa Barbara , California 93106 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Materials Sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , 1 Cyclotron Road , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhiyuan", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Materials Sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , 1 Cyclotron Road , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Haimei", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Materials Sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , 1 Cyclotron Road , Berkeley , California 94720 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Lynne B", "Last Name": "McCusker", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering , University of California, Santa Barbara , Santa Barbara , California 93106 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy C", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , University of Houston , 4726 Calhoun Road , Houston , Texas 77204 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Bradley F", "Last Name": "Chmelka", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering , University of California, Santa Barbara , Santa Barbara , California 93106 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey D", "Last Name": "Rimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , University of Houston , 4726 Calhoun Road , Houston , Texas 77204 , United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2019Dec26"}, {"PMID": "31727138", "Title": "Novel risk genes and mechanisms implicated by exome sequencing of 2572 individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "Abstract": "Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with high mortality despite recent therapeutic advances.

Our previous study indicated that imidazole arctigenin derivatives possessed antiviral activities against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Based on the structure-activity relationship in that study, a new imidazole arctigenin derivative, 4-(8-(2-ethylimidazole)octyloxy)-arctigenin (EOA), was designed, synthesized and its anti-IHNV activity was evaluated. By comparing inhibitory concentration at half-maximal activity (IC50), we found that EOA (IC50\u202f=\u202f0.56\u202fmg/L) possessed a higher antiviral activity than those imidazole arctigenin derivatives in our previous study. Besides, EOA could significantly decrease cytopathic effect (CPE) and viral titer induced by IHNV in epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells. In addition, EOA significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by IHNV in EPC cells. Further data verified that EOA inhibited IHNV replication in rainbow trout, with reducing 32.0% mortality of IHNV-infected fish. The results suggested that EOA was more stable with a prolonged inhibitory half-life in the early stage of virus infection (1-4 days). Consistent with above results, EOA repressed IHNV glycoprotein gene expression in virus sensitive tissues (kidney and spleen) in the early stage of virus infection. Moreover, histopathological evaluation showed that tissues from the spleen and kidney of fish infected with IHNV exhibited pathological changes.

We demonstrated the utility of SFE-LC-FTMS, including results from both Orbitrap and FTICR MS, for analysis of complex mixtures of organic compounds in a solid matrix by characterizing soil organic matter in peat, a high-carbon soil. For example, in a single experiment, >6000 molecular formulas can be assigned based upon FTICR MS data from 1-50 \u03bcL of soil samples (roughly 1-50 mg of soil, dependent on soil density), nearly twice that typically obtained from direct infusion liquid solvent extraction (LSE) from an order of magnitude larger volume of the same soil. The detected species consisted predominately of lipid-like, lignin-like and protein-like compounds, based on their O/C and H/C ratios, with predominantly CHO and CHONP molecular compositions. These results clearly demonstrate that SFE has the potential to effectively extract a variety of molecular species and could become an important member of a suite of extraction methods for studying SOM and other natural organic matter. This is especially true when comprehensive coverage, minimal sample volumes, and high sensitivity are required, or when the presence of organic solvent residue in residual soil is problematic.

Replicate humanized mice generated diverse and highly divergent repertoires. Repertoire narrowing and increased CDR3\u03b2 sharing was observed during thymocyte selection. While hydrophobicity analysis implicated self-peptides in positive selection of the overall repertoire, positive selection favored shorter shared sequences that had reduced hydrophobicity at positions 6 and 7 of CDR3\u03b2s, suggesting weaker interactions with self-peptides than unshared sequences, possibly allowing escape from negative selection. Sharing was similar between autologous and allogeneic thymi and occurred between different cell subsets. Shared sequences were enriched for allo-crossreactive CDR3\u03b2s and for Type 1 diabetes-associated autoreactive CDR3\u03b2s. Single-cell TCR-sequencing showed increased sharing of CDR3\u03b1s compared to CDR3\u03b2s between mice.

Biosynthesis of hypusine is a two-step reaction involving the enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). eIF5A is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and plays a role in mRNA translation, cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, and inflammation. DHPS is also highly conserved and is essential for life, as Dhps-null mice are embryonic lethal.

These individuals have similar neurodevelopmental features that include global developmental delay and seizures. Two of four affected females have short stature.

Previous exome sequencing studies for CDH have supported a role of de novo damaging variants but did not identify any recurrently mutated genes. To investigate further the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 362 proband-parent trios including 271 new trios reported in this study. We identified four unrelated individuals with damaging de novo variants in MYRF (P = 5.3x10(-8)), including one likely gene-disrupting (LGD) and three deleterious missense (D-mis) variants. Eight additional individuals with de novo LGD or missense variants were identified from our other genetic studies or from the literature. Common phenotypes of MYRF de novo variant carriers include CDH, congenital heart disease and genitourinary abnormalities, suggesting that it represents a novel syndrome. MYRF is a membrane associated transcriptional factor highly expressed in developing diaphragm and is depleted of LGD variants in the general population. All de novo missense variants aggregated in two functional protein domains. Analyzing the transcriptome of patient-derived diaphragm fibroblast cells suggest that disease associated variants abolish the transcription factor activity. Furthermore, we showed that the remaining genes with damaging variants in CDH significantly overlap with genes implicated in other developmental disorders. Gene expression patterns and patient phenotypes support pleiotropic effects of damaging variants in these genes on CDH and other developmental disorders. Finally, functional enrichment analysis implicates the disruption of regulation of gene expression, kinase activities, intra-cellular signaling, and cytoskeleton organization as pathogenic mechanisms in CDH.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child, Preschool", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Developmental Disabilities", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Hernias,

We followed the phenotypes of chimeric peripheral blood cells in 21 patients receiving intestinal allografts over 5 years. Donor lymphocyte phenotypes suggested a contribution of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the graft. Surprisingly, we detected donor-derived HSPCs in intestinal mucosa, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver. Human gut HSPCs are phenotypically similar to bone marrow HSPCs and have multilineage differentiation potential in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Analysis of circulating post-transplant donor T\u00a0cells suggests that they undergo selection in recipient lymphoid organs to acquire immune tolerance. Our longitudinal study of human HSPCs carried in intestinal allografts demonstrates their turnover kinetics and gradual replacement of donor-derived HSPCs from a circulating pool.

Human allograft tolerance has been intentionally induced across HLA barriers via combined kidney and bone marrow transplantation (CKBMT) with a regimen that induces only transient chimerism. Tregs are enriched early after CKBMT. While deletional tolerance contributes to long-term tolerance, the role of Tregs remains unclear. We have optimized a method for identifying the donor-specific Treg repertoire and used it to interrogate the fate of donor-specific Tregs after CKBMT. We expanded Tregs with several different protocols. Using functional analyses and T cell receptor sequencing, we found that expanding sorted Tregs with activated donor B cells identified the broadest Treg repertoire with the greatest potency and donor specificity of suppression. This method outperformed both alloantigen stimulation with CTLA4Ig and sequencing of CFSElo cells from the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction. In 3 tolerant and 1 nontolerant CKBMT recipients, we sequenced donor-specific Tregs before transplant and tracked them after transplant. Preexisting donor-specific Tregs were expanded at 6 months after CKBMT in tolerant patients and were reduced in the nontolerant patient.

In the previous study, we designed and synthesized a coumarin derivative, 7-(4-benzimidazole-butoxy)-coumarin (BBC), to evaluate its antiviral activity on spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV). In this study, our results show that BBC does not affect viral adhesion and delivery from endosomes to the cytosol, indicating BBC has no inhibitory activity in the early stage of viral infection. Further data are determined that BBC significantly declines SVCV-infected apoptosis and recovers caspase-3/8/9 activity. To reveal the pathway that affects Nrf2 translocation by BBC, we examine changes in protein kinase C (PKC) in EPC cells treated with BBC. We observe that BBC results in a higher phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 that is involved in the activation of erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) phosphorylation to favor Nrf2 translocation to nucleus at 24 and 48\u202fh. In addition, the results show that BBC also up-regulates both antiviral responses, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and cellular IFN response. Overall, this mechanism of action provides a new therapeutic target for the treatment of SVCV infection, and these results suggest that treatment with BBC is effective in reducing SVCV infection and differently regulates SVCV-induced undesirable conditions.", "Keywords": ["Coumarin", "Heme oxygenase-1", "Nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2", "Protein kinase C", "Spring viraemia of carp virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Cell Line", "Coumarins", "Fish Proteins", "Fishes", "Heme Oxygenase-1", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase C beta", "Rhabdoviridae", "Rhabdoviridae Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Marine Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China; Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.

However, our understanding of T cell responses in human lymphoid sites and their relation to peripheral blood remains sparse. In this study, we used a unique human tissue resource to study human T cells in different anatomical compartments within individual donors and identify a subset of memory CD8+ T cells in LN, which maintain a distinct differentiation and functional profile compared with memory CD8+ T cells in blood, spleen, bone marrow, and lungs. Whole-transcriptome and high-dimensional cytometry by time-of-flight profiling reveals that LN memory CD8+ T cells express signatures of quiescence and self-renewal compared with corresponding populations in blood, spleen, bone marrow, and lung.

Our results demonstrated that D5 had a robust antiviral activity with >90% inhibitory rate of SVCV expression in the host cells. And D5 significantly reduced viral-induced apoptosis and recovered virus-activated caspase-3/8/9 activities. Further data determined that SVCV could alter the cytoskeletal structure of EPC cells, characterized by a circumferential ring of microtubules and a disrupted microfilament organization, whereas cytoskeleton structure in D5-treated cells kept the normal morphology. Mechanistically speaking, D5 could interfere with SVCV replication inside or outside of cells through two different approaches. Before the process of virus entry into EPC cells, D5 had an impact on SVCV glycoprotein structure so as to disrupt viral binding to the cell surface or translocation to the cytosol. Another strategy for D5 to against SVCV was that D5 significantly suppressed SVCV-activated autophagy, which was beneficial for the host cells to restrict SVCV viral replication, accompanied by a higher phosphorylation of Akt-mTOR.

Up to now, there is no approved therapy on SVCV, making them strong public health threat in aquaculture. In this study, the anti-SVCV activities of 12 plant crude extracts were investigated by using epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. Among these plants, Psoralea corylifolia Linn. showed the highest inhibition on SVCV replication, with an inhibitory percentage of 67.98%. Further studies demonstrated that bavachin (BVN), one of the major constituents of Psoralea corylifolia Linn., was also highly effective to SVCV infection. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of BVN on SVCV glycoprotein and nucleoprotein expression were 0.46 (0.29-0.73) and 0.31 (0.13-0.55) mg/L, respectively. In addition, SVCV-induced apoptosis which may be negative to SVCV replication was inhibited by BVN. The apoptotic cells were decreased 21.42% for BVN compared with SVCV group. These results indicated that the inhibition of BVN on SVCV replication was, in some extent, via blocking SVCV induced apoptosis. Furthermore, cellular morphological damage induced by SVCV was also blocked by BVN treatment. Mechanistically, BVN did not affect SVCV infectivity and cannot be used for prevention of SVCV infection. Time-of-addition and viral binding assays revealed that BVN mainly inhibited the early events of SVCV replication but did not interfere with SVCV adsorption.

Accurate prediction of haploinsufficient genes is essential for prioritizing and interpreting deleterious variants in genetic studies.

Here we show haploinsufficiency is strongly associated with epigenomic patterns, and develop a computational method (Episcore) to predict haploinsufficiency leveraging epigenomic data from a broad range of tissue and cell types by machine learning methods. Based on data from recent exome sequencing studies on developmental disorders, Episcore achieves better performance in prioritizing likely-gene-disrupting (LGD) de novo variants than current methods. We further show that Episcore is less-biased by gene size, and complementary to mutation intolerance metrics for prioritizing LGD variants.

To address the urgent need for therapeutics to combat SVCV infection, we investigated the anti-SVCV activities of 12 natural compounds and 7 common antiviral agents using epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells in this study. From the 19 compounds, we identified arctigenin (ARG) has the highest inhibition on SVCV replication, with maximum inhibitory percentage on SVCV\u00a0>\u00a090%. And the 48\u00a0h half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ARG on SVCV glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were 0.29 (0.22-0.39) and 0.35 (0.29-0.41)\u00a0mg/L respectively. In addition, ARG significantly reduced SVCV-induced apoptosis and recovered SVCV-activated caspase-3/8/9 activity. Further, cellular morphological damage induced by SVCV was blocked by ARG treatment. Mechanistically, ARG did not affect SVCV infectivity. Moreover, ARG could not induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which plays an antiviral role on SVCV. Interestingly, SVCV-induced autophagy which is necessary for virus replication was inhibited by ARG treatment. These results indicated that the inhibition of ARG on SVCV replication was, at least in part, via blocking SVCV-induced autophagy.

The vast majority of syntheses require the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), which has economic and environmental shortcomings. In the search for alternative zeolites to common industrial catalysts, such as ZSM-5 (MFI), a promising candidate is ZSM-11 (MEL), a close structural analogue of MFI. ZSM-11 is comprised of 3-dimensional straight channels that have less diffusion limitations than MFI. Side-by-side comparisons of ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 catalysts reveal the former exhibits significantly longer time-on-stream lifetime in many reactions; however, there are several difficulties associated with the preparation of ZSM-11, which include the ability to identify inexpensive OSDAs that produce small crystals in high yield. Here, we examine ZSM-11 synthesis using 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO), which produces ZSM-11 crystals with sizes of ca. 300\u2005nm. We demonstrate that the use of MEL seeds allows for an order of magnitude reduction in the quantity of DAO without sacrificing crystal purity or yield (>80\u2009%). Catalytic tests using methanol to hydrocarbons as a representative reaction show that H-ZSM-11 lifetime and selectivity are similar for samples prepared with and without seeds.

Intriguingly, some of the effects appear to differ between soma and germline: in particular, whereas mutation rates have been reported to decrease with expression levels in tumors, no clear effect has been detected in the germline. Distinct approaches were taken to analyze the data, however, so it is hard to know whether these apparent differences are real. To enable a cleaner comparison, we considered a statistical model in which the mutation rate of a coding region is predicted by GC content, expression levels, replication timing, and two histone repressive marks. We applied this model to both a set of germline mutations identified in exomes and to exonic somatic mutations in four types of tumors. Most determinants of mutations are shared: notably, we detected an effect of expression levels on both germline and somatic mutation rates. Moreover, in all tissues considered, higher expression levels are associated with greater strand asymmetry of mutations. However, mutation rates increase with expression levels in testis (and, more tentatively, in ovary), whereas they decrease with expression levels in somatic tissues.

A combined analysis with 39 additional trios with complex CDH, previously published, revealed a significant genome-wide burden of de novo variants compared to background mutation rate and 900 control trios. We identified an increased burden of likely gene-disrupting (LGD, i.e. nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site) and predicted deleterious missense (D-mis) variants in complex and isolated CDH patients. Overall, an excess of predicted damaging de novo LGD and D-mis variants relative to the expected frequency contributed to 21% of complex cases and 12% of isolated CDH cases. The burden of de novo variants was higher in genes expressed in the developing mouse diaphragm and heart. Some overlap with genes responsible for congenital heart defects and neurodevelopmental disorders was observed in CDH patients within our cohorts.

In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like recipient CD28+ NKG2DHi CD8+ alpha beta T cells, marked predominance of HvG clones, and accelerated T cell turnover in the graft. Ultimately, these recipient T cells acquired a steady state tissue-resident phenotype, but regained CD28 expression during rejections.

Herein, we report use of long (\u22651M) columns containing short alkyl (C1-C4) bonded phases to achieve high-resolution RPLC for separation of proteoforms. At a specific operation pressure limit (i.e., 96.5MPa or 14Kpsi used in this work), column length was found to be the most important factor for achieving maximal resolution separation of proteins when 1.5-5\u03bcm particles were used as packings and long columns provided peak capacities greater than 400 for proteoforms derived from a global cell lysate with molecular weights below 50kDa. Larger proteoforms (50-110kDa) were chromatographed on long RPLC columns and detected by MS; however, they cannot be identified yet by tandem mass spectrometry. Our experimental data further demonstrated that long alkyl (e.g., C8 and C18) bonded particles provided high-resolution RPLC for <10kDa proteoforms, not efficient for separation of global proteoforms. Reversed-phase particles with porous, nonporous, and superficially porous surfaces were systematically investigated for high-resolution RPLC. Pore size (200-400\u00c5) and the surface structure (porous and superficially porous) of particles was found to have minor influences on high-resolution RPLC of proteoforms. RPLC presented herein enabled confident identification of \u223c900 proteoforms (1% FDR) for a low-microgram quantity of proteomic samples using a single RPLC-MS/MS analysis. The level of RPLC performance attained in this work is close to that typically realized in bottom-up proteomics, and broadly useful when applying e.g., the single-stage MS accurate mass tag approach, but less effective when combined with current tandem MS. Our initial data indicate that MS detection and fragmentation inefficiencies provided by current high-resolution mass spectrometers are key challenges for characterization of larger proteoforms.", "Keywords": ["Columns and stationary phases", "Intact proteins", "Mass spectrometry", "Proteoforms", "Top-down proteomics", "UPLC"], "MeSH terms": ["Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Chromatography, Reverse-Phase", "Peptides", "Porosity", "Pressure", "Proteins", "Proteomics", "Surface Properties", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354, USA.

measure directly in patients. High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires (TCRseq) provides a population-wide statistical description of how T cells respond to disease. We have defined immunophenotypes of whole repertoires based on TCRseq of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains from glioma tissue, nonneoplastic brain tissue, and peripheral blood from patients. Using information theory, we partitioned the diversity of these TCR repertoires into that from the distribution of VJ cassette combinations and diversity due to VJ-independent factors, such as selection due to antigen binding. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) possessed higher VJ-independent diversity than nonneoplastic tissue, stratifying patients according to tumor grade. We found that the VJ-independent components of tumor-associated repertoires diverge more from their corresponding peripheral repertoires than T-cell populations in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly for low-grade gliomas. Finally, we identified a \"signature\" set of TCRs whose use in peripheral blood is associated with patients exhibiting low TIL divergence and is depleted in patients with highly divergent TIL repertoires. This signature is detectable in peripheral blood, and therefore accessible noninvasively. We anticipate that these immunophenotypes will be foundational to monitoring and predicting response to antiglioma vaccines and immunotherapy.", "Keywords": ["T-cell receptor", "glioblastoma", "glioma", "immunooncology", "immunoprofiling"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Glioma", "Humans", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer S", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Boris", "Last Name": "Grinshpun", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Yaping", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Waksman Institute of Microbiology Genomics Core Facility, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854;"}, {"First Name": "Timothy H", "Last Name": "Ung", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Department of Neurosurgery, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045;"}, {"First Name": "Justin A", "Last Name": "Neira", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Jorge L", "Last Name": "Samanamud", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; ys2411@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 ys2411@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; ys2411@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2016Jun21"}, {"PMID": "27094857", "Title": "A recurrent de novo CTBP1 mutation is associated with developmental delay, hypotonia, ataxia, and tooth enamel defects.", "Abstract": "Exome sequencing is an effective way to identify genetic causes of etiologically heterogeneous conditions such as developmental delay and intellectual disabilities.

We highlight the historical development of assays to measure alloreactivity and discuss how high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing-based assays can provide a new window into the fate of alloreactive T cells in human transplant recipients. A specific approach combining a classical in vitro assay, the mixed lymphocyte reaction, with deep T cell receptor sequencing is described as a tool to track the donor-reactive T cell repertoire for any specific HLA-mismatched donor-recipient pair.

This study investigated the anti-Saprolegnia activity of a total of 108 plants on Saprolegnia parasitica in vitro and Dioscorea collettii was selected for further studies. By loading on an open silica gel column and eluting with petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-methanol, dioscin (C45H72O16) was isolated from D. collettii. Saprolegnia parasitica growth was inhibited significantly when dioscin concentration was more than 2.0 mg\u00a0L(-1). When compared with formalin and hydrogen peroxide, dioscin showed a higher inhibitory effect. As potential inhibition mechanisms, dioscin could cause the S. parasitica mycelium morphologic damage, dense folds, or disheveled protuberances observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and the influx of Propidium iodide. The structural changes in the treated mycelium were indicative of an efficient anti-Saprolegnia activity of dioscin. The oxidative stress results showed that dioscin also accumulated reactive oxygen species excessively and increased total antioxidant and superoxide dismutase activity. These situations could render S. parasitica more vulnerable to oxidative damage. Additionally, when dioscin concentration was less than 2.0 mg\u00a0L(-1), the survival rate of embryos was more than 70%.

SeqMule integrates computational-cluster-free parallelization capability built on top of the variant callers, and facilitates normalization/intersection of variant calls to generate consensus set with high confidence. SeqMule integrates 5 alignment tools, 5 variant calling algorithms and accepts various combinations all by one-line command, therefore allowing highly flexible yet fully automated variant calling. In a modern machine (2 Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, 48 GB memory), when fast turn-around is needed, SeqMule generates annotated VCF files in a day from a 30X whole-genome sequencing data set; when more accurate calling is needed, SeqMule generates consensus call set that improves over single callers, as measured by both Mendelian error rate and consistency.

Both are characterized by distinctive blistering lesions and significant mortality rates. While there is evidence for strong drug-specific genetic predisposition related to HLA alleles, recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) on European and Asian populations have failed to identify genetic susceptibility alleles that are common across multiple drugs. We hypothesize that this is a consequence of the low to moderate effect size of individual genetic risk factors. To test this hypothesis we developed Pointer, a new algorithm that assesses the aggregate effect of multiple low risk variants on a pathway using a gene set enrichment approach. A key advantage of our method is the capability to associate SNPs with genes by exploiting physical proximity as well as by using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that capture information about both cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects. We control for known bias-inducing aspects of enrichment based analyses, such as: 1) gene length, 2) gene set size, 3) presence of biologically related genes within the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, and, 4) genes shared among multiple gene sets. We applied this approach to publicly available SJS/TEN genome-wide genotype data and identified the ABC transporter and Proteasome pathways as potentially implicated in the genetic susceptibility of non-drug-specific SJS/TEN. We demonstrated that the innovative SNP-to-gene mapping phase of the method was essential in detecting the significant enrichment for those pathways. Analysis of an independent gene expression dataset provides supportive functional evidence for the involvement of Proteasome pathways in SJS/TEN cutaneous lesions. These results suggest that Pointer provides a useful framework for the integrative analysis of pharmacogenetic GWAS data, by increasing the power to detect aggregate effects of multiple low risk variants.

Candidate genes and surrounding regions showed elevated polymorphism, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and lower levels of population differentiation, but they did not show greater between-species divergence.

As sporadic complex CDH likely has a significant impact on reproductive fitness, we hypothesized that de novo variants would account for the etiology in a significant fraction of cases. We performed exome sequencing in 39 CDH trios and compared the frequency of de novo variants with 787 unaffected controls from the Simons Simplex Collection. We found no significant difference in overall frequency of de novo variants between cases and controls. However, among genes that are highly expressed during diaphragm development, there was a significant burden of likely gene disrupting (LGD) and predicted deleterious missense variants in cases (fold enrichment = 3.2, P-value = 0.003), and these genes are more likely to be haploinsufficient (P-value = 0.01) than the ones with benign missense or synonymous de novo variants in cases. After accounting for the frequency of de novo variants in the control population, we estimate that 15% of sporadic complex CDH patients are attributable to de novo LGD or deleterious missense variants. We identified several genes with predicted deleterious de novo variants that fall into common categories of genes related to transcription factors and cell migration that we believe are related to the pathogenesis of CDH.

We now establish an assay to identify donor-reactive T cells and test the role of deletion in tolerance after CKBMT. Using high-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor B chain CDR3 region, we define a fingerprint of the donor-reactive T cell repertoire before transplantation and track those clones after transplant. We observed posttransplant reductions in donor-reactive T cell clones in three tolerant CKBMT patients; such reductions were not observed in a fourth, nontolerant, CKBMT patient or in two conventional kidney transplant recipients on standard immunosuppressive regimens. T cell repertoire turnover due to lymphocyte-depleting conditioning only partially accounted for the observed reductions in tolerant patients; in fact, conventional transplant recipients showed expansion of circulating donor-reactive clones, despite extensive repertoire turnover. Moreover, loss of donor-reactive T cell clones more closely associated with tolerance induction than in vitro functional assays.

leukocyote antigen (HLA) alleles as the major risk factors of drug-induced liver injuries (DILI). While these alleles often cause large relative risk, their predictive values are quite low due to low prevalence of idiosyncratic DILI. Finding additional risk factors is important for precision medicine. However, optimal design of further genetic studies is hindered by uncertain overall heritability of DILI. This is a common problem for low-prevalence pharmacological traits, since it is difficult to obtain clinical outcome data in families. Here we estimated the heritability (h(2)) of DILI from case-control genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data using a method based on random effect models. We estimated the proportion of h(2) captured by common SNPs for DILI to be between 0.3 and 0.5. For co-amoxiclav induced DILI, chromosome 6 explained part of the heritability, indicating additional contributions from common variants yet to be found. We performed simulations to assess the robustness of the h(2) estimate with limited sample size under low prevelance, a condition typical to studies on idiosyncratic pharmacological traits. Our findings suggest that common variants outside of HLA contribute to DILI susceptability; therefore, it is valuable to conduct further GWAS with expanded case collection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination", "Case-Control Studies", "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6", "Floxacillin", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "beta-Lactamase Inhibitors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Casey Lynnette", "Last Name": "Overby", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY [2]."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Hripcsak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY [2] Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY [3] JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2014Jul21"}, {"PMID": "24771342", "Title": "CANOES: detecting rare copy number variants from whole exome sequencing data.", "Abstract": "We present CANOES, an algorithm for the detection of rare copy number variants from exome sequencing data.

Here we used genome-wide association analysis to search for common predisposing genetic variants.

Tests of association were carried out for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by logistic regression adjusting for gender and population structure. No SNP reached genome wide-significance; the variant with the lowest P value was rs2276314, a non-synonymous coding variant in C18orf21 (p \u200a=\u200a 3\u00d710(-7), odds ratio\u200a=\u200a2, 95% confidence intervals: 1.5-2.6).
