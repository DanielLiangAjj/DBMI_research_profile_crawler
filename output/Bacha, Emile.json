We examined our septation experience with over 30\u00a0years of follow-up. We retrospectively reviewed patients with double-inlet ventricle from 1990 to 2011. Patients with two adequate atrioventricular valves, a volume-overloaded ventricle, and no significant subaortic obstruction were septation candidates. Of 98 double-inlet ventricle patients, 9 (9.2%) underwent attempted septation via a one-stage (n\u2009=\u20092, 22.2%) or two-stage (n\u2009=\u20097, 77.8%) approach. Ages at primary septation were 7.5 and 20.2\u00a0months. In the staged group, median age at the first and second stage was 8.3\u00a0months [range 4.1-14.7] and 22.4\u00a0months [range 11.4-195.7], respectively. There were no operative mortalities. Median follow-up was 18.8\u00a0years [range 0.4-32.9] and 30-year transplant-free survival was 77.8%\u2009\u00b1\u200913.9%. Both single stage patients are alive and in sinus rhythm; 1 underwent bilateral outflow tract obstruction repair 27\u00a0years later. Of 7 patients planned for two-stage septation, there was 1 interval mortality and 1 deferred the second stage. Five patients underwent the second stage; 1 required early reintervention for a residual neo-septal defect and 1 underwent right atrioventricular valve replacement 28\u00a0years later. Three patients required a pacemaker preoperatively (n\u2009=\u20091) or after partial septation (n\u2009=\u20092). At latest follow-up, 7 patients have normal biventricular function and no significant valvulopathy. All remain NYHA functional class I. Select double-inlet ventricles may be septated with excellent long-term outcomes.

Clinical and echocardiographic predictors for LVOTO reoperation are controversial and procedures to prophylactically prevent future LVOTO are not reliable. However, it is important to identify the patients at risk for future LVOTO intervention after repair of IAA-VSD. Patients who underwent single-stage IAA-VSD repair at our center 2006-2021 were retrospectively reviewed, excluding patients with associated cardiac lesions. Two-dimensional measurements, LVOT gradients, and 4-chamber (4C) and short-axis (SAXM) strain were obtained from preoperative and predischarge echocardiograms. Univariate risk analysis for LVOTO reoperation was performed using unpaired t-test. Thirty patients were included with 21 (70%) IAA subtype B and mean weight at surgery 3.0\u00a0kg. Repair included aortic arch patch augmentation in 20 patients and subaortic obstruction intervention in three patients. Seven (23%) required reoperations for LVOTO. Patient characteristics were similar between patients who required LVOT reoperation and those who did not. Patch augmentation was not associated with LVOTO reintervention. Patients requiring reintervention had significantly smaller LVOT AP diameter preoperatively and at discharge, and higher LVOT velocity, smaller AV annular diameter, and ascending aortic diameter at discharge. There was an association between LVOT-indexed cross-sectional area (CSAcm2/BSAm2)\u2009\u2264\u20090.7 and reintervention. There was no significant difference in 4C or SAXM strain in patients requiring reintervention. LVOTO reoperation was not associated with preoperative clinical or surgical variables but was associated with smaller LVOT on preoperative echo and smaller LVOT, smaller AV annular diameter, and increased LVOT velocity at discharge.", "Keywords": ["Aortic arch repair", "Echocardiography", "Interrupted aortic arch", "Reintervention"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Retrospective Studies", "Male", "Reoperation", "Aorta, Thoracic", "Echocardiography", "Ventricular Outflow Obstruction", "Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular", "Infant", "Postoperative Complications", "Infant, Newborn", "Treatment Outcome", "Cardiac Surgical Procedures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hannah L", "Last Name": "McMullen", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Stanford Health Care, Palo Alto, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jamie K", "Last Name": "Harrington", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Blitzer", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Section of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children Hospital-New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, 3959 Broadway, CHN-274, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikhil", "Last Name": "Pasumarti", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Morgan Stanley Children Hospital-New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, 3959 Broadway, CHN-274, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "St\u00e9phanie", "Last Name": "Levasseur", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Morgan Stanley Children Hospital-New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, 3959 Broadway, CHN-274, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emile", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Section of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children Hospital-New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, 3959 Broadway, CHN-274, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kalfa", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Section of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children Hospital-New York Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, 3959 Broadway, CHN-274, New York, NY, 10032, USA. dk2757@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38350595", "Title": "Optimal timing of Ross operation in children: A moving target?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Ross operation", "aortic valve", "congenital heart disease", "heart", "infants", "neonates", "pediatric"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Igor E", "Last Name": "Konstantinov", "Affiliation": "Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne Centre for Cardiovascular Genomics and Regenerative Medicine, Melbourne, Australia.

Post-operative stenosis can occur after repair of anomalous pulmonary venous return (APVR) or stenosis within native veins. There is limited data on the outcomes of post-operative PVS. Our objective was to review our experience and assess surgical and transcatheter outcomes. Single-center retrospective study was performed including patients\u2009<\u200918\u00a0years who developed restenosis after baseline pulmonary vein surgery that required additional intervention(s) from 1/2005 to 1/2020. Non-invasive imaging, catheterization and surgical data were reviewed.\u00a0We identified 46 patients with post-operative PVS with 11 (23.9%) patient deaths. Median age at index procedure was 7.2\u00a0months (range 1\u00a0month-10\u00a0years), and median follow-up was 10.8\u00a0months (range 1\u00a0day-13\u00a0years). Index procedure was surgical in 36 (78.3%) and transcatheter in 10 (21.7%). Twenty-three (50%) patients developed vein atresia. Mortality was not associated with number of affected veins, vein atresia, or procedure type. Single ventricle physiology, complex congenital heart disease (CCHD), and genetic disorders were associated with mortality. Survival rate was higher in APVR patients (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Patients with three or more interventions had a higher survival rate compared to patients with 1-2 interventions (p\u2009=\u20090.02). Male gender, necrotizing enterocolitis, and diffuse hypoplasia were associated with vein atresia. In post-operative PVS, mortality is associated with CCHD, single ventricle physiology, and genetic disorders. Vein atresia is associated with male gender, necrotizing enterocolitis, and diffuse hypoplasia.

Different compositions of teams trained in cardiology, critical care, cardiothoracic surgery, anesthesia, and neonatology have been identified as being primarily responsible for perioperative care of this high-risk population in dedicated cardiac intensive care units (CICUs). Although the specific role of cardiac intensivists has become more well defined over the past two decades, the responsibilities of neonatologists remain highly variable in the CICU with neonatologists providing care along with a unique spectrum of primary, shared, or consultative care. The neonatologist can function as the primary physician and assume all or share responsibility with the cardiac intensivists for the management of infants with CHD. A neonatologist can provide care as a secondary consultant physician in a supportive role for the primary CICU team. Additionally, neonates with CHD can be mixed with older children in a CICU, cohorted in a dedicated space within the CICU or placed in a stand-alone infant CICU without older children. Although variations exist between centers on which model of care is deployed and the location within a CICU, characterization of current practice patterns represents the initial step required to determine optimal best practices to improve the quality of care for neonates with cardiac disease. In this manuscript, we present four models utilized in the United States in which the neonatologist provides neonatal-cardiac-focused care in a dedicated CICU. We also outline the different permutations of location where neonates can be cared for in dedicated pediatric/infant CICUs.", "Keywords": ["CICU", "congenital heart disease", "neonatology"], "MeSH terms": ["Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Humans", "Child", "United States", "Adolescent", "Neonatology", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Intensive Care Units", "Critical Care", "Perioperative Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paulomi M", "Last Name": "Chaudhry", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shawn", "Last Name": "Sen", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology and Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina", "Last Name": "Steurer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor Y", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sharada", "Last Name": "Gowda", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Molly K", "Last Name": "Ball", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amir", "Last Name": "Ashrafi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, CHOC Children's Hospital, Orange, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sitaram M", "Last Name": "Emani", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiac Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital, Department of Surgery, Harvard Medical School Boston, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emile A", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Checchia", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip T", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Division of Newborn Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ganga", "Last Name": "Krishnamurthy", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37290690", "Title": "Commentary: The yin and yang in tetralogy of Fallot surgery.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Tetralogy of Fallot"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emile", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "Section of Pediatric and Adult Congenital Cardiac Surgery, Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, NY.

This study demonstrates the in vitro proof of concept of a biostable polymeric trileaflet valved conduit designed for surgical implantation and subsequent expansion via transcatheter balloon dilation to accommodate the growth of pediatric patients and delay or avoid repeated open-heart surgeries. The valved conduit is formed via dip molding using a polydimethylsiloxane-based polyurethane, a biocompatible material shown here to be capable of permanent stretching under mechanical loading. The valve leaflets are designed with an increased coaptation area to preserve valve competence at expanded diameters. Four 22\u00a0mm diameter valved conduits are tested in vitro for hydrodynamics, balloon dilated to new permanent diameters of 23.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0mm, and then tested again. Upon further dilation, two valved conduits sustain leaflet tears, while the two surviving devices reach final diameters of 24.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0mm. After each successful dilation, the valved conduits show increased effective orifice areas and decreased transvalvular pressure differentials while maintaining low regurgitation. These results demonstrate concept feasibility and motivate further development of a polymeric balloon-expandable device to replace valves in children and avoid reoperations.", "Keywords": ["congenital heart disease", "growth accommodation", "polymeric valves", "right ventricular outflow tract", "valved conduit"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Heart Valve Diseases", "Biocompatible Materials", "Catheters", "Prosthesis Design"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Richard L", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Section of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, New-York Presbyterian -

Here, we report the development, optimization, and testing of a biomimetic, multilayered material (BMM), designed to replicate the native valve leaflets. Polycarbonate urethane and polycaprolactone have been processed as film, foam, and aligned fibers to replicate the leaflet's architecture and anisotropy, through solution casting, lyophilization, and electrospinning. Compared to the commercialized materials, our BMMs exhibited an anisotropic behavior and a closer mechanical performance to the aortic leaflets. The material exhibited superior biostability in an accelerated oxidization environment. It also displayed better resistance to protein adsorption and calcification in vitro and in vivo.

Our objective was to assess survival and identify predictors of re-operation. Data were retrospectively collected for 314 patients undergoing bAVR at 8 centers from 2000-2014. Kaplan-Meier estimation of time to re-operation and Cox regression were utilized. Average age was 45.2 years (IQR 17.8-71.1) and 30% were <21. Indications were stenosis (48%), regurgitation (28%) and mixed (18%). Twenty-eight (9%) underwent prior AVR. Median valve size was 23mm (IQR 21, 25). Implanted valves included CE (Carpentier-Edwards) Perimount (47%), CE Magna/Magna Ease (29%), Sorin Mitroflow (9%), St Jude (2%) and other (13%). Median follow-up was 2.9 (IQR 1.2, 5.7) years. Overall, 11% required re-operation, 35% of whom had a Mitroflow and 65% were <21 years old. Time to re-operation varied among valve type (p=0.020). Crude 3-year rate was 20% in patients \u226421. Smaller valve size indexed to BSA was associated with re-operation (21.7 vs. 23.5 mm/m2). Predictors of reintervention by multivariable analysis were younger age (29% increase in hazard per 5-year decrease, p<0.001), Mitroflow (HR=4 to 8 versus other valves), and smaller valve size (20% increase in hazard per 1 mm decrease, p=0.002). The overall 1, 3 and 5-year survival rates were 94%, 90% and 85% without differences by valve (p=0.19). A concerning reduction in 5-year survival after bAVR is shown.

Based on early follow-up data the valve design was modified; we report on the comparative performance of the two designs at 12 months post-implantation. Methods: Twelve children (six male) median age 5 (2 to 12) years and weight 17 (10 to 43) kg, had implantation of the first XPV valve design (XPV-1, group 1; 16 mm (n = 5), and 18 mm (n = 7). All had had previous surgery. Based on XPV performance at 12 months, the leaflet design was modified and an additional six children (five male) with complex malformations, median age 5 (3 to 9) years, and weight 21 (14 to 29) kg underwent implantation of the new XPV (XPV-2, group 2; 18 mm in all). For both subgroups, the 12 month clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were compared. Results: All patients in both groups have completed 12 months of follow-up. All are in NYHA functional class I. Seventeen of the 18 conduits have shown no evidence of progressive stenosis, dilation or aneurysm formation. Residual gradients of >40 mm Hg were observed in three patients in group 1 due to kinking of the conduit (n = 1), and peripheral stenosis of the branch pulmonary arteries (n = 2). In group 2, one patient developed rapidly progressive stenosis of the proximal conduit anastomosis, requiring conduit replacement. Five patients in group 1 developed severe pulmonary valve regurgitation (PI) due to prolapse of valve leaflet. In contrast, only one patient in group 2 developed more than mild PI at 12 months, which was not related to leaflet prolapse. Conclusions: The XPV, a biorestorative valved conduit, demonstrated promising early clinical outcomes in humans with 17 of 18 patients being free of reintervention at 1 year. Early onset PI seen in the XPV-1 version seems to have been corrected in the XPV-2, which has led to the approval of an FDA clinical trial.

Thrombosis incidence and relationship to thromboprophylaxis choice and timing of initiation are not well established. We sought to evaluate the incidence of Fontan circuit thrombosis in the first 30 postoperative days and its relationship to thromboprophylaxis choice and timing. Patients undergoing Fontan surgery, 2006-2016, were reviewed. Fontan circuit thrombosis was defined by sonographic detection of intracardiac or deep venous thrombi. Logistic regression was used to assess relationships between thromboprophylaxis characteristics and thrombosis. One hundred ninety-two patients underwent Fontan. Fontan thrombosis occurred in 19 (10%) patients. 54% were started on aspirin, 27% coumadin, 4% heparin, and 7% none. There was no relationship between thrombosis and baseline anatomy, Fontan type or fenestration. Median time to thromboprophylaxis initiation was 4 days (interquartile range 2-6). Patients not started on thromboprophylaxis had 44.8 times the odds of thrombosis as those on thromboprophylaxis (confidence interval 6.4-311.7, P < 0.01); no children starting thromboprophylaxis before postoperative day 2 developed thromboses. For every day that thromboprophylaxis was delayed, odds of thrombosis increased by 30% (odds ratio 1.3; CI 1.1-1.6, P < 0.01). There was no difference in the odds of thrombosis between children taking aspirin vs other thromboprophylaxis types. Odds of early postoperative Fontan circuit thrombosis are increased in patients in whom thromboprophylaxis is delayed beyond the second postoperative day, with no difference in the odds of thrombosis between patients initiated on aspirin vs other thromboprophylaxis.

Methods and Results We performed a retrospective review of all individuals with CHD followed at Columbia University Irving Medical Center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020. The primary end point was moderate/severe response to COVID-19 infection defined as (1) death during COVID-19 infection; or (2) need for hospitalization and/or respiratory support secondary to COVID-19 infection. Among 53 COVID-19-positive patients with CHD, 10 (19%) were <18\u00a0years of age (median age 34\u00a0years of age). Thirty-one (58%) had complex congenital anatomy including 10 (19%) with a Fontan repair. Eight (15%) had a genetic syndrome, 6 (11%) had pulmonary hypertension, and 9 (17%) were obese.

A phase 1 study of cangrelor was performed in neonates after palliation of congenital heart disease. PD endpoint of >90% platelet inhibition in 60% of patients was achieved at 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min dosing. No serious adverse events related to drug administration were observed, including bleeding. ABSTRACT: Background Systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt thrombosis is a significant cause of early postoperative mortality in neonates after palliation of congenital heart disease. In the context of thromboprophylaxis, an optimal therapeutic strategy has yet to be established before aspirin administration. Cangrelor, a fast-acting, reversible P2Y12 inhibitor, may fill this unmet need. Objectives To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of cangrelor in neonates undergoing stage 1 palliation. Methods This prospective, open-label, single-arm study evaluated two cangrelor dosing cohorts following placement of a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt, right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt, or ductal stent. Drug concentrations and platelet reactivity, assessed by light transmission aggregometry and in microfluidic assays (MF), were measured. Results Twenty-two patients were consented and 15 received a 1-hour infusion of cangrelor at either 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/kg/min (cohort 1) or 0.25\u00a0\u00b5g/kg/min (cohort 2). Whereas the primary PD endpoint was achieved at the higher dose (ie, reduction in maximal platelet aggregation by \u226590% in 60% of participants), only 29% of those in cohort 2 attained this goal. Comparable and statistically significant results were obtained in MF assays (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001 vs. baseline). Drug levels during infusion were 3-fold higher in cohort 1 vs. cohort 2 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Most participants (70%) had undetectable drug levels by 10\u00a0minutes postinfusion with full recovery in platelet function at 1\u00a0hour. No drug-related bleeding events occurred.

The closure of congenital heart surgery programs worldwide to address the growing number of infected individuals could have an unintended impact on future health for COVID-19-negative patients with CHD. Pediatric and congenital heart surgeons, given their small numbers and close relationships, are uniquely positioned to collectively assess the impact of the pandemic on surgical practice and care of children with CHD.

We used a risk difference analysis in a retrospective cohort, 2006-2016. Neonates born\u2009\u2264\u20092.0\u00a0kg undergoing congenital heart surgery during initial postnatal admission were included. Data were standardized alternatingly for birth weight and cardiac surgical risk using national population data to estimate the number of deaths expected had they not required cardiac surgery or were they of normal weight. Of 105 neonates\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00a0kg, median birth weight was 1.6\u00a0kg (IQR 1.3-1.8\u00a0kg). Median gestational age was 33\u00a0weeks (IQR 31-35\u00a0weeks). Observed operative mortality was 14.3%; 0% for neonates\u2009\u2264\u20091.0\u00a0kg (CI 0-33.6%), 20.6% for neonates\u2009>\u20091.0-1.5\u00a0kg (CI 8.7-37.9%), and 12.9% for neonates\u2009>\u20091.5-2.0\u00a0kg (CI 5.7-23.9%). Among neonates\u2009\u2264\u20092.0\u00a0kg not undergoing cardiac surgery, expected mortality was 4.8% (CI 1.6-10.8); cardiac surgery increased the risk of mortality 9.5% (CI 1.7-17.4%). Conversely, the expected risk for normal birth weight neonates undergoing cardiac surgery was 5.7% (CI 2.1-12.0%); low birth weight increased the risk of mortality 8.6% (CI 0.5-16.6%).

Methods and Results We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 observational studies, comprising 5035 patients, that reported mortality after atrial switch repair with a minimum follow-up of 10\u00a0years. We also examined 4 additional studies comprising 105 patients who reported rates of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in this population. Average survival dropped to 65% at 40\u00a0years after atrial switch repair, with sudden cardiac death accounting for 45% of all reported deaths. Mortality was significantly lower in cohorts that were more recent and operated on younger patients. Patient-level risk factors for late mortality were history of supraventricular tachycardia (odds ratio [OR] 3.8, 95% CI 1.4-10.7), Mustard procedure compared with Senning (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.9-4.5) and complex D-TGA compared with simple D-TGA (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.2-8.8). Significant risk factors for sudden cardiac death were history of supraventricular tachycardia (OR 4.7, 95% CI 2.2-9.8), Mustard procedure (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.1), and complex D-TGA (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.8-18.0). Out of a total 124 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharges over 330 patient-years in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary prevention, only 8% were appropriate. Conclusions Patient-level risk of both mortality and sudden cardiac death after atrial switch repair are significantly increased by history of supraventricular tachycardia, Mustard procedure, and complex D-TGA. This knowledge may help refine current selection practices for primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, given disproportionately high rates of inappropriate discharges.", "Keywords": ["D\u2010transposition of the great arteries", "atrial switch", "long\u2010term outcomes", "mustard", "senning", "sudden cardiac death"], "MeSH terms": ["Arterial Switch Operation", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Humans", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tachycardia, Supraventricular", "Time Factors", "Transposition of Great Vessels"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Prashanth", "Last Name": "Venkatesh", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Center for Adult Congenital Heart Disease New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Arthur T", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Anna M", "Last Name": "Maw", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Medicine Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Raymond A", "Last Name": "Pashun", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Center for Adult Congenital Heart Disease New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Agam", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Center for Adult Congenital Heart Disease New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Luke", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Center for Adult Congenital Heart Disease New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Dmitriy", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Center for Adult Congenital Heart Disease New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Minutello", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Center for Adult Congenital Heart Disease New York NY."}, {"First Name": "S Chiu", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Center for Adult Congenital Heart Disease New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Judy C", "Last Name": "Stribling", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine Samuel J.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology allows for the creation of physical cardiac models that can be used for teaching trainees. 3D printed cardiac models were created for the following lesions: pulmonic stenosis, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, d-transposition of the great arteries, coarctation of the aorta, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Medical students participated in a workshop consisting of different teaching stations. At the 3D printed station, students completed a pre- and post-intervention survey assessing their knowledge of each cardiac lesion on a Likert scale. Students were asked to rank the educational benefit of each modality. Linear regression was utilized to assess the correlation of the mean increase in knowledge with increasing complexity of CHD based on the Aristotle Basic Complexity Level. 45 medical students attended the CHD workshop. Students' knowledge significantly improved for every lesion (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A strong positive correlation was found between mean increase in knowledge and increasing complexity of CHD (R2\u2009=\u20090.73, p\u2009<\u20090.05). The 3D printed models, pathology specimens and spoken explanation were found to be the most helpful modalities. Students \"strongly agreed\" the 3D printed models made them more confident in explaining congenital cardiac anatomy to others (mean\u2009=\u20094.23,\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69), and that they recommend the use of 3D models for future educational sessions (mean\u2009=\u20094.40,\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69). 3D printed cardiac models should be included in medical student education particularly for lesions that require a complex understanding of spatial relationships.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Education, Medical", "Female", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Anatomic", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Self Report", "Students, Medical", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Smerling", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles C", "Last Name": "Marboe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jay H", "Last Name": "Lefkowitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina", "Last Name": "Pavlicova", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emile", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Einstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoshifumi", "Last Name": "Naka", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Glickstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 3959 Broadway, CHN-2, New York, NY, 10023, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kanwal M", "Last Name": "Farooqi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 3959 Broadway, CHN-2, New York, NY, 10023, USA. kf2549@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "31027561", "Title": "Pulmonary Atresia With Intact Ventricular Septum With Borderline Tricuspid Valve: How Small Is Too Small.", "Abstract": "PA/IVS is a rare, heterogenous congenital heart defect anatomically defined by complete obstruction to the right ventricular outflow tract with varying degrees of hypoplasia of the right ventricle and tricuspid valve.

Our objective was to assess the safety of this procedure in infants weighing \u22642.5\u2009kg at the time of surgery. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes for all neonates undergoing the ASO at our institution from 2005 to 2015. Our primary outcome of interest was major morbidity or operative mortality, assessed as a composite outcome. From 2005 to 2015, 217 neonates underwent the ASO, with 31 (14%) weighing \u22642.5\u2009kg at the date of surgery, and 8 weighing <2.0\u2009kg. Neonates weighing \u22642.5\u2009kg were more likely to be premature than those weighing >2.5\u2009kg, but there was no difference in the age at operation between these groups. Overall, 32 infants experienced a major morbidity or mortality, including 37.5% (n\u2009=\u20093) weighing <2.0\u2009kg, 8.7% (n\u2009=\u20092) weighing 2.0-2.5\u2009kg, and 14.5% (n\u2009=\u20097) weighing >2.5\u2009kg (P\u2009=\u20090.141). One infant weighing <2.0\u2009kg (1.1\u2009kg) and 4 infants weighing >2.5\u2009kg died. In multivariable models, odds of major morbidity or mortality were significantly higher for infants weighing <2\u2009kg compared with infants weighing >2.5\u2009kg (odds ratio 3.93, 95% confidence interval 1.04-14.85, P\u2009=\u20090.044), but there was no difference between infants weighing 2.0-2.5\u2009kg and those weighing >2.5\u2009kg (P\u2009=\u20090.225).

Secondary objectives included procedural feasibility, safety, and valve performance. The Harmony TPV was developed for nonsurgical pulmonary valve replacement in non-right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit patients. The Native Outflow Tract TPV Research Clinical Study was the first study approved under the Food and Drug Administration Early Feasibility Study guidance. Enrollment required that patient anatomy be precisely matched to the single-size Harmony TPV implant, necessitating a rigorous selection process. The study was nonrandomized, prospective, and performed at 3 sites. All patients met standard indications for surgical pulmonary valve replacement. The goal of the screening committee was to match the candidate anatomy to predetermined engineering criteria thought to be predictive of secure Harmony TPV implantation for the single-size device under study. A majority of the screening committee was required to recommend a patient as eligible for implant. A total of 270 patients underwent prescreening cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 66 were enrolled and received a computed tomography scan (24%), 21 met criteria for implant and were catheterized (8%), and 20 underwent implant. Nineteen of 20 met criteria for implant success. In conclusion, the Medtronic Harmony TPV represents an emerging therapeutic option for patients with complex postoperative right ventricular outflow tract failure. The initial clinical evaluation of this technology was unique, and the highly variable anatomy of this population required careful screening to ensure acceptable device fit.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cardiac Catheterization", "Clinical Studies as Topic", "Echocardiography", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Patient Selection", "Prospective Studies", "Pulmonary Valve", "Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Gillespie", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The effects of patient characteristics and surgical timing on disease recurrence are largely unknown. We performed a retrospective study, assessing the relative effects of patient age and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient on the need for reoperation for recurrent SAS. We included all children <20\u00a0years of age who underwent initial surgical resection of SAS at our center, January 2003-December 2013. Stratified logistic regression was performed, considering the effects of patient demographics, clinical characteristics, echocardiographic parameters, and operative technique, and clustering standard errors by surgeon. The multivariable model was used to simulate predicted probabilities of recurrent SAS for children at varying ages and baseline LVOT gradients. Sixty-three patients (38 males) underwent initial operation for SAS. Patients were followed for a median of 3.7\u00a0years (IQR 1.2-7.1). Twenty-one percent of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a013) underwent reoperation for SAS. Twelve were male. For every 10\u00a0mmHg increase in preoperative peak gradient in boys, the odds of reoperation for SAS doubled (OR 2.01, CI 1.5-2.72, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and for every additional 6\u00a0months of age, the odds of reoperation decreased by 14% (OR 0.86, CI 0.84-0.88, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both younger age and higher preoperative outflow tract gradient are independently associated with risk of reoperation.

Valve-sparing repairs have recently gained recognition; however, they may be associated with residual pulmonary stenosis (PS) in patients with small PV z scores. We sought to determine whether a repair that increases the PV annulus and augments the valve leaflet with a biomaterial would result in annular growth and in longer duration of valve competence compared with TAP. Eighty patients (median age 136\u00a0days, range 4-350) who underwent surgical repair of TOF between 2010 and 2014 were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups based on the PV intervention: balloon dilation/valvotomy (n\u00a0=\u00a029), valve-sparing transannular repair (VSTAR) (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and TAP (n\u00a0=\u00a032). Intraoperative, early postoperative and midterm follow-up echocardiographic data (median 19\u00a0months, range 1-59) were obtained. The primary outcomes were the presence and severity of pulmonary regurgitation and/or PS. Compared with TAP, VSTAR patients demonstrated significantly less severe PR with 100\u00a0% freedom of severe PR immediately post-op (vs. 0\u00a0% in TAP), 60\u00a0% at 6\u00a0months and 20\u00a0% at 20\u00a0months. There were no differences in PS between VSTAR and TAP at follow-up. A subgroup analysis of the VSTAR group was performed. PV z scores were calculated and fit to a random effects model. Patient data fit the model closely, predicting a reproducible increase in valve annulus size over time. With better short-term and comparable midterm results, VSTAR may be appropriate for TOF repair in patients with small PV that would conventionally require a TAP.", "Keywords": ["Pulmonary valve", "Tetralogy of Fallot", "Transannular patch repair", "Valve-sparing repair"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Pulmonary Valve", "Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency", "Retrospective Studies", "Tetralogy of Fallot", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danielle Gottlieb", "Last Name": "Sen", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Najjar", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Betul", "Last Name": "Yimaz", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiology, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "St\u00e9phanie M", "Last Name": "Levasseur", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bindu", "Last Name": "Kalessan", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan M", "Last Name": "Quaegebeur", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emile A", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. eb2709@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "PubDate": "2016Jun"}, {"PMID": "26892077", "Title": "The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Consensus Guidelines: Reasons and purpose.", "Abstract": "The time interval for the doubling of medical knowledge continues to decline.

Therefore, many of these recommendations are based on expert consensus and the few reports available. As the procedures evolve, technology advances, experience grows, and more data accumulate, there will certainly be a need to update this consensus statement. The writing committee and participating societies believe that the recommendations in this report serve as appropriate requisites. In some ways, these recommendations apply to institutions more than to individuals. There is a strong consensus that these new valve therapies are best performed using a Heart Team approach; thus, these credentialing criteria should be applied at the institutional level. Partnering societies used the ACC's policy on relationships with industry (RWI) and other entities to author this document (http://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents). To avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest due to industry relationships or personal interests, all members of the writing committee, as well as peer reviewers of the document, were asked to disclose all current healthcare-related relationships including those existing 12 months before the initiation of the writing effort. A committee of interventional cardiologists and surgeons was formed to include a majority of members with no relevant RWI and to be led by an interventional cardiology cochair and a surgical cochair with no relevant RWI. Authors with relevant RWI were not permitted to draft or vote on text or recommendations pertaining to their RWI. RWI were reviewed on all conference calls and updated as changes occurred. Author and peer reviewer RWI pertinent to this document are disclosed in the Appendices. In addition, to ensure complete transparency, authors' comprehensive disclosure information (including RWI not pertinent to this document) is available in Appendix AII. The work of the writing committee was supported exclusively by the partnering societies without commercial support. SCAI, AATS, ACC, and STS believe that adherence to these recommendations will maximize the chances that these therapies will become a successful part of the armamentarium for treating valvular heart disease in the United States. In addition, these recommendations will hopefully facilitate optimum quality during the delivery of this therapy, which will be important to the development and successful implementation of future, less invasive approaches to structural heart disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["American Heart Association", "Cardiac Catheterization", "Cardiology", "Heart Valve Diseases", "Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Pulmonary Valve", "Societies, Medical", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ziyad M", "Last Name": "Hijazi", "Affiliation": "Sidra Cardiovascular Center of Excellence, Department of Pediatrics, Sidra Medical & Research Center, Doha, Qatar."}, {"First Name": "Carlos E", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "Lenox Hill Heart & Vascular Institute of New York, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Evan", "Last Name": "Zahn", "Affiliation": "Guerin Family Congenital Heart Program, Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Ringel", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel S", "Last Name": "Aldea", "Affiliation": "Regional Heart Center, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Emile A", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Bavaria", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "R Morton", "Last Name": "Bolman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Duke E", "Last Name": "Cameron", "Affiliation": "The Dana and Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli Center for Aortic Diseases, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Larry S", "Last Name": "Dean", "Affiliation": "University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Ted", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, Evanston Hospital, Evanston, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Fullerton", "Affiliation": "Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Horlick", "Affiliation": "Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Mack", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Council Dallas, Heart Hospital Baylor, Plano, Texas."}, {"First Name": "D Craig", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Marc R", "Last Name": "Moon", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Debabrata", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Medicine, Texas Tech University, El Paso, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Alfredo", "Last Name": "Trento", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Carl L", "Last Name": "Tommaso", "Affiliation": "Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, Skokie Hospital, North Shore University Health System, Skokie, Illinois."}], "Journal": "Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions", "PubDate": "2015Jul"}, {"PMID": "25595831", "Title": "Heterotaxy syndrome infants are at risk for early shunt failure after Ladd procedure.", "Abstract": "Cardiac-specific risks and complications after a Ladd procedure in patients with heterotaxy syndrome (HS) and intestinal rotational anomalies (IRA) are unknown.

This study aimed at identifying predictors of postoperative outcomes, including mortality and left ventricle (LV) normalization. A retrospective, single institution review was conducted on forty-four ALCAPA repairs from April 1991 to November 2012. Preoperative clinical data and echocardiograms were analyzed. Postoperative outcomes included duration of intensive care supports and mortality. Time to normalization of LV end diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and function were assessed. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to correlate preoperative variables to postoperative outcomes. Forty-four patients underwent ALCAPA repair. No in-hospital or late mortality was observed. LVEDD, weight, and LV shortening fraction (SF) independently predicted duration of postoperative inotropic support. LVEDD and body surface area independently predicted the duration of postoperative intubation. For the infant majority, younger age predicted longer duration of postoperative intubation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048) and LVEDD Z-score independently predicted duration of postoperative IV inotropic support (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042). LV function normalized in all patients for whom follow-up data was available. LVEDD Z-score independently predicted time to normalization of LV function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). ALCAPA repair in the current era has excellent outcomes, with no mortality in our cohort. Immediate postoperative morbidities are influenced by patient size, LVEDD, and preoperative SF.

Post-pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) after cardiac surgery has a reported incidence of 1-40\u00a0%. We focused exclusively on secundum ASD repair to evaluate the incidence of PPS. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of PPS after surgical repair of secundum ASD and investigate what risk factors may be predictive of its development. A retrospective study was performed, and 97 patients who underwent surgical closure of a secundum ASD were identified. 27 (28\u00a0%) were diagnosed with PPS within the first postoperative year. Diagnosis was made if they had evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion and the presence of \u22652 of the following criteria: fever >72\u00a0h postoperatively, irritability, pleuritic chest pain, or pericardial friction rub. Closure of secundum ASDs was performed at a median age of 3.8\u00a0years (Interquartile Range (IQR): 2.2-6.0\u00a0years) and a median weight of 14.3\u00a0kilograms (IQR: 10.9-19.3\u00a0kilograms). The median time for development of PPS was 8\u00a0days post-op (IQR: 5-14). Significantly, 19 (27\u00a0%) of 70 patients in the non-PPS group had a small pericardial effusion on their discharge echocardiogram, while of the 27 patients who developed PPS, 17 (63\u00a0%) had a small pericardial effusion on their discharge echocardiogram (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

A retrospective cohort study was performed to assess the epidemiology of several types of HAIs in children 18 years of age or younger undergoing cardiac surgery from July 2010 to June 2012. Potential pre-, intra-, and postoperative risk factors, including adherence to the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis regimen at the authors' hospital, were assessed by multivariable analysis using Poisson regression models. Microorganisms associated with HAIs and their susceptibility patterns were described. Overall, 634 surgeries were performed, 38 (6 %) of which were complicated by an HAI occurring within 90 days after surgery. The HAIs included 7 central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), 12 non-CLABSI bacteremias, 6 episodes of early postoperative infective endocarditis (IE), 9 surgical-site infections (SSIs), and 4 ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs). Mechanical ventilation (rate ratio [RR] 1.07 per day; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.11; p = 0.0002), postoperative transfusion of blood products (RR 3.12; 95 %, CI 1.38-7.06; p = 0.0062), postoperative steroid use (RR 3.32; 95 % CI 1.56-7.02; p = 0.0018), and continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis longer than 48 h after surgery (RR 2.56; 95 % CI 1.31-5.03; p = 0.0062) were associated with HAIs. Overall, 66.7 % of the pathogens associated with SSIs were susceptible to cefazolin, the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis used by the authors' hospital. In conclusion, HAIs occurred after 6 % of cardiac surgeries. Bacteremia and CLABSI were the most common. This study identified several potentially modifiable risk factors that suggest interventions. Further studies should assess the role of improving adherence to perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, the age of transfused red blood cells, and evidence-based guidelines for postoperative steroids.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Bacteremia", "Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Cross Infection", "Endocarditis, Bacterial", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Surgical Wound Infection", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca F", "Last Name": "Turcotte", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, 3959 Broadway, CHN 10-24, New York, NY, 10032, USA, rft2106@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Ava", "Last Name": "Brozovich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rozelle", "Last Name": "Corda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ryan T", "Last Name": "Demmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine V", "Last Name": "Biagas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Diane", "Last Name": "Mangino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Covington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Ferris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Thumm", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emile", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Art", "Last Name": "Smerling", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Saiman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "PubDate": "2014Dec"}, {"PMID": "24894896", "Title": "Surgical volume-to-outcome relationship and monitoring of technical performance in pediatric cardiac surgery.", "Abstract": "A significant inverse relationship of surgical institutional and surgeon volumes to outcome has been demonstrated in many high-stakes surgical specialties. By and large, the same results were found in pediatric cardiac surgery, for which a more thorough analysis has shown that this relationship depends on case complexity and type of surgical procedures. Lower-volume programs tend to underperform larger-volume programs as case complexity increases. High-volume pediatric cardiac surgeons also tend to have better results than low-volume surgeons, especially at the more complex end of the surgery spectrum (e.g., the Norwood procedure). Nevertheless, this trend for lower mortality rates at larger centers is not universal. All larger programs do not perform better than all smaller programs. Moreover, surgical volume seems to account for only a small proportion of the overall between-center variation in outcome. Intraoperative technical performance is one of the most important parts, if not the most important part, of the therapeutic process and a critical component of postoperative outcome. Thus, the use of center-specific, risk-adjusted outcome as a tool for quality assessment together with monitoring of technical performance using a specific score may be more reliable than relying on volume alone. However, the relationship between surgical volume and outcome in pediatric cardiac surgery is strong enough that it ought to support adapted and well-balanced health care strategies that take advantage of the positive influence that higher center and surgeon volumes have on outcome.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Cardiology Service, Hospital", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Child", "Hospital Mortality", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Monitoring, Intraoperative", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Risk Adjustment", "Risk Factors", "Surgery Department, Hospital", "Workload"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kalfa", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, 3959 Broadway, New York, NY, 10032, USA, dk2757@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Chai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emile", "Last Name": "Bacha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Pediatric cardiology", "PubDate": "2014Aug"}, {"PMID": "24835557", "Title": "SCAI/AATS/ACC/STS operator and institutional requirements for transcatheter valve repair and replacement: Part II.

The authors hypothesized that resynchronization with optimized temporary multisite pacing postoperatively would be safe, feasible, and effective. Pacing was assessed in the intensive care unit within the first 24 h after surgery. Two unipolar atrial pacing leads and four bipolar ventricular pacing leads were placed at standardized sites intraoperatively. Pacing was optimized to maximize mean arterial pressure. The protocol tested 11 combinations of the 4 different ventricular lead sites, 6 atrioventricular delays (50-150 ms), and 14 intraventricular delays. Optimal pacing settings were thus determined and ultimately compared in four configurations: bipolar, unipolar, single-site atrioventricular pacing, and intrinsic rhythm. Each patient was his or her own control, and all pacing comparisons were implemented in random sequence. Single-ventricle palliation was performed for 17 children ages 0-21 years. Pacing increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) versus intrinsic rhythm, with the following configurations: bipolar multisite pacing increased MAP by 2.2 % (67.7 \u00b1 2.4 to 69.2 \u00b1 2.4 mmHg; p = 0.013) and unipolar multisite pacing increased MAP by 2.8 % (67.7 \u00b1 2.4 to 69.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg; p = 0.002). Atrioventricular single-site pacing increased MAP by 2.1 % (67.7 \u00b1 2.4 to 69.1 \u00b1 2.5 mmHg: p = 0.02, insignificant difference under Bonferroni correction). The echocardiographic fractional area change in nine patients increased significantly only with unipolar pacing (32 \u00b1 3.1 to 36 \u00b1 4.2 %; p = 0.02). No study-related adverse events occurred.
