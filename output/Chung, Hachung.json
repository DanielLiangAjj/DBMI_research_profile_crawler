Viral nucleic acids are key ligands for the activation of many PRRs and the induction of downstream inflammatory and antiviral effects. Initially it was thought that endogenous (self) nucleic acids rarely activated these PRRs, however emerging evidence indicates that endogenous nucleic acids are able to activate host PRRs in homeostasis and disease. In fact, many regulatory mechanisms are in place to finely control and regulate sensing of self-nucleic acids by PRRs. Sensing of self-nucleic acids is particularly important in the brain, as perturbations to nucleic acid sensing commonly leads to neuropathology. This review will highlight the role of nucleic acid sensors in the brain, both in disease and homeostasis.

However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger neuroinflammation are poorly understood. Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers innate immune responses when sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in all cell types. Here, we report that human neurons intrinsically carry exceptionally high levels of immunostimulatory dsRNAs and identify long 3'UTRs as giving rise to neuronal dsRNA structures. We found that the neuron-enriched ELAVL family of genes (ELAVL2, ELAVL3, and ELAVL4) can increase (i) 3'UTR length, (ii) dsRNA load, and (iii) activation of dsRNA-sensing PRRs such as MDA5, PKR, and TLR3. In wild-type neurons, neuronal dsRNAs signaled through PRRs to induce tonic production of the antiviral type I interferon. Depleting ELAVL2 in WT neurons led to global shortening of 3'UTR length, reduced immunostimulatory dsRNA levels, and rendered WT neurons susceptible to herpes simplex virus and Zika virus infection. Neurons deficient in ADAR1, a dsRNA-editing enzyme mutated in the neuroinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, exhibited intolerably high levels of dsRNA that triggered PRR-mediated toxic inflammation and neuronal death. Depleting ELAVL2 in ADAR1 knockout neurons led to prolonged neuron survival by reducing immunostimulatory dsRNA levels.

Two ADAR1 protein isoforms, p150 (150 kDa) and p110 (110 kDa), are expressed and can edit RNA, but the contribution of each isoform to the editing landscape remains unclear, largely because of the challenges in expressing p150 without p110. In this study, we demonstrate that p110 is coexpressed with p150 from the canonical p150-encoding mRNA due to leaky ribosome scanning downstream of the p150 start codon. The presence of a strong Kozak consensus context surrounding the p110 start codon suggests the p150 mRNA is optimized to leak p110 alongside expression of p150. To reduce leaky scanning and translation initiation at the p110 start codon, we introduced synonymous mutations in the coding region between the p150 and p110 start codons. Cells expressing p150 constructs with these mutations produced significantly reduced levels of p110. Editing analysis of total RNA from ADAR1 knockout cells reconstituted separately with modified p150 and p110 revealed that more than half of the A-to-I edit sites are selectively edited by p150, and the other half are edited by either p150 or p110.
