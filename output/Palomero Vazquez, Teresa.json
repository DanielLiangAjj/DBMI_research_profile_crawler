Irradiation of RuBiRuxo reduces cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in a light- and time-dependent manner in a CTCL cell line.

Although gene expression profiling and next generations sequencing have been proven to define specific features recurrently associated with distinct entities, genomic-based stratifications have not yet led to definitive diagnostic criteria and/or entered into the routine clinical practice. Herein, to improve the current molecular classification between AITL and PTCL-NOS, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles from 503 PTCLs stratified according to their molecular configuration and integrated them with genomic data of recurrently mutated genes (RHOA G17V , TET2, IDH2 R172 , and DNMT3A) in 53 cases (39 AITLs and 14 PTCL-NOSs) included in the series. Our analysis unraveled that the mutational status of RHOA G17V , TET2, and DNMT3A poorly correlated, individually, with peculiar transcriptional fingerprints.

These analyses identified numerous relapse-associated mutated genes intertwined in chemotherapy resistance-related protein complexes. In this context, RAS-MAPK pathway-activating mutations in the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) genes were present in 24 of 55 (44%) cases in our series. Interestingly, some leukemias showed retention or emergence of RAS mutant clones at relapse, whereas in others RAS mutant clones present at diagnosis were replaced by RAS wild-type populations, supporting a role for both positive and negative selection evolutionary pressures in clonal evolution of RAS-mutant leukemia. Consistently, functional dissection of mouse and human wild-type and mutant RAS isogenic leukemia cells demonstrated induction of methotrexate resistance but also improved the response to vincristine in mutant RAS-expressing lymphoblasts.

These analyses identified a distinctive pattern of somatic copy number alterations in S\u00e9zary syndrome, including highly prevalent chromosomal deletions involving the TP53, RB1, PTEN, DNMT3A and CDKN1B tumor suppressors. Mutation analysis identified a broad spectrum of somatic mutations in key genes involved in epigenetic regulation (TET2, CREBBP, KMT2D (MLL2), KMT2C (MLL3), BRD9, SMARCA4 and CHD3) and signaling, including MAPK1, BRAF, CARD11 and PRKG1 mutations driving increased MAPK, NF-\u03baB and NFAT activity upon T cell receptor stimulation. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the genetics of S\u00e9zary syndrome and CTCL and support the development of personalized therapies targeting key oncogenically activated signaling pathways for the treatment of these diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Case-Control Studies", "Chromosome Deletion", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Exome", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Markers", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous", "Mutation", "Risk Factors", "Sezary Syndrome", "Signal Transduction", "Skin Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ana Carolina", "Last Name": "da Silva Almeida", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Abate", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Khiabanian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Estela", "Last Name": "Martinez-Escala", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatopathology, Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Guitart", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatopathology, Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cornelis P", "Last Name": "Tensen", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Maarten H", "Last Name": "Vermeer", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teresa", "Last Name": "Palomero", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature genetics", "PubDate": "2015Dec"}, {"PMID": "25194570", "Title": "A NOTCH1-driven MYC enhancer promotes T cell development, transformation and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.", "Abstract": "Efforts to identify and annotate cancer driver genetic lesions have been focused primarily on the analysis of protein-coding genes; however, most genetic abnormalities found in human cancer are located in intergenic regions. Here we identify a new long range-acting MYC enhancer controlled by NOTCH1 that is targeted by recurrent chromosomal duplications in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Together these results identify N-Me as a long-range oncogenic enhancer implicated directly in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and highlight the importance of the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory axis in T cell transformation and as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Amplification", "Genes, myc", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Lymphopoiesis", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Oncogenes", "Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Receptor, Notch1", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Herranz", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Ambesi-Impiombato", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teresa", "Last Name": "Palomero", "Affiliation": "1] Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

These analyses identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples.

Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts.
