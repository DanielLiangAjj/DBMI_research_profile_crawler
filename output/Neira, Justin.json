[{"PMID": "37452938", "Title": "Benign and Malignant Tumors of the Pineal Region.", "Abstract": "Pineal region tumors fall into five broad categories: benign pineal region tumors, glial tumors, papillary tumors, pineal parenchymal tumors, and germ cell tumors. Genetic and transcriptional studies have identified key chromosomal alterations in germinomas (RUNDC3A, ASAH1, LPL) and in pineocytomas/pineoblastomas (DROSHA/DICER1, RB1). Pineal region tumors generally present with symptoms of hydrocephalus including nausea, vomiting, papilledema, and the classical Parinaud's triad of upgaze paralysis, convergence-retraction nystagmus, and light-near pupillary dissociation. Workup requires neuroimaging and tissue diagnosis via biopsy. In germinoma cases, diagnosis may be made based on serum or CSF studies for alpha-fetoprotein or beta-HCG making the preferred treatment radiosurgery, thereby preventing the need for unnecessary surgeries. Treatment generally involves three steps: CSF diversion in cases of hydrocephalus, biopsy through endoscopic or stereotactic methods, and open surgical resection. Multiple surgical approaches are possible for approach to the pineal region. The original approach to the pineal region was the interhemispheric transcallosal first described by Dandy. The most common approach is the supracerebellar infratentorial approach as it utilizes a natural anatomic corridor for access to the pineal region. The paramedian or lateral supracerebellar infratentorial approach is another improvement that uses a similar anatomic corridor but allows for preservation of midline bridging veins; this minimizes the chance for brainstem or cerebellar venous infarction. Determination of the optimal approach relies on tumor characteristics, namely location of deep venous structures to the tumor along with the lateral eccentricity of the tumor. The immediate post-operative period is important as hemorrhage or swelling can cause obstructive hydrocephalus and lead to rapid deterioration. Adjuvant therapy, whether chemotherapy or radiation, is based on tumor pathology. Improvements within pineal surgery will require improved technology for access to the pineal region along with targeted therapies that can effectively treat and prevent recurrence of malignant pineal region tumors.", "Keywords": ["Biomarkers", "Histopathology", "Pineal gland", "Pineal region tumors", "Surgical approaches"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Pinealoma", "Pineal Gland", "Brain Neoplasms", "Glioma", "Hydrocephalus", "Ribonuclease III", "DEAD-box RNA Helicases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pavan S", "Last Name": "Upadhyayula", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin A", "Last Name": "Neira", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, USA. jnb2@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37083756", "Title": "Commentary: Augmented Reality-Assisted Resection of a Large Presacral Ganglioneuroma: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Ganglioneuroma", "Augmented Reality"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Justin A", "Last Name": "Neira", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, Bronxville, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dean", "Last Name": "Chou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)", "PubDate": "2023Jul01"}, {"PMID": "36574250", "Title": "Surgeon-Delivered Nerve Block for Reduction of Perioperative Pain and Opioid Use After Lumbosacral Spine Surgery.", "Abstract": "This cohort study compares postoperative pain scores, opioid use, and length of hospital stay among adults undergoing noninstrumented lumbosacral surgery who received x-ray\u2013guided dorsal ramus block vs those who did not.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Nerve Block", "Pain, Postoperative", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Surgeons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Evan F", "Last Name": "Joiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University-NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}, {"First Name": "Justin A", "Last Name": "Neira", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University-NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}, {"First Name": "Wisdom E", "Last Name": "Yevudza", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University-NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Weller", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gebhard", "Last Name": "Wagener", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University-NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Angevine", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University-NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Mandigo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University-NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}], "Journal": "JAMA network open", "PubDate": "2022Dec01"}, {"PMID": "36243020", "Title": "Chronic convection-enhanced delivery of topotecan for patients with recurrent glioblastoma: a first-in-patient, single-centre, single-arm, phase 1b trial.", "Abstract": "Topotecan is cytotoxic to glioma cells but is clinically ineffective because of drug delivery limitations.

Serial imaging revealed slow tumor regrowth over a three year period which prompted a second resection. The recurrent tumor displayed a similar low grade-appearing histology and harbored the same H3 K27M and PTPN11 mutations as the primary. While the prognostic importance of isolated H3 K27M in spinal gliomas is well-known, the combination of these two mutations in spinal low grade glioma has not been previously reported. Importantly, PTPN11 is a component of the MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, as building evidence shows that low grade-appearing gliomas harboring H3 K27M mutations along with BRAF or FGFR1 mutations have a relatively more favorable course compared to isolated H3 K27M-mutant midline gliomas, the present case provides new evidence for the prognostic importance of activating mutations in other components of the MAPK signaling pathway.

Recent cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that there is continued growth of the cervical spine through the teenage years. The purpose of this multicenter study was to determine the effects of rigid instrumentation and fusion on the growing subaxial cervical spine by investigating vertical growth, cervical alignment, cervical curvature, and adjacent-segment instability over time. METHODS A total of 15 centers participated in this multi-institutional retrospective study. Cases involving children less than 16 years of age who underwent rigid instrumentation and fusion of the subaxial cervical spine (C-2 and T-1 inclusive) with at least 1 year of clinical and radiographic follow-up were investigated. Charts were reviewed for clinical data. Postoperative and most recent radiographs, CT, and MR images were used to measure vertical growth and assess alignment and stability. RESULTS Eighty-one patients were included in the study, with a mean follow-up of 33 months. Ninety-five percent of patients had complete clinical resolution or significant improvement in symptoms. Postoperative cervical kyphosis was seen in only 4 patients (5%), and none developed a swan-neck deformity, unintended adjacent-level fusion, or instability. Of patients with at least 2 years of follow-up, 62% demonstrated growth across the fusion construct. On average, vertical growth was 79% (4-level constructs), 83% (3-level constructs), or 100% (2-level constructs) of expected growth. When comparing the group with continued vertical growth to the one without growth, there were no statistically significant differences in terms of age, sex, underlying etiology, surgical approach, or number of levels fused. CONCLUSIONS Continued vertical growth of the subaxial spine occurs in nearly two-thirds of children after rigid instrumentation and fusion of the subaxial spine. Failure of continued vertical growth is not associated with the patient's age, sex, underlying etiology, number of levels fused, or surgical approach. Further studies are needed to understand this dichotomy and determine the long-term biomechanical effects of surgery on the growing pediatric cervical spine.", "Keywords": ["alignment", "cervical", "fusion", "growth", "stability", "subaxial spine"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Atlanto-Axial Joint", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Joint Instability", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Radiography", "Spinal Curvatures", "Spinal Fusion", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hannah E", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of New York, Columbia-Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Justin A", "Last Name": "Neira", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of New York, Columbia-Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matei", "Last Name": "Banu", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of New York, Columbia-Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Philipp R", "Last Name": "Aldana", "Affiliation": "2Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery, University of Florida College of Medicine, Jacksonville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Bruno P", "Last Name": "Braga", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurological Surgery, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Douglas L", "Last Name": "Brockmeyer", "Affiliation": "4Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Primary Children's Hospital, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "DiLuna", "Affiliation": "5Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Daniel H", "Last Name": "Fulkerson", "Affiliation": "6Department of Neurological Surgery, Goodman Campbell Brain and Spine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana."}, {"First Name": "Todd C", "Last Name": "Hankinson", "Affiliation": "7Department of Neurosurgery, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Andrew H", "Last Name": "Jea", "Affiliation": "6Department of Neurological Surgery, Goodman Campbell Brain and Spine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana."}, {"First Name": "Sean M", "Last Name": "Lew", "Affiliation": "8Department of Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Limbrick", "Affiliation": "9Department of Neurological Surgery, St. Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "10Department of Neurosurgery, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Joshua M", "Last Name": "Pahys", "Affiliation": "11Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shriners Hospitals for Children, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Luis F", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "12Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Curtis J", "Last Name": "Rozzelle", "Affiliation": "13Division of Neurosurgery, Children's of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama; and."}, {"First Name": "Gerald F", "Last Name": "Tuite", "Affiliation": "12Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas M", "Last Name": "Wetjen", "Affiliation": "14Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Richard C E", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "1Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital of New York, Columbia-Presbyterian, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Recent evidence suggests that intravenously administered fluorescein sodium associates with tumor tissue, facilitating safe maximal resection of GBM. In this study, the authors evaluate the safety and utility of intraoperative fluorescein guidance for the prediction of histopathological alteration both in the contrast-enhancing (CE) regions, where this relationship has been established, and into the non-CE (NCE), diffusely infiltrated margins. METHODS Thirty-two patients received fluorescein sodium (3 mg/kg) intravenously prior to resection. Fluorescence was intraoperatively visualized using a Zeiss Pentero surgical microscope equipped with a YELLOW 560 filter. Stereotactically localized biopsy specimens were acquired from CE and NCE regions based on preoperative MRI in conjunction with neuronavigation. The fluorescence intensity of these specimens was subjectively classified in real time with subsequent quantitative image analysis, histopathological evaluation of localized biopsy specimens, and radiological volumetric assessment of the extent of resection. RESULTS Bright fluorescence was observed in all GBMs and localized to the CE regions and portions of the NCE margins of the tumors, thus serving as a visual guide during resection. Gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 84% of the patients with an average resected volume of 95%, and this rate was higher among patients for whom GTR was the surgical goal (GTR achieved in 93.1% of patients, average resected volume of 99.7%). Intraoperative fluorescein staining correlated with histopathological alteration in both CE and NCE regions, with positive predictive values by subjective fluorescence evaluation greater than 96% in NCE regions. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative administration of fluorescein provides an easily visualized marker for glioma pathology in both CE and NCE regions of GBM.

High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires (TCRseq) provides a population-wide statistical description of how T cells respond to disease. We have defined immunophenotypes of whole repertoires based on TCRseq of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains from glioma tissue, nonneoplastic brain tissue, and peripheral blood from patients. Using information theory, we partitioned the diversity of these TCR repertoires into that from the distribution of VJ cassette combinations and diversity due to VJ-independent factors, such as selection due to antigen binding. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) possessed higher VJ-independent diversity than nonneoplastic tissue, stratifying patients according to tumor grade. We found that the VJ-independent components of tumor-associated repertoires diverge more from their corresponding peripheral repertoires than T-cell populations in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly for low-grade gliomas. Finally, we identified a \"signature\" set of TCRs whose use in peripheral blood is associated with patients exhibiting low TIL divergence and is depleted in patients with highly divergent TIL repertoires. This signature is detectable in peripheral blood, and therefore accessible noninvasively. We anticipate that these immunophenotypes will be foundational to monitoring and predicting response to antiglioma vaccines and immunotherapy.", "Keywords": ["T-cell receptor", "glioblastoma", "glioma", "immunooncology", "immunoprofiling"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Glioma", "Humans", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer S", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Boris", "Last Name": "Grinshpun", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Yaping", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Waksman Institute of Microbiology Genomics Core Facility, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854;"}, {"First Name": "Timothy H", "Last Name": "Ung", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Department of Neurosurgery, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045;"}, {"First Name": "Justin A", "Last Name": "Neira", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Jorge L", "Last Name": "Samanamud", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; ys2411@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; JP Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 ys2411@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; ys2411@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2016Jun21"}, {"PMID": "26407010", "Title": "The use of fluorescein sodium in the biopsy and gross-total resection of a tectal plate glioma.", "Abstract": "Intravenous administration of fluorescein sodium fluoresces glioma burden tissue and can be visualized using the surgical microscope with a specialized filter.

Molecular indicators have been applied to several aspects of cancer therapy: to describe the genotypic and phenotypic state of neoplastic tissue for prognosis, to predict susceptibility to anti-proliferative agents, to validate the presence of specific drug targets, and to evaluate responsiveness to therapy. For glioblastoma (GBM), immunohistochemical and radiographic biomarkers accessible to the clinical lab have informed traditional regimens, but while immunotherapies have emerged as potentially disruptive weapons against this diffusely infiltrating, heterogeneous tumor, biomarkers with strong predictive power have not been fully established. The cancer immunotherapy field, through the recently accelerated expansion of trials, is currently leveraging this wealth of clinical and biological data to define and revise the use of biomarkers for improving prognostic accuracy, personalization of therapy, and evaluation of responses across the wide variety of tumors. Technological advancements in DNA sequencing, cytometry, and microscopy have facilitated the exploration of more integrated, high-dimensional profiling of the disease system-incorporating both immune and tumor parameters-rather than single metrics, as biomarkers for therapeutic sensitivity.
