Yet, it remains unknown whether DNA ADP-ribosylation (DNA-ADPr) promotes genome stability and how it is regulated. Here, we show that telomeres are subject to DNA-ADPr catalyzed by PARP1 and removed by TARG1. Mechanistically, we show that DNA-ADPr is coupled to lagging telomere DNA strand synthesis, forming at single-stranded DNA present at unligated Okazaki fragments and on the 3' single-stranded telomere overhang. Persistent DNA-linked ADPr, due to TARG1 deficiency, eventually leads to telomere shortening. Furthermore, using the bacterial DNA ADP-ribosyl-transferase toxin to modify DNA at telomeres directly, we demonstrate that unhydrolyzed DNA-linked ADP-ribose compromises telomere replication and telomere integrity. Thus, by identifying telomeres as chromosomal targets of PARP1 and TARG1-regulated DNA-ADPr, whose deregulation compromises telomere replication and integrity, our study highlights and establishes the critical importance of controlling DNA-ADPr turnover for sustained genome stability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Telomere", "ADP-Ribosylation", "DNA Replication", "Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1", "Humans", "DNA", "Animals", "Mice", "Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose", "Genomic Instability", "Telomere Shortening"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anne R", "Last Name": "Wondisford", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Junyeop", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Telomere Length Regulation Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Marion", "Last Name": "Schuller", "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Josephine", "Last Name": "Groslambert", "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ragini", "Last Name": "Bhargava", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Schamus-Haynes", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leyneir C", "Last Name": "Cespedes", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patricia L", "Last Name": "Opresko", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hilda A", "Last Name": "Pickett", "Affiliation": "Telomere Length Regulation Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jaewon", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivan", "Last Name": "Ahel", "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Roderick J", "Last Name": "O'Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. osullivanr@upmc.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature structural & molecular biology", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38696464", "Title": "Extrachromosomal telomere DNA derived from excessive strand displacements.", "Abstract": "Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism mediated by break-induced replication, evident in approximately 15% of human cancers.

To maintain their immortal proliferation capacity, cancer cells must employ a telomere maintenance mechanism, such as telomerase activation or the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres pathway (ALT). With only 10-15% of cancers utilizing the ALT mechanism, progress towards understanding its molecular components and associated hallmarks has only recently been made. This review analyzes the advances towards understanding the ALT pathway by: (1) detailing the mechanisms associated with engaging the ALT pathway as well as (2) identifying potential therapeutic targets of ALT that may lead to novel cancer therapeutic treatments. Collectively, these studies indicate that the ALT molecular mechanisms involve at least two distinct pathways induced by replication stress and damage at telomeres. We suggest exploiting tumor dependency on ALT is a promising field of study because it suggests new approaches to ALT-specific therapies for cancers with poorer prognosis.

HBECs exhibit critically short telomeres at 200 PD and the population of cells start to undergo replicative senescence. Subcloning these late passage cells to clonal density, to mimic lung injury in vivo, selects for rare subsets of HBECs that activate low levels of telomerase activity to maintain short telomeres. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of human telomerase reverse transcriptase or treatment with the telomerase-mediated telomere targeting agent 6-thio-2'deoxyguanosine abrogates colony growth in these late passage cultures (>200 PD) but not in early passage cultures (<200 PD).

In summary, ALT cells exhibit more telomere replication defects that result in persistent DNA damage responses at telomeres, leading to the engagement of telomeric MiDAS (spontaneous mitotic telomere synthesis) that is triggered by DNA replication stress, a potential driver of genomic duplications in cancer.", "Keywords": ["ALT", "G quadruplex", "MiDAS", "R-loop", "RAD51", "RAD52", "SMC5/6", "TIMELESS", "cyclin E", "telomerase", "telomere"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line", "DNA", "DNA Repair", "DNA Replication", "Humans", "Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein", "Recombination, Genetic", "Telomerase", "Telomere", "Telomere Homeostasis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jaewon", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Woodring E", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jerry W", "Last Name": "Shay", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA jerry.shay@utsouthwestern.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "PubDate": "2017Oct15"}, {"PMID": "28082393", "Title": "Alternative lengthening of telomeres can be maintained by preferential elongation of lagging strands.", "Abstract": "Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomerase independent telomere maintenance mechanism that occurs in \u223c15% of cancers.

Here, we generated TERC (telomerase RNA) gene knockouts in telomerase positive cell lines that resulted in long-term surviving clones acquiring the ALT pathway but at a very low frequency. By comparing these ALT cells with parental telomerase positive cells, we observed that ALT cells possess excessively long telomeric overhangs derived from telomere elongation processes that mostly occur during S phase. ALT cells exhibited preferential elongation of the telomeric lagging strands, whereas telomerase positive cells exhibited similar elongation between leading and lagging strands.

Because ~90% of primary human tumors express telomerase and generally maintain very short telomeres, telomerase is carefully regulated, particularly in large, long-lived mammals. In the current report, we provide substantial evidence for a new regulatory control mechanism of the rate limiting catalytic protein component of telomerase (hTERT) that is determined by the length of telomeres. We document that normal, young human cells with long telomeres have a repressed hTERT epigenetic status (chromatin and DNA methylation), but the epigenetic status is altered when telomeres become short. The change in epigenetic status correlates with altered expression of TERT and genes near to TERT, indicating a change in chromatin. Furthermore, we identified a chromosome 5p telomere loop to a region near TERT in human cells with long telomeres that is disengaged with increased cell divisions as telomeres progressively shorten. Finally, we provide support for a role of the TRF2 protein, and possibly TERRA, in the telomere looping maintenance mechanism through interactions with interstitial TTAGGG repeats.

Absence of Brca2 in mice results in progressive shortening of telomeres and senescence, yet cells are prone to neoplastic transformation with elongated telomeres, suggesting that BRCA2 has positive and negative effects on telomere length regulation along the path to tumorigenesis. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we show here that depletion of BRC-2, an ortholog of BRCA2, paradoxically delays senescence in telomerase-deficient mutant worms. Telomerase-deficient worms (trt-1) exhibit early replication senescence due to short telomeres. It should be noted that worms mutated in brc-2 are not viable as well due to massive genotoxic insults. However, when BRC-2 is depleted by RNA interference in trt-1 mutant worms, the number of generations is unexpectedly increased with telomere length maintained, compared to telomerase mutants. Interestingly, depletion of other HR genes such as rad-51 and rad-54 exhibited similar effects. In worms doubly deficient of telomerase and brc-2, rad-51, or rad-54, extra telomeric C-circles were generated, suggesting that abrogation of HR induces an alteration in telomere environment favorable to illegitimate telomere maintenance when telomerase is absent. Collectively, absence of BRC-2 in telomerase-deficient background first leads to telomere shortening, followed by an induction of an as-yet-unknown telomere maintenance pathway, resulting in delay of senescence.

BubR1 acetylation was also required to counteract excessive Aurora B activity at the KT for stable chromosome-spindle attachments. The association of acetylation-deficient BubR1 with PP2A-B56\u03b1 phosphatase was reduced, and the phosphorylated Ndc80 at the KT was elevated in K243R/+ MEFs.
