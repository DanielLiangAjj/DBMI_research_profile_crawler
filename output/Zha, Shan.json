Enzymatic inhibitors of PARP1 and PARP2 (PARPi) are promising cancer therapy agents that selectively target BRCA1- or BRCA2- deficient cancers. As immediate early responders to DNA strand breaks with robust activities, PARP1 and PARP2 normally form transient foci (<10\u202fminutes) at the micro-irradiation-induced DNA lesions. In addition to enzymatic inhibition, PARPi also extend the presence of PARP1 and PARP2 at DNA lesions, including at replication forks, where they may post a physical block for subsequent repair and DNA replication. The dynamic nature of PARP1 and PARP2 foci made live cell imaging a unique platform to detect subtle changes and the functional interaction among PARP1, PARP2, and their regulators. Recent imaging studies have provided new understandings of the biological consequence of PARP inhibition and uncovered functional interactions between PARP1 and PARP2 and new regulators (e.g., histone poly(ADP-ribosylation) factor).

Once activated by DNA breaks, PARP1 and PARP2 generate poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) chains on themselves and other substrates to promote DNA single-strand break repair (SSBR). PARP1 can be activated by diverse DNA lesions, whereas PARP2 specifically recognizes 5' phosphorylated nicks. They can be activated independently and provide mutual backup in the absence of the other. However, whether PARP1 and PARP2 have synergistic functions in DNA damage response remains elusive. Here, we show that PARP1 and the PAR chains generated by PARP1 recruit PARP2 to the vicinity of DNA damage sites through the scaffold protein XRCC1. Using quantitative live-cell imaging, we found that loss of XRCC1 markedly reduces irradiation-induced PARP2 foci in PARP1-proficient cells. The central BRCT domain (BRCT1) of XRCC1 binds to the PAR chain, while the C-terminal BRCT domain (BRCT2) of XRCC1 interacts with the catalytic domain of PARP2, facilitating its localization near the breaks.

Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimer (KU) initiates NHEJ, thereby recruiting and activating the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). While DNA-PKcs deletion only moderately impairs end-ligation, the expression of kinase-dead DNA-PKcs completely abrogates NHEJ. Active DNA-PK phosphorylates DNA-PKcs at two clusters-PQR around S2056 (S2053 in mouse) and ABCDE around T2609. Alanine substitution at the S2056 cluster moderately compromises end-ligation on plasmid-based assays. But, mice carrying alanine substitution at all five serine residues within the S2056 cluster (DNA-PKcsPQR/PQR) display no defect in lymphocyte development, leaving the physiological significance of S2056 cluster phosphorylation elusive. Xlf is a nonessential NHEJ factor. Xlf\u2009-/- mice have substantial peripheral lymphocytes that are completely abolished by the loss of DNA-PKcs, the related ATM kinases, other chromatin-associated DNA damage response factors (e.g., 53BP1, MDC1, H2AX, and MRI), or RAG2-C-terminal regions, suggesting functional redundancy.

In addition to blocking PARP1&2 enzymatic activity, PARP inhibitors also extend the lifetime of DNA damage-induced PARP1&2 foci, termed trapping. Trapping is important for the therapeutic effects of PARP inhibitors. Using live-cell imaging, we found that PARP inhibitors cause persistent PARP2 foci by switching the mode of PARP2 recruitment from a predominantly PARP1- and PAR-dependent rapid exchange to a WGR domain-mediated stalling of PARP2 on DNA. Specifically, PARP1-deletion markedly reduces but does not abolish PARP2 foci. The residual PARP2 foci in PARP1-deficient cells are DNA-dependent and abrogated by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain. Yet, PARP2-R140A forms normal foci in PARP1-proficient cells. In PARP1-deficient cells, PARP inhibitors - niraparib, talazoparib, and, to a lesser extent, olaparib - enhance PARP2 foci by preventing PARP2 exchange. This trapping of PARP2 is independent of auto-PARylation and is abolished by the R140A mutation in the WGR domain and the H415A mutation in the catalytic domain.

While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells.

Clinical PARP inhibitors (PARPi) extend the lifetime of damage-induced PARP1/2 foci, referred to as 'trapping'. To understand the molecular nature of 'trapping' in cells, we employed quantitative live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. Unexpectedly, we found that PARP1 exchanges rapidly at DNA damage sites even in the presence of clinical PARPi, suggesting the persistent foci are not caused by physical stalling. Loss of Xrcc1, a major downstream effector of PAR, also caused persistent PARP1 foci without affecting PARP1 exchange. Thus, we propose that the persistent PARP1 foci are formed by different PARP1 molecules that are continuously recruited to and exchanging at DNA lesions due to attenuated XRCC1-LIG3 recruitment and delayed DNA repair.

Our review focuses on three PI3-kinase related protein kinases-ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs, which situate at the apex of the mammalian DDR. They are recruited to and activated at the DNA damage sites by their respective sensor protein complexes-MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 for ATM, RPA/ATRIP for ATR and KU70-KU80/86 (XRCC6/XRCC5) for DNA-PKcs. Upon activation, ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs phosphorylate a large number of partially overlapping substrates to promote efficient and accurate DNA repair and to coordinate DNA repair with other DNA metabolic events (e.g., transcription, replication and mitosis). At the organism level, robust DDR is critical for normal development, aging, stem cell maintenance and regeneration, and physiological genomic rearrangements in lymphocytes and germ cells. In addition to endogenous damage, oncogene-induced replication stresses and genotoxic chemotherapies also activate DDR. On one hand, DDR factors suppress genomic instability to prevent malignant transformation. On the other hand, targeting DDR enhances the therapeutic effects of anti-cancer chemotherapy, which led to the development of specific kinase inhibitors for ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs. Using mouse models expressing kinase dead ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs, an unexpected structural function of these kinases was revealed, where the expression of catalytically inactive kinases causes more genomic instability than the loss of the proteins themselves. The spectrum of genomic instabilities and physiological consequences are unique for each kinase and depends on their activating complexes, suggesting a model in which the catalysis is coupled with DNA/chromatin release and catalytic inhibition leads to the persistence of the kinases at the DNA lesion, which in turn affects repair pathway choice and outcomes.

ATM is the primary mobilizer of the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) - a broad signaling network in which many components are ATM targets. The major clinical feature of A-T is cerebellar atrophy, characterized by relentless loss of Purkinje and granule cells. In Atm-knockout (Atm-KO) mice, complete loss of Atm leads to a very mild neurological phenotype, suggesting that Atm loss is not sufficient to markedly abrogate cerebellar structure and function in this organism. Expression of inactive (\"kinase-dead\") Atm (AtmKD) in mice leads to embryonic lethality, raising the question of whether conditional expression of AtmKD in the murine nervous system would lead to a more pronounced neurological phenotype than Atm loss. We generated two mouse strains in which AtmKD was conditionally expressed as the sole Atm species: one in the CNS and one specifically in Purkinje cells. Focusing our analysis on Purkinje cells, the dynamics of DSB readouts indicated that DSB repair was delayed longer in the presence of AtmKD compared to Atm loss. However, both strains exhibited normal life span and displayed no gross cerebellar histological abnormalities or significant neurological phenotype. We conclude that the presence of AtmKD is indeed more harmful to DSB repair than Atm loss, but the murine central nervous system can reasonably tolerate the extent of this DSB repair impairment.

We propose that premature aging of HSCs, together with previously reported defects in class-switch recombination and memory immune response, underlies the progressive and severe lymphocytopenia in XLF-deficient patients in the absence of measurable V(D)J recombination defects.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Cellular Senescence", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Disease Progression", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Lymphopenia", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Serine", "Last Name": "Avagyan", "Affiliation": "Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Cancer Genetics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Research Center."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Churchill", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Research Center, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Kenta", "Last Name": "Yamamoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Cancer Genetics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Research Center, Pathobiology Graduate Program, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Crowe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Cancer Genetics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Research Center, Pathobiology Graduate Program, College for Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; and."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Cancer Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Cancer Genetics."}, {"First Name": "Tian", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Zha", "Affiliation": "Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Department of Pediatrics, Institute for Cancer Genetics."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2014Sep04"}, {"PMID": "25036710", "Title": "Atm deletion with dual recombinase technology preferentially radiosensitizes tumor endothelium.", "Abstract": "Cells isolated from patients with ataxia telangiectasia are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation. Kinase inhibitors of ATM, the gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, can sensitize tumor cells to radiation therapy, but concern that inhibiting ATM in normal tissues will also increase normal tissue toxicity from radiation has limited their clinical application. Endothelial cell damage can contribute to the development of long-term side effects after radiation therapy, but the role of endothelial cell death in tumor response to radiation therapy remains controversial. Here, we developed dual recombinase technology using both FlpO and Cre recombinases to generate primary sarcomas in mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of Atm to determine whether loss of Atm in endothelial cells sensitizes tumors and normal tissues to radiation. Although deletion of Atm in proliferating tumor endothelial cells enhanced the response of sarcomas to radiation, Atm deletion in quiescent endothelial cells of the heart did not sensitize mice to radiation-induced myocardial necrosis. Blocking cell cycle progression reversed the effect of Atm loss on tumor endothelial cell radiosensitivity. These results indicate that endothelial cells must progress through the cell cycle in order to be radiosensitized by Atm deletion.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Proliferation", "Endothelial Cells", "Gene Deletion", "Heart", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myocardium", "Radiation Tolerance", "Recombinases", "Sarcoma, Experimental", "Soft Tissue Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Everett J", "Last Name": "Moding", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chang-Lung", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine D", "Last Name": "Castle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Zha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hooney D", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shiva", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David G", "Last Name": "Kirsch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2014Aug"}, {"PMID": "23355489", "Title": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is dispensable for endonuclease I-SceI-induced homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells.", "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is activated upon DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and phosphorylates numerous DSB response proteins, including histone H2AX on serine 139 (Ser-139) to form \u03b3-H2AX. Through interaction with MDC1, \u03b3-H2AX promotes DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). H2AX Ser-139 can also be phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and ataxia telangiectasia- and Rad3-related kinase. Thus, we tested whether ATM functions in HR, particularly that controlled by \u03b3-H2AX, by comparing HR occurring at the euchromatic ROSA26 locus between mouse embryonic stem cells lacking either ATM, H2AX, or both. We show here that loss of ATM does not impair HR, including H2AX-dependent HR, but confers sensitivity to inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. Loss of ATM or H2AX has independent contributions to cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The ATM-independent HR function of H2AX requires both Ser-139 phosphorylation and \u03b3-H2AX/MDC1 interaction.

Recombination activating gene endonuclease initiates V(D)J recombination by generating DSBs between two V(D)J coding gene segments and flanking recombination signal sequences (RS), with the two coding ends and two RS ends joined by C-NHEJ to form coding joins and signal joins, respectively. During C-NHEJ, recombination activating gene factor generates two coding ends as covalently sealed hairpins and RS ends as blunt 5'-phosphorylated DSBs. Opening and processing of coding end hairpins before joining by C-NHEJ requires the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). However, C-NHEJ of RS ends, which do not require processing, occurs relatively normally in the absence of DNA-PKcs. The XRCC4-like factor (XLF) is a C-NHEJ component that is not required for C-NHEJ of chromosomal signal joins or coding joins because of functional redundancy with ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase, a protein that also has some functional overlap with DNA-PKcs in this process. Here, we show that XLF has dramatic functional redundancy with DNA-PKcs in the V(D)J SJ joining process, which is nearly abrogated in their combined absence. Moreover, we show that XLF functionally overlaps with DNA-PKcs in normal mouse development, promotion of genomic stability in mouse fibroblasts, and in IgH class switch recombination in mature B cells. Our findings suggest that DNA-PKcs has fundamental roles in C-NHEJ processes beyond end processing that have been masked by functional overlaps with XLF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "DNA End-Joining Repair", "DNA-Activated Protein Kinase", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Genomic Instability", "Immunoglobulin Class Switching", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Nuclear Proteins", "Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid", "V(D)J Recombination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Valentyn", "Last Name": "Oksenych", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, and Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vipul", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiangyu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chunguang", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bjoern", "Last Name": "Schwer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Zha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frederick W", "Last Name": "Alt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Feb05"}]
