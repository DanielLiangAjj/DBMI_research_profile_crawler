These issues are largely due to the failure in targeting immunomodulators directly to the tumor microenvironment. To address this, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines a genetically modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) membrane with a bioactive nanoparticle core for chemokine-directed radioimmunotherapy of GBM is developed. The CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-overexpressing MSC membrane acts as a tactical tentacle to achieve radiation-induced tropism toward the abundant chemokine (CC motif)\u00a0ligand 2 (CCL2) in irradiated gliomas. The nanoparticle core, comprising diselenide-bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and PD-L1 antibodies (\u03b1PD-L1), enables X-ray-responsive drug release and radiosensitization. In two murine models with orthotopic GBM tumors, this nanoplatform reinvigorated immunogenic cell death, and augmented the efficacy and specificity of GBM radioimmunotherapy, with reduced occurrence of irAEs. This study suggests a promising radiation-induced tropism strategy for targeted drug delivery, and presents a potent nanoplatform that enhances the efficacy and safety of radio-immunotherapy.", "Keywords": ["glioblastoma", "immune\u2010related adverse events", "mesenchymal stem cells", "radiation\u2010induced tropism", "radioimmunotherapy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zheng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."}, {"First Name": "Fangman", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration and Reconstruction, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."}, {"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration and Reconstruction, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration and Reconstruction, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaochun", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration and Reconstruction, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration and Reconstruction, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Madi", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration and Reconstruction, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Fanshu", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Shao", "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Tissue Restoration and Reconstruction, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Renjun", "Last Name": "Pei", "Affiliation": "CAS Key Laboratory of Nano-Bio Interface, Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."}], "Journal": "Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)", "PubDate": "2024May07"}, {"PMID": "38583366", "Title": "Optimization of lipid nanoparticles for gene editing of the liver via intraduodenal delivery.", "Abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have recently emerged as successful gene delivery platforms for a diverse array of disease treatments.

To bridge this gap, we built a human vascular organoid model replicating Proteus syndrome's vasculature. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and gene overexpression, we created induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) embodying the Proteus syndrome-specific AKTE17K point mutation for organoid generation. Our findings revealed that AKT overactivation in these organoids resulted in smaller sizes yet increased vascular connectivity, although with less stable connections. This could be due to the significant vasculogenesis induced by AKT overactivation. This phenomenon likely stems from boosted vasculogenesis triggered by AKT overactivation, leading to increased vascular sprouting. Additionally, a notable increase in dysfunctional PDGFR\u03b2+ mural cells, impaired in matrix secretion, was observed in these AKT-overactivated organoids. The application of AKT inhibitors (ARQ092, AZD5363, or GDC0068) reversed the vascular malformations; the inhibitors' effectiveness was directly linked to reduced connectivity in the organoids. In summary, our study introduces an innovative in vitro model combining organoid technology and gene editing to explore vascular pathophysiology in Proteus syndrome.

Following injury, cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs), categorized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are released from dying or dead cells, triggering local and systemic inflammatory responses and coagulation abnormalities that worsen disease progression. Harnessing cfNA scavenging strategies with biomaterials has emerged as a promising approach for treating posttrauma systemic inflammation. In this study, the effectiveness of cationic hyperbranched polyaminoglycosides derived from tobramycin (HPT) and disulfide-included HPT (ss-HPT) in scavenging cfNAs to mitigate posttrauma inflammation and hypercoagulation is investigated. Both cationic polymers demonstrate the ability to suppress DAMP-induced toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and hypercoagulation by efficiently scavenging cfNAs. Additionally, HPT and ss-HPT exhibit potent antibacterial efficacy attributed to the presence of tobramycin in their chemical composition. Furthermore, HPT and ss-HPT exhibit favorable modulatory effects on inflammation and therapeutic outcomes in a cecal ligation puncture (CLP) mouse abdominal trauma model. Notably, in vivo studies reveal that ss-HPT displayed high accumulation and retention in injured organs of traumatized mice while maintaining a higher biodegradation rate in healthy mice, contrasting with findings for HPT.

Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis we define complementary effects stemming from additional genes residing within the deleted locus.

A small molecule compound, NYX-1492, that was originally designed to block PCSK9 binding with the LDLR was tested in TEBVs to determine its effect on lowering PCSK9-induced inflammation. The compound reduced monocyte adhesion in P+ TEBVs with evidence of lowering secretion of VCAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1.

As animal models fail to recapitulate the molecular changes in astronauts, engineered human tissues and \"organs-on-chips\" are valuable tools for studying effects of radiation in vitro. We have developed a bioengineered tissue platform for studying radiation damage in individualized settings. To demonstrate its utility, we determined the effects of radiation using engineered models of two human tissues known to be radiosensitive: engineered cardiac tissues (eCT, a target of chronic radiation damage) and engineered bone marrow (eBM, a target of acute radiation damage).

Herein, we report the development of thiol-disulfide hybrid mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) that improve the storage and sustained release of NO, broadening the therapeutic window of NO-based therapy against colitis. The tailored NO-storing nanomaterials coordinated the release of NO and the immunoregulator dexamethasone (Dex) in the intestinal microenvironment, specifically integrating the alleviation of oxidative stress in enterocytes and the reversal of NO-exacerbated macrophage activation. Mechanistically, such a synchronous operation was achieved by a self-motivated process wherein the thiyl radicals produced by NO release cleaved the disulfide bonds to degrade the matrix and release Dex via thiol-disulfide exchange. Specifically, the MON-mediated combination of NO and Dex greatly ameliorated intractable colitis compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid, even after delayed treatment.

For p53-wild-type tumors, the underlying mechanisms of functional inhibition of p53 during oncogenesis are unknown. The results reveal that the expression of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF is inhibited in p53-wild-type tumors, indicating that the restoration of ARF could be a potential oncotherapy strategy for p53-wild-type tumors. Therefore, ARF-mimetic MDM2-targeting reassembly peptide nanoparticles (MtrapNPs) for p53-based tumor therapy is developed. The results elucidated that the MtrapNPs respond to and form a nanofiber structure with MDM2. By trapping MDM2, the MtrapNPs stabilize and activate p53 for the inhibition of p53-wild-type tumors. In most cases, reactivated mutant p53 is inhibited and degraded by MDM2. In the present study, MtrapNPs are used to load and deliver arsenic trioxide, a p53 mutation rescuer, for p53-mutated tumor treatment in both orthotopic and metastatic models, and they exhibit significant therapeutic effects. Therefore, the study provides evidence supporting a link between decreased ARF expression and tumor development in patients with p53-wild-type tumors.

To test if imatinib can restore the compromised iBBB, we treated the patient's iBBB with imatinib. After treatment, both trans-endothelial electrical resistance and solute permeability returned to comparable levels of the control iBBB. Correspondingly, changes in tight junctions and endothelial glycocalyx of the iBBB were also restored. Western blotting showed that imatinib increased the level of active forms of the CRKL protein. A transcriptome study revealed that imatinib up-regulated genes in the signaling pathways responsible for the protein modification process and down-regulated those for cell cycling. The KEGG pathway analysis further suggested that imatinib improved the gene expression of the CRKL signaling pathway and tight junctions, which agrees with our expectations and the observations at protein levels. Our results indicate that the 22q11.2DS iBBB is at least partially caused by the haploinsufficiency of CRKL, which can be rescued by imatinib via its effects on the Abl/CRKL signaling pathway. Our findings uncover a novel disease mechanism associated with 22q11.2DS.", "Keywords": ["Abl/CRKL signaling pathway", "DiGeorge Syndrome", "blood\u2013brain barrier", "endothelial glycocalyx", "imatinib", "permeability", "tight junction", "transcription network"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Imatinib Mesylate", "DiGeorge Syndrome", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Endothelial Cells", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yunfei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The City College of the City University of New York, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhixiong", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huixiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Shteyman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The City College of the City University of New York, New York, NY 10031, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sander", "Last Name": "Markx", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bingmei M", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The City College of the City University of New York, New York, NY 10031, USA."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2023Jan27"}, {"PMID": "36712096", "Title": "Focused ultrasound-mediated brain genome editing.", "Abstract": "Gene editing in the mammalian brain has been challenging because of the restricted transport imposed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

In addition, the respective properties of the EM and SeM synergistically alter the gut microbiome to a favorable state by increasing the bacterial diversity and shifting the microbiome profile to an anti-inflammatory phenotype.

In the mouse models of breast cancer metastasis, paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles reduce serum levels of cfNAs and inflammatory cytokines compared with paclitaxel treatment alone and inhibit both primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis.

The pathogenesis of periodontitis involves inflammatory dysregulation, which represents a target for new therapeutic strategies to treat periodontitis. After establishing the correlation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level with periodontitis in patient samples, we test the hypothesis that the cfDNA-scavenging approach will benefit periodontitis treatment. We create a nanoparticulate cfDNA scavenger specific for periodontitis by coating selenium-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (SeHANs) with cationic polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM-G3), namely G3@SeHANs, and compare the activities of G3@SeHANs with those of soluble PAMAM-G3 polymer. Both G3@SeHANs and PAMAM-G3 inhibit periodontitis-related proinflammation in vitro by scavenging cfDNA and alleviate inflammatory bone loss in a mouse model of ligature-induced periodontitis. G3@SeHANs also regulate the mononuclear phagocyte system in a periodontitis environment, promoting the M2 over the M1 macrophage phenotype. G3@SeHANs show greater therapeutic effects than PAMAM-G3 in reducing proinflammation and alveolar bone loss in vivo.

These nucleic acid-containing Damage and Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs/PAMPs) can be depleted using nucleic acid-binding microfibers to limit the patient samples' ability to hyperactivate such innate immune receptors.

This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'. While analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processing-structure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science. Also, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in 'biomaterialomics' concept, which integrates multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning.

An altered BBB has been described in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of such alterations remain unclear. Here, we investigate if BBB integrity is compromised in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (also called DiGeorge syndrome), which is one of the validated genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. We utilized a set of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) derived from the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of patients with 22q11.2-deletion-syndrome-associated schizophrenia. We found that the solute permeability of the BBB formed from patient HBMECs increases by ~1.3-1.4-fold, while the trans-endothelial electrical resistance decreases to ~62% of the control values. Correspondingly, tight junction proteins and the endothelial glycocalyx that determine the integrity of the BBB are significantly disrupted. A transcriptome study also suggests that the transcriptional network related to the cell-cell junctions in the compromised BBB is substantially altered. An enrichment analysis further suggests that the genes within the altered gene expression network also contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.

As a proof of concept, polydopamine nanoparticles were synthesized via a simple in situ polymerization in which the nanoparticles were conjugated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit and the TLR7/8 agonist R848. The resulting SARS-CoV-2 virus-mimetic nanoparticles were attached to erythrocytes via catechol groups on the nanoparticle. Erythrocytes naturally home to the spleen and interact with the immune system. Injection of the nanoparticle-decorated erythrocytes into mice resulted in greater maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells, humoral and cellular immune responses in the spleen, production of S1-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and systemic antiviral T cell responses than a control group treated with the nanoparticles alone, with no significant negative side effects.

However, the issue of low reprogramming efficiency poses a major barrier to its application. We propose that topographical cues, which have been applied successfully to enhance lineage-directed differentiation and multipotent stem cell transdifferentiation, could improve nonviral direct neuronal reprogramming efficiency. To investigate, we used a polymer-BAM (Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l) factor transfection polypex to reprogram primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Using a multiarchitecture chip, we screened for patterns that may improve transfection and/or subsequent induced neuron reprogramming efficiency. Selected patterns were then investigated further by analyzing \u03b2-tubulin III (TUJ1) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) protein expression, cell morphology and electrophysiological function of induced neurons. Certain hierarchical topographies, with nanopatterns imprinted on micropatterns, significantly improved the percentage of TUJ1+ and MAP2+ cells. It is postulated that the microscale base pattern enhances initial BAM expression while the nanoscale sub-pattern promotes subsequent maturation. This is because the base pattern alone increased expression of TUJ1 and MAP2, while the nanoscale pattern was the only pattern yielding induced neurons capable of firing multiple action potentials. Nanoscale patterns also produced the highest fraction of cells showing spontaneous synaptic activity. Overall, reprogramming efficiency with one dose of polyplex on hierarchical patterns was comparable to that of five doses without topography. Thus, topography can enhance nonviral direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced neurons.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Fibroblasts", "Mice", "Neurons", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Mattiassi", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave. W, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada. eyim@uwaterloo.ca."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Rizwan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher L", "Last Name": "Grigsby", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aung Moe", "Last Name": "Zaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Evelyn K F", "Last Name": "Yim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biomaterials science", "PubDate": "2021Aug07"}, {"PMID": "34122990", "Title": "Biofunctional Janus particles promote phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages.", "Abstract": "Herein, a versatile strategy for the construction of biofunctional Janus particles (JPs) through the combination of Pickering emulsion and copper-free click chemistry is developed for the study of particle-mediated cell-cell interactions.

Here, we address this knowledge gap by comparing the proteomic profiles of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPEs (iRPE) from individuals with DHRD and their isogenic controls. Our analysis and follow-up studies elucidated the mechanism of lipid accumulation in DHRD iRPE cells. Specifically, we detected significant downregulation of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), an enzyme that converts cholesteryl ester to free cholesterol, an indispensable process in cholesterol export. CES1 knockdown or overexpression of EFEMP1R345W, a variant of EGF-containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 that is associated with DHRD and attenuated cholesterol efflux and led to lipid droplet accumulation. In iRPE cells, we also found that EFEMP1R345W has a hyper-inhibitory effect on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling when compared to EFEMP1WT and may suppress CES1 expression via the downregulation of transcription factor SP1.

Cellular engineering approaches are used to sustain primary hepatocytes or produce hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells and other adult tissues. Three-dimensional microtissues are generated by scaffold-free assembly or scaffold-assisted methods such as macroencapsulation, droplet microfluidics, and bioprinting. Optimization of the hepatic microenvironment entails incorporating the appropriate cell composition for enhanced cell-cell interactions and niche-specific signals, and creating scaffolds with desired chemical, mechanical and physical properties. Perfusion-based culture systems such as bioreactors and microfluidic systems are used to achieve efficient exchange of nutrients and soluble factors.

Targeted and on-demand release of chemotherapeutics remains a challenge. Here, cancer-cell-membrane-coated mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) containing X-ray- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive diselenide bonds for controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) at tumor sites are developed. DOX-loaded MONs coated with 4T1 breast cancer cell membranes (CM@MON@DOX) show greater accumulation at tumor sites and prolonged blood circulation time versus an uncoated control in mice bearing 4T1 orthotopic mammary tumors.

The MSN provides efficient loading of Cas9 plasmid as well as Cas9 protein/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), while liposome-coating offers improved serum stability and enhanced cell uptake. Hypothesizing that loss-of-function mutation in the lipid-metabolism-related genes pcsk9, apoc3, and angptl3 would improve cardiovascular health by lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides, the lipoMSN is used to deliver a combination of RNPs targeting these genes. When targeting a single gene, the lipoMSN achieved a 54% gene-editing efficiency, besting the state-of-art Lipofectamine CRISPRMax. For multiplexing, lipoMSN maintained significant gene-editing at each gene target despite reduced dosage of target-specific RNP. By delivering combinations of targeting RNPs in the same nanoparticle, synergistic effects on lipid metabolism are observed in vitro and vivo.

Implantation of mesenchymal stem cell is one of the most promising approach for regenerating cartilage defects. Here we prepared polymeric nanofibrils decorated with cartilage-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) as a chondroinductive scaffold material for cartilage repair. To fabricate nanofibrils, eletrospun PCL nanofibers were fragmented by subsequent mechanical and chemical process. The nanofibrils were surface-modified with poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA@NF) via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). The epoxy groups of PGMA@NF were subsequently reacted with dECM prepared from bovine articular cartilage. Therefore, the cartilage-dECM-decorated nanofibrils structurally and biochemically mimic cartilage-specific microenvironment. Once adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were self-assembled with the cartilage-dECM-decorated nanofibrils by cell-directed association, they exhibited differentiation hallmarks of chondrogenesis without additional biologic additives. ADSCs in the nanofibril composites significantly increased expression of chondrogenic gene markers in comparison to those in pellet culture.

We report that opioids from the inflamed colon activate \u03b4-opioid receptors (DOPr) in endosomes of nociceptors. Biopsy samples of inflamed colonic mucosa from patients and mice with colitis released opioids that activated DOPr on nociceptors to cause a sustained decrease in excitability. DOPr agonists inhibited mechanically sensitive colonic nociceptors. DOPr endocytosis and endosomal signaling by protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways mediated the sustained inhibitory actions of endogenous opioids and DOPr agonists. DOPr agonists stimulated the recruitment of G\u03b1i/o and \u03b2-arrestin1/2 to endosomes. Analysis of compartmentalized signaling revealed a requirement of DOPr endocytosis for activation of PKC at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol and ERK in the nucleus. We explored a nanoparticle delivery strategy to evaluate whether endosomal DOPr might be a therapeutic target for pain. The DOPr agonist DADLE was coupled to a liposome shell for targeting DOPr-positive nociceptors and incorporated into a mesoporous silica core for release in the acidic and reducing endosomal environment. Nanoparticles activated DOPr at the plasma membrane, were preferentially endocytosed by DOPr-expressing cells, and were delivered to DOPr-positive early endosomes. Nanoparticles caused a long-lasting activation of DOPr in endosomes, which provided sustained inhibition of nociceptor excitability and relief from inflammatory pain. Conversely, nanoparticles containing a DOPr antagonist abolished the sustained inhibitory effects of DADLE. Thus, DOPr in endosomes is an endogenous mechanism and a therapeutic target for relief from chronic inflammatory pain.", "Keywords": ["G protein-coupled receptors", "inflammation", "nanomedicine", "pain", "signaling"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Colon", "Enkephalin, Leucine-2-Alanine", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Mice", "Nanoparticles", "Neurons", "Nociceptors", "Pain", "Receptors, Opioid, delta", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nestor N", "Last Name": "Jimenez-Vargas", "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 2V7."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Wisdom", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pathobiology, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, NY 10010."}, {"First Name": "Dane D", "Last Name": "Jensen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pathobiology, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, NY 10010."}, {"First Name": "Rocco", "Last Name": "Latorre", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pathobiology, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, NY 10010."}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Hegron", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pathobiology, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, NY 10010."}, {"First Name": "Shavonne", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pathobiology, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, NY 10010."}, {"First Name": "Jesse J", "Last Name": "DiCello", "Affiliation": "Drug Discovery Biology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Pradeep", "Last Name": "Rajasekhar", "Affiliation": "Drug Discovery Biology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas A", "Last Name": "Veldhuis", "Affiliation": "Drug Discovery Biology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Simona E", "Last Name": "Carbone", "Affiliation": "Drug Discovery Biology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 2V7."}, {"First Name": "Cintya", "Last Name": "Lopez-Lopez", "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 2V7."}, {"First Name": "Josue", "Last Name": "Jaramillo-Polanco", "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 2V7."}, {"First Name": "Meritxell", "Last Name": "Canals", "Affiliation": "Centre for Membrane Proteins and Receptors and Division of Physiology, Pharmacology, and Neuroscience, School of Life Sciences, Queen's Medical Centre, University of Nottingham, NG7 2RD Nottingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "David E", "Last Name": "Reed", "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 2V7."}, {"First Name": "Alan E", "Last Name": "Lomax", "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 2V7."}, {"First Name": "Brian L", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Bluestone Center for Clinical Research, New York University College of Dentistry, New York, NY 10010."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Vanner", "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Diseases Research Unit, Division of Gastroenterology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 2V7."}, {"First Name": "Michelle L", "Last Name": "Halls", "Affiliation": "Drug Discovery Biology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia;

However, the therapeutic usefulness of sCT is hindered by the frequent injection required, owing to its short plasma half-life and therapeutic need for a high dose. Oral delivery is a popular modality of administration for patients because of its convenience to self-administration and high patient compliance, while orally administered sCT remains a great challenge currently due to the existence of multiple barriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here, we introduced an orally targeted delivery system to increase the transport of sCT across the intestine through both the paracellular permeation route and the bile acid pathway. In this system, sCT-based glycol chitosan-taurocholic acid conjugate (GC-T)/dextran sulfate (DS) ternary nanocomplexes (NC-T) were produced by a flash nanocomplexation (FNC) process in a kinetically controlled mode. The optimized NC-T exhibited well-controlled properties with a uniform and sub-60 nm hydrodynamic diameter, high batch-to-batch reproducibility, good physical or chemical stability, as well as sustained drug release behaviors. The studies revealed that NC-T could effectively improve the intestinal uptake and permeability, owing to its surface functionalization with the taurocholic acid ligand. In the rat model, orally administered NC-T showed an obvious hypocalcemia effect and a relative oral bioavailability of 10.9%. An in vivo assay also demonstrated that NC-T induced no observable side effect after long-term oral administration.

Not only is TNBC difficult to treat due to the lack of molecular target receptors, but BRCA1 mutations (BRCA1m) also result in chemotherapeutic resistance, making disease recurrence more likely. Although BRCA1m are highly heterogeneous and therefore difficult to target, BRCA1 gene's synthetic lethal pair, PARP1, is conserved in BRCA1m cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeting PARP1 might be a fruitful direction to sensitize BRCA1m cancer cells to chemotherapy. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate PARP1 deficiency in two TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (BRCA1 wild-type) and MDA-MB-436 (BRCA1m). We explored whether this PARP1 disruption (PARP1m) could significantly lower the chemotherapeutic dose necessary to achieve therapeutic efficacy in both a 2D and 3D tumor-on-a-chip model. With both BRCA1m and PARP1m, the TNBC cells were more sensitive to three representative chemotherapeutic breast cancer drugs, doxorubicin, gemcitabine and docetaxel, compared with the PARP1 wild-type counterpart in the 2D culture environment. However, PARP1m did not result in this synergy in the 3D tumor-on-a-chip model, suggesting that drug dosing in the tumor microenvironment may influence the synergy.

However, its application has been limited by its short half-life (~13\u00a0h), which requires daily injections to maintain effective drug concentrations in blood, thus increasing the risk of poor patient compliance and complications. In this study, we developed a ternary liraglutide/tannic acid (TA)/Al3+ nanoparticle system based on hydrogen bond formation between liraglutide and TA and stabilized by complex coordination interaction between TA and Al3+. This ternary nanoparticle formulation offers sustained release of liraglutide for >8\u00a0days by optimizing the concentration of TA during nanoparticle assembly. A flash nanocomplexation (FNC) process was adopted to confer homogeneous mixing of the three components and control the assembly kinetics, thus enabling efficient encapsulation, a tunable drug release profile, improved nanoparticle size uniformity, and a high degree of colloidal stability. Upon a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration, the optimized formulation effectively lowered the high blood glucose level in a T2D db/db mice model to the normal range (8-10\u00a0mmol/L) within 6\u00a0h, maintained it for 60 more hours, and kept it lower than the original level for >6\u00a0days. In a 30-day treatment study, the nanoparticle formulation with a dosage frequency of once every 5\u00a0days exhibited similar or better control of blood sugar level (20% reduction in HbA1c) and weight control than daily injection of free liraglutide at the same treatment dose.

Unfortunately, most CRISPR/Cas9 non-viral delivery strategies only utilise micro-/nano-particle delivery methods. While these approaches provide reasonable genomic editing efficiencies, their systemic delivery may lead to undesirable off-target effects. For in vivo applications, a more localized and sustained delivery approach may be useful, particularly in the context of tissue regeneration. Here, we developed a scaffold that delivers the CRISPR/Cas9 components (i.e. single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein complexes) in a localized and non-viral manner. Specifically, using mussel-inspired bioadhesive coating, polyDOPA-melanin (pDOPA), we adsorbed Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes onto bio-mimicking fiber scaffolds. To evaluate the genome-editing efficiency of this platform, U2OS.EGFP cells were used as the model cell type. pDOPA coating was essential in allowing Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes to adhere onto the scaffolds with a higher loading efficiency, while laminin coating was necessary for maintaining cell viability and proliferation on the pDOPA-coated fibers for effective gene editing (21.5% editing efficiency, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Importantly, U2OS.EGFP cells took up Cas9:sgRNA lipofectamine complexes directly from the scaffolds via reverse transfection. Overall, we demonstrate the efficacy of such fiber scaffolds in providing localized, sustained and non-viral delivery of Cas9:sgRNA complexes. Such genome editing scaffolds may find useful applications in tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, there is a lack of effective non-viral means to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components for genome editing. Most existing approaches only utilize micro-/nano-particles by injection or systemic delivery, which may lead to undesirable off-target effects. Here, we report a platform that delivers the CRISPR/Cas9 components (i.e. single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein complexes) in a localized and sustained manner.

This significantly limits its clinical application. In this study, we developed a tannic acid/exendin-4/Fe3+ ternary nanoparticle system to provide sustained release of exendin-4 in vivo. The formation of these nanoparticles relies on TA/exendin-4 complexation and stabilization through TA-Fe3+ coordination, where the rapid reaction kinetics can benefit from efficient mixing of all three components. Adapting our recently developed flash nanocomplexation (FNC) method, we formulated nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiency (~ 100%) of exendin-4, high payload capacity, and high degrees of uniformity and stability because the rapid turbulent mixing facilitated a homogeneous distribution of all three components in the complexation process. Intraperitoneal injection in mice showed that exendin-4 released from the nanoparticles had an AUC 7.2-fold higher than the free exendin-4 injection. Efficacy study in a T2D mouse model showed that the optimized formulation achieved a rapid reduction of the blood glucose level to the normal range within <12\u202fh and maintained the same level for 72\u202fh following a single intraperitoneal dose. The blood glucose level was maintained to below the therapeutic level (< 15\u202fmmol/L) for 6\u202fdays, and the treatment led to reduced body weight with pathological and functional improvements in the kidney and liver.

Previous work on endocytic pathways looks at the effect of various pathway inhibitors on the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles carrying fluorescently-labeled cargo.

Inspired by these, in this study, paclitaxel (PTX) was used as a model drug, depending on intermolecular hydrogen-bonded interactions, PTX-loaded tannic acid/poly( N-vinylpyrrolidone) nanoparticles (PTX-NP) were produced by a flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) process. The optimized PTX-NP showed an average diameter of 54 nm with a drug encapsulation efficiency of 80% and loading capacity of 14.5%. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to illuminate the assembling mechanism of hydrogen-bonded PTX-NP.

Consequently, there is an increasing demand for alternative diagnostic approaches aimed at the molecular annotation of the disease on a patient-by-patient basis and the design of more personalized treatments. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology enables the development of such novel approaches. For instance, in diagnostics, the use of the RNA-specific C2c2 system allows ultrasensitive nucleic acid detection and could be used to characterize the mutational repertoire and transcriptional breast cancer signatures. In disease modeling, CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be applied to selectively engineer oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes involved in disease pathogenesis. In treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to develop gene-therapy, while its catalytically-dead variant (dCas9) can be applied to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of malignant cells. As immunotherapy becomes increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, CRISPR/Cas9 can engineer the immune cells to redirect them against cancer cells and potentiate antitumor immune responses.

In these systems, plasmid DNA can be encapsulated through condensation by a cationic lipid to form lipo-complexes, or polycation following complexation into cationic liposomes to form lipo-polyplexes. Conventional methods for achieving these two DNA-delivering LNP vehicles suffer from significant batch-to-batch variation, poor scalability and complicated multi-step preparation procedures. Resultant nanoparticles often have uncontrollable size and surface charge with wide distribution, and poor stability when exposed to physiological media. Here we report a single-step flash nanocomplexation (FNC) process using turbulent mixing to prepare uniform lipo-complex or lipo-polyplex LNPs in a scalable manner, demonstrating excellent control over the nanoparticle size (from 40 to several hundred nm) and surface charge, with narrow size distribution. The FNC-produced LNPs could be purified and concentrated using a tangential flow filtration (TFF) process in a scalable manner. An optimized formulation of purified lipo-complex LNPs (DOTAP/Chol/DNA, 45\u202fnm) showed significantly higher (5-fold in the lungs and 4-fold in the liver) transgene expression activity upon oral dosage than lipo-polyplex LNPs (DPPC/Chol/lPEI/DNA, 75\u202fnm) or lPEI/DNA nanoparticles (43\u202fnm). Repeated dosing (4\u202fdays, 150\u202f\u03bcg/day) of the lipo-complex LNPs sustained the transgene activity over a period of one week without detectable toxicity in major organs, suggesting its potential for clinical translation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We report a new method to prepare uniform size-controlled lipid-based DNA-loaded nanoparticles by turbulent mixing delivered by a multi-inlet vortex mixer. Two distinct compositions were successfully prepared: (1) lipo-complexes, through condensation of the plasmid DNA by cationic lipids; (2) lipo-polyplexes, by encapsulation of DNA/PEI together with neutral lipids. Comparing with conventional methods, which use multi-step processes with high batch-to-batch variations and poor control over nanoparticle characteristics, this method offers a single-step, continuous and reproducible assembly methodology that would promote the translation of such gene medicine products. Effective purification and concentration of nanoparticles were achieved by adopted tangential flow filtration method. Following oral gavage in mice, the lipo-complex nanoparticles showed the highest level of transgene expression in the lung and liver.", "Keywords": ["DNA delivery", "Flash nanocomplexation", "Lipid-based nanoparticles", "Oral delivery", "Size control"], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Caco-2 Cells", "Cholesterol", "DNA", "Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Humans", "Liposomes", "Mice", "Nanoparticles", "PC-3 Cells", "Particle Size", "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhiyu", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Center for Functional Biomaterials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, and Key Laboratory for Polymeric Composite and Functional Materials of Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA; Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yizong", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tianqi", "Last Name": "Nie", "Affiliation": "Center for Functional Biomaterials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, and Key Laboratory for Polymeric Composite and Functional Materials of Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"First Name": "Haoyu", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinchang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA; Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kuntao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA; Institute for NanoBioTechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lixin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Center for Functional Biomaterials, School of Materials Science and Engineering, and Key Laboratory for Polymeric Composite and Functional Materials of Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

Application of tissue glues instead of sutures could minimize the additional trauma and scar formation. Despite the countless efforts devoted to the development of high-strength tissue glues, little attention has been paid to their influence on the scar formation. Here, we report the development of a new tissue glue with excellent biocompatibility and tunable degradability for scarless wound closure. A series of catechol-containing poly(amidoamine) (CPAA) polymers were synthesized via the one-step Michael addition of dopamine and bisacrylamide. The tertiary amino group in the polymer backbone was used to introduce a zwitterionic sulfobetaine group by one-step ring-opening polymerization. The introduction of the zwitterionic sulfobetaine group could easily tune the hydrophilicity and the degradability of CPAA without influencing the density of the catechol group in the polymer. Lap-shear tests on the porcine skin demonstrated a high adhesion strength of 7 kPa at 1 h, rising to 24 kPa by 12 h. Addition of silica nanoparticles could further enhance the adhesion strength by 50%.

Here, we utilized electrospun scaffolds for sustained delivery of siRNA/MSN-PEI through surface adsorption and nanofiber encapsulation. As a proof-of-concept, we targeted collagen type I expression to modulate fibrous capsule formation. Surface adsorption of siRNA/MSN-PEI provided sustained availability of siRNA for at least 30\u202fdays in vitro. As compared to conventional bolus delivery, such scaffold-mediated transfection provided more effective gene silencing (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

In vivo subcutaneous implantation and biodistribution analysis of these scaffolds revealed that siRNA remained localized up to \u223c290\u202f\u03bcm from the implants. Finally, a fibrous capsule reduction of \u223c45.8% was observed after 4\u202fweeks in vivo as compared to negative scrambled siRNA treatment.

Methods available for fabricating protein-encapsulating nanoparticles in a scalable fashion are scarce. Protein delivery often requires multiple functionalities to be incorporated into the same vehicle. Specifically for nanoparticle-mediated oral delivery of protein therapeutics, protection in GI tract, site-specific release, facilitating transmucosal permeation, and enhancing epithelial transport are a few desirable features to be engineered into a nanoparticle system. Here we devised a sequential flash nanocomplexation (FNC) technique for the scalable production of a core-shell structured nanoparticle system by combining materials choice and particle size and structure to fulfill these functions, therefore enhancing the delivery efficiency of insulin. This method is highly effective in controlling the size, generating core-shell structure with high encapsulation efficiency (97%) and payload capacity (67%) using insulin/l-penetratin complex nanoparticles as a core coated with hyaluronic acid (HA). Both the in vitro and in vivo models confirmed that the HA coating on these core-shell nanoparticles enhanced the permeation of nanoparticles through the intestinal mucus layer and improved trans-epithelial absorption of insulin nanoparticles; and the enhancement effect was most prominent using HA with the highest average molecular weight. The insulin-loaded nanoparticles were then encapsulated into enteric microcapsules (MCs) in an FNC process to provide additional protection against the acidic environment in the stomach while allowing rapid release of insulin nanoparticles when they reach small intestine. The optimized multifunctional MCs delivered an effective glucose reduction in a Type I diabetes rat model following a single oral administration, yielding a relative bioavailability of 11% in comparison with subcutaneous injection of free-form insulin. This FNC technique is highly effective in controlling particle size and structure to improve delivery properties and function.

In this work, a multifunctional mixed micellar system, consisting of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) for specific liver-targeting, trans-activator of transcription (TAT) peptide for potent cell penetration, and pH-sensitive poly(\u03b2-amino ester) polymers for acidic-triggered drug release, was developed to provide HCC-targeting delivery and pH-triggered release of doxorubicin (DOX). These micelles were hypothesized to efficaciously accumulate in HCC site by the guide of GA ligands, enter into cancer cells facilitated by the activated TAT peptide on the micellar surface, and finally rapidly release DOX in cytoplasm. To demonstrate this design, DOX was initially loaded in micelles modified with both GA and TAT (DOX/GA@TAT-M) with high drug loading efficiency and pH-sensitive drug release profiles. The HCC-targeting cellular uptake and synergetic anticancer efficacy were tested, indicating DOX/GA@TAT-M could be specifically and effectively internalized into HCC cells by the effect of GA targeting and TAT penetrating with enhanced cytotoxicity. In addition, the prolonged circulation time and enhanced accumulation in tumor facilitated its potent tumor growth inhibition activity in vivo. These results demonstrated that the cleavable multifunctional mixed micelles with tumor targeting, controlled TAT peptide activation, and sequential pH-sensitive drug release could be an efficient strategy for HCC treatment.", "Keywords": ["TAT exposure", "glycyrrhetinic acid", "mixed micelles", "pH-sensitive", "tumor-targeting"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Doxorubicin", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Drug Liberation", "Glycyrrhetinic Acid", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Liver Neoplasms", "Micelles", "Peptides", "Polymers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jinming", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau , Macao 999078, China."}, {"First Name": "Yifeng", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicines, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou 510275, China."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicines, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziren", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicines, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"First Name": "Yitao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau , Macao 999078, China."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University , New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Meiwan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau , Macao 999078, China."}], "Journal": "Molecular pharmaceutics", "PubDate": "2017Nov06"}, {"PMID": "28734498", "Title": "Surgical site infection reduction bundle in patients with gynecologic cancer undergoing colon surgery.", "Abstract": "Surgical site infections (SSIs) can lead to substantial morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased costs, and death in patients undergoing colorectal procedures.

Formulation of protein nanoparticles by polyelectrolyte complexation between the protein and a natural polymer such as chitosan (CS) is a popular approach. However, the current method of batch-mode mixing faces significant challenges in scaling up while maintaining size control, high uniformity, and high encapsulation efficiency. Here we report a new method, termed flash nanocomplexation (FNC), to fabricate insulin nanoparticles by infusing aqueous solutions of CS, tripolyphosphate (TPP), and insulin under rapid mixing condition (Re\u00a0>\u00a01600) in a multi-inlet vortex mixer. In comparison with the bulk-mixing method, the optimized FNC process produces CS/TPP/insulin nanoparticles with a smaller size (down to 45\u00a0nm) and narrower size distribution, higher encapsulation efficiency (up to 90%), and pH-dependent nanoparticle dissolution and insulin release. The CS/TPP/insulin nanoparticles can be lyophilized and reconstituted without loss of activity, and produced at a throughput of 5.1\u00a0g\u00a0h-1 when a flow rate of 50\u00a0mL\u00a0min-1 is used. Evaluated in a Type I diabetes rat model, the smaller nanoparticles (45\u00a0nm and 115\u00a0nm) control the blood glucose level through oral administration more effectively than the larger particles (240\u00a0nm).

Cells undergoing transdifferentiation expressed ACTN2 and TNNT2 and partially organized their cytoskeleton in a cross-striated manner. The conversion process was associated with significant upregulation of a cohort of cardiac-specific genes, activation of pathways associated with muscle contraction and physiology, and downregulation of fibroblastic markers. We used a genetically encoded calcium indicator and readily detected active calcium transients although no spontaneous contractions were observed in transdifferentiated cells. Finally, we determined that inhibition of Janus kinase 1, inhibition of Glycogen synthase kinase 3, or addition of NRG1 significantly enhanced the efficiency of transdifferentiation.

The method combines multiple techniques, involving soft lithography to replicate poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds from a well-defined mold, stitch technique to assemble multiple PDMS molds to a single large mold, and nanoimprinting to generate a master mold on polystyrene (PS) substrates.

Thus, transcriptional activation and epigenetic remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are sufficient for conversion between cell types.

Hypothesizing that nanomedicines may impact ICD due to their proven advantages in delivery of chemotherapeutics, we encapsulated oxaliplatin (OXA) or gemcitabine (GEM), an ICD and a non-ICD inducer respectively, into the amphiphilic diblock copolymer nanoparticles. Neither GEM nor nanoparticle-encapsulated GEM (NP-GEM) induced ICD, while both OXA and nanoparticle-encapsulated OXA (NP-OXA) induced ICD. Interestingly, NP-OXA treated tumor cells released more DAMPs and induced stronger immune responses of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes than OXA treatment in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, OXA and NP-OXA exhibited stronger therapeutic effects in immunocompetent mice than in immunodeficient mice, and the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy was significantly higher in the NP-OXA group than the OXA group. Moreover, NP-OXA treatment induced a higher proportion of tumor infiltrating activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes than OXA treatment. This general trend of enhanced ICD by nanoparticle delivery was corroborated in evaluating another pair of ICD inducer and non-ICD inducer, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil. In conclusion, although nanoparticle encapsulation did not endow a non-ICD inducer with ICD-mediated anti-tumor capacity, treatment with a nanoparticle-encapsulated ICD inducer led to significantly enhanced ICD and consequently improved anti-tumor effects than the free ICD inducer.

Recent advances in nanotechnology have made a major contribution to the development of multifunctional nanomaterials, which represents a paradigm shift from single purpose to multipurpose materials. Multifunctional nanomaterials have been proposed to enable simultaneous target imaging and on-demand delivery of therapeutic agents only to the specific site. Most advanced systems are also responsive to internal or external stimuli. This approach is particularly important for highly potent drugs (e.g. chemotherapeutics), which should be delivered in a discreet manner and interact with cells/tissues only locally. Both advances in imaging and precisely controlled and localized delivery are critically important in cancer treatment, and the use of such systems - theranostics - holds great promise to minimise side effects and boost therapeutic effectiveness of the treatment. Among others, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) are considered one of the most promising nanomaterials for drug delivery. Due to their unique intrinsic features, including tunable porosity and size, large surface area, structural diversity, easily modifiable chemistry and suitability for functionalization, and biocompatibility, MSNPs have been extensively utilized as multifunctional nanocarrier systems. The combination or hybridization with biomolecules, drugs, and other nanoparticles potentiated the ability of MSNPs towards multifunctionality, and even smart actions stimulated by specified signals, including pH, optical signal, redox reaction, electricity and magnetism.

They require an effective delivery system, which can take the form of a scaffold (e.g., hydrogels and electrospun fibers), carrier (viral and nonviral), nano- and microparticle, or genetically modified cell. In this review, we will discuss the history and current technologies of drug, protein, and gene delivery in the context of regenerative medicine. Next, we will present case examples of how delivery technologies are being applied to promote angiogenesis in nonhealing wounds or prevent angiogenesis in age related macular degeneration. Finally, we will conclude with a brief discussion of the regulatory pathway from bench to bedside for the clinical translation of these novel therapeutics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Humans", "Nucleic Acids", "Peptides", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Proteins", "Regenerative Medicine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth R", "Last Name": "Lorden", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, 101 Science Drive, Durham, NC, 27708, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard M", "Last Name": "Levinson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Drug delivery and translational research", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}, {"PMID": "25770356", "Title": "Engineering mesenchymal stem cells for regenerative medicine and drug delivery.", "Abstract": "Researchers have applied mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to a variety of therapeutic scenarios by harnessing their multipotent, regenerative, and immunosuppressive properties with tropisms toward inflamed, hypoxic, and cancerous sites.

Murine iPSCs were directed to differentiate toward the chondrogenic lineage with an established protocol and then engineered to express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce the expression of p21. Cells expressing the p21 shRNA demonstrated higher proliferative potential during monolayer expansion and increased synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in pellet cultures. Furthermore, these cells could be expanded \u223c150-fold over three additional passages without a reduction in the subsequent production of GAGs, while control cells showed reduced potential for GAG synthesis with three additional passages.

RNA for contractile proteins was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Elastic moduli of skin and scar tissue were analyzed using a microstrain analyzer. Grafts contracted to \u223c45% of their original size by day 14 and maintained their size. Grafting of GFP mouse skin onto wild-type mice, and analysis of dermal thickness and hair follicle density, confirmed graft survival. Interestingly, hair follicles disappeared after grafting and regenerated in ear skin configuration by day 30. Radiological analysis revealed that panniculus carnosus doesn't contribute to contraction. Microscopic analyses showed that grafts show increase in cellularity. Granulation tissue formed after day 3. Collagen analysis revealed increases in collagen maturation over time. CD31 stain revealed increased vascularity. Macrophages and mast cells were increased. qRT-PCR showed up-regulation of transforming growth factor beta, alpha smooth muscle actin, and rho-associated protein kinase 2 in HSc.

It requires the design of carriers capable of simultaneously transporting to and releasing multiple therapeutics at a disease site. Co-delivery has arisen from the emerging trend of combination therapy, where treatment with two or more therapeutics at the same time can succeed where single therapeutics fail. However, conventional combination therapy offers little control over achieving an optimized therapeutic ratio at the target site. Co-delivery via inclusion of multiple therapeutic cargos within the same carrier addresses this issue by not only ensuring delivery of both therapeutics to the same cell, but also offering a platform for control of the delivery process, from loading to release. Co-delivery systems have been formulated using a number of carriers previously developed for single-therapeutic delivery. Liposomes, polymeric micelles, PLGA nanoparticles, and dendrimers have all been adapted for co-delivery. Much of the effort focuses on dealing with drugs having dissimilar properties, increasing loading efficiencies, and controlling loading and release ratios. In this review, we highlight the innovations in carrier designs and formulations to deliver combination cargoes of drug/drug, drug/siRNA, and drug/pDNA toward disease therapy.

Great interest exists in the use of autologous or allogeneic cells delivered to the degenerated IVD to promote matrix regeneration. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from a patient's own somatic cells, have demonstrated their capacity to differentiate into various cell types although their potential to differentiate into an IVD cell has not yet been demonstrated. The overall objective of this study was to assess the possibility of generating iPSC-derived nucleus pulposus (NP) cells in a mouse model, a cell population that is entirely derived from notochord. This study employed magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) to isolate a CD24(+) iPSC subpopulation. Notochordal cell-related gene expression was analyzed in this CD24(+) cell fraction via real time RT-PCR. CD24(+) iPSCs were then cultured in a laminin-rich culture system for up to 28 days, and the mouse NP phenotype was assessed by immunostaining. This study also focused on producing a more conducive environment for NP differentiation of mouse iPSCs with addition of low oxygen tension and notochordal cell conditioned medium (NCCM) to the culture platform. iPSCs were evaluated for an ability to adopt an NP-like phenotype through a combination of immunostaining and biochemical assays. Results demonstrated that a CD24(+) fraction of mouse iPSCs could be retrieved and differentiated into a population that could synthesize matrix components similar to that in native NP. Likewise, the addition of a hypoxic environment and NCCM induced a similar phenotypic result.

Lipoplex nanoparticles are popular nanocarriers for gene delivery. In conventional transfection methods, the cellular uptake of lipoplex nanoparticels occurs through the endocytosis process. The entrapment of lipoplex nanoparticles into endocytic vesicle is a major barrier in achieving efficient gene silencing and expression. Here, a novel nanochannel electroporation (NEP) method is employed to facilitate the cellular uptake and release of siRNAs/DNAs from lipoplexes. First, it is demonstrated that in a NEP device, lipoplex nanoparticles can be injected directly into the cell cytoplasm within several seconds.

Consequently, increased wall stress and workload on the remaining myocardium leads to chamber dilation, dysfunction, and heart failure.

However, it is unclear whether cardiac progenitor cell-derived cardiomyocytes are capable of attaining levels of structural and functional maturity comparable to that of terminally-fated cardiomyocytes. Here, we first describe the derivation of mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which once differentiated allow for the enrichment of Nkx2-5(+) cardiac progenitors, and the cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the red fluorescent protein. We show that the cardiac progenitors are multipotent and capable of differentiating into endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Moreover, cardiac progenitor selection corresponds to cKit(+) cell enrichment, while cardiomyocyte cell-lineage commitment is concomitant with dual expression of either cKit/Flk1 or cKit/Sca-1. We proceed to show that the cardiac progenitor-derived cardiomyocytes are capable of forming electrically and mechanically coupled large-scale 2D cell cultures with mature electrophysiological properties. Finally, we examine the cell progenitors' ability to form electromechanically coherent macroscopic tissues, using a physiologically relevant 3D culture model and demonstrate that following long-term culture the cardiomyocytes align, and form robust electromechanical connections throughout the volume of the biosynthetic tissue construct.

Functional assays such as immune response and systemic protein concentration analysis can further define the merits of the oral delivery systems. As biologics become increasingly more important in chronic therapies, nanoparticle-mediated oral delivery will assume greater prominence, and more sophisticated in vitro and in vivo models will be required.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Biological Availability", "Cell Line", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Carriers", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Hematologic Tests", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Models, Biological", "Nanoparticles", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Radionuclide Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer M", "Last Name": "Gamboa", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, 101 Science Drive, Durham, NC 27708, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Advanced drug delivery reviews", "PubDate": "2013Jun15"}, {"PMID": "23306021", "Title": "Transfection efficiency and transgene expression kinetics of mRNA delivered in naked and nanoparticle format.", "Abstract": "Transfection efficiencies and transgene expression kinetics of messenger RNA (mRNA), an emerging class of nucleic acid-based therapeutics, have been poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated transfection efficiencies of mRNA delivered in naked and nanoparticle format in vitro and in vivo using GFP and luciferase as reporters. While mRNA nanoparticles transfect primary human and mouse dendritic cells (DCs) efficiently in vitro, naked mRNA could not produce any detectable gene product. The protein expression of nanoparticle-mediated transfection in vitro peaks rapidly within 5-7h and decays in a biphasic manner. In vivo, naked mRNA is more efficient than mRNA nanoparticles when administered subcutaneously. In contrast, mRNA nanoparticle performs better when administered intranasally and intravenously. Gene expression is most transient when delivered intravenously in nanoparticle format with an apparent half-life of 1.4h and lasts less than 24h, and most sustained when delivered in the naked format subcutaneously at the base of tail with an apparent half-life of 18h and persists for at least 6days. Notably, exponential decreases in protein expression are consistently observed post-delivery of mRNA in vivo regardless of the mode of delivery (naked or nanoparticle) or the site of administration. This study elucidates the performance of mRNA transfection and suggests a niche for mRNA therapeutics when predictable in vivo transgene expression kinetics is imperative.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Intranasal", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Dendritic Cells", "Drug Carriers", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Injections, Intravenous", "Injections, Subcutaneous", "Kinetics", "Luciferases", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nanoparticles", "Primary Cell Culture", "RNA, Messenger", "Regression Analysis", "Tissue Distribution", "Transfection", "Transgenes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyle K L", "Last Name": "Phua", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Smita K", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "PubDate": "2013Mar28"}, {"PMID": "23171167", "Title": "Comparison of mixed and lamellar coculture spatial arrangements for tissue engineering capillary networks in vitro.", "Abstract": "Coculture of endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro can yield confluent monolayers or EC networks. Factors influencing this transition are not known. In this study, we examined whether the spatial arrangement of EC-SMC cocultures affected EC migration, network morphology, and angiogenic protein secretion. Human umbilical cord blood-derived ECs (hCB-ECs) were grown in coculture with human aortic SMCs in either a mixed or lamellar spatial geometry and analyzed over a culture period of 12 days. The hCB-ECs cultured on SMCs in a mixed system had higher cell speeds, shorter persistence times, and lower random motility coefficients than ECs in a lamellar system. By day 12 of coculture, mixed systems demonstrated greater anastomoses and capillary loop formation than lamellar systems as evidenced by a higher number of branch points, angle of curvature between branch points, and percentage of imaged area covered by networks. The network morphology was more uniform in the mixed systems than the lamellar systems with fewer EC clusters present after several days in culture. Proliferation of hCB-ECs was higher for mixed cocultures during the first 24\u2009h of coculture, and then declined dramatically suggesting that proliferation only contributed to network formation during the early stages of coculture. Proteome assay results show reduced solution levels, but no change in intracellular levels of angiogenic proteins in lamellar systems compared to mixed systems. These data suggest that mixing ECs and SMCs together favors the formation of EC networks to a greater extent than a lamellar arrangement in which ECs form a cell layer above a confluent, quiescent layer of SMCs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anastomosis, Surgical", "Capillaries", "Cell Aggregation", "Cell Movement", "Coculture Techniques", "Endothelial Cells", "Fetal Blood", "Humans", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Tissue Engineering", "Transduction, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erica B", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Christoforou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George A", "Last Name": "Truskey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Tissue engineering.

Due to its absence of toxicity, easy administration, and antigen specificity, oral tolerance is a very attractive approach to prevent unwanted immune responses that cause a variety of diseases or that complicate treatment of a disease. Many researchers have induced oral tolerance to efficiently treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in different animal models. However, clinical trials yielded limited success. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of oral tolerance induction to therapeutic proteins is critical for paving the way for clinical development of oral tolerance protocols. This review will summarize progress on understanding the major underlying tolerance mechanisms and contributors, including antigen presenting cells, regulatory T cells, cytokines, and signaling pathways. Potential applications, examples for therapeutic proteins and disease targets, and recent developments in delivery methods are discussed.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Antibody Formation", "Antigen-Presenting Cells", "Cytokines", "Drug Carriers", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Humans", "Lymphoid Tissue", "Nanoparticles", "Plants, Genetically Modified", "Proteins", "Recombinant Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Somatostatin-Secreting Cells", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaomei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. wangxiaomei@ufl.edu"}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Sherman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gongxian", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kam W", "Last Name": "Leong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Daniell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cox", "Last Name": "Terhorst", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roland W", "Last Name": "Herzog", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Advanced drug delivery reviews", "PubDate": "2013Jun15"}, {"PMID": "23088863", "Title": "Advanced materials and processing for drug delivery: the past and the future.", "Abstract": "Design and synthesis of efficient drug delivery systems are of vital importance for medicine and healthcare.
