[{"PMID": "35476991", "Title": "An increase in spontaneous activity mediates visual habituation.", "Abstract": "The cerebral cortex is spontaneously active, but the function of this ongoing activity remains unclear. To test whether spontaneous activity encodes learned experiences, we measured the response of neuronal populations in mouse primary visual cortex with chronic two-photon calcium imaging during visual habituation to a specific oriented stimulus. We find that, during habituation, spontaneous activity increases in neurons across the full range of orientation selectivity, eventually matching that of evoked levels. This increase in spontaneous activity robustly correlates with the degree of habituation. Moreover, boosting spontaneous activity with two-photon optogenetic stimulation to the levels of visually evoked activity accelerates habituation. Our study shows that cortical spontaneous activity is linked to habituation, and we propose that habituation unfolds by minimizing the difference between spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity levels. We conclude that baseline spontaneous activity could gate incoming sensory information to the cortex based on the learned experience of the animal.", "Keywords": ["CP: Neuroscience", "V1", "intrinsic activity", "mouse", "ongoing activity", "perceptual learning", "visual memory", "visual recognition"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Learning", "Mice", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jae-Eun Kang", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "NeuroTechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Division of Systems Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA.

This criticality is manifested by power law distribution of the size and duration of spontaneous cascades of activity, which are referred as neuronal avalanches. The existence of such neuronal avalanches has been confirmed by several studies both in vitro and in vivo, among different species and across multiple spatial scales. However, despite the prevalence of scale free activity, still very little is known concerning whether and how the scale-free nature of cortical activity is altered during external stimulation. To address this question, we performed in vivo two-photon population calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in primary visual cortex of behaving mice during visual stimulation and conducted statistical analyses on the inferred spike trains. Our investigation for each mouse and condition revealed power law distributed neuronal avalanches, and irregular spiking individual neurons. Importantly, both the avalanche and the spike train properties remained largely unchanged for different stimuli, while the cross-correlation structure varied with stimuli. Our results establish that microcircuits in the visual cortex operate near the critical regime, while rearranging functional connectivity in response to varying sensory inputs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Calcium", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Models, Neurological", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yahya", "Last Name": "Karimipanah", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhengyu", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jae-Eun Kang", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center and Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center and Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ralf", "Last Name": "Wessel", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "26774159", "Title": "Simultaneous Multi-plane Imaging of Neural Circuits.", "Abstract": "Recording the activity of large populations of neurons is an important step toward understanding the\u00a0emergent function of neural circuits.

To explore this, we used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of neuronal populations in primary visual cortex of awake mice in the presence and absence of visual stimulation. Multidimensional analysis of the network activity allowed us to identify neuronal ensembles defined as groups of cells firing in synchrony. These synchronous groups of neurons were themselves activated in sequential temporal patterns, which repeated at much higher proportions than chance and were triggered by specific visual stimuli such as natural visual scenes. Interestingly, sequential patterns were also present in recordings of spontaneous activity without any sensory stimulation and were accompanied by precise firing sequences at the single-cell level. Moreover, intrinsic dynamics could be used to predict the occurrence of future neuronal ensembles. Our data demonstrate that visual stimuli recruit similar sequential patterns to the ones observed spontaneously, consistent with the hypothesis that already existing Hebbian cell assemblies firing in predefined temporal sequences could be the microcircuit substrate that encodes visual percepts changing in time.", "Keywords": ["graph theory", "in vivo calcium imaging", "multidimensional population vectors", "neuronal ensembles", "primary visual cortex", "two-photon microscopy"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Calcium", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Parvalbumins", "Photic Stimulation", "Psychophysics", "Reaction Time", "Somatostatin", "Visual Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luis", "Last Name": "Carrillo-Reid", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027 lc2998@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jae-Eun Kang", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Jordan P", "Last Name": "Hamm", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Jesse", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2015Jun10"}, {"PMID": "25201983", "Title": "Visual stimuli recruit intrinsically generated cortical ensembles.", "Abstract": "The cortical microcircuit is built with recurrent excitatory connections, and it has long been suggested that the purpose of this design is to enable intrinsically driven reverberating activity. To understand the dynamics of neocortical intrinsic activity better, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of populations of neurons from the primary visual cortex of awake mice during visual stimulation and spontaneous activity. In both conditions, cortical activity is dominated by coactive groups of neurons, forming ensembles whose activation cannot be explained by the independent firing properties of their contributing neurons, considered in isolation. Moreover, individual neurons flexibly join multiple ensembles, vastly expanding the encoding potential of the circuit. Intriguingly, the same coactive ensembles can repeat spontaneously and in response to visual stimuli, indicating that stimulus-evoked responses arise from activating these intrinsic building blocks. Although the spatial properties of stimulus-driven and spontaneous ensembles are similar, spontaneous ensembles are active at random intervals, whereas visually evoked ensembles are time-locked to stimuli. We conclude that neuronal ensembles, built by the coactivation of flexible groups of neurons, are emergent functional units of cortical activity and propose that visual stimuli recruit intrinsically generated ensembles to represent visual attributes.", "Keywords": ["V1", "assemblies", "mouse", "reverberation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Mice", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jae-eun Kang", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 jkm2149@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Inbal", "Last Name": "Ayzenshtat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Luis", "Last Name": "Carrillo-Reid", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2014Sep23"}, {"PMID": "24760863", "Title": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mediates circadian rhythms in mammalian olfactory bulb and olfaction.", "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the olfactory bulbs (OBs) function as an independent circadian system regulating daily rhythms in olfactory performance. However, the cells and signals in the olfactory system that generate and coordinate these circadian rhythms are unknown. Using real-time imaging of gene expression, we found that the isolated olfactory epithelium and OB, but not the piriform cortex, express similar, sustained circadian rhythms in PERIOD2 (PER2). In vivo, PER2 expression in the OB of mice is circadian, approximately doubling with a peak around subjective dusk. Furthermore, mice exhibit circadian rhythms in odor detection performance with a peak at approximately subjective dusk. We also found that circadian rhythms in gene expression and odor detection performance require vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or its receptor VPAC2R. VIP is expressed, in a circadian manner, in interneurons in the external plexiform and periglomerular layers, whereas VPAC2R is expressed in mitral and external tufted cells in the OB. Together, these results indicate that VIP signaling modulates the output from the OB to maintain circadian rhythms in the mammalian olfactory system.", "Keywords": ["VIP", "circadian", "clock", "olfaction", "olfactory discrimination", "rhythms"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "Circadian Rhythm", "Male", "Mice", "Motor Activity", "Olfactory Bulb", "Olfactory Mucosa", "Olfactory Pathways", "Period Circadian Proteins", "Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, Type II", "Smell", "Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jae-Eun Kang", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biology and Anatomy and Neurobiology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63130."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Granados-Fuentes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luciano", "Last Name": "Marpegan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy E", "Last Name": "Holy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erik D", "Last Name": "Herzog", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014Apr23"}]
