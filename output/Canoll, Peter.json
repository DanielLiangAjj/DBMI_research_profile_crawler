Here, we explored pathological changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the familial AD APPV717I mutation after cell injection into the mouse forebrain. APPV717I mutant iPSCs and isogenic controls were differentiated into neurons revealing enhanced A\u03b242 production, elevated phospho-tau, and impaired neurite outgrowth in APPV717I neurons. Two months after transplantation, APPV717I and control neural cells showed robust engraftment but at 12\u00a0months post-injection, APPV717I grafts were smaller and demonstrated impaired neurite outgrowth compared to controls, while plaque and tangle pathology were not seen. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of micro-dissected grafts, performed 2 months after cell injection, identified significantly altered transcriptome signatures in APPV717I iPSC-derived neurons pointing towards dysregulated synaptic function and axon guidance. Interestingly, APPV717I neurons showed an increased expression of genes, many of which are also upregulated in postmortem neurons of AD patients including the transmembrane protein LINGO2. Downregulation of LINGO2 in cultured APPV717I neurons rescued neurite outgrowth deficits and reversed key AD-associated transcriptional changes related but not limited to synaptic function, apoptosis and cellular senescence.

Furthermore, these senescent cells expand the repertoire of cells resistant to these drugs by secreting an array of factors, including TGF\u03b2, which induce proliferating cells to exit mitosis and become quiescent-a state that also resists spindle inhibitors.

This heterogeneity is further exacerbated during GBM recurrence, as treatment-induced reactive changes produce additional intratumoral heterogeneity that is ambiguous to differentiate on clinical imaging. There is an urgent need to develop non-invasive approaches to map the heterogeneous landscape of histopathological alterations throughout the entire lesion for each patient. We propose to predictively fuse Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with the underlying intratumoral heterogeneity in recurrent GBM using machine learning (ML) by leveraging image-localized biopsies with their associated locoregional MRI features. To this end, we develop BioNet, a biologically-informed neural network model, to predict regional distributions of three tissue-specific gene modules: proliferating tumor, reactive/inflammatory cells, and infiltrated brain tissue. BioNet offers valuable insights into the integration of multiple implicit and qualitative biological domain knowledge, which are challenging to describe in mathematical formulations. BioNet performs significantly better than a range of existing methods on cross-validation and blind test datasets. Voxel-level prediction maps of the gene modules by BioNet help reveal intratumoral heterogeneity, which can improve surgical targeting of confirmatory biopsies and evaluation of neuro-oncological treatment effectiveness. The non-invasive nature of the approach can potentially facilitate regular monitoring of the gene modules over time, and making timely therapeutic adjustment. These results also highlight the emerging role of ML in precision medicine.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hairong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "H.

Through interrogation of publicly available CRISPR and RNAi library screens, we identified the \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) gene, which encodes an enzyme that is part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as essential for GBM growth. Moreover, by combining transcriptome and metabolite screening analyses, we discovered that loss of function of OGDH by the clinically validated drug compound CPI-613 was synthetically lethal with Bcl-xL inhibition (genetically and through the clinically validated BH3 mimetic, ABT263) in patient-derived xenografts as well neurosphere GBM cultures. CPI-613-mediated energy deprivation drove an integrated stress response with an upregulation of the BH3-only domain protein, Noxa, in an ATF4-dependent manner, as demonstrated by genetic loss-of-function experiments. Consistently, silencing of Noxa attenuated cell death induced by CPI-613 in model systems of GBM. In patient-derived xenograft models of GBM in mice, the combination treatment of ABT263 and CPI-613 suppressed tumor growth and extended animal survival more potently than each compound on its own.

Alternative models using human cells such as human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may provide significant advantages, since they have successfully been used to model disease mechanisms in neurons and in glial cells in neurodegenerative diseases in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we summarize recent studies that describe the transplantation of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells into the forebrain of mice to generate chimeric transplantation models of AD.

Using different model systems including HMC3 cells, iPSC-derived microglia and cerebral organoids, we characterize the effect of these compounds in mimicking human microglial subtypes in vitro. We show that the Topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin induces a CD74high/MHChigh microglial subtype which is specialized in amyloid beta phagocytosis.

The IDH1R132H mutation is an important diagnostic tool for tumor diagnosis and prognosis; however, its role in glioma development, and its impact on response to therapy, is not fully understood. We developed a murine model of proneural IDH1R132H-mutated glioma that shows elevated production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and increased trimethylation of lysine residue K27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) compared to IDH1 wild-type tumors. We found that using Tazemetostat to inhibit the methyltransferase for H3K27, Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2), reduced H3K27me3 levels and increased acetylation on H3K27. We also found that, although the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Panobinostat was less cytotoxic in IDH1R132H-mutated cells (either isolated from murine glioma or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells infected in vitro with a retrovirus expressing IDH1R132H) compared to IDH1-wild-type cells, combination treatment with Tazemetostat is synergistic in both mutant and wild-type models.

Neurons are increasingly appreciated as important reactive components of the glioma microenvironment, due to their role in causing hallmark glioma symptoms, such as cognitive deficits and seizures, as well as their potential ability to drive glioma progression. Separately, mTOR signaling has been shown to have pleiotropic effects in the brain tumor microenvironment, including regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability. However, the local cellular-level effects of mTOR inhibition on glioma-induced neuronal alterations are not well understood. Here we employed neuron-specific profiling of ribosome-bound mRNA via 'RiboTag,' morphometric analysis of dendritic spines, and in vivo calcium imaging, along with pharmacological mTOR inhibition to investigate the impact of glioma burden and mTOR inhibition on these neuronal alterations. The RiboTag analysis of tumor-associated excitatory neurons showed a downregulation of transcripts encoding excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins and dendritic spine development, and an upregulation of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal proteins involved in dendritic spine turnover. Light and electron microscopy of tumor-associated excitatory neurons demonstrated marked decreases in dendritic spine density. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in tumor-associated excitatory neurons revealed progressive alterations in neuronal activity, both at the population and single-neuron level, throughout tumor growth. This in vivo calcium imaging also revealed altered stimulus-evoked somatic calcium events, with changes in event rate, size, and temporal alignment to stimulus, which was most pronounced in neurons with high-tumor burden. A single acute dose of AZD8055, a combined mTORC1/2 inhibitor, reversed the glioma-induced alterations on the excitatory neurons, including the alterations in ribosome-bound transcripts, dendritic spine density, and stimulus evoked responses seen by calcium imaging. These results point to mTOR-driven pathological plasticity in neurons at the infiltrative margin of glioma - manifested by alterations in ribosome-bound mRNA, dendritic spine density, and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity. Collectively, our work identifies the pathological changes that tumor-associated excitatory neurons experience as both hyperlocal and reversible under the influence of mTOR inhibition, providing a foundation for developing therapies targeting neuronal signaling in glioma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander R", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation":

frontotemporal dementia.", "Abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in prevalence and comprise a large socioeconomic burden on patients and their caretakers. The need for effective therapies and avenues for disease prevention and monitoring is of paramount importance. Fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases have gained a variety of uses, including informing participant selection for clinical trials, lending confidence to clinical diagnosis and disease staging, determining prognosis, and monitoring therapeutic response. Their role is expected to grow as disease-modifying therapies start to be available to a broader range of patients and as prevention strategies become established. Many of the underlying molecular mechanisms of currently used biomarkers are incompletely understood. Animal models and in vitro systems using cell lines have been extensively employed but face important translatability limitations. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, where a theoretically unlimited range of cell\u00a0types can be reprogrammed from peripheral cells sampled from patients or healthy individuals, has gained prominence over the last decade. It is a promising avenue to study physiological and pathological biomarker function and response to experimental therapeutics. Such systems are amenable to high-throughput drug screening or multiomics readouts such as transcriptomics, lipidomics, and proteomics for biomarker discovery, investigation, and validation. The present review describes the current state of biomarkers in the clinical context of neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. We include a discussion of how iPSC models have been used to investigate and test biomarkers such as amyloid-\u03b2, phosphorylated tau, neurofilament light chain or complement proteins, and even nominate novel biomarkers. We discuss the limitations of current iPSC methods, mentioning alternatives such as coculture systems and three-dimensional organoids which address some of these concerns. Finally, we propose exciting prospects for stem cell transplantation paradigms using animal models as a preclinical tool to study biomarkers in the in vivo context.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "biomarkers", "disease modeling", "frontotemporal dementia", "iPSC", "induced pluripotent stem cells"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julie J", "Last Name": "McInvale", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2024Jan21"}, {"PMID": "38105955", "Title": "Consensus scHPF Identifies Cell Type-Specific Drug Responses in Glioma by Integrating Large-Scale scRNA-seq.", "Abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic analyses now frequently involve elaborate study designs including samples from multiple individuals, experimental conditions, perturbations, and batches from complex tissues. Dimensionality reduction is required to facilitate integration, interpretation, and statistical analysis. However, these datasets often include subtly different cellular subpopulations or state transitions, which are poorly described by clustering. We previously reported a Bayesian matrix factorization algorithm called single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF) that identifies gene co-expression patterns directly from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) count matrices while accounting for transcript drop-out and noise. Here, we describe consensus scHPF, which analyzes scHPF models from multiple random initializations to identify the most robust gene signatures and automatically determine the number of factors for a given dataset. Consensus scHPF facilitates integration of complex datasets with highly multi-modal posterior distributions, resulting in factors that can be uniformly analyzed across individuals and conditions. To demonstrate the utility of consensus scHPF, we performed a meta-analysis of a large-scale scRNA-seq dataset from drug-treated, human glioma slice cultures generated from surgical specimens across three major cell types, 19 patients, 10 drug treatment conditions, and 52 samples.

Further, the addition of immunotherapies, while promising in a number of other solid tumors, has overwhelmingly failed in the treatment of gliomas, in part due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor drug penetrance to the brain. Local delivery of immunomodulatory therapies circumvents some of these challenges and has led to long-term remission in select patients. Many of these approaches utilize convection-enhanced delivery (CED) for immunological drug delivery, allowing high doses to be delivered directly to the brain parenchyma, avoiding systemic toxicity.

These tissue-states correlated with radiographic, histopathologic, and prognostic features and were enriched in distinct metabolic pathways. Fatty acid biosynthesis was enriched in the tissue-state defined by the cohabitation of astrocyte-like/mesenchymal glioma cells, reactive astrocytes, and macrophages, and was associated with recurrent GBM and shorter survival.

We performed a first-of-kind evaluation of two transcriptome-based precision cancer medicine methodologies to predict tumor sensitivity to a comprehensive repertoire of clinically relevant oncology drugs, whose mechanism of action we experimentally assessed in cognate cell lines. We enrolled patients with histologically distinct, poor-prognosis malignancies who had progressed on multiple therapies, and developed low-passage, patient-derived xenograft models that were used to validate 35 patient-specific drug predictions. Both OncoTarget, which identifies high-affinity inhibitors of individual master regulator (MR) proteins, and OncoTreat, which identifies drugs that invert the transcriptional activity of hyperconnected MR modules, produced highly significant 30-day disease control rates (68% and 91%, respectively). Moreover, of 18 OncoTreat-predicted drugs, 15 induced the predicted MR-module activity inversion in vivo. Predicted drugs significantly outperformed antineoplastic drugs selected as unpredicted controls, suggesting these methods may substantively complement existing precision cancer medicine approaches,

Recently, scientists have focused on therapeutic strategies to determine the\u00a0regulation of tumors and design molecules for specific targets. Some studies have demonstrated the clinical significance of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) in malignancy and NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in promoting tumorigenesis in OSCC. This is the first study to investigate whether aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induces HLA-G expression through NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 secretion in OSCC. Our results showed that the upregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome leads to abundant HLA-G in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of FaDu cells. In addition, we also generated anti-HLA-G chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells and provided evidence for their effects in EGFR-mutated and overexpressed oral cancer. Our results may be integrated with OSCC patient data to translate basic research into clinical significance and may lead to novel EGFR-aberrant OSCC treatment.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Cell biology", "Immunology", "Molecular biology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yu-Chuan", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Drug Development Center, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chun-Hung", "Last Name": "Hua", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Hsin-Man", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Asia University, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Shi-Wei", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Translational Cell Therapy Center, China Medical University Hospital, No. 2, Yude Road, North District, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Yeh", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Ming-Hsui", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Fang-Yu", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Translational Cell Therapy Center, China Medical University Hospital, No. 2, Yude Road, North District, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shao-Chih", "Last Name": "Chiu", "Affiliation": "Drug Development Center, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Wei-Hua", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Dr. Jean Landsborough Memorial Hospice Ward, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 500, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Der-Yang", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Drug Development Center, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chia-Ing", "Last Name": "Jan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan."}], "Journal": "iScience", "PubDate": "2023Mar17"}, {"PMID": "36865302", "Title": "A cell state specific metabolic vulnerability to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis in glioblastoma.", "Abstract": "Glioma cells hijack developmental transcriptional programs to control cell state. During neural development, lineage trajectories rely on specialized metabolic pathways. However, the link between tumor cell state and metabolic programs is poorly understood in glioma. Here we uncover a glioma cell state-specific metabolic liability that can be leveraged therapeutically. To model cell state diversity, we generated genetically engineered murine gliomas, induced by deletion of p53 alone (p53) or with constitutively active Notch signaling (N1IC), a pathway critical in controlling cellular fate. N1IC tumors harbored quiescent astrocyte-like transformed cell states while p53 tumors were predominantly comprised of proliferating progenitor-like cell states. N1IC cells exhibit distinct metabolic alterations, with mitochondrial uncoupling and increased ROS production rendering them more sensitive to inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 and induction of ferroptosis. Importantly, treating patient-derived organotypic slices with a GPX4 inhibitor induced selective depletion of quiescent astrocyte-like glioma cell populations with similar metabolic profiles.", "Keywords": ["Astrocyte", "Cell-state", "Ferroptosis", "Glioblastoma", "Metabolism", "Quiescent"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matei A", "Last Name": "Banu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Athanassios", "Last Name": "Dovas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael G", "Last Name": "Argenziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenting", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of System Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henar Cuervo", "Last Name": "Grajal", "Affiliation": "Spanish National Center for Cardiovascular Research, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Dominique M O", "Last Name": "Higgins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colin P", "Last Name": "Sperring", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brianna", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ling F", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia L", "Last Name": "Furnari", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavan S", "Last Name": "Upadhyayula", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fereshteh", "Last Name": "Zandkarimi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang T T", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter B", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Hai", "Affiliation": "Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Karan", "Affiliation": "Sulzberger Columbia Genome Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aida", "Last Name": "Razavilar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "University of Illinois Cancer Center, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of System Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Feb23"}, {"PMID": "36864031", "Title": "Dietary restriction of cysteine and methionine sensitizes gliomas to ferroptosis and induces alterations in energetic metabolism.", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is mediated by lipid peroxidation of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acyl moieties.

Systemic delivery is limited by toxicity and insufficient brain penetrance, and, to date, convection-enhanced delivery (CED) has been restricted to a single treatment of restricted duration. To address this problem, we engineered a subcutaneously implanted catheter-pump system capable of repeated, chronic (prolonged, pulsatile) CED of topotecan into the brain and tested its safety and

Hamsters and patients deceased from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also exhibit microglial activation and expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6, especially within the hippocampus and the medulla oblongata, when compared with non-COVID control hamsters and humans who died from other infections, cardiovascular disease, uraemia or trauma. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus of both COVID-19 hamsters and humans, we observed fewer neuroblasts and immature neurons.

However, it remains unclear whether lactate is metabolized by GBMs. Here, we demonstrated that lactate rescued patient-derived xenograft (PDX) GBM cells from nutrient-deprivation-mediated cell death. Transcriptome analysis, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq showed that lactate entertained a signature of oxidative energy metabolism. LC/MS analysis demonstrated that U-13C-lactate elicited substantial labeling of TCA-cycle metabolites, acetyl-CoA, and histone protein acetyl-residues in GBM cells. Lactate enhanced chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation in a manner dependent on oxidative energy metabolism and the ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY). Utilizing orthotopic PDX models of GBM, a combined tracer experiment unraveled that lactate carbons were substantially labeling the TCA-cycle metabolites.

While resistance to Kif11 inhibitors in other cell types is due to mechanisms that prevent these drugs from disrupting mitosis, we find that in glioblastoma (GBM), resistance to the Kif11 inhibitor ispinesib works instead through suppression of apoptosis driven by activation of STAT3. This form of resistance requires dual phosphorylation of STAT3 residues Y705 and S727, mediated by SRC and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), respectively. Simultaneously inhibiting SRC and EGFR reverses this resistance, and combined targeting of these two kinases in\u00a0vivo with clinically available inhibitors is synergistic and significantly prolongs survival in ispinesib-treated GBM-bearing mice.

This enabled simultaneous tracking of individual neurons from both excitatory and inhibitory populations throughout seizure-like events. Moreover, our approach allowed for observation of how the crosstalk between these neurons varied spatially, as we recorded across an extended region of glioma-infiltrated cortex. In tumour-bearing slices, we observed marked alterations in single units classified as putative fast-spiking interneurons, including reduced firing, activity concentrated within excitatory bursts and deficits in local inhibition. These results were correlated with increases in overall excitability. Mechanistic perturbation of this system with the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 revealed increased firing of putative fast-spiking interneurons and restoration of local inhibition, with concomitant decreases in overall excitability.

Pathogenic somatic variants have been identified in many genes within the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-signalling pathway in individuals with hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia (type II), and more recently in SLC35A2 in individuals with focal cortical dysplasia (type I) or non-dysplastic epileptic cortex. Given the expanding role of somatic variants across different brain malformations, we sought to delineate the landscape of somatic variants in a large cohort of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery with hemimegalencephaly or focal cortical dysplasia. We evaluated samples from 123 children with hemimegalencephaly (n\u2009=\u200916), focal cortical dysplasia type I and related phenotypes (n\u2009=\u200948), focal cortical dysplasia type II (n\u2009=\u200944), or focal cortical dysplasia type III (n\u2009=\u200915). We performed high-depth exome sequencing in brain tissue-derived DNA from each case and identified somatic single nucleotide, indel and large copy number variants. In 75% of individuals with hemimegalencephaly and 29% with focal cortical dysplasia type II, we identified pathogenic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes. Four of 48 cases with focal cortical dysplasia type I (8%) had a likely pathogenic variant in SLC35A2. While no other gene had multiple disease-causing somatic variants across the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort, four individuals in this group had a single pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variant in CASK, KRAS, NF1 and NIPBL, genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. No rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variants in any neurological disease genes like those identified in the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort were found in 63 neurologically normal controls (P\u2009=\u20090.017), suggesting a role for these novel variants. We also identified a somatic loss-of-function variant in the known epilepsy gene, PCDH19, present in a small number of alleles in the dysplastic tissue from a female patient with focal cortical dysplasia IIIa with hippocampal sclerosis. In contrast to focal cortical dysplasia type II, neither focal cortical dysplasia type I nor III had somatic variants in genes that converge on a unifying biological pathway, suggesting greater genetic heterogeneity compared to type II. Importantly, we demonstrate that focal cortical dysplasia types I, II and III are associated with somatic gene variants across a broad range of genes, many associated with epilepsy in clinical

This non-cell-autonomous effect is preceded by a dramatic reorganization of the neuronal nuclear architecture, which results in dissipation of genomic compartments harboring OR genes. Our data provide a potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the cellular morphology and the transcriptome of cells it cannot infect, offering insight to its systemic effects in olfaction and beyond.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "anosmia", "nuclear architecture"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anosmia", "COVID-19", "Cricetinae", "Down-Regulation", "Humans", "Receptors, Odorant", "SARS-CoV-2", "Smell"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marianna", "Last Name": "Zazhytska", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

Previously, we reported enrichment of BRAF/PTPN11 mutations in 30% of rGBM that responded to PD-1 blockade. Given that BRAF and PTPN11 promote MAPK/ERK signaling, we investigated whether activation of this pathway is associated with response to PD-1 inhibitors in rGBM, including patients that do not harbor BRAF/PTPN11 mutations. Here we show that immunohistochemistry for ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK), a marker of MAPK/ERK pathway activation, is predictive of overall survival following adjuvant PD-1 blockade in two independent rGBM patient cohorts. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence analyses revealed that p-ERK was mainly localized in tumor cells and that high-p-ERK GBMs contained tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia with elevated expression of MHC class\u2009II and associated genes. These findings indicate that ERK1/2 activation in rGBM is predictive of response to PD-1 blockade and is associated with a distinct myeloid cell phenotype.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib has significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, including those with brain metastases. However, despite striking initial responses, osimertinib-treated patients eventually develop lethal metastatic relapse, often to the brain. Although osimertinib-refractory brain relapse is a major clinical challenge, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using metastatic models of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we show that cancer cells expressing high intracellular S100A9 escape osimertinib and initiate brain relapses. Mechanistically, S100A9 upregulates ALDH1A1 expression and activates the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway in osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. We demonstrate that the genetic repression of S100A9, ALDH1A1, or RA receptors (RAR) in cancer cells, or treatment with a pan-RAR antagonist, dramatically reduces brain metastasis. Importantly, S100A9 expression in cancer cells correlates with poor PFS in osimertinib-treated patients. Our study, therefore, identifies a novel, therapeutically targetable S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA axis that drives brain relapse.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family", "Aniline Compounds", "Brain", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "ErbB Receptors", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Retinal Dehydrogenase", "Signal Transduction", "Tretinoin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anup Kumar", "Last Name": "Biswas", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Seoyoung", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yifan", "Last Name": "Tai", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Wanchao", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Coker", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "S Aidan", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ahmad Rushdi", "Last Name": "Shakri", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Timothy James", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hanna", "Last Name": "Scholze", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Galina G", "Last Name": "Lagos", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Mela", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Katia", "Last Name": "Manova-Todorova", "Affiliation": "Molecular Cytology Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "de Stanchina", "Affiliation": "Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo A", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Helena A", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paul K", "Last Name": "Paik", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anjali", "Last Name": "Saqi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mark G", "Last Name": "Kris", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Massague", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Swarnali", "Last Name": "Acharyya", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2022Apr01"}, {"PMID": "34884748", "Title": "Lentiviral-Induced Spinal Cord Gliomas in Rat Model.", "Abstract": "Intramedullary spinal cord tumors are a rare and understudied cancer with poor treatment options and prognosis. Our prior study used a combination of PDGF-B, HRAS, and p53 knockdown to induce the development of high-grade glioma in the spinal cords of minipigs. In this study, we evaluate the ability of each vector alone and combinations of vectors to produce high-grade spinal cord gliomas. Eight groups of rats (n = 8/group) underwent thoracolumbar laminectomy and injection of lentiviral vector in the lateral white matter of the spinal cord. Each group received a different combination of lentiviral vectors expressing PDGF-B, a constitutively active HRAS mutant, or shRNA targeting p53, or a control vector. All animals were monitored once per week for clinical deficits for 98 days. Tissues were harvested and analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Rats injected with PDGF-B+HRAS+sh-p53 (triple cocktail) exhibited statistically significant declines in all behavioral measures (Basso Beattie Bresnahan scoring, Tarlov scoring, weight, and survival rate) over time when compared to the control. Histologically, all groups except the control and those injected with sh-p53 displayed the development of tumors at the injection site, although there were differences in the rate of tumor growth and the histopathological features of the lesions between groups. Examination of immunohistochemistry revealed rats receiving triple cocktail displayed the largest and most significant increase in the Ki67 proliferation index and GFAP positivity than any other group. PDGF-B+HRAS also displayed a significant increase in the Ki67 proliferation index. Rats receiving PDGF-B alone and PDGF-B+ sh-p53 displayed more a significant increase in SOX2-positive staining than in any other group. We found that different vector combinations produced differing high-grade glioma models in rodents. The combination of all three vectors produced a model of high-grade glioma more efficiently and aggressively with respect to behavioral, physiological, and histological characteristics than the rest of the vector combinations.

One of these diseases is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), an early onset dementia and one of the leading causes of dementia in people under the age of 60. FTD is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with pathological accumulation of particular proteins in neurons and glial cells including the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is deposited in its hyperphosphorylated form in about half of all patients with FTD. As for other patients with dementia, there is currently no cure for patients with FTD and thus several lines of research focus on the characterization of underlying pathogenic mechanisms with the goal to identify therapeutic targets. In this review, we provide an overview of reported disease phenotypes in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and glial cells from patients with tau-associated FTD with the aim to highlight recent progress in this fast-moving field of iPSC disease modeling. We put a particular focus on genetic forms of the disease that are linked to mutations in the gene encoding tau and summarize mutation-associated changes in FTD patient cells related to tau splicing and tau phosphorylation, microtubule function and cell metabolism as well as calcium homeostasis and cellular stress. In addition, we discuss challenges and limitations but also opportunities using differentiated patient-derived iPSCs for disease modeling and biomedical research on neurodegenerative diseases including FTD.", "Keywords": ["disease modeling", "frontotemporal dementia (FTD)", "frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)", "induced pluriopotent stem cells", "neurodegenenerative diseases", "neurodegeneration", "tau", "tauopathy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebekka", "Last Name": "K\u00fchn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34818553", "Title": "Protein kinase C\u03b9 and SRC signaling define reciprocally related subgroups of glioblastoma with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities.", "Abstract": "We report that atypical protein kinase C\u03b9 (PKC\u03b9) is an oncogenic driver of glioblastoma (GBM).

Resistance to the PKC\u03b9 inhibitor auranofin is associated with activated SRC signaling and response to a SRC inhibitor, whereas resistance to a SRC inhibitor is associated with activated PKC\u03b9 signaling and sensitivity to auranofin. Interestingly, PKC\u03b9- and SRC-dependent cells often co-exist in individual GBM tumors, and treatment of GBM-bearing mice with combined auranofin and SRC inhibitor prolongs survival beyond either drug alone.

Histology and genetic analysis of the pontine biopsy were consistent with grade 3 oligodendroglioma, and comparison of the two lesions demonstrated common 1p/19q co-deletions and TERT promoter mutations but distinct IDH1 mutations, with a non-canonical IDH1 R132G mutation identified in the infratentorial lesion and a R132H mutation identified in the cortical lesion. Initiation of Temozolomide led to complete response of the supratentorial lesion and durable disease control, while Temozolomide with subsequent radiation therapy of 54\u00a0Gy in 30 fractions resulted in partial response of the pontine lesion. This case report supports possible distinct molecular pathogenesis in supratentorial and infratentorial oligodendrogliomas and raises questions about the role of different IDH1 mutant isoforms in explaining treatment resistance to different chemotherapy regimens. Importantly, this case suggests that biopsies of all radiographic lesions, when feasible and safe, should be considered in order to adequately guide management in multicentric oligodendrogliomas.", "Keywords": ["IDH mutant", "Infratentorial", "Low-Grade Glioma", "Multifocal", "Supratentorial"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Humans", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase", "Male", "Mutation", "Neoplasms, Multiple Primary", "Oligodendroglioma", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander H C W", "Last Name": "Agopyan-Miu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, USA. aha2152@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Matei A", "Last Name": "Banu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Troy", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tony J C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Feldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aya", "Last Name": "Haggiagi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuro-Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica communications", "PubDate": "2021Sep29"}, {"PMID": "34498065", "Title": "Rosette-Forming Glioneuronal Tumor in the Pineal Region: A Series of 6 Cases and Literature Review.", "Abstract": "Resected lesions from the pineal region are rare specimens encountered by surgical pathologists, and their heterogeneity can pose significant diagnostic challenges. Here, we reviewed 221 pineal region lesions resected at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center from 1994 to 2019 and found the most common entities to be pineal parenchymal tumors (25.3%), glial neoplasms (18.6%), and germ cell tumors (17.6%) in this predominantly adult cohort of patients. Six cases of a rare midline entity usually found exclusively in the fourth ventricle, the rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor, were identified. These tumors exhibit biphasic morphology, with a component resembling pilocytic astrocytoma admixed with variable numbers of small cells forming compact rosettes and perivascular pseudorosettes. Targeted sequencing revealed a 100% co-occurrence of novel and previously described genetic alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways, suggesting a synergistic role in tumor formation. The most common recurrent mutation, PIK3CA H1047R, was identified in tumor cells forming rosettes and perivascular pseudorosettes. A review of the literature revealed 16 additional cases of rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors in the pineal region.

Recent studies have demonstrated that >95% extent of resection is associated with better outcomes, including prolonged progression-free and overall survival. The diffusely infiltrative pattern of growth in gliomas results in microscopic extension of tumor cells into surrounding brain parenchyma that makes complete resection unattainable. The historical goal of surgical management has therefore been maximal safe resection, traditionally guided by MRI and defined as removal of all contrast-enhancing tumor. Optimization of surgical resection has led to the concept of supramarginal resection, or removal beyond the contrast-enhancing region on MRI. This strategy of extending the cytoreductive goal targets a tumor region thought to be important in the recurrence or progression of disease as well as resistance to systemic and local treatment. This approach must be balanced against the risk of impacting eloquent regions of brain and causing permanent neurologic deficit, an important factor affecting overall survival. Over the years, fluorescent agents such as fluorescein sodium have been explored as a means of more reliably delineating the boundary between tumor core, tumor-infiltrated brain, and surrounding cortex. Here we examine the rationale behind extending resection into the infiltrative tumor margins, review the current literature surrounding the use of fluorescein in supramarginal resection of gliomas, discuss the experience of our own institution in utilizing fluorescein to maximize glioma extent of resection, and assess the clinical implications of this treatment strategy.", "Keywords": ["fluorescein", "fluorescence-guided surgery", "glioblastoma", "high-grade glioma", "supramarginal resection", "supramaximal resection", "survival"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linda M", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Gabriele Bartoli Brain Tumor Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matei A", "Last Name": "Banu", "Affiliation": "Gabriele Bartoli Brain Tumor Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Gabriele Bartoli Brain Tumor Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Gabriele Bartoli Brain Tumor Laboratory, Department of Neurological Surgery and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34031650", "Title": "SARS-CoV-2 Infection Causes Dopaminergic Neuron Senescence.", "Abstract": "COVID-19 patients commonly present with neurological signs of central nervous system (CNS)1-3 and/or peripheral nervous system dysfunction4.

In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls.

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

"Drug delivery in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is significantly limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused ultrasound (FUS), when combined with the administration of microbubbles can effectively open the BBB permitting the entry of drugs across the cerebrovasculature into the brainstem. Given that the utility of FUS in brainstem malignancies remains unknown, the purpose of our study was to determine the safety and feasibility of this technique in a murine pontine glioma model. A syngeneic orthotopic model was developed by stereotactic injection of PDGF-B+PTEN-/-p53-/- murine glioma cells into the pons of B6 mice. A single-element, spherical-segment 1.5\u00a0MHz ultrasound transducer driven by a function generator through a power amplifier was used with concurrent intravenous microbubble injection for tumor sonication. Mice were randomly assigned to control, FUS and double-FUS groups. Pulse and respiratory rates were continuously monitored during treatment. BBB opening was confirmed with gadolinium-enhanced MRI and Evans blue. Kondziela inverted screen testing and sequential weight lifting measured motor function before and after sonication. A subset of animals were treated with etoposide following ultrasound. Mice were either sacrificed for tissue analysis or serially monitored for survival with daily weights. FUS successfully caused BBB opening while preserving normal cardiorespiratory and motor function. Furthermore, the degree of intra-tumoral hemorrhage and inflammation on H&E in control and treated mice was similar. There was also no difference in weight loss and survival between the groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Lastly, FUS increased intra-tumoral etoposide concentration by more than fivefold.

OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2 detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters.

Previous studies suggest that cysts occur in 7-23% of GBMs and report mixed results regarding their prognostic impact. Using our retrospective cohort of 493 patients with first-diagnosis GBM, we carried out an exploratory analysis on this potential link between cystic GBM and survival. Using pretreatment MRIs, we manually identified 88 patients with GBM that had a significant cystic component at presentation and 405 patients that did not. Patients with cystic GBM had significantly longer overall survival and were significantly younger at presentation. Within patients who received the current standard of care (SOC) (N = 184, 40 cystic), we did not observe a survival benefit of cystic GBM. Unexpectedly, we did not observe a significant survival benefit between this SOC cystic cohort and patients with cystic GBM diagnosed before the standard was established (N = 40 with SOC, N = 19 without SOC); this significant SOC benefit was clearly observed in patients with noncystic GBM (N = 144 with SOC, N = 111 without SOC). When stratified by sex, the survival benefit of cystic GBM was only preserved in male patients (N = 303, 47 cystic).

While humans of all sexes are more alike than different, there is evidence for sex differences in the most basic aspects of human biology and these differences have consequences for the etiology and pathophysiology of many diseases. In a disease like cancer, these consequences manifest in the sex biases in incidence and outcome of many cancer types. The ability to deliver precise, targeted therapies to complex cancer cases is limited by our current understanding of the underlying sex differences. Gaining a better understanding of the implications and interplay of sex differences in diseases like cancer will thus be informative for clinical practice and biological research. Here we review the evidence for a broad array of biological sex differences in humans and discuss how these differences may relate to observed sex differences in various diseases, including many cancers and specifically glioblastoma. We focus on areas of human biology that play vital roles in healthy and disease states, including metabolism, development, hormones, and the immune system, and emphasize that the intersection of sex differences in these areas should not go overlooked.

understanding the patterns of survival in different molecular subtypes within gliomas and their responses to treatment. In particular, diffuse gliomas are now principally characterized by their mutation status (IDH1 and 1p/19q codeletion), yet there remains a paucity of information regarding the prognostic value of molecular markers and extent of resection (EOR) on survival. Furthermore, given the modern emphasis on molecular rather than histological diagnosis, it is important to examine the effect of maximal resection on survival in all gliomas with 1p/q19 codeletions, as these will now be classified as oligodendrogliomas under the new WHO guidelines. The objectives of the present study were twofold: 1) to assess the association between EOR and survival for patients with oligodendrogliomas in the National Cancer Database (NCDB), which includes information on mutation status, and 2) to demonstrate the same effect for all patients with 1p/19q codeleted gliomas in the NCDB.", "Keywords": ["1pq19", "IDH", "extent of resection", "gross-total resection", "oligodendroglioma", "oncology", "surgery", "survival"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Brain Neoplasms", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1", "Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glioma", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Margins of Excision", "Middle Aged", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Oligodendroglioma", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Sequence Deletion", "Survival Analysis", "Tumor Burden", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew L A", "Last Name": "Garton", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurological Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Connor J", "Last Name": "Kinslow", "Affiliation": "2Department of Radiation Oncology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ali I", "Last Name": "Rae", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurological Surgery, Oregon Health & Sciences University, Portland, Oregon."}, {"First Name": "Amol", "Last Name": "Mehta", "Affiliation": "4Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Susan C", "Last Name": "Pannullo", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurological Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Rajiv S", "Last Name": "Magge", "Affiliation": "5Department of Radiation Oncology, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Rohan", "Last Name": "Ramakrishna", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurological Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "6Department of Neurological Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Sisti", "Affiliation": "6Department of Neurological Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "6Department of Neurological Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "7Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Simon K", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "2Department of Radiation Oncology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Sonabend", "Affiliation": "10Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Tony J C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "2Department of Radiation Oncology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "PubDate": "2020May08"}, {"PMID": "32315286", "Title": "HDAC inhibitors elicit metabolic reprogramming by targeting super-enhancers in glioblastoma models.", "Abstract": "The Warburg effect is a tumor-related phenomenon that could potentially be targeted therapeutically. Here, we showed that glioblastoma (GBM) cultures and patients' tumors harbored super-enhancers in several genes related to the Warburg effect. By conducting a transcriptome analysis followed by ChIP-Seq coupled with a comprehensive metabolite analysis in GBM models, we found that FDA-approved global (panobinostat, vorinostat) and selective (romidepsin) histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors elicited metabolic reprogramming in concert with disruption of several Warburg effect-related super-enhancers. Extracellular flux and carbon-tracing analyses revealed that HDAC inhibitors blunted glycolysis in a c-Myc-dependent manner and lowered ATP levels. This resulted in the engagement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) driven by elevated fatty acid oxidation (FAO), rendering GBM cells dependent on these pathways. Mechanistically, interference with HDAC1/-2 elicited a suppression of c-Myc protein levels and a concomitant increase in 2 transcriptional drivers of oxidative metabolism, PGC1\u03b1 and PPARD, suggesting an inverse relationship. Rescue and ChIP experiments indicated that c-Myc bound to the promoter regions of PGC1\u03b1 and PPARD to counteract their upregulation driven by HDAC1/-2 inhibition. Finally, we demonstrated that combination treatment with HDAC and FAO inhibitors extended animal survival in patient-derived xenograft model systems in vivo more potently than single treatments in the absence of toxicity.", "Keywords": ["Intermediary metabolism", "Oncology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cellular Reprogramming", "Fatty Acids", "Glioblastoma", "Glycolysis", "HCT116 Cells", "Histone Deacetylase 1", "Histone Deacetylase 2", "Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors", "Humans", "Mice", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "PPAR delta", "Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc", "Response Elements"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Trang Thi Thu", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yiru", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Enyuan", "Last Name": "Shang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Bronx Community College, City University of New York, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Consuelo", "Last Name": "Torrini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Junfei", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Bianchetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Mela", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arif O", "Last Name": "Harmanci", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Health, School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhengdeng", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Core for Research Informatics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Maienschein-Cline", "Affiliation": "Core for Research Informatics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catarina M", "Last Name": "Quinzii", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mike-Andrew", "Last Name": "Westhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Karpel-Massler", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2020Jul01"}, {"PMID": "32294436", "Title": "Glioma-Induced Alterations in Neuronal Activity and Neurovascular Coupling during Disease Progression.", "Abstract": "Diffusely infiltrating gliomas are known to cause alterations in cortical function, vascular disruption, and seizures.

This disease is uniformly fatal, with intratumor heterogeneity the major reason for treatment failure and recurrence. Just like the nature vs nurture debate, heterogeneity can arise from intrinsic or environmental influences. Whilst it is impossible to clinically separate observed behavior of cells from their environmental context, using a mathematical framework combined with multiscale data gives us insight into the relative roles of variation from different sources. To better understand the implications of intratumor heterogeneity on therapeutic outcomes, we created a hybrid agent-based mathematical model that captures both the overall tumor kinetics and the individual cellular behavior. We track single cells as agents, cell density on a coarser scale, and growth factor diffusion and dynamics on a finer scale over time and space. Our model parameters were fit utilizing serial MRI imaging and cell tracking data from ex vivo tissue slices acquired from a growth-factor driven glioblastoma murine model. When fitting our model to serial imaging only, there was a spectrum of equally-good parameter fits corresponding to a wide range of phenotypic behaviors. When fitting our model using imaging and cell scale data, we determined that environmental heterogeneity alone is insufficient to match the single cell data, and intrinsic heterogeneity is required to fully capture the migration behavior. The wide spectrum of in silico tumors also had a wide variety of responses to an application of an anti-proliferative treatment. Recurrent tumors were generally less proliferative than pre-treatment tumors as measured via the model simulations and validated from human GBM patient histology. Further, we found that all tumors continued to grow with an anti-migratory treatment alone, but the anti-proliferative/anti-migratory combination generally showed improvement over an anti-proliferative treatment alone. Together our results emphasize the need to better understand the underlying phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity present in a tumor when designing therapeutic regimens.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Proliferation", "Computational Biology", "Computer Simulation", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Models, Theoretical", "Phenotype", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jill A", "Last Name": "Gallaher", "Affiliation": "Integrated Mathematical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Susan C", "Last Name": "Massey", "Affiliation": "Precision NeuroTherapeutics Innovation Program, Mathematical NeuroOncology Lab, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Hawkins-Daarud", "Affiliation": "Precision NeuroTherapeutics Innovation Program, Mathematical NeuroOncology Lab, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sonal S", "Last Name": "Noticewala", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Russell C", "Last Name": "Rockne", "Affiliation": "Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sandra K", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Precision NeuroTherapeutics Innovation Program, Mathematical NeuroOncology Lab, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Luis", "Last Name": "Gonzalez-Cuyar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Juliano", "Affiliation": "Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Orlando", "Last Name": "Gil", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kristin R", "Last Name": "Swanson", "Affiliation": "Precision NeuroTherapeutics Innovation Program, Mathematical NeuroOncology Lab, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alexander R A", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Integrated Mathematical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2020Feb"}, {"PMID": "31961117", "Title": "Fluorescein-guided resection of gliomas.", "Abstract": "Standard of care in the management of high-grade gliomas includes gross total resection (GTR) followed by treatment with radiation and temozolomide. GTR remains one of the few independent prognostic factors for improved survival in this disease. Sodium fluorescein is an organic fluorophore that has been studied as a surgical adjunct to improve the likelihood of achieving GTR in gliomas. Though sodium fluorescein does not selectively accumulate in glioma cells, it allows for real-time identification of regions of blood brain barrier breakdown, corresponding to the contrast-enhancing cores of high-grade gliomas. In addition to its high predictive value for identifying pathologic tissue, use of fluorescein has been shown to improve rates of GTR. In stereotactic needle biopsies, it helps reduce procedure time by rapidly confirming the presence of diagnostic tissue. Furthermore, in non-enhancing, low-grade gliomas, it labels focal regions of vascular dysregulation that have been correlated with high-grade features. Fluorescein has also been shown to be significantly less expensive than other contemporary surgical adjuncts such as intraoperative ultrasound, intraoperative MRI, and the recently FDA approved fluorophore, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA).

In the present study, we report a parallel workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH)5-7, a label-free optical imaging method and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict diagnosis at the bedside in near real-time in an automated fashion. Specifically, our CNNs, trained on over 2.5 million SRH images, predict brain tumor diagnosis in the operating room in under 150\u2009s, an order of magnitude faster than conventional techniques (for example, 20-30\u2009min)2. In a multicenter, prospective clinical trial (n\u2009=\u2009278), we demonstrated that CNN-based diagnosis of SRH images was noninferior to pathologist-based interpretation of conventional histologic images (overall accuracy, 94.6% versus 93.9%). Our CNNs learned a hierarchy of recognizable histologic feature representations to classify the major histopathologic classes of brain tumors. In addition, we implemented a semantic segmentation method to identify tumor-infiltrated diagnostic regions within SRH images.

Moreover, we found that small molecules activating ferroptosis through system xc- inhibition or GPX4 inhibition synergize with radiation to induce ferroptosis in several cancer types by enhancing cytoplasmic lipid peroxidation but not increasing DNA damage or caspase activation. Ferroptosis inducers synergized with cytoplasmic irradiation, but not nuclear irradiation. Finally, administration of ferroptosis inducers enhanced the antitumor effect of radiation in a murine xenograft model and in human patient-derived models of lung adenocarcinoma and glioma.

Cancer recurrence in the context of therapy is by no means unique to gliomas. For many tumors residing outside the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-based analyses are routinely employed to document the molecular and cellular features of disease recurrence. Such interventions are inconsistently applied for gliomas, however, and lack rigorous standardization when they are. While many of the reasons underlying these discrepancies reflect pragmatic realities inherent to CNS disease, the suboptimal employment of histological and molecular assessment at recurrence nevertheless represents a missed opportunity to proactively guide patient management and increase knowledge. Herein, we address this quandary by pairing a succinct description of the histological, biological, and molecular characteristics of recurrent glioma with recommendations for how to better standardize and implement quality pathological assessment into patient management. We hope this review will prompt thoughtful revision of standard operating procedures to maximize the utility of glioma re-biopsy.", "Keywords": ["adult", "glioma", "pathology", "pseudoprogression", "recurrence"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain Neoplasms", "Glioma", "Humans", "Reference Standards"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ali S", "Last Name": "Haider", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "van den Bent", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Patrick Y", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "Center for Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Vogelbaum", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and Neuro-Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Horbinski", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason T", "Last Name": "Huse", "Affiliation": "Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuro-oncology", "PubDate": "2020Apr15"}, {"PMID": "31731042", "Title": "Ex vivo multi-electrode analysis reveals spatiotemporal dynamics of ictal behavior at the infiltrated margin of glioma.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to develop a platform in which the cellular and molecular underpinnings of chronic focal neocortical lesional epilepsy can be explored and use it to characterize seizure-like events (SLEs) in an ex vivo model of infiltrating high-grade glioma.

Electrode locations were co-registered to the underlying histology to ascertain the influence of the varying histologic landscape on the observed electrophysiologic changes. Peritumoral, infiltrated, and tumor sites were sampled in tumor-bearing slices. Following the addition of zero Mg2+ solution, all three histologic regions in tumor-bearing slices showed significantly greater increases in firing rates when compared to the control sites. Tumor-bearing slices demonstrated increased proclivity for SLEs, with 40 events in tumor-bearing slices and 5 events in control slices (p-value\u202f=\u202f.0105). Observed SLEs were characterized by either low voltage fast (LVF) onset patterns or short bursts of repetitive widespread, high amplitude low frequency discharges. Seizure foci comprised areas from all three histologic regions. The onset electrode was found to be at the infiltrated margin in 50% of cases and in the peritumoral region in 36.9% of cases.

However, treatment resistance emerges inevitably. Here, we performed global metabolite screening with metabolite set enrichment coupled with transcriptome and gene set enrichment analysis and proteomic screening, and identified substantial reprogramming of tumor metabolism involving oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) with substantial accumulation of acyl-carnitines accompanied by an increase of PGC1\u03b1 in response to genetic (shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9) and pharmacologic (crizotinib) inhibition of c-MET. Extracellular flux and carbon tracing analyses (U-13C-glucose, U-13C-glutamine, and U-13C-palmitic acid) demonstrated enhanced oxidative metabolism, which was driven by FAO and supported by increased anaplerosis of glucose carbons. These findings were observed in concert with increased number and fusion of mitochondria and production of reactive oxygen species. Genetic interference with PGC1\u03b1 rescued this oxidative phenotype driven by c-MET inhibition. Silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that cAMP response elements binding protein regulates the expression of PGC1\u03b1 in the context of c-MET inhibition. Interference with both oxidative phosphorylation (metformin, oligomycin) and \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids (etomoxir) enhanced the antitumor efficacy of c-MET inhibition. Synergistic cell death was observed with c-MET inhibition and gamitrinib treatment. In patient-derived xenograft models, combination treatments of crizotinib and etomoxir, and crizotinib and gamitrinib were significantly more efficacious than single treatments and did not induce toxicity.

However, their efficacy is limited and additional insights regarding the underlying mechanism are necessary. By performing transcriptome analysis coupled with global polar metabolite screening, we show that LXR agonists, LXR623 and GW3965, enhance synergistically the anti-proliferative effect of BH3 mimetics in solid tumor malignancies, which is predominantly mediated by cell death with features of apoptosis and is rescued by exogenous cholesterol. Extracellular flux analysis and carbon tracing experiments (U-13 C-glucose and U-13 C-glutamine) reveal that within 5\u00a0h, activation of LXR\u03b2 results in reprogramming of tumor cell metabolism, leading to suppression of mitochondrial respiration, a phenomenon not observed in normal human astrocytes. LXR activation elicits a suppression of respiratory complexes at the protein level by reducing their stability. In turn, energy starvation drives an integrated stress response (ISR) that up-regulates pro-apoptotic Noxa in an ATF4-dependent manner. Cholesterol and nucleotides rescue from the ISR elicited by LXR agonists and from cell death induced by LXR agonists and BH3 mimetics. In conventional and patient-derived xenograft models of colon carcinoma, melanoma, and glioblastoma, the combination treatment of ABT263 and LXR agonists reduces tumor sizes significantly stronger than single treatments.

Although a number of proinvasive signaling pathways are active in glioblastoma, many are redundant, so targeting one can be overcome by activating another. However, these pathways converge on nonredundant components of the cytoskeleton, and we have shown that inhibiting one of these-the myosin II family of cytoskeletal motors-blocks glioblastoma invasion even with simultaneous activation of multiple upstream promigratory pathways. Myosin IIA and IIB are the most prevalent isoforms of myosin II in glioblastoma, and we now show that codeleting these myosins markedly impairs tumorigenesis and significantly prolongs survival in a rodent model of this disease. However, while targeting just myosin IIA also impairs tumor invasion, it surprisingly increases tumor proliferation in a manner that depends on environmental mechanics. On soft surfaces myosin IIA deletion enhances ERK1/2 activity, while on stiff surfaces it enhances the activity of NF\u03baB, not only in glioblastoma but in triple-negative breast carcinoma and normal keratinocytes as well. We conclude myosin IIA suppresses tumorigenesis in at least two ways that are modulated by the mechanics of the tumor and its stroma.

The extracellular adenosine-generating enzyme CD73 is involved in many cellular functions that can be usurped by tumors, including cell adhesion, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. We set out to determine the role of CD73 in GB pathogenesis. To do this, we established a unique GB mouse model (CD73-FLK) in which we spatially expressed CD73 on endothelial cells in CD73-/- mice. This allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of host CD73 versus GB-expressed CD73 by comparing GB pathogenesis in WT, CD73-/-, and CD73-FLK mice. GB in CD73-/- mice had decreased tumor size, decreased tumor vessel density, and reduced tumor invasiveness compared with GB in WT mice. Interestingly, GBs in CD73-FLK mice were much more invasive and caused complete distortion of the brain morphology. We showed a 20-fold upregulation of A2B AR on GB compared with sham, and its activation induced matrix metalloproteinase-2, which enhanced GB pathogenesis. Inhibition of A2B AR signaling decreased multidrug resistance transporter protein expression, including permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). Further, we showed that blockade of A2B AR signaling potently increased GB cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide. Together, these findings suggest that CD73 and A2B AR play a multifaceted role in GB pathogenesis and progression and that targeting the CD73-A2B AR axis can benefit GB patients and inform new approaches for therapy to treat GB patients.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Glioblastoma (GB) is the most devastating primary brain tumor. GB patients' median survival is 16 months even with treatment. It is critical that we develop prophylaxes to advance GB treatment and improve patient survival. CD73-generated adenosine has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis, but its role in GB was not ascertained. Here, we demonstrated that host CD73 plays a prominent role in multiple areas of glioblastoma pathogenesis, including promoting GB growth, its angiogenesis, and its invasiveness. We found a 20-fold increase in A2B adenosine receptor (AR) expression on GB compared with sham, and its inhibition increased GB chemosensitivity to temozolomide.

Invasion into unaffected brain parenchyma is one such behavior, and a leading mechanism of tumor recurrence unaddressed by the current therapeutic armamentarium. Further, providing insight into variability of tumor cell migration within individual tumors may inform discovery of novel anti-invasive therapeutics. In this study, ex vivo organotypic slice cultures from EGFR-wild type and EGFR-amplified patient tumors were treated with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib to evaluate potential sub-population restricted intratumoral drug-specific responses. High-resolution time-lapse microscopy and quantitative path tracking demonstrated migration of individual cells are punctuated by intermittent bursts of movement. Elevation of population aggregate mean speeds were driven by subpopulations of cells exhibiting frequent high-amplitude bursts, enriched within EGFR-amplified tumors. Treatment with gefitinib specifically targeted high-burst cell subpopulations only in EGFR-amplified tumors, decreasing bursting frequency and amplitude. We provide evidence of intratumoral subpopulations of cells with enhanced migratory behavior in human glioblastoma, selectively targeted via EGFR inhibition.

Transcriptome-based GSEA analysis suggests that metabolic reprogramming is involved with synergistic reduction of oxidative and glycolytic pathways in the combination treatment. Extracellular flux analysis confirms that combined HDAC inhibition and BRD inhibition blunts oxidative and glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells, leading to a depletion of intracellular ATP production and total ATP levels. In turn, energy deprivation drives an integrated stress response, originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in an increase in proapoptotic Noxa. Aside from Noxa, we encounter a compensatory increase of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein. Pharmacologic, utilizing the FDA-approved drug sorafenib, and genetic inhibition of Mcl-1 enhanced the effects of the combination therapy. Finally, we show in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts of GBM, that the combination treatment reduces tumor growth, and that triple therapy involving the clinically validated compounds panobinostat, OTX015, and sorafenib further enhances these effects, culminating in a significant regression of tumors in vivoConclusions: Overall, these results warrant clinical testing of this novel, efficacious combination therapy.

Yet, some tissues may lack molecular profiles necessary for interactome inference (orphan tissues), or, as for single cells isolated from heterogeneous samples, their tissue context may be undetermined. To address this problem, we introduce metaVIPER, an algorithm designed to assess protein activity in tissue-independent\u00a0fashion by integrative analysis of multiple, non-tissue-matched interactomes. This assumes that transcriptional targets of each protein will be recapitulated by one or more available interactomes.

While glioma is a notoriously infiltrative disease, the dynamics of microglia and glioma migratory patterns have not been well characterized. To investigate the migratory behaviour of microglia and glioma cells at the infiltrative edge, we performed two-colour time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of brain slices generated from a platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB)-driven rat model of glioma, in which glioma cells and microglia were each labelled with one of two different fluorescent markers. We used mathematical techniques to analyse glioma cells and microglia motility with both single cell tracking and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Our results show microglia motility is strongly correlated with the presence of glioma, while the correlation of the speeds of glioma cells and microglia was variable and weak. Additionally, we showed that microglia and glioma cells exhibit different types of diffusive migratory behaviour. Microglia movement fit a simple random walk, while glioma cell movement fits a super diffusion pattern. These results show that glioma cells stimulate microglia motility at the infiltrative margins, creating a correlation between the spatial distribution of glioma cells and the pattern of microglia motility.", "Keywords": ["PDGF rat model", "anomalous diffusion", "glioblastoma", "particle image velocimetry", "time lapse microscopy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Movement", "Glioma", "Humans", "Microglia", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Rats"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Juliano", "Affiliation": "Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA swanson.kristin@mayo.edu."}, {"First Name": "Orlando", "Last Name": "Gil", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Hawkins-Daarud", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonal", "Last Name": "Noticewala", "Affiliation": "University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Russell C", "Last Name": "Rockne", "Affiliation": "Division of Mathematical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jill", "Last Name": "Gallaher", "Affiliation": "Integrated Mathematical Oncology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan Christine", "Last Name": "Massey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander R A", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Integrated Mathematical Oncology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin R", "Last Name": "Swanson", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the Royal Society, Interface", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "29369751", "Title": "Extent of BOLD Vascular Dysregulation Is Greater in Diffuse Gliomas without Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 R132H Mutation.", "Abstract": "Purpose To determine the effect that R132H mutation status of diffuse glioma has on extent of vascular dysregulation and extent of residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) abnormality after surgical resection. Materials and Methods This study was an institutional review board-approved retrospective analysis of an institutional database of patients, and informed consent was waived. From 2010 to 2017, 39 treatment-na\u00efve patients with diffuse glioma underwent preoperative echo-planar imaging and BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging. BOLD vascular dysregulation maps were made by identifying voxels with time series similar to tumor and dissimilar to healthy brain. The spatial overlap between tumor and vascular dysregulation was characterized by using the Dice coefficient, and areas of BOLD abnormality outside the tumor margins were quantified as BOLD-only fraction (BOF). Linear regression was used to assess effects of R132H status on the Dice coefficient, BOF, and residual BOLD abnormality after surgical resection. Results When compared with R132H wild-type (R132H-) gliomas, R132H-mutated (R132H+) gliomas showed greater spatial overlap between BOLD abnormality and tumor (mean Dice coefficient, 0.659 \u00b1 0.02 [standard error] for R132H+ and 0.327 \u00b1 0.04 for R132H-; P < .001), less BOLD abnormality beyond the tumor margin (mean BOF, 0.255 \u00b1 0.03 for R132H+ and 0.728 \u00b1 0.04 for R132H-; P < .001), and less postoperative BOLD abnormality (residual fraction, 0.046 \u00b1 0.0047 for R132H+ and 0.397 \u00b1 0.045 for R132H-; P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed high sensitivity and specificity in the discrimination of R132H+ tumors from R132H- tumors with calculation of both Dice coefficient and BOF (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.967 and 0.977, respectively).

While gliosarcoma may represent a distinct clinical entity given its unique histologic composition and molecular features, its relative prognostic significance remains uncertain. While treatment of gliosarcoma generally encompasses the same standardized approach used in glioblastoma, supporting evidence is limited given its rarity. Here, we characterized 32 cases of gliosarcoma and retrospectively evaluated survival relative to 451 glioblastoma patients diagnosed during the same era within the same institution. Overall, we identified 22 primary gliosarcomas, representing 4.7% of WHO Grade IV primary glioblastomas, and 10 secondary gliosarcomas. With median age of 62, patients were predominately Caucasian (87.5%) and male (65.6%). Tumors with available molecular profiling were primarily MGMT-unmethylated (87.5%), IDH-1-preserved (100%) and EGFR wild-type (100%). Interestingly, while no significant median survival difference between primary gliosarcoma and glioblastoma was observed across the entire cohort (11.0 vs. 14.8 months, p\u2009=\u20090.269), median survival was worse for gliosarcoma specifically among patients who received modern temozolomide-based (TMZ) chemoradiotherapy (11.0 vs. 17.3 months, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Matched-pair analysis also trended toward worse median survival among gliosarcomas (11.0 vs. 19.6 months, log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.177, Breslow p\u2009=\u20090.010). While adjuvant radiotherapy (HR 0.206, p\u2009=\u20090.035) and TMZ-based chemotherapy (HR 0.531, p\u2009=\u20090.000) appeared protective, gliosarcoma emerged as a significantly poor prognostic factor on multivariate analysis (HR 3.27, p\u2009=\u20090.012).

Addition of 2-HG to glioblastoma cultures recapitulates the effects of the IDH mutation on intrinsic apoptosis, shuts down oxidative phosphorylation and reduces ATP levels in glioblastoma cells. 2-HG-mediated energy depletion activates AMPK (Threonine 172), blunting protein synthesis and mTOR signaling, culminating in a decline of Mcl-1.

They are characterized by their diffuse infiltration of the brain tissue and are uniformly fatal, with glioblastoma being the most aggressive form of the disease. In recent years, the over-expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been shown to produce tumors in experimental rodent models that closely resemble this human disease, specifically the proneural subtype of glioblastoma. We have previously modeled this system, focusing on the key attribute of these experimental tumors-the \"recruitment\" of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) to participate in tumor formation by PDGF-expressing retrovirally transduced cells-in one dimension, with spherical symmetry. However, it has been observed that these recruitable progenitor cells are not uniformly distributed throughout the brain\u00a0and that tumor cells migrate at different rates depending on the material properties in different regions of the brain. Here we model the differential diffusion of PDGF-expressing and recruited cell populations via a system of partial differential equations with spatially variable diffusion coefficients and solve the equations in two spatial dimensions on a mouse brain atlas using a flux-differencing numerical approach. Simulations of our in silico model demonstrate qualitative agreement with the observed tumor distribution in the experimental animal system. Additionally, we show that while there are higher concentrations of OPCs in white matter, the level of recruitment of these plays little role in the appearance of \"white matter disease,\" where the tumor shows a preponderance for white matter. Instead, simulations show that this is largely driven by the ratio of the diffusion rate in white matter as compared to gray. However, this ratio has less effect on the speed of tumor growth than does the degree of OPC recruitment in the tumor. It was observed that tumor simulations with greater degrees of recruitment grow faster and develop more nodular tumors than if there is no recruitment at all, similar to our prior results from implementing our model in one dimension.\u00a0Combined, these results show that recruitment remains an important consideration in understanding and slowing glioma growth.", "Keywords": ["Brain tumor", "Cancer", "Glioma", "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)", "Reaction\u2013diffusion"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Computer Simulation", "Glioma", "Humans", "Mathematical Concepts", "Mice", "Models, Neurological", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells", "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Susan Christine", "Last Name": "Massey", "Affiliation": "Precision Neurotherapeutics Innovation Program, Mayo Clinic, 5777 E Mayo Blvd, Phoenix, AZ, 85054, USA. massey.susan@mayo.edu."}, {"First Name": "Russell C", "Last Name": "Rockne", "Affiliation": "Division of Mathematical Oncology, Department of Information Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Hawkins-Daarud", "Affiliation": "Precision Neurotherapeutics Innovation Program, Mayo Clinic, 5777 E Mayo Blvd, Phoenix, AZ, 85054, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jill", "Last Name": "Gallaher", "Affiliation": "Integrative Mathematical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Research Center, Tampa, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander R A", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Integrative Mathematical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Research Center, Tampa, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuropathology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin R", "Last Name": "Swanson", "Affiliation": "Precision Neurotherapeutics Innovation Program, Mayo Clinic, 5777 E Mayo Blvd, Phoenix, AZ, 85054, USA."}], "Journal": "Bulletin of mathematical biology", "PubDate": "2018May"}, {"PMID": "28816146", "Title": "Quality Assessment of Stereotactic Radiosurgery of a Melanoma Brain Metastases Model Using a Mouselike Phantom and the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform.", "Abstract": "To establish a novel preclinical model for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with combined mouselike phantom quality assurance in the setting of brain metastases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cone-Beam Computed Tomography", "Contrast Media", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Melanoma", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Multimodal Imaging", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Quality Assurance, Health Care", "Radiosurgery", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Time Factors", "Tumor Burden"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cheng-Chia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kunal R", "Last Name": "Chaudhary", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yong Hum", "Last Name": "Na", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Black", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Sonabend", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York;

On the basis of a high-throughput drug screen, we provide preclinical proof of concept that targeting the mitochondrial Hsp90 chaperone network (mtHsp90) and inhibition of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 is sufficient to elicit synthetic lethality in tumors recalcitrant to therapy. Our analyses focused on BH3 mimetics that are broad acting (ABT263 and obatoclax) or selective (ABT199, WEHI-539, and A1210477), along with the established mitochondrial matrix chaperone inhibitor gamitrinib-TPP. Drug combinations were tested in various therapy-resistant tumors in vitro and in vivo in murine model systems of melanoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDX) of human glioblastoma. We found that combining BH3 mimetics and gamitrinib-TPP blunted cellular proliferation in a synergistic manner by massive activation of intrinsic apoptosis. In like manner, suppressing either Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 recapitulated the effects of BH3 mimetics and enhanced the effects of gamitrinib-TPP. Mechanistic investigations revealed that gamitrinib-TPP activated a PERK-dependent integrated stress response, which activated the proapoptotic BH3 protein Noxa and its downstream targets Usp9X and Mcl-1.

All patients at our institution with m-HPC were assessed for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics associated with survival, recurrence, and metastasis. New findings were validated using the SEER database. Twenty-seven patients were identified in our institutional records with m-HPC with a median follow-up time of 85 months. Invasiveness was the strongest predictor of decreased overall survival (OS) and decreased metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.004 and 0.001). On subgroup analysis, bone invasion trended towards decreased OS (p\u2009=\u20090.056). Bone invasion and soft tissue invasion were significantly associated with decreased MFS (p\u2009=\u20090.001 and 0.012).

Recent evidence suggests that intravenously administered fluorescein sodium associates with tumor tissue, facilitating safe maximal resection of GBM. In this study, the authors evaluate the safety and utility of intraoperative fluorescein guidance for the prediction of histopathological alteration both in the contrast-enhancing (CE) regions, where this relationship has been established, and into the non-CE (NCE), diffusely infiltrated margins. METHODS Thirty-two patients received fluorescein sodium (3 mg/kg) intravenously prior to resection. Fluorescence was intraoperatively visualized using a Zeiss Pentero surgical microscope equipped with a YELLOW 560 filter. Stereotactically localized biopsy specimens were acquired from CE and NCE regions based on preoperative MRI in conjunction with neuronavigation. The fluorescence intensity of these specimens was subjectively classified in real time with subsequent quantitative image analysis, histopathological evaluation of localized biopsy specimens, and radiological volumetric assessment of the extent of resection. RESULTS Bright fluorescence was observed in all GBMs and localized to the CE regions and portions of the NCE margins of the tumors, thus serving as a visual guide during resection. Gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 84% of the patients with an average resected volume of 95%, and this rate was higher among patients for whom GTR was the surgical goal (GTR achieved in 93.1% of patients, average resected volume of 99.7%). Intraoperative fluorescein staining correlated with histopathological alteration in both CE and NCE regions, with positive predictive values by subjective fluorescence evaluation greater than 96% in NCE regions.

High-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires (TCRseq) provides a population-wide statistical description of how T cells respond to disease. We have defined immunophenotypes of whole repertoires based on TCRseq of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains from glioma tissue, nonneoplastic brain tissue, and peripheral blood from patients. Using information theory, we partitioned the diversity of these TCR repertoires into that from the distribution of VJ cassette combinations and diversity due to VJ-independent factors, such as selection due to antigen binding. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) possessed higher VJ-independent diversity than nonneoplastic tissue, stratifying patients according to tumor grade. We found that the VJ-independent components of tumor-associated repertoires diverge more from their corresponding peripheral repertoires than T-cell populations in nonneoplastic brain tissue, particularly for low-grade gliomas.

With a median survival of about a year, new approaches to treating this disease are necessary. To identify signaling molecules regulating GBM progression in a genetically engineered murine model of proneural GBM, we quantified phosphotyrosine-mediated signaling using mass spectrometry. Oncogenic signals, including phosphorylated ERK MAPK, PI3K, and PDGFR, were found to be increased in the murine tumors relative to brain. Phosphorylation of CDK1 pY15, associated with the G2 arrest checkpoint, was identified as the most differentially phosphorylated site, with a 14-fold increase in phosphorylation in the tumors. To assess the role of this checkpoint as a potential therapeutic target, syngeneic primary cell lines derived from these tumors were treated with MK-1775, an inhibitor of Wee1, the kinase responsible for CDK1 Y15 phosphorylation. MK-1775 treatment led to mitotic catastrophe, as defined by increased DNA damage and cell death by apoptosis. To assess the extensibility of targeting Wee1/CDK1 in GBM, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines were also treated with MK-1775. Although the response was more heterogeneous, on-target Wee1 inhibition led to decreased CDK1 Y15 phosphorylation and increased DNA damage and apoptosis in each line. These results were also validated in vivo, where single-agent MK-1775 demonstrated an antitumor effect on a flank PDX tumor model, increasing mouse survival by 1.74-fold. This study highlights the ability of unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomics to reveal therapeutic targets in tumor models, and the potential for Wee1 inhibition as a treatment approach in preclinical models of GBM.

To ensure aggressive growth, tumor cells highly depend on amino acids, most notably due to their pivotal need of protein synthesis. In this study, we assessed the overall hypothesis that depletion of asparagine by E. coli-derived L-asparaginase might be a novel means for the therapy of one of the most recalcitrant neoplasms and for which no efficient treatment currently exists - glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Our results suggest that certain glioma cell cultures are particularly susceptible to inhibition of proliferation by L-asparaginase, while others display a more resistant phenotype. In sensitive cells, L-asparaginase induces apoptosis with dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of effector caspases. L-asparaginase-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Noxa, Mcl-1 and the deubiquitinase Usp9X. Given the impact of L-asparaginase on these molecules, we found that L-asparaginase potently overcomes resistance to both intrinsic apoptosis induced by the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, ABT263, and extrinsic apoptosis mediated by TRAIL even in glioma cells that are resistant towards L-asparaginase single treatment. RNA interference studies showed that Usp9X, Mcl-1, Noxa and Bax/Bak are involved in ABT263/L-asparaginase-mediated cell death. In vivo, combined treatment with ABT263 and L-asparaginase led to an enhanced reduction of tumor growth when compared to each reagent alone without induction of toxicity.

Expression analysis data confirm that Usp9X expression is increased in glioblastoma compared to normal brain tissue indicating its potential as a therapeutic. Consistently, increasing concentrations of WP1130 decrease the cellular viability of established, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and stem cell-like glioblastoma cells. Specific down-regulation of Usp9X reduces viability in glioblastoma cells mimicking the effects of WP1130. Mechanistically, WP1130 elicits apoptosis and increases activation of caspases. Moreover, WP1130 and siRNAs targeting Usp9X reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins, XIAP and Survivin. Pharmacological and genetic interference with Usp9X efficiently sensitized glioblastoma cells to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic stimuli.

Current therapeutic options are sparse and the prognosis of patients suffering from this disease is grim. Abundance in intratumoral heterogeneity among different deregulated signaling pathways is a hallmark of glioblastoma and likely accounts for its recurrence and resistance to treatment. Glioblastomas harbor a plethora of deregulated pathways driving tumor formation and growth. In this study, we show that TIC10/ONC201, a promising compound that is currently in planned clinical development, along with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition by ABT263 yields a strong synergistic antiproliferative effect on pediatric, adult, proneural glioblastoma and glioma stem-like cells.

Consistently, the combination treatment of TIC10/ONC201 and ABT263 required the presence of functional BAX and BAK to drive intrinsic apoptosis, but is surprisingly independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 is overexpressed in glioblastoma and represents an important resistance factor to the BH-3 mimetic ABT263. In this study, we show that combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070 overcomes apoptotic resistance in established glioblastoma cell lines, glioma stem-like cells and primary cultures. Moreover, this treatment regimen also proves to be advantageous in vivo. On the molecular level, GX15-070 enhanced apoptosis by posttranslational down-regulation of the deubiquitinase, Usp9X, and the chaperone Bag3, leading to a sustained depletion of Mcl-1 protein levels. Moreover, knock-down of Usp9X or Bag3 depleted endogenous Mcl-1 protein levels and in turn enhanced apoptosis induced through Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition. In conclusion, combined treatment with ABT263 and GX15-070 results in a significantly enhanced anti-cancer activity in vitro as well as in vivo in the setting of glioblastoma.

To investigate the role of epigenetics on EGFR regulation in the contexts of neural development and gliomagenesis, we measured levels of DNA methylation and histone H3 modifications at the EGFR promoter in human brain tissues, glioma specimens, and EGFR-expressing neural cells, acutely isolated from their native niche. While DNA was constitutively hypomethylated in non-neoplastic and glioma samples, regardless of their EGFR-expression status, the activating histone modifications H3K27ac and H3K4me3 were enriched only when EGFR is highly expressed (developing germinal matrix and gliomas). Conversely, repressive H3K27me3 marks predominated in adult white matter where EGFR is repressed. Furthermore, the histone methyltransferase core enzyme ASH2L was bound at EGFR in the germinal matrix and in gliomas where levels of H3K4me3 are high, and the histone acetyltransferase P300 was bound in samples with H3K27ac enrichment.

This is in contrast with the genetic suppression of EGFR* induction that led to significant tumor regression and prolonged animal survival. However, despite their initial response to genetic EGFR* extinction, all tumors would relapse and propagate independent of EGFR*. We further showed that EGFR*-independent tumor cells existed prior to treatment and were responsible for relapse following genetic EGFR* suppression.

In addition to grey matter pathology, white matter changes are now recognized as an important pathological feature in the emergence of the disease. Despite growing recognition of the importance of white matter abnormalities in the pathogenesis of AD, the causes of white matter degeneration are still unknown. While multiple studies propose Wallerian-like degeneration as the source of white matter change, others suggest that primary white matter pathology may be due, at least in part, to other mechanisms, including local effects of toxic A\u03b2 peptides. In the current study, we investigated levels of soluble amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in white matter of AD patients (n=12) compared with controls (n=10). Fresh frozen white matter samples were obtained from anterior (Brodmann area 9) and posterior (Brodmann area 1, 2 and 3) areas of post-mortem AD and control brains. ELISA was used to examine levels of soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40. Total cortical neuritic plaque severity rating was derived from individual ratings in the following areas of cortex: mid-frontal, superior temporal, pre-central, inferior parietal, hippocampus (CA1), subiculum, entorhinal cortex, transentorhinal cortex, inferior temporal, amygdala and basal forebrain. Compared with controls, AD samples had higher white matter levels of both soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40. While no regional white matter differences were found in A\u03b2 -40, A\u03b2 -42 levels were higher in anterior regions than in posterior regions across both groups. After statistically controlling for total cortical neuritic plaque severity, differences in both soluble A\u03b2 -42 and A\u03b2 -40 between the groups remained, suggesting that white matter A\u03b2 peptides accumulate independent of overall grey matter fibrillar amyloid pathology and are not simply a reflection of overall amyloid burden. These results shed light on one potential mechanism through which white matter degeneration may occur in AD.

Gliomas are also complex at the cellular level and involve multiple cell types, including transformed and reactive cells in the brain tumor microenvironment. The distinct functions of the various cell types likely lead to different requirements and regulatory paradigms for protein synthesis. Proneural gliomas can arise from transformation of glial progenitors that are driven to proliferate via mitogenic signaling that affects translation. To investigate translational regulation in this system, we developed a RiboTag glioma mouse model that enables cell-type-specific, genome-wide ribosome profiling of tumor tissue. Infecting glial progenitors with Cre-recombinant retrovirus simultaneously activates expression of tagged ribosomes and delivers a tumor-initiating mutation. Remarkably, we find that although genes specific to transformed cells are highly translated, their translation efficiencies are low compared with normal brain. Ribosome positioning reveals sequence-dependent regulation of ribosomal activity in 5'-leaders upstream of annotated start codons, leading to differential translation in glioma compared with normal brain. Additionally, although transformed cells express a proneural signature, untransformed tumor-associated cells, including reactive astrocytes and microglia, express a mesenchymal signature.

Gene ontology analysis showed that the cell type-specific expression patterns were functionally distinct and highly enriched in genes associated with the corresponding cell phenotypes. Comparing the RNA-seq data from the GBM samples to that of nonneoplastic brain revealed that the differentially expressed genes are distributed across multiple cell types. Notably, the patterns of cell type-specific alterations varied between the different GBM subtypes: the NE regions of proneural tumors were enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor genes, whereas the NE regions of mesenchymal GBM were enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes.

One of the major deterrents in understanding gliomagenesis is the remarkably complex and heterogeneous molecular composition of gliomas, as well as their ability to change phenotypically as they progress and recur. In the past decade, several monumental studies have begun to define better glioma heterogeneity. Four distinct molecular subgroups have emerged: proneural, classical, mesenchymal, and neural; which have unique gene expression signatures and prognostic significance. Of these, gliomas of the proneural subtype, which encompass most grade II/III diffuse gliomas and secondary glioblastomas and often carry isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, have emerged as a distinct tumor subclass with a notably superior prognosis. Important molecular markers with prognostic relevance, such as mutant IDH1/2, have already been incorporated into clinical neuropathological practice. The recent molecular discoveries in gliomas have also emphasized the intimate link between epigenetics and genetics in gliomagenesis.

GBMs display a deregulated apoptotic pathway with high levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and overt activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Therefore, combined interference of the PI3K pathway and the Bcl-2 family of proteins is a reasonable therapeutic strategy. ABT-263 (Navitoclax), an orally available small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, and GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, were used to treat established glioblastoma and glioblastoma neurosphere cells, alone or in combination. Although GDC-0941 alone had a modest effect on cell viability, treatment with ABT-263 displayed a marked reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, combinatorial therapy using ABT-263 and GDC-0941 showed an enhanced effect, with a further decrease in cellular viability. Furthermore, combination treatment abrogated the ability of stem cell-like glioma cells to form neurospheres. ABT-263 and GDC-0941, in combination, resulted in a consistent and significant increase of Annexin V positive cells and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential compared with either monotherapy. The combination treatment led to enhanced cleavage of both initiator and effector caspases. Mechanistically, GDC-0941 depleted pAKT (Serine 473) levels and suppressed Mcl-1 protein levels, lowering the threshold for the cytotoxic actions of ABT-263. GDC-0941 decreased Mcl-1 in a posttranslational manner and significantly decreased the half-life of Mcl-1 protein. Ectopic expression of human Mcl-1 mitigated apoptotic cell death induced by the drug combination. Furthermore, GDC-0941 modulated the phosphorylation status of BAD, thereby further enhancing ABT-263-mediated cell death.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aniline Compounds", "Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Down-Regulation", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Indazoles", "Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors", "Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Signal Transduction", "Sulfonamides", "Transfection", "bcl-Associated Death Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fresia", "Last Name": "Pareja", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Macleod", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Crary", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Alonzo H", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Authors' Affiliations: Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and ms4169@columbia.edu ms4169@cumc.columbia.edu msiegelin@gmail.com."}], "Journal": "Molecular cancer research : MCR", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "24637229", "Title": "Convection-enhanced delivery of etoposide is effective against murine proneural glioblastoma.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma subtypes have been defined based on transcriptional profiling, yet personalized care based on molecular classification remains unexploited.

Our goals were to study differential methylation across the genome in gene promoters using an array-based method, as well as repetitive elements using surrogate global methylation markers. The discovery sample set for this study consisted of 54 GBM from Columbia University and Case Western Reserve University, and 24 brain controls from the New York Brain Bank. We assembled a validation dataset using methylation data of 162 TCGA GBM and 140 brain controls from dbGAP. HumanMethylation27 Analysis Bead-Chips (Illumina) were used to interrogate 26,486 informative CpG sites in both the discovery and validation datasets. Global methylation levels were assessed by analysis of L1 retrotransposon (LINE1), 5 methyl-deoxycytidine (5m-dC) and 5 hydroxylmethyl-deoxycytidine (5hm-dC) in the discovery dataset. We validated a total of 1548 CpG sites (1307 genes) that were differentially methylated in GBM compared to controls. There were more than twice as many hypomethylated genes as hypermethylated ones. Both the discovery and validation datasets found 5 tumor methylation classes. Pathway analyses showed that the top ten pathways in hypomethylated genes were all related to functions of innate and acquired immunities. Among hypermethylated pathways, transcriptional regulatory network in embryonic stem cells was the most significant. In the study of global methylation markers, 5m-dC level was the best discriminant among methylation classes, whereas in survival analyses, high level of LINE1 methylation was an independent, favorable prognostic factor in the discovery dataset. Based on a pathway approach, hypermethylation in genes that control stem cell differentiation were significant, poor prognostic factors of overall survival in both the discovery and validation datasets. Approaches that targeted these methylated genes may be a future therapeutic goal.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Brain Neoplasms", "CpG Islands", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Promoter Regions, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rose K", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yanwen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xiaowei", "Last Name": "Guan", "Affiliation": "Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Darryl", "Last Name": "Nousome", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Charu", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery, Columbia University & Bartoli Brain Tumor Research Laboratory, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Sloan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University Hospitals-Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Etty", "Last Name": "Cortes", "Affiliation": "New York Brain Bank, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America ; New York Brain Bank, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Pathology Core, Herbert Irving Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lissette", "Last Name": "Delgado-Cruzata", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University & Biomarker Core, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Irina", "Last Name": "Gurvich", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University & Biomarker Core, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Regina M", "Last Name": "Santella", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University & Biomarker Core, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Quinn", "Last Name": "Ostrom", "Affiliation": "Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Feinstein Institute of Medical Genetics, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gregersen", "Affiliation": "Feinstein Institute of Medical Genetics, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jill", "Last Name": "Barnholtz-Sloan", "Affiliation": "Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24453336", "Title": "E2F1 coregulates cell cycle genes and chromatin components during the transition of oligodendrocyte progenitors from proliferation to differentiation.", "Abstract": "Cell cycle exit is an obligatory step for the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelinating cells.

Binding of E2F1 to chromatin on the gene targets was validated and their expression assessed in developing white matter tracts and cultured OPCs. Increased expression of E2F1 gene targets was also detected in mouse gliomas (that were induced by retroviral transformation of OPCs) compared with normal brain.

In this setting, the tumors acquired remarkably consistent genetic deletions at late stages of progression, similar to those deleted in human proneural glioblastoma. Further investigations revealed that p53 is a master regulator of the transcriptional network underlying the proneural phenotype. This p53-centric transcriptional network and its associated phenotype were observed at both the early and late stages of progression, and preceded the proneural-specific deletions.

Here, we report direct observation of large-amplitude, sinusoidal ~0.1 Hz hemodynamic oscillations in the cortex of an awake human undergoing surgical resection of a brain tumor. Intraoperative multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) revealed that SSHOs were spatially localized to distinct regions of the cortex, exhibited wave-like propagation, and involved oscillations in the diameter of specific pial arterioles, indicating that the effect was not the result of systemic blood pressure oscillations. fMRI data collected from the same subject 4 days prior to surgery demonstrates that ~0.1 Hz oscillations in the BOLD signal can be detected around the same region. Intraoperative optical imaging data from a patient undergoing epilepsy surgery, in whom sinusoidal oscillations were not observed, is shown for comparison. This direct observation of the '0.1 Hz wave' in the awake human brain, using both intraoperative imaging and pre-operative fMRI, confirms that SSHOs occur in the human brain, and can be detected by fMRI.

The prognosis for glioblastoma (GBM), the most common type of malignant glioma, has remained dismal, with median survival a little over one year despite maximal therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Although immunotherapy has become increasingly successful against many systemic tumors, clinical efficacy against brain tumors has been limited.

These M2-type macrophages exert glioma-supportive effects through reduced anti-tumor functions, increased expression of immunosuppressive mediators, and nonimmune tumor promotion through expression of trophic and invasion-facilitating substances.

We present a cell line-based murine proneural GBM model and characterize its response to radiation therapy. Proneural gliomas were generated by injecting PDGF-IRES-Cre retrovirus into the subcortical white matter of adult mice that harbor floxed tumor suppressors (Pten and p53) and stop-floxed reporters. Primary cell cultures were generated from the retrovirus induced tumors and maintained in vitro for multiple passages. RNA sequencing-based expression profiling of the resulting cell lines was performed. The tumorigenic potential of the cells was assessed by intracranial injection into adult na\u00efve mice from different strains. Tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). BLI for tumor cells and brain slices were obtained and compared to in vivo BLI. Response to whole-brain radiation was assessed in glioma-bearing animals. Intracranial injection of Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) glioma cells led to formation of GBM-like tumors with 100 % efficiency (n = 48) and tumorigenesis was retained for more than 3 generations.

Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are universally fatal childhood tumors for which there is currently no effective treatment. In this report the authors describe CED of the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan for the treatment of DIPG in 2 children. As part of a pilot feasibility study, the authors treated 2 pediatric patients with DIPG. Stereotactic biopsy with frozen section confirmation of glial tumor was followed by placement of bilateral catheters for CED of topotecan during the same procedure. The first patient underwent CED 210 days after initial diagnosis, after radiation therapy and at the time of tumor recurrence, with a total dose of 0.403 mg in 6.04 ml over 100 hours. Her Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score was 60 before CED and 50 posttreatment. Serial MRI initially demonstrated a modest reduction in tumor size and edema, but the tumor progressed and the patient died 49 days after treatment. The second patient was treated 24 days after the initial diagnosis prior to radiation with a total dose of 0.284 mg in 5.30 ml over 100 hours. Her KPS score was 70 before CED and 50 posttreatment. Serial MRI similarly demonstrated an initial modest reduction in tumor size. The patient subsequently underwent fractionated radiation therapy, but the tumor progressed and she died 120 days after treatment. Topotecan delivered by prolonged CED into the brainstem in children with DIPG is technically feasible. In both patients, high infusion rates (> 0.12 ml/hr) and high infusion volumes (> 2.8 ml) resulted in new neurological deficits and reduction in the KPS score, but lower infusion rates (< 0.04 ml/hr) were well tolerated.
