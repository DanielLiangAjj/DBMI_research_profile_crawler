[{"PMID": "38664866", "Title": "Probing the content of affective semantic memory following caregiving-related early adversity.", "Abstract": "Cognitive science has demonstrated that we construct knowledge about the world by abstracting patterns from routinely encountered experiences and storing them as semantic memories. This preregistered study tested the hypothesis that caregiving-related early adversities (crEAs) shape affective semantic memories to reflect the content of those adverse interpersonal-affective experiences. We also tested the hypothesis that because affective semantic memories may continue to evolve in response to later-occurring positive experiences, child-perceived attachment security will inform their content. The sample comprised 160 children (ages 6-12 at Visit 1; 87F/73\u00a0M), 66% of whom experienced crEAs (n\u00a0=\u00a0105). At Visit 1, crEA exposure prior to study enrollment was operationalized as parental-reports endorsing a history of crEAs (abuse/neglect, permanent/significant parent-child separation); while child-reports assessed concurrent attachment security. A false memory task was administered online \u223c2.5 years later (Visit 2) to probe the content of affective semantic memories-specifically attachment schemas. Results showed that crEA exposure (vs. no exposure) was associated with a higher likelihood of falsely endorsing insecure (vs. secure) schema scenes. Attachment security moderated the association between crEA exposure and insecure schema-based false recognition. Findings suggest that interpersonal-affective semantic schemas include representations of parent-child interactions that may capture the quality of one's own attachment experiences and that these representations shape how children remember attachment-relevant narrative events. Findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that these affective semantic memories can be modified by later experiences. Moving forward, the approach taken in this study provides a means of operationalizing Bowlby's notion of internal working models within a cognitive neuroscience framework. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Affective semantic memories representing insecure schema knowledge (child needs + needs-not-met) may be more salient, elaborated, and persistent among youths exposed to early caregiving adversity. All youths, irrespective of early caregiving adversity exposure, may possess affective semantic memories that represent knowledge of secure schemas (child needs + needs-met). Establishing secure relationships with parents following early-occurring caregiving adversity may attenuate the expression of insecure semantic memories, suggesting potential malleability. Affective semantic memories include schema representations of parent-child interactions that may capture the quality of one's own attachment experiences and shape how youths remember attachment-relevant events.", "Keywords": ["attachment", "development", "emotional memory", "maltreatment", "parent\u2010child relationship", "stress"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Vannucci", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Fields", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Bloom", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas L", "Last Name": "Camacho", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tricia", "Last Name": "Choy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amaesha", "Last Name": "Durazi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syntia", "Last Name": "Hadis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chelsea", "Last Name": "Harmon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charlotte", "Last Name": "Heleniak", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "VanTieghem", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Dozier", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Milham", "Affiliation": "Child Mind Institute, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simona", "Last Name": "Ghetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of California at Davis and Center for Mind and Brain, Davis, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Developmental science", "PubDate": "2024Apr25"}, {"PMID": "38549194", "Title": "The effects of parental presence on amygdala and mPFC activation during fear conditioning: An exploratory study.", "Abstract": "Learning safe versus dangerous cues is crucial for survival. During development, parents can influence fear learning by buffering their children's stress response and increasing exploration of potentially aversive stimuli. Rodent findings suggest that these behavioral effects are mediated through parental presence modulation of the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here, we investigated whether similar parental modulation of amygdala and mPFC during fear learning occurs in humans. Using a within-subjects design, behavioral (final N\u00a0=\u00a048, 6-17 years, mean\u00a0=\u00a011.61, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.84, 60% females/40% males) and neuroimaging data (final N\u00a0=\u00a039, 6-17 years, mean\u00a0=\u00a012.03, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.98, 59% females/41% males) were acquired during a classical fear conditioning task, which included a CS+ followed by an aversive noise (US; 75% reinforcement rate) and a CS-. Conditioning occurred once in physical contact with the participant's parent and once alone (order counterbalanced). Region of interest analyses examined the unconditioned stress response by BOLD activation to the US (vs. implicit baseline) and learning by activation to the CS+ (vs. CS-). Results showed that during US presentation, parental presence reduced the centromedial amygdala activity, suggesting buffering of the unconditioned stress response. In response to learned stimuli, parental presence reduced mPFC activity to the CS+ (relative to the CS-), although this result did not survive multiple comparisons' correction. These preliminary findings indicate that parents modulate amygdala and mPFC activity during exposure to unconditioned and conditioned fear stimuli, potentially providing insight into the neural mechanisms by which parents act as a social buffer during fear learning. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: (1)This study used a within-participant experimental design to investigate how parental presence (vs. absence) affects youth's neural responses in a classical fear conditioning task.

A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "The parent-infant relationship is critical for socioemotional development and is adversely impacted by perinatal substance use. This systematic review posits that the mechanisms underlying these risks to mother-infant relationships center on 3 primary processes: (1) mothers' childhood maltreatment experiences; (2) attachment styles and consequent internal working models of interpersonal relationships; and (3) perinatal substance use. Further, the review considers the role of hyperkatifeia, or hypersensitivity to negative affect which occurs when people with substance use disorders are not using substances, and which drives the negative reinforcement in addiction. The authors performed a systematic review of articles (published 2000-2022) related to these constructs and their impact on mother-infant relationships and offspring outcomes, including original clinical research articles addressing relationships between these constructs, and excluding case studies, reviews, non-human animal studies, intervention studies, studies with fewer than 30% female-sex participants, clinical guidelines, studies limited to obstetric outcomes, mechanistic/biological studies, and studies with methodological issues precluding interpretation. Overall 1844 articles were screened, 377 were selected for full text review, and data were extracted from 157 articles. Results revealed strong relationships between mothers' childhood maltreatment experiences, less optimal internal working models, and increased risk for perinatal substance use, and importantly, all of these predictors interacted with hyperkatifeia and exerted a marked impact on mother-infant relationships with less data available on offspring outcomes. These data strongly support the need for future studies addressing the additive impact of maternal childhood maltreatment experiences, suboptimal internal working models, and perinatal substance use, with hyperkatifeia as a potential moderator, and their interacting effects on mother-infant socioemotional outcomes.", "Keywords": ["Childhood maltreatment", "addiction", "attachment", "emotional dysregulation", "hyperkatifeia", "negative affect", "perinatal", "substance use"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aviva K", "Last Name": "Olsavsky", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isabella", "Last Name": "Chirico", "Affiliation": "SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University College of Medicine, Brooklyn, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diab", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Christensen", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brianna", "Last Name": "Boggs", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lillian", "Last Name": "Svete", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Ketcham", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kent", "Last Name": "Hutchison", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Zeanah", "Affiliation": "Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Riggs", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "C Neill", "Last Name": "Epperson", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA."}], "Journal": "Substance abuse : research and treatment", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37455342", "Title": "Associations between cortical thickness and parasympathetic nervous system functioning during middle childhood.", "Abstract": "Positive associations have been found between cortical thickness and measures of parasympathetic cardiac control (e.g., respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) in adults, which may indicate mechanistic integration between neural and physiological indicators of stress regulation.

To investigate this, we collected structural magnetic resonance imaging and resting-state respiratory sinus arrhythmia data from children in middle childhood (N\u2009=\u200962, Mage \u2009=\u200910.09, range: 8.28-12.14\u2009years).

Findings demonstrate that early-life adversity does not have an ontogenetically uniform impact on brain volumes, but instead exhibits age-, experience-, and region-specific associations. Relative to non-exposed comparisons, interpersonal early adversity (e.g., family-based maltreatment) was associated with initially larger volumes in frontolimbic regions until ~10-years-old, after which these exposures were linked to increasingly smaller volumes. By contrast, socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty) was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic regions in childhood, which were attenuated at older ages.

Exposure to familiar music enhances spontaneous recall of memories directly cued by the music, but it is unknown whether such effects extend to deliberate recall more generally - e.g., to memories not directly linked to the music being played. It is also unclear whether familiar music boosts recall of specific episodes versus more generalised semantic memories, or whether effects are driven by domain-general mechanisms (e.g., improved mood). In a registered report study, we examined effects of familiar music on deliberate recall in healthy adults ages 65-80 years (N\u2009=\u200975) by presenting familiar music from earlier in life, unfamiliar music, and non-musical audio clips across three sessions. After each clip, we assessed free recall of remote memories for pre-selected events. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no effects of music exposure on recall of prompted events, though familiar music evoked spontaneous memories most often.

In contrast, infants who cannot implement the safety strategies available to adults and depend heavily on caregivers for survival are more likely to turn toward familiar adults, such as their parents, to help them navigate threatening circumstances. However, work has yet to investigate how readily children and adolescents orient toward their parents in threatening or fearful contexts. The current work addressed this question using a visual search paradigm that included arrays of parents' and strangers' faces as target and distractor stimuli, preceded by a fear or neutral emotional priming procedure. Linear mixed-effects models showed that children and adolescents (N\u00a0=\u00a088, age range\u00a0=\u00a04-17\u00a0years; 42M/46F) were faster to search for the face of their parent than of a stranger. However, fear priming attenuated this effect of the parent on search times, such that children and adolescents were significantly slower to orient toward their parent in an array of strangers' faces if they were first primed with fear as opposed to a neutral video. This work indicates that fear priming may phasically interfere with parental orienting during childhood and adolescence, possibly because fear reallocates attention away from parents and toward (potentially threatening) unfamiliar people in the environment to facilitate the development of independent threat learning and coping systems.", "Keywords": ["Adolescents", "Affective priming", "Caregiving", "Children", "Development", "Fear learning", "Social referencing", "Threat detection"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Fear", "Humans", "Infant", "Parents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Fields", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

Currently, there are multiple configurations of bifactor models originating from different theoretical and empirical perspectives. We aimed to test the reliability, validity, measurement invariance, and the correlation of different bifactor models of psychopathology using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We used data from the Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC) initiative (N = 7,011, ages 5 to 22 years, 40.2% females). Factor models were tested using the baseline data. To address our aim, we (a) searched for the published item-level bifactor models using the CBCL; (b) tested their global model fit; (c) calculated model-based reliability indices; (d) tested associations with symptoms' impact in everyday life; (e) tested measurement invariance across many characteristics, and (f) analyzed the observed factor correlation across the models. We found 11 bifactor models ranging from 39 to 116 items. Their global model fit was broadly similar. Factor determinacy and H index were acceptable for the p-factors, internalizing, externalizing, and somatic specific factors in most models. However, only the p- and attention factors predicted daily life symptoms' impact in all models. Models were broadly invariant across different characteristics. P-factors were highly correlated across models (r = .88 to .99) and homotypic specific factors were highly correlated. These results suggest that regardless of item selection and strategy to compose CBCL bifactor models, they assess very similar constructs. Taken together, our results support the robustness of the p-factor across distinct bifactor models and studies of distinct characteristics.

While several studies have suggested that this circuitry exhibits functional changes across the first two decades of life, findings have been mixed - perhaps resulting from differences in analytic choices across studies. Here we used multiverse analyses to examine the robustness of task-based amygdala-mPFC function findings to analytic choices within the context of an accelerated longitudinal design (4-22\u2009years-old; N\u00a0=\u00a098; 183 scans; 1-3 scans/participant). Participants recruited from the greater Los Angeles area completed an event-related emotional face (fear, neutral) task. Parallel analyses varying in preprocessing and modeling choices found that age-related change estimates for amygdala reactivity were more robust than task-evoked amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity to varied analytical choices. Specification curves indicated evidence for age-related decreases in amygdala reactivity to faces, though within-participant changes in amygdala reactivity could not be differentiated from between-participant differences. In contrast, amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity results varied across methods much more, and evidence for age-related change in amygdala-mPFC connectivity was not consistent. Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) measurements of connectivity were especially sensitive to whether a deconvolution step was applied. Our findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the robustness of findings to analysis choices, although the age-related changes in our current work cannot be overinterpreted given low test-retest reliability.

Emerging evidence highlights the importance of developmental trajectories in determining early psychiatric outcomes.

Drawing on characteristics of adolescent neurodevelopment, we highlight two examples, safety cues and incentives, that leverage insights from neural circuit development and may have great promise for augmenting existing behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders during adolescence. This commentary seeks to serve as a framework to maximize the translational potential of basic research in developmental populations for strengthening psychiatric treatments. In turn, input from clinical practice including the identification of age-specific clinically relevant phenotypes will continue to guide future basic research in the same neural circuits to better reflect clinical practices.

Despite the central role of frontoamygdala communication in adult emotional learning and regulation, little is known about how top-down control emerges during human development. In the present cross-sectional pilot study, we experimentally manipulated prefrontal engagement to test its effects on the amygdala during development. Inducing dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation resulted in developmentally-opposite effects on amygdala reactivity during childhood versus adolescence, such that dACC activation was followed by increased amygdala reactivity in childhood but reduced amygdala reactivity in adolescence. Bayesian network analyses revealed an age-related switch between childhood and adolescence in the nature of amygdala connectivity with the dACC and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC). Whereas adolescence was marked by information flow from dACC and vmPFC to amygdala (consistent with that observed in adults), the reverse information flow, from the amygdala to dACC and vmPFC, was dominant in childhood. The age-related switch in information flow suggests a potential shift from bottom-up co-excitatory to top-down regulatory frontoamygdala connectivity and may indicate a profound change in the circuitry supporting maturation of emotional behavior.

While past developmental studies have shown that the hippocampus helps to support memory in middle childhood and adolescence, the extent to which ongoing maturation within the hippocampus contributes to developmental change in episodic memory abilities remains unclear. In contrast, slower maturing regions, such as the PFC, have been suggested to be the neurobiological locus of memory improvements into adolescence. However, it is also possible that the methods used to detect hippocampal development during middle childhood and adolescence are not sensitive enough. Here, we examine how temporal covariance (or differentiation) in voxel representations within anterior and posterior hippocampus change with age to support the development of detailed recollection in male and female developing humans. We find age-related increases in the distinctiveness of temporal activation profiles in the posterior, but not anterior, hippocampus. Second, we show that this measure of granularity, when present during postencoding rest periods, correlates with the recall of detailed memories of preceding stimuli several weeks postencoding, suggesting that granularity may promote memory stabilization.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Studying hippocampal maturation can provide insight into episodic memory development, as well as clues to episodic functioning in adulthood. Past work has shown evidence both for and against hippocampal contributions to age-related improvements in memory performance, but has relied heavily on univariate approaches (averaging activity across hippocampal voxels), which may not be sensitive to nuanced developmental change. Here we use a novel approach, examining time signatures in individual hippocampal voxels to reveal regionally specific (anterior vs posterior hippocampus) differences in the distinctiveness (granularity) of temporal activation profiles across development. Importantly, posterior hippocampus granularity during windows of putative memory stabilization was associated with long-term memory specificity. This suggests that the posterior hippocampus gradually builds the capacity to support detailed episodic recall.", "Keywords": ["development", "fMRI", "hippocampus", "intervoxel similarity", "memory", "multivariate"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Aging", "Child", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Memory, Long-Term", "Mental Recall"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Callaghan", "Affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095 bcallaghan@ucla.edu."}, {"First Name": "Camille", "Last Name": "Gasser", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer A", "Last Name": "Silvers", "Affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "VanTieghem", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Tricia", "Last Name": "Choy", "Affiliation": "University of California, Riverside, CA, 92521."}, {"First Name": "Kaitlin", "Last Name": "O'Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Alexa", "Last Name": "Tompary", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."}, {"First Name": "Lila", "Last Name": "Davachi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021Feb24"}, {"PMID": "33427163", "Title": "Neural meaning making, prediction, and prefrontal-subcortical development following early adverse caregiving.", "Abstract": "Early adversities that are caregiving-related (crEAs) are associated with a significantly increased risk for mental health problems. Recent neuroscientific advances have revealed alterations in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-subcortical circuitry following crEAs. While this work has identified alterations in affective operations (e.g., perceiving, reacting, controlling, learning) associated with mPFC-subcortical circuitry, this circuitry has a much broader function extending beyond operations. It plays a primary role in affective meaning making, involving conceptual-level, schematized knowledge to generate predictions about the current environment. This function of mPFC-subcortical circuitry motivates asking whether mPFC-subcortical phenotypes following crEAs support semanticized knowledge content (or the concept-level knowledge) and generate predictive models. I present a hypothesis motivated by research findings across four different lines of work that converge on mPFC-subcortical neuroanatomy, including (a) the neurobiology supporting emotion regulation processes in adulthood, (b) the neurobiology that is activated by caregiving cues during development, (c) the neurobiology that is altered by crEAs, and (d) the neurobiology of semantic-based meaning making. I hypothesize that the affective behaviors following crEAs result in part from affective semantic memory processes supported by mPFC-subcortical circuitry that over the course of development, construct affective schemas that generate meaning making and guide predictions. I use this opportunity to review some of the literature on mPFC-subcortical circuit development following crEAs to illustrate the motivation behind this hypothesis.

We used a valence bias task (ratings of emotional ambiguity) as a potential early indicator of depression risk and differences in frontoamygdalar connectivity. Previous work using this task demonstrated that children normatively have a negative bias that attenuates with maturation. Here, we test the hypothesis that persistence of this negativity bias as maturation ensues may reveal differences in emotion regulation development, and may be associated with increased risk for depression. In children aged 6-13\u00a0years, we tested the moderating role of puberty on relationships between valence bias, depressive symptoms, and frontoamygdalar connectivity. A negative bias was associated with increased depressive symptoms for those at more advanced pubertal stages (within this sample) and less regulatory frontoamygdalar connectivity, whereas a more positive bias was associated with more regulatory connectivity patterns.

Here, we used a developmental dataset (ages 5-21, N\u00a0=\u00a0348) from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Initiative to directly compare two widely used MRI structural sequences: one based on the Human Connectome Project (MPRAGE) and another based on the ABCD study (MPRAGE+PMC). We aimed to determine if the morphometric measurements obtained from both protocols are equivalent or if one sequence has a clear advantage over the other. The sequences were also compared through quality control measurements. Inter- and intra-sequence reliability were assessed with another set of participants (N\u00a0=\u00a071) from HBN that performed two MPRAGE and two MPRAGE+PMC sequences within the same imaging session, with one MPRAGE (MPRAGE1) and MPRAGE+PMC (MPRAGE+PMC1) pair at the beginning of the session and another pair (MPRAGE2 and MPRAGE+PMC2) at the end of the session. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) scores for morphometric measurements such as volume and cortical thickness showed that intra-sequence reliability is the highest with the two MPRAGE+PMC sequences and lowest with the two MPRAGE sequences. Regarding inter-sequence reliability, ICC scores were higher for the MPRAGE1 - MPRAGE+PMC1 pair at the beginning of the session than the MPRAGE1 - MPRAGE2 pair, possibly due to the higher motion artifacts in the MPRAGE2 run. Results also indicated that the MPRAGE+PMC sequence is robust, but not impervious, to high head motion. For quality control metrics, the traditional MPRAGE yielded better results than MPRAGE+PMC in 5 of the 8 measurements. In conclusion, morphometric measurements evaluated here showed high inter-sequence reliability between the MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC sequences, especially in images with low head motion. We suggest that studies targeting hyperkinetic populations use the MPRAGE+PMC sequence, given its robustness to head motion and higher reliability scores. However, neuroimaging researchers studying non-hyperkinetic participants can choose either MPRAGE or MPRAGE+PMC sequences, but should carefully consider the apparent tradeoff between relatively increased reliability, but reduced quality control metrics when using the MPRAGE+PMC sequence.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Connectome", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Reproducibility of Results", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Ai", "Affiliation": "Center for the Developing Brain, Child Mind Institute, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "R Cameron", "Last Name": "Craddock", "Affiliation": "Department of Diagnostic Medicine, The University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, Austin, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan P", "Last Name": "Dyke", "Affiliation": "Citigroup Biomedical Imaging Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Imaging and Neuromodulation, Nathan S.

To address this gap in the literature, the present study examined observational fear learning in youth (n\u00a0=\u00a033; age range: 6-17\u00a0years) as they watched videos of their parent and an \"unfamiliar parent\" (i.e., another participant's parent) undergo fear conditioning.

Parent trait anxiety was associated with youth learning better (i.e., reporting a stronger preference for the CS- relative to CS+), and exhibiting stronger medial prefrontal-amygdala connectivity. Neuroimaging data were additionally acquired from a subset of parents during firsthand conditioning, and parental amygdala and mPFC activation were associated with youth's neural recruitment.

The neurobiology underlying affective learning capitalizes on this protracted timeline to develop a rich affective repertoire in adulthood. Humans are afforded this luxuriously slow development in part by the extended period of caregiving provided by parents, and parents aid in scaffolding the process of maturation during childhood. Just as adequate caregiving is a potent effector of brain development, so is adverse caregiving, which is the largest environmental risk factor for adult mental illness. There are large individual differences in neurobiological outcomes following caregiving adversity, indicating that these pathways are probabilistic, rather than deterministic, and prolonged plasticity in human brain development may also allow for subsequent amelioration by positive experiences. The extant research indicates that the development of mental health cannot be considered without consideration of children in the context of their families.", "Keywords": ["Amygdala", "Brain development", "Medial prefrontal cortex", "Parents", "Sensitive periods", "Stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Amygdala", "Brain", "Child", "Humans", "Neurobiology", "Parents", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, New York.

This obligatory attraction for parental cues keeps the child nearby and safe to explore the environment; thus, it is critical for survival and sets the foundation for normal human cognitive-emotional behaviour. Here we examined the learning underlying this attraction in preschool-age children. Young children underwent an aversive conditioning procedure either in the parent's presence or alone. We showed that despite disliking the aversive unconditioned stimulus, children exhibited a behavioural approach for conditioned stimuli that were acquired in the parent's presence and an avoidance for stimuli acquired in the parent's absence, an effect that was strongest among those with the lowest cortisol levels.

We highlight three domains in which these mechanisms are well-established and point to clear targets for intervention: 1) threat-related social information processing biases; 2) heightened emotional reactivity and difficulties with emotion regulation; and 3) disruptions in reward processing. In contrast to these established pathways, knowledge of how childhood adversity influences emotional learning mechanisms, including fear and reward learning, is remarkably limited. We see the investigation of these mechanisms as a critical next step for the field that will not only advance understanding of developmental pathways linking childhood adversity with psychopathology, but also provide clear targets for behavioral interventions.

Eighty-nine children and adolescents who were either previously institutionalized (PI youth; N = 46; 33 females and 13 males; age range, 7-16 years) or were raised by their biological parents from birth (N = 43; 22 females and 21 males; age range, 7-16 years) completed an aversive-learning paradigm while undergoing functional neuroimaging, wherein visual cues were paired with either an aversive sound (CS+) or no sound (CS-). For the PI youth, better aversive learning was associated with higher concurrent trait anxiety. Both groups showed robust learning and amygdala activation for CS+ versus CS- trials. However, PI youth also exhibited broader recruitment of several regions and increased hippocampal connectivity with prefrontal cortex. Stronger connectivity between the hippocampus and ventromedial PFC predicted significant improvements in future anxiety (measured 2 years later), and this was particularly true within the PI group. These results suggest that for humans as well as for other species, early adversity alters the neurobiology of aversive learning by engaging a broader prefrontal-subcortical circuit than same-aged peers.

Emerging evidence across species suggests that phasic variation in parental presence during the sensitive period of childhood affects the recruitment of emotional networks on a moment-to-moment basis.

In this review, we examine how early parental care, the central nervous system, and behavior come together to form a 'neuro-environmental loop,' contributing to the formation of stable emotion regulation circuits. To achieve this end, we focus on the interaction of parental care and the developing amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) network-that is at the core of human emotional functioning.

This impairment is often accompanied by diminished eye contact and atypical amygdala responses to face stimuli. The current study used a within-subjects design to examine the effects of natural viewing and an experimental eye-gaze manipulation on amygdala responses to faces. Individuals with ASD showed less gaze toward the eye region of faces relative to a control group. Among individuals with ASD, reduced eye gaze was associated with higher threat ratings of neutral faces. Amygdala signal was elevated in the ASD group relative to controls. This elevated response was further potentiated by experimentally manipulating gaze to the eye region. Potentiation by the gaze manipulation was largest for those individuals who exhibited the least amount of naturally occurring gaze toward the eye region and was associated with their subjective threat ratings. Effects were largest for neutral faces, highlighting the importance of examining neutral faces in the pathophysiology of autism and questioning their use as control stimuli with this population. Overall, our findings provide support for the notion that gaze direction modulates affective response to faces in ASD.", "Keywords": ["amygdala", "autism spectrum disorders", "eye-tracking", "fMRI", "face expressions"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Amygdala", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Child", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Escape Reaction", "Face", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "UCLA Psychology-Developmental, 1285 Franz Hall, BOX 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563, USA. nimtottenham@ucla.edu."}, {"First Name": "Margaret E", "Last Name": "Hertzig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Gillespie-Lynch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tara", "Last Name": "Gilhooly", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander J", "Last Name": "Millner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "B J", "Last Name": "Casey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Social cognitive and affective neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "23467374", "Title": "A developmental shift from positive to negative connectivity in human amygdala-prefrontal circuitry.", "Abstract": "Recent human imaging and animal studies highlight the importance of frontoamygdala circuitry in the regulation of emotional behavior and its disruption in anxiety-related disorders. Although tracing studies have suggested changes in amygdala-cortical connectivity through the adolescent period in rodents, less is known about the reciprocal connections within this circuitry across human development, when these circuits are being fine-tuned and substantial changes in emotional control are observed. The present study examined developmental changes in amygdala-prefrontal circuitry across the ages of 4-22 years using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results suggest positive amygdala-prefrontal connectivity in early childhood that switches to negative functional connectivity during the transition to adolescence. Amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity was significantly positive (greater than zero) among participants younger than 10 years, whereas functional connectivity was significantly negative (less than zero) among participants 10 years and older, over and above the effect of amygdala reactivity. The developmental switch in functional connectivity was paralleled by a steady decline in amygdala reactivity. Moreover, the valence switch might explain age-related improvement in task performance and a developmentally normative decline in anxiety. Initial positive connectivity followed by a valence shift to negative connectivity provides a neurobiological basis for regulatory development and may present novel insight into a more general process of developing regulatory connections.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Amygdala", "Anxiety", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Oxygen", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Regression Analysis", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dylan G", "Last Name": "Gee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn L", "Last Name": "Humphreys", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Flannery", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bonnie", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eva H", "Last Name": "Telzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mor", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Todd A", "Last Name": "Hare", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan Y", "Last Name": "Bookheimer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Mar06"}, {"PMID": "23205521", "Title": "Exposure to the self-face facilitates identification of dynamic facial expressions: influences on individual differences.", "Abstract": "A growing literature suggests that the self-face is involved in processing the facial expressions of others.

Their results show that experimentally activating self-face representations results in earlier recognition of dynamically emerging facial expression. As a group, participants in the self-face prime condition recognized expressions earlier (when less affective perceptual information was available) compared to participants in the nonself-face prime condition. There were individual differences in performance, such that poorer expression identification was associated with higher autism traits (in this neurocognitively healthy sample). However, when randomized into the self-face prime condition, participants with high autism traits performed as well as those with low autism traits.

Negative interpretations are first and fast, but this initial negativity default can be overridden by regulatory control processes that result in positive interpretations. We tested the initial negativity hypothesis by examining positivity-negativity biases during development. We hypothesized that during childhood, the default negativity mode would be more evident than in adulthood and, as a group, children would show a negativity bias when processing ambiguous facial expressions. We examined ratings of two ambiguous expressions, surprised and neutral expressions, from childhood through adolescence and recorded facial corrugator muscle activity, a physiological index of negative appraisals. Surprised faces were rated as conveying clear negative affect by younger participants as indexed by fast RTs and negative ratings, and corrugator data showed a corresponding increase in activity to surprised faces. By adolescence, positive ratings of surprised faces became more frequent and RTs slowed, suggesting that surprised faces were perceived as having more ambiguous meaning. Accordingly, corrugator activity also decreased during adolescence. Neutral faces also produced negative ratings by children, but were also rated as conveying negative affect by older participants. Accordingly, neutral faces also elicited high corrugator activity that was similar to that elicited by negative expressions. These data show that early in life, ambiguous facial expressions are perceived as conveying negative meaning, adding support for an initial-negativity hypothesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Electromyography", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Facial Muscles", "Fear", "Female", "Happiness", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Social Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nim", "Last Name": "Tottenham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563, USA. nimtottenham@ucla.edu"}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Phuong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Flannery", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laurel", "Last Name": "Gabard-Durnam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bonnie", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Emotion (Washington, D.C.)", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
