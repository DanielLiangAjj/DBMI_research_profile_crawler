Yet the pathophysiology of APOs is poorly understood, limiting our ability to prevent and treat these conditions. To search for genetic markers of maternal risk for four APOs, we performed multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for pregnancy loss, gestational length, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. We clustered participants by their genetic ancestry and focused our analyses on three sub-cohorts with the largest sample sizes: European, African, and Admixed American. Association tests were carried out separately for each sub-cohort and then meta-analyzed together. Two novel loci were significantly associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss: a cluster of SNPs located downstream of the TRMU gene (top SNP: rs142795512), and the SNP rs62021480 near RGMA.

Methods: Data were derived from the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network. Features were chosen a priori for entry into hierarchical cluster analysis, including fetal and placental changes. Results: A four-cluster solution (coefficient = 0.983) correlated with relative time periods of \"no retention,\" \"mild retention,\" \"moderate retention,\" and \"severe retention.\" Loss of nuclear basophilia within fetal organs were found at varying rates among these clusters. Conclusions: Hierarchical cluster analysis is able to classify stillbirths based on histopathological changes, roughly correlating to length of intrauterine retention.

Due to the heterogeneity of APOs, only few genetic associations have been identified. In this report, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 479 traits that are possibly related to APOs using a large and racially diverse study, Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b). To display the extensive results, we developed a web-based tool GnuMoM2b ( https://gnumom2b.cumcobgyn.org/ ) for searching, visualizing, and sharing results from GWAS of 479 pregnancy traits as well as phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) of more than 17 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genetic results from three ancestries (Europeans, Africans, and Admixed Americans) and meta-analyses are populated in GnuMoM2b.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and polycystic ovary syndrome are associated with both hyperandrogenism and increased risk for ASD. We examined whether increased maternal testosterone mediates the relationship between these hyperandrogenic disorders (HDs) during pregnancy and child communication and social skills. Maternal plasma was collected during the second trimester and parent-report measures of child communication and social skills were obtained at 4.5-6.5 years of age from 270 participants enrolled in the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b). Our retrospective frequency-matched cohort study design identified 58 mothers with one or both of the HDs and 58 matched controls. Women diagnosed with an HD who carried a female had higher testosterone levels compared to those carrying a male (t(56) = -2.70, p = 0.01). Compared to females controls, females born to women with an HD had significantly higher scores on the Social Communication Questionnaire (t(114) = -2.82, p =0.01). Maternal testosterone partially mediated the relationship between a diagnosis of an HD and SCQ scores among females.

"Abstract": "Stillbirths account for half of all perinatal mortality, but the underlying cause of a significant portion of the cases remains unknown. We set out to test the potential role and extent of microbial infection in stillbirth through a case-control analysis of fetal cord blood collected from the multisite Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network. Cases (n\u2009=\u200960) were defined as stillbirths at >20\u2009weeks of gestation, and controls (n\u2009=\u2009176) were live births. The bacterial presence, abundance, and composition were analyzed by endpoint PCR of full-length 16S rRNA and the V4 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The results demonstrate that bacterial prevalence and abundance were both significantly increased in stillbirth, even after adjusting for maternal age, race, body mass index, number of pregnancies, gestational age, and multiple gestations. Composition of bacterial communities in the cord blood also differed significantly. Using a group of 25 ASVs differentially abundant between the two groups, a Random Forest classification model achieved an accuracy score of 0.76 differentiating stillbirth and live birth, with Group B Streptococcus as the most enriched species in stillbirth. Positive PCR was also significantly associated with early preterm birth. A group of oral anaerobes, including Actinomyces, Campylobacter, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella, were enriched in live early preterm birth, suggesting possible oral origin of infection. Our ASV-based microbiome analysis revealed specific candidate pathogens associated with infections in stillbirth and early preterm birth. The cord blood microbial signatures may be markers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our study will help identify possible mechanism of infection and improve our ability to prevent stillbirth and early preterm birth. IMPORTANCE Stillbirth accounts for half of all perinatal mortality, but the underlying cause of a substantial portion of all cases remains elusive. We examined the umbilical cord blood microbiome in stillbirths (n\u2009=\u200960) and live births (n\u2009=\u2009176) and discovered that the bacterial prevalence and abundance were significantly higher in stillbirths than live births. The microbial compositions also differed significantly. Group B Streptococcus was the most prevalent species detected in stillbirth. In addition, pathogens previously unknown to be associated with stillbirth were identified. A group of oral anaerobes including Fusobacterium nucleatum were found to be specifically enriched in the cord blood in early preterm live birth. This is by far the most comprehensive study to examine the microbial signatures in umbilical cord blood. Cord blood microbial signatures may be markers for adverse birth outcomes. Detection of key microbial signatures will help identify individuals at risk and develop effective preventative strategies.", "Keywords": ["16S rRNA", "Fusobacterium", "PCR", "Streptococcus

Methods and Results We performed a prospective cohort study of participants with singleton gestations and no known preexisting medical conditions who were diagnosed with HDP compared with normotensive women with no pregnancy complications (non-HDP). Participants underwent cardiovascular risk assessment 6 to 12\u00a0months after delivery. Primary outcome was onset of new chronic hypertension at 6 to 12\u00a0months postpartum. We also examined lipid values, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, diabetes, and 30-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between HDP and odds of a postpartum diagnosis of chronic hypertension while adjusting for parity, body mass index, insurance, and family history of CVD. There were 58 participants in the HDP group and 51 participants in the non-HDP group. Baseline characteristics between groups were not statistically different. Participants in the HDP group had 4-fold adjusted odds of developing a new diagnosis of chronic hypertension 6 to 12\u00a0months after delivery, compared with those in the non-HDP group (adjusted odds ratio, 4.60 [95% CI, 1.65-12.81]), when adjusting for body mass index, parity, family history of CVD, and insurance. Of the HDP group, 58.6% (n=34) developed new chronic hypertension. Participants in the HDP group had increased estimated 30-year CVD risk and were more likely to have metabolic syndrome, a higher fasting blood glucose, and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conclusions Participants without known underlying medical conditions who develop HDP have 4-fold increased odds of new diagnosis of chronic hypertension by 6 to 12\u00a0months postpartum as well as increased 30-year CVD risk scores. Implementation of multidisciplinary care models focused on CVD screening, patient education, and lifestyle interventions during the first year postpartum may serve as an effective primary prevention strategy for the development of CVD.", "Keywords": ["chronic hypertension", "hyperlipidemia", "hypertensive disorders of pregnancy", "maternal cardiovascular disease", "metabolic syndrome", "postpartum screening"], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Postpartum Period", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christina M", "Last Name": "Ackerman-Banks", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Science Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Olga", "Last Name": "Grechukhina", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Science Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Spatz", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Lisbet", "Last Name": "Lundsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Science Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Josephine", "Last Name": "Chou", "Affiliation": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Graeme", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Kingston General Hospital Kingston Ontario Canada."}, {"First Name": "Victoria R", "Last Name": "Greenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Medstar Georgetown University Hospital Washington DC."}, {"First Name": "Uma M", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Columbia University New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Science Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Jane", "Last Name": "O'Bryan", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Science Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Shelby", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "University of Connecticut School of Medicine Hartford CT."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Perley", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Science Yale University New Haven CT."}, {"First Name": "Heather S", "Last Name": "Lipkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Science Yale University New Haven CT."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "PubDate": "2022Apr19"}, {"PMID": "35381324", "Title": "Multifaceted roles of plant derived small molecule inhibitors on replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2.", "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused by the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Objectives: To determine whether SDB in pregnancy and/or after delivery is associated with hypertension (HTN) and metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods: nuMoM2b-HHS (Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study) (N\u2009=\u20094,508) followed participants initially recruited during their first pregnancy. Participants returned for a visit 2-7 years after pregnancy. This study examined a subgroup who underwent SDB assessments during their first pregnancy (n\u2009=\u20091,964) and a repeat SDB assessment after delivery (n\u2009=\u20091,222). Two SDB definitions were considered: 1) apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 and 2)\u00a0oxygen desaturation index (ODI)\u2009\u2a7e\u20095. Associations between SDB and incident HTN and MS were evaluated with adjusted risk ratios (aRRs). Measurements and Main Results: The aRR for MS given an AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 during pregnancy was 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.93), but no association with HTN was found. ODI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy was associated with both an increased risk for HTN (aRR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.30-3.14) and MS (aRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19-1.97). Participants with an AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy that persisted after delivery were at higher risk for both HTN (aRR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.84-7.73) and MS (aRR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.59-3.76). Similar associations were observed for persistent ODI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 after delivery. Conclusions: An AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of MS. An ODI\u2009\u2a7e\u20095 in pregnancy was significantly associated with both HTN and MS. Participants with persistent elevations in AHI and ODI during pregnancy and at 2-7 years after delivery were at the highest risk for HTN and MS.

We examined the relationships between prenatal maternal testosterone and estradiol at 19.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0weeks, cord blood testosterone and estradiol at birth, placental aromatase mRNA expression, and neurodevelopment using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, 3rd Edition (BASC-3), and the Empathizing Quotient for Children (EQ-C) at 4.5-6.5\u00a0years of age in a sample of 270 Nulliparous-Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) study participants. Maternal testosterone levels were positively associated with SCQ scores, but the association was not significant after adjusting for maternal age at delivery, nor was there a significant interaction with sex. Maternal estradiol levels were negatively associated with BASC-3 Clinical Probability scores among males (n\u00a0=\u00a0139). We report a significant interaction effect of cord blood testosterone and fetal sex on both total SCQ scores and t-scores on the Developmental Social Disorders subscale. Placental aromatase was not associated with any neurodevelopmental or hormone measure, but under conditions of low placental aromatase expression, high maternal testosterone was positively associated with SCQ scores in males (n\u00a0=\u00a046). No other associations between hormone levels and neurodevelopment were significant. Our findings provide a foundation for further investigation of the mechanisms through which maternal sex hormones and placental steroidogenesis may affect fetal hormone production and neurobehavior.", "Keywords": ["Aromatase", "Autism spectrum disorder", "Estradiol", "Fetal", "Maternal", "Placenta", "Testosterone"], "MeSH terms": ["Aromatase", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Gonadal Steroid Hormones", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Nervous System", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Testosterone"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Morgan R", "Last Name": "Firestein", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

risk for late preterm delivery: Replaces SMFM Statement #4, Implementation of the use of antenatal corticosteroids in the late preterm birth period in women at risk for preterm delivery, August 2016.", "Abstract": "The administration of antenatal corticosteroids has been widely adopted as the standard of care in the management of pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, with the primary goal of reducing neonatal morbidity. However, the long-term risks associated with antenatal corticosteroid use remain uncertain. The purpose of this Consult is to review the current literature on the benefits and risks of antenatal corticosteroid use in the late preterm period and to provide recommendations based on the available evidence. The recommendations by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine are as follows: (1) we recommend offering a single course of antenatal corticosteroids (2 doses of 12 mg of intramuscular betamethasone 24 hours apart) to patients who meet the inclusion criteria of the Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids trial, ie, those with a singleton pregnancy between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation who are at high risk of preterm birth within the next 7 days and before 37 weeks of gestation (GRADE 1A); (2) we suggest consideration for the use of antenatal corticosteroids in select populations not included in the original Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids trial, such as patients with multiple gestations reduced to a singleton gestation on or after 14 0/7 weeks of gestation, patients with fetal anomalies, or those who are expected to deliver in <12 hours (GRADE 2C); (3) we recommend against the use of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity in pregnant patients with a low likelihood of delivery before 37 weeks of gestation (GRADE 1B); (4) we recommend against the use of late preterm corticosteroids in pregnant patients with pregestational diabetes mellitus, given the risk of worsening neonatal hypoglycemia (GRADE 1C); (5) we recommend that patients at risk for late preterm delivery be thoroughly counseled regarding the potential risks and benefits of antenatal corticosteroid administration and be advised that the long-term risks remain uncertain (GRADE 1C).", "Keywords": ["antenatal corticosteroids", "betamethasone", "fetal lung maturity", "preterm birth"], "MeSH terms": ["Betamethasone", "Directive Counseling", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, Third", "Premature Birth", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM).

Risk factors for severity, obstetrical and immediate neonatal outcomes were assessed. A total of 926 pregnant women with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were included, among which 92 (9.9%) presented with severe COVID-19 disease. Risk factors for severe maternal outcomes were pulmonary comorbidities [aOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.9-9.5], hypertensive disorders [aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.0-7.0] and diabetes [aOR2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.5]. Pregnant women with severe maternal outcomes were at higher risk of caesarean section [70.7% (n\u2009=\u200953/75)], preterm delivery [62.7% (n\u2009=\u200932/51)] and newborns requiring admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [41.3% (n\u2009=\u200931/75)].

Women with adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) have increased cardiovascular risk, but the relationship of other factors is unknown. Methods and Results Among 4471 primiparous women, we related first-trimester atherogenic markers to risk of APO (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, small for gestational age), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertension (130/80\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or antihypertensive use) 2 to 7\u00a0years after delivery. Women with an APO/GDM (n=1102) had more atherogenic characteristics (obesity [34.2 versus 19.5%], higher blood pressure [systolic blood pressure 112.2 versus 108.4, diastolic blood pressure 69.2 versus 66.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg], glucose [5.0 versus 4.8\u00a0mmol/L], insulin [77.6 versus 60.1\u00a0pmol/L], triglycerides [1.4 versus 1.3\u00a0mmol/L], and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [5.6 versus 4.0\u00a0nmol/L], and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [1.8 versus 1.9\u00a0mmol/L]; P<0.05) than women without an APO/GDM. They were also more likely to develop hypertension after delivery (32.8% versus 18.1%, P<0.05). Accounting for confounders and factors routinely assessed antepartum, higher glucose (relative risk [RR] 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00-1.06] per 0.6\u00a0mmol/L), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.11] per 2-fold higher), and triglycerides (RR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.14-1.41] per 2-fold higher) were associated with later hypertension. Higher physical activity was protective (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87-0.99] per 3\u00a0h/week). When evaluated as latent profiles, the nonobese group with higher lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and insulin values (6.9% of the cohort) had increased risk of an APO/GDM and later hypertension. Among these factors, 7% to 15% of excess RR was related to APO/GDM. Conclusions Individual and combined first-trimester atherogenic characteristics are associated with APO/GDM occurrence and hypertension 2 to 7\u00a0years later.

unknown. We present a case of second trimester pregnancy with symptomatic COVID-19 complicated by severe preeclampsia and placental abruption.METHODSWe analyzed the placenta for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through molecular and immunohistochemical assays and by and electron microscopy and measured the maternal antibody response in the blood to this infection.RESULTSSARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the materno-fetal interface of the placenta. Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for the vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia.CONCLUSIONThis case demonstrates SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with COVID-19.FUNDINGBeatrice Kleinberg Neuwirth Fund and Fast Grant Emergent Ventures funding from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

occurring in 1 in 160 deliveries in the United States. In developed countries, the most prevalent risk factors associated with stillbirth are non-Hispanic black race, nulliparity, advanced maternal age, obesity, preexisting diabetes, chronic hypertension, smoking, alcohol use, having a pregnancy using assisted reproductive technology, multiple gestation, male fetal sex, unmarried status, and past obstetric history. Although some of these factors may be modifiable (such as smoking), many are not. The study of specific causes of stillbirth has been hampered by the lack of uniform protocols to evaluate and classify stillbirths and by decreasing autopsy rates. In any specific case, it may be difficult to assign a definite cause to a stillbirth. A significant proportion of stillbirths remains unexplained, even after a thorough evaluation. Evaluation of a stillbirth should include fetal autopsy; gross and histologic examination of the placenta, umbilical cord, and membranes; and genetic evaluation. The method and timing of delivery after a stillbirth depend on the gestational age at which the death occurred, maternal obstetric history (eg, previous hysterotomy), and maternal preference. Health care providers should weigh the risks and benefits of each strategy in a given clinical scenario and consider available institutional expertise. Patient support should include emotional support and clear communication of test results. Referral to a bereavement counselor, peer support group, or mental health professional may be advisable for management of grief and depression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "American College of Obstetricians and GynecologistsSociety for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org.", "Affiliation": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in collaboration withSociety for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org.", "Affiliation": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org."}, {"First Name": "Torri D", "Last Name": "Metz", "Affiliation": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org."}, {"First Name": "Rana Snipe", "Last Name": "Berry", "Affiliation": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org."}, {"First Name": "Ruth C", "Last Name": "Fretts", "Affiliation": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org."}, {"First Name": "Uma M", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org."}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Turrentine", "Affiliation": "Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 409 12 St. SW, Washington, DC 20024, USA. pubs@smfm.org."}], "Journal": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "PubDate": "2020Mar"}, {"PMID": "31981510", "Title": "Quality of periconceptional dietary intake and maternal and neonatal outcomes.", "Abstract": "Periconceptional diet quality is commonly suboptimal and sociodemographic disparities in diet quality exist.

The objective of this study was to determine the association between outcomes in first pregnancies and subsequent cardiovascular health. Methods and Results The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be Heart Health Study is a prospective observational cohort that followed 4484 women 2 to 7\u00a0years (mean 3.2\u00a0years) after their first pregnancy. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (defined as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, small-for-gestational-age birth, preterm birth, and stillbirth) were identified prospectively in 1017 of the women (22.7%) during this pregnancy. The primary outcome was incident hypertension (HTN). Women without adverse pregnancy outcomes served as controls. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs were adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index, insurance type, and race/ethnicity at enrollment during pregnancy. The overall incidence of HTN was 5.4% (95% CI 4.7% to 6.1%). Women with adverse pregnancy outcomes had higher adjusted risk of HTN at follow-up compared with controls (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.8-3.1). The association held for individual adverse pregnancy outcomes: any hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.6), preeclampsia (RR 2.8, 95% CI 2.0-4.0), and preterm birth (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-3.8). Women who had an indicated preterm birth and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy had the highest risk of HTN (RR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.7). Conclusions Several pregnancy complications in the first pregnancy are associated with development of HTN 2 to 7\u00a0years later. Preventive care for women should include a detailed pregnancy history to aid in counseling about HTN risk.

This study evaluates the associations of prenatal stress and APOs with maternal stress years after pregnancy. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (0-40 range) was completed in the first and third trimesters, and 2-7\u00a0years after delivery among a subsample (n\u2009=\u20094161) of nulliparous women enrolled at eight US medical centers between 2010 and 2013 in a prospective, observational cohort study. Demographics, medical history, and presence of APOs (gestational diabetes (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), preeclampsia (PE), and medically indicated or spontaneous preterm birth (miPTB, sPTB)) were obtained. The associations of prenatal PSS and the presence of APOs with PSS scores years after delivery were estimated using multivariable linear regression. Mean PSS scores were 12.5 (95% CI 12.3, 12.7) and 11.3 (95% CI 11.1, 11.5) in the first and third trimesters respectively and 14.9 (95% CI 14.7, 15.1) 2-7\u00a0years later, an average increase of 2.4 points (95% CI 2.2, 2.6) from the start of pregnancy. Regressing PSS scores after delivery on first-trimester PSS and PSS increase through pregnancy showed positive associations, with coefficients (95% CI) of 2.8 (2.7, 3.0) and 1.5 (1.3, 1.7) per 5-point change, respectively. Adding APO indicator variables separately showed higher PSS scores for women with HDP (0.7 [0.1, 1.3]), PE (1.3 [0.6, 2.1]), and miPTB (1.3 [0.2, 2.4]), but not those with GDM or sPTB.

"Abstract": "Morphology of the nucleus is an important regulator of gene expression. Nuclear morphology is in turn a function of the forces acting on it and the mechanical properties of the nuclear envelope. Here, we present a two-parameter, nondimensional mechanical model of the nucleus that reveals a relationship among nuclear shape parameters, such as projected area, surface area, and volume. Our model fits the morphology of individual nuclei and predicts the ratio between forces and modulus in each nucleus. We analyzed the changes in nuclear morphology of liver cells due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection using this model. The model predicted a decrease in the elastic modulus of the nuclear envelope and an increase in the pre-tension in cortical actin as the causes for the change in nuclear morphology. These predictions were validated biomechanically by showing that liver cells expressing HCV proteins possessed enhanced cellular stiffness and reduced nuclear stiffness. Concomitantly, cells expressing HCV proteins showed downregulation of lamin-A,C and upregulation of \u03b2-actin, corroborating the predictions of the model. Our modeling assumptions are broadly applicable to adherent, monolayer cell cultures, making the model amenable to investigate changes in nuclear mechanics due to other stimuli by merely measuring nuclear morphology.

The relationship between maternal oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-31-week gestation and body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, insulin, and anthropometric measurements (sum of skinfolds, subscapular/triceps ratio, and waist circumference) in the offspring of untreated mild GDM and non-GDM (abnormal 50-g screen/normal OGTT) women was assessed. Multivariable regression modeling controlling for maternal and neonatal characteristics was employed.Results: A cohort of 236 untreated mild GDM and 480 non-GDM offspring were analyzed. In the combined cohort, significant correlations existed between fasting, 1, 2, and 3\u2009h maternal glucose and subscapular/triceps ratio (all p\u2009<\u2009.04) and in all OGTT values other than the 2-hour value for homeostatic model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (all p\u2009<\u2009.04) and sum of skinfold measurements (all p\u2009<\u2009.03). No correlation was found between OGTT values and childhood BMI Z-score. Multivariable regression modeling showed that OGTT values were associated with only sum of skinfolds and subscapular/triceps ratio and not with childhood BMI Z-score.

Methods We performed a secondary analysis of a multi-center placebo-controlled trial of vitamins C/E to prevent preeclampsia in low risk nulliparous women. Clinical chorioamnionitis was defined as either the \"clinical diagnosis\" of chorioamnionitis or antibiotic administration during labor because of an elevated temperature or uterine tenderness in the absence of another cause. Early-onset neonatal sepsis was categorized as \"suspected\" or \"confirmed\" based on a clinical diagnosis with negative or positive blood, urine or cerebral spinal fluid cultures, respectively, within 72 h of birth. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression. Results Data from 9391 mother-infant pairs were analyzed. The frequency of chorioamnionitis was 10.3%. Overall, 6.6% of the neonates were diagnosed with confirmed (0.2%) or suspected (6.4%) early-onset sepsis. Only 0.7% of infants born in the setting of chorioamnionitis had culture-proven early-onset sepsis versus 0.1% if chorioamnionitis was not present. Clinical chorioamnionitis was associated with both suspected [OR 4.01 (3.16-5.08)] and confirmed [OR 4.93 (1.65-14.74)] early-onset neonatal sepsis, a need for resuscitation within the first 30 min after birth [OR 2.10 (1.70-2.61)], respiratory distress [OR 3.14 (2.16-4.56)], 1 min Apgar score of \u22643 [OR 2.69 (2.01-3.60)] and 4-7 [OR 1.71 (1.43-2.04)] and 5 min Apgar score of 4-7 [OR 1.67 (1.17-2.37)] (vs. 8-10). Conclusion Clinical chorioamnionitis is common and is associated with neonatal morbidities.

Earlier, we have demonstrated anti-HCV property of the methanolic extract of Phyllanthus amarus, an age-old folk-medicine against viral hepatitis. Here, we report identification of a principal bioactive component 'corilagin', which showed significant inhibition of the HCV key enzymes, NS3 protease and NS5B RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase. This pure compound could effectively inhibit viral replication in the infectious cell culture system, displayed strong antioxidant activity by blocking HCV induced generation of reactive oxygen species and suppressed up-regulation of NOX4 and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA levels. Oral administration of corilagin in BALB/c mice demonstrated its better tolerability and systemic bioavailability. More importantly, corilagin could restrict serum HCV RNA levels, decrease collagen deposition and hepatic cell denaturation in HCV infected chimeric mice harbouring human hepatocytes.

measures, independent of economic status, exist among a large population of pregnant nulliparas. Methods\u2003Between October 2010 and September 2013, nulliparous women at eight U.S. medical centers were followed longitudinally during pregnancy and completed validated instruments to quantify several psychosocial domains: Cohen Perceived Stress Scale, trait subscale of the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Krieger Racism Scale, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the Pregnancy Experience Scale. Scores were stratified and compared by self-reported race, ethnicity, and income. Results\u2003Complete data were available for 8,128 of the 10,038 women enrolled in the study. For all measures, race and ethnicity were significantly associated (p\u2009<\u20090.001) with survey scores. Non-Hispanic black (NHB) women were most likely to score in the most unfavorable category for all measures, with the exception of the Pregnancy Experience Scale. The magnitude of these differences did not differ by income status (interaction, p\u2009>\u20090.05) except on the Krieger racism survey and the Edinburgh depression survey, which were exacerbated among NHB women with higher income (interaction, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

this study was to assess the relationship between first trimester cell-free total and fetal DNA in maternal plasma and the subsequent development of preeclampsia. Study Design\u2003Nested case-control study of patients enrolled in the Combined Antioxidant and Preeclampsia Prediction Studies prediction study of 175 women who did and 175 women who did not develop preeclampsia. The predictive values of cell-free total and fetal DNA and the subsequent development of preeclampsia were measured using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results\u2003Cell-free total DNA was higher in African American (median; 25-75%; 6.15; 0.14-28.73; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and Hispanic (4.95; 0.20-26.82; p\u2009=\u20090.037) compared with white women (2.33; 0.03-13.10). Levels of cell-free total DNA were also associated with maternal body mass index (BMI) (p\u2009=\u20090.02).

A Secondary Analysis of Randomized Trial Data.", "Abstract": "Objective\u2003The objective of this study was to examine whether there is an association between insulin resistance and subsequent development of puerperal infection by measuring insulin resistance in the mid-trimester using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA:IR). Methods\u2003Secondary analysis of low-risk nulliparas enrolled in a multicenter preeclampsia prevention trial. HOMA:IR was measured on fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations among low-risk nulliparas between 22 and 26 weeks' gestation. Median HOMA:IR was compared between women who did and did not develop puerperal infection using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders. Results\u2003Of 1,180 women with fasting glucose and insulin available, 121 (10.3%) had a puerperal infection.

In this report, we detail the design and study procedures of the nuMoM2b-HHS. Women in the pregnancy cohort who consented to be contacted for participation in future studies were approached at 6-month intervals to ascertain health information and to maintain ongoing contact. Two to 5 years after completion of the pregnancy documented in the nuMoM2b, women in the nuMoM2b-HHS were invited to an in-person study visit. During this visit, they completed psychosocial and medical history questionnaires and had clinical measurements and biological specimens obtained. A subcohort of participants who had objective assessments of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy were asked to repeat this investigation. This unique prospective observational study includes a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort, rich depth of phenotypic information about adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical data and biospecimens from early in the index pregnancy onward.

Methods\u2003This is a secondary analysis of data from the Combined Antioxidant and Preeclampsia Prediction Study.

Targeted delivery of siRNA helps minimize adverse 'off-target' effects and maximize the efficacy of therapeutic response. Herein, we report the delivery of siRNA against the conserved 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of HCV RNA using a liver-targeted dendritic nano-vector functionalized with a galactopyranoside ligand (DG). Physico-chemical characterization revealed finer details of complexation of DG with siRNA, whereas molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated sugar moieties projecting \"out\" in the complex. Preferential delivery of siRNA to the liver was achieved through a highly specific ligand-receptor interaction between dendritic galactose and the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The siRNA-DG complex exhibited perinuclear localization in liver cells and co-localization with viral proteins. The histopathological studies showed the systemic tolerance and biocompatibility of DG. Further, whole body imaging and immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the preferential delivery of the nucleic acid to mice liver. Significant decrease in HCV RNA levels (up to 75%) was achieved in HCV subgenomic replicon and full length HCV-JFH1 infectious cell culture systems.

This article illustrates that asking data to fit a preconceived model or letting a sufficiently flexible model fit observed data is the main difference in principles of statistical modeling between the original Friedman curve and our average labor curve. An evidence-based approach to construct a labor curve and establish normal values should allow the statistical model to fit observed data. In addition, the presence of the deceleration phase in the active phase of an average labor curve was questioned. Forcing a deceleration phase to be part of the labor curve may have artificially raised the speed of progression in the active phase with a particularly large impact on earlier labor between 4 and 6 cm. Finally, any labor curve is illustrative and may not be instructive in managing labor because of variations in individual labor pattern and large errors in measuring cervical dilation. With the tools commonly available, it may be more productive to establish a new partogram that takes the physiology of labor and contemporary obstetric population into account.", "Keywords": ["Friedman curve", "deceleration phase", "labor curve", "modeling", "partogram"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Labor, Obstetric", "Models, Statistical", "Pregnancy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

Despite extensive research, the genetic contributions to spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) are not well understood. Term controls were matched with cases by race/ethnicity, maternal age, and parity prior to recruitment. Genotyping was performed using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 assays. Statistical analyses utilized PLINK to compare allele occurrence rates between case and control groups, and incorporated quality control and multiple-testing adjustments. We analyzed DNA samples from mother-infant pairs from early SPTB cases (20(0/7)-33(6/7) weeks, 959 women and 979 neonates) and term delivery controls (39(0/7)-41(6/7) weeks, 960 women and 985 neonates). For validation purposes, we included an independent validation cohort consisting of early SPTB cases (293 mothers and 243 infants) and term controls (200 mothers and 149 infants). Clustering analysis revealed no population stratification. Multiple maternal SNPs were identified with association P-values between 10\u00d710(-5) and 10\u00d710(-6). The most significant maternal SNP was rs17053026 on chromosome 3 with an odds ratio (OR) 0.44 with a P-value of 1.0\u00d710(-6). Two neonatal SNPs reached the genome-wide significance threshold, including rs17527054 on chromosome 6p22 with a P-value of 2.7\u00d710(-12) and rs3777722 on chromosome 6q27 with a P-value of 1.4\u00d710(-10).

Recent advances in the last decade in anti HCV treatment strategies have dramatically increased the viral clearance rate. However, several limitations are still associated, which warrant a great need of novel, safe and selective drugs against HCV infection. Towards this objective, we explored highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitors, the ellagitannins, from the crude extract of Pomegranate (Punica granatum) fruit peel. The pure compounds, punicalagin, punicalin, and ellagic acid isolated from the extract specifically blocked the HCV NS3/4A protease activity in vitro. Structural analysis using computational approach also showed that ligand molecules interact with the catalytic and substrate binding residues of NS3/4A protease, leading to inhibition of the enzyme activity. Further, punicalagin and punicalin significantly reduced the HCV replication in cell culture system.

The application of similar screening algorithms to identify women at the highest risk for other adverse pregnancy outcomes in the first trimester could potentially have a major clinical impact. There has been much investigation into the ability to identify patients early in pregnancy at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes who may benefit from further surveillance and/or intervention. For this to be the case, however, as is true of any useful screening test, effective interventions need to be available. Unfortunately, for fetal growth restriction and stillbirth, no such interventions exist short of delivery. For preeclampsia, low dose aspirin has been demonstrated to be of benefit in specific subgroups. For preterm birth, although there are efficacious treatments, first trimester serum markers or cervical length measurements do not add significantly beyond historical or demographic factors, in prediction of preterm birth. Given the current evidence, first trimester screening, via serum or ultrasound markers, does not have sufficiently high enough positive predictive values for the development of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth or stillbirth.

An NIH State-of-the-Science Conference was convened in 2012 to address new findings, particularly the use of the medication sapropterin to treat some individuals with PKU, and to develop a research agenda. Prior to the 2012 conference, five working groups of experts and public members met over a 1-year period. The working groups addressed the following: long-term outcomes and management across the lifespan; PKU and pregnancy; diet control and management; pharmacologic interventions; and molecular testing, new technologies, and epidemiologic considerations. In a parallel and independent activity, an Evidence-based Practice Center supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted a systematic review of adjuvant treatments for PKU; its conclusions were presented at the conference. The conference included the findings of the working groups, panel discussions from industry and international perspectives, and presentations on topics such as emerging treatments for PKU, transitioning to adult care, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory perspective. Over 85 experts participated in the conference through information gathering and/or as presenters during the conference, and they reached several important conclusions. The most serious neurological impairments in PKU are preventable with current dietary treatment approaches. However, a variety of more subtle physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of even well-controlled PKU are now recognized. The best outcomes in maternal PKU occur when blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations are maintained between 120 and 360 \u03bcmol/L before and during pregnancy. The dietary management treatment goal for individuals with PKU is a blood Phe concentration between 120 and 360 \u03bcmol/L. The use of genotype information in the newborn period may yield valuable insights about the severity of the condition for infants diagnosed before maximal Phe levels are achieved. While emerging and established genotype-phenotype correlations may transform our understanding of PKU, establishing correlations with intellectual outcomes is more challenging. Regarding the use of sapropterin in PKU, there are significant gaps in predicting response to treatment; at least half of those with PKU will have either minimal or no response. A coordinated approach to PKU treatment improves long-term outcomes for those with PKU and facilitates the conduct of research to improve diagnosis and treatment. New drugs that are safe, efficacious, and impact a larger proportion of individuals with PKU are needed. However, it is imperative that treatment guidelines and the decision processes for determining access to treatments be tied to a solid evidence base with rigorous standards for robust and consistent data collection. The process that preceded the PKU State-of-the-Science Conference, the conference itself, and the identification of a research agenda have facilitated the development of clinical practice guidelines by professional organizations and serve as a model for other inborn errors of metabolism.", "Keywords": ["Glycomacropeptide", "Hyperphenylalaninemia", "Large neutral amino acids", "Maternal PKU", "Phenylketonuria", "Sapropterin"], "MeSH terms": ["Biopterins", "Diet Therapy", "Disease Management", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "National Institutes of Health (U.S.)", "Phenylketonurias", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Pregnancy", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kathryn M", "Last Name": "Camp", "Affiliation": "Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20982, USA.

The Consortium on Safe Labor, a retrospective cohort (2002-2008), included 223,512 singleton deliveries of which 0.2% had hyperthyroidism, 1.4% primary and 0.1% iatrogenic hypothyroidism, and 1.3% other/unspecified thyroid disease. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations estimated adjusted odds ratios of adverse outcomes. Intensive care treatment was more common for neonates of women with thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism and primary hypothyroidism were associated with sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea, and apnea. Iatrogenic hypothyroidism was associated with sepsis and neonatal anemia. Hyperthyroidism was also associated with rare outcomes (prevalence, <1%) including cardiomyopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and neonatal thyroid diseases. Hyperthyroid non-Hispanic black women had higher odds of term infants that weighed <2,500 g, and hypothyroid non-Hispanic white women had higher odds of large-for-gestational-age infants. These analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity due to interaction. Associations were similar in analyses restricted to term infants. In conclusion, thyroid diseases were associated with increased neonatal morbidity. Although we lacked data on treatment during pregnancy, these nationwide data suggest a need for better thyroid disease management to reduce neonatal morbidity.", "Keywords": ["anemia, neonatal", "birth weight", "intensive care, neonatal", "pregnancy", "respiratory distress syndrome, newborn", "thyroid diseases"], "MeSH terms": ["Birth Weight", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units, Neonatal", "Odds Ratio", "Perinatal Mortality", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Sex Distribution", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Thyroid Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tuija", "Last Name": "M\u00e4nnist\u00f6", "Affiliation": "Epidemiology Branch, Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. mannistoti@mail.nih.gov"}, {"First Name": "Pauline", "Last Name": "Mendola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Uma", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S Katherine", "Last Name": "Laughon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of epidemiology", "PubDate": "2013Sep01"}, {"PMID": "23531847", "Title": "A population-based case-control study of stillbirth: the relationship of significant life events to the racial disparity for African Americans.", "Abstract": "Stillbirths (fetal deaths occurring at \u226520 weeks' gestation) are approximately equal in number to infant deaths in the United States and are twice as likely among non-Hispanic black births as among non-Hispanic white births. The causes of racial disparity in stillbirth remain poorly understood. A population-based case-control study conducted by the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network in 5 US catchment areas from March 2006 to September 2008 identified characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparity and interpersonal and environmental stressors, including a list of 13 significant life events (SLEs). The adjusted odds ratio for stillbirth among women reporting all 4 SLE factors (financial, emotional, traumatic, and partner-related) was 2.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.43, 3.46). This association was robust after additional control for the correlated variables of family income, marital status, and health insurance type. There was no interaction between race/ethnicity and other variables. Effective ameliorative interventions could have a substantial public health impact, since there is at least a 50% increased risk of stillbirth for the approximately 21% of all women and 32% of non-Hispanic black women who experience 3 or more SLE factors during the year prior to delivery.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Black or African American", "Case-Control Studies", "Confidence Intervals", "Female", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Income", "Insurance, Health", "Life Change Events", "Marital Status", "Odds Ratio", "Pregnancy", "Risk Factors", "Stillbirth", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United States", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carol J R", "Last Name": "Hogue", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. chogue@emory.edu"}, {"First Name": "Corette B", "Last Name": "Parker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marian", "Last Name": "Willinger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeff R", "Last Name": "Temple", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carla M", "Last Name": "Bann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert M", "Last Name": "Silver", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "Dudley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew A", "Last Name": "Koch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald R", "Last Name": "Coustan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barbara J", "Last Name": "Stoll", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Uma M", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael W", "Last Name": "Varner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George R", "Last Name": "Saade", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Conway", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert L", "Last Name": "Goldenberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network Writing Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of epidemiology", "PubDate": "2013Apr15"}, {"PMID": "23374059", "Title": "An algorithm for the estimation of gestational age at the time of fetal death.", "Abstract": "Accurate assignment of gestational age (GA) at time of fetal death is important for research and clinical practice.
