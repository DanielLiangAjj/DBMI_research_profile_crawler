During pathological conditions, tactile stimuli can aberrantly engage nociceptive pathways leading to the perception of touch as pain, known as mechanical allodynia. Two main drivers of peripheral tactile information, low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and postsynaptic dorsal column neurons (PSDCs), terminate in the brainstem dorsal column nuclei (DCN). Activity within the DRG, spinal cord, and DCN have all been implicated in mediating allodynia, yet the DCN remains understudied at the cellular, circuit, and functional levels compared to the other two. Here, we show that the gracile nucleus (Gr) of the DCN mediates tactile sensitivity for low-threshold stimuli and contributes to mechanical allodynia during neuropathic pain in mice. We found that the Gr contains local inhibitory interneurons in addition to thalamus-projecting neurons, which are differentially innervated by primary afferents and spinal inputs. Functional manipulations of these distinct Gr neuronal populations resulted in bidirectional changes to tactile sensitivity, but did not affect noxious mechanical or thermal sensitivity. During neuropathic pain, silencing Gr projection neurons or activating Gr inhibitory neurons was able to reduce tactile hypersensitivity, and enhancing inhibition was able to ameliorate paw withdrawal signatures of neuropathic pain, like shaking. Collectively, these results suggest that the Gr plays a specific role in mediating hypersensitivity to low-threshold, innocuous mechanical stimuli during neuropathic pain, and that Gr activity contributes to affective, pain-associated phenotypes of mechanical allodynia. Therefore, these brainstem circuits work in tandem with traditional spinal circuits underlying allodynia, resulting in enhanced signaling of tactile stimuli in the brain during neuropathic pain.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aman", "Last Name": "Upadhyay", "Affiliation": "W.M.

Polygenic transcription of OR genes may define spatially constrained OR repertoires, among which one OR allele is selected for singular expression later in development. Heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization of OR alleles also vary across the axes of the olfactory epithelium and may preferentially eliminate ectopically expressed ORs with more dorsal expression destinations from this 'privileged' repertoire.

By contrast, social isolation generates an aversive state (loneliness) that motivates social seeking and heightens social interaction upon reunion3-5. The observed rebound in social interaction triggered by isolation suggests a homeostatic process underlying the control of social drive, similar to that observed for physiological needs such as hunger, thirst or sleep3,6. In this study, we assessed social responses in multiple mouse strains and identified the FVB/NJ line as exquisitely sensitive to social isolation. Using FVB/NJ mice, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during social isolation and social rebound and that orchestrate the behavior display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations of opposite function and with brain areas associated with social behavior, emotional state, reward, and physiological needs, and showed that animals require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfill their social need, thus revealing a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis. These findings offer mechanistic insight into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ding", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mostafizur", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Autumn", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iku", "Last Name": "Tsutsui-Kimura", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolai", "Last Name": "Pena", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mustafa", "Last Name": "Talay", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon L", "Last Name": "Logeman", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Finkbeiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seungwon", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Athena", "Last Name": "Capo-Battaglia", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ishmail", "Last Name": "Abdus-Saboor", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ginty", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naoshige", "Last Name": "Uchida", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mitsuko", "Last Name": "Watabe-Uchida", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Dulac", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023May19"}, {"PMID": "36993168", "Title": "Opposing, spatially-determined epigenetic forces impose restrictions on stochastic olfactory receptor choice.", "Abstract": "Olfactory receptor (OR) choice represents an example of genetically hardwired stochasticity, where every olfactory neuron expresses one out of ~2000 OR alleles in a probabilistic, yet stereotypic fashion.

Taken together, this automated pain quantification approach will increase objectivity in collecting rigorous behavioral data, and it is compatible with other neural circuit dissection tools for determining the mouse pain state.", "Keywords": ["automation", "high-speed videography", "machine learning", "mouse", "neural circuits", "neuroscience", "pain", "somatosensation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Automation, Laboratory", "Female", "Male", "Mice", "Pain Measurement", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jessica M", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Foster", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Colin R", "Last Name": "Twomey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Burdge", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Osama M", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, United States."}, {"First Name": "Talmo D", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jessica A", "Last Name": "Wojick", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Corder", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua B", "Last Name": "Plotkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ishmail", "Last Name": "Abdus-Saboor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2020Aug06"}, {"PMID": "32102021", "Title": "Improving pain assessment in mice and rats with advanced videography and computational approaches.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Pain Measurement", "Rats", "Video Recording"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nathan T", "Last Name": "Fried", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Rutgers University-Camden, Camden, NJ, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Chamessian", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Mark J", "Last Name": "Zylka", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, UNC Neuroscience Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ishmail", "Last Name": "Abdus-Saboor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}], "Journal": "Pain", "PubDate": "2020Jul"}, {"PMID": "32066827", "Title": "Evoked and spontaneous pain assessment during tooth pulp injury.", "Abstract": "Injury of the tooth pulp is excruciatingly painful and yet the receptors and neural circuit mechanisms that transmit this form of pain remain poorly defined in both the clinic and preclinical rodent models. Easily quantifiable behavioral assessment in the mouse orofacial area remains a major bottleneck in uncovering molecular mechanisms that govern inflammatory pain in the tooth. In this study we sought to address this problem using the Mouse Grimace Scale and a novel approach to the application of mechanical Von Frey hair stimuli. We use a dental pulp injury model that exposes the pulp to the outside environment, a procedure we have previously shown produces inflammation. Using RNAscope technology, we demonstrate an upregulation of genes that contribute to the pain state in the trigeminal ganglia of injured mice. We found that mice with dental pulp injury have greater Mouse Grimace Scores than sham within 24\u2009hours of injury, suggestive of spontaneous pain. We developed a scoring system of mouse refusal to determine thresholds for mechanical stimulation of the face with Von Frey filaments. This method revealed that mice with a unilateral dental injury develop bilateral mechanical allodynia that is delayed relative to the onset of spontaneous pain. This work demonstrates that tooth pain can be quantified in freely behaving mice using approaches common for other types of pain assessment.

Inherent in this model is a finite failure rate wherein multiple OR alleles may be activated prior to feedback suppression [15, 16]. Confronted with more than one receptor, the neuron would need to activate a refinement mechanism to eliminate multigenic OR expression and resolve unique neuronal identity [16], critical to the generation of the circuit from nose to olfactory bulb.
