Despite these improvements in complications, the use of continuous flow assist devices is still associated with high rates of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications, most notably stroke in approximately 10% of continuous flow assist devices patients per year. With the newest HeartMate 3 devices, there have been lower observed rates of stroke, which has in part been achieved by both improvements in pump technology and knowledge of the risk factors for stroke and neurological complications. The therapeutic options available to clinicians to reduce the risk of stroke, including management of hypertension and antithrombotics, will be reviewed in this manuscript.", "Keywords": ["Epidemiology", "LVAD", "Prevention", "Stroke", "Treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Heart Failure", "Heart Transplantation", "Heart-Assist Devices", "Humans", "Quality of Life", "Retrospective Studies", "Stroke", "Thrombosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chinwe", "Last Name": "Ibeh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 West 168th street, Room 604, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kara R", "Last Name": "Melmed", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melana", "Last Name": "Yuzefpolskaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paolo C", "Last Name": "Colombo", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua Z", "Last Name": "Willey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 West 168th street, Room 604, New York, NY, 10032, USA. jzw2@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Heart failure reviews", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "34719260", "Title": "Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiovascular Science: Anticipating Problems and Potential Solutions: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.", "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had worldwide repercussions for health care and research. In spring 2020, most non-COVID-19 research was halted, hindering research across the spectrum from laboratory-based experimental science to clinical research. Through the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, biomedical research, including cardiovascular science, only gradually restarted, with many restrictions on onsite activities, limited clinical research participation, and the challenges associated with working from home and caregiver responsibilities. Compounding these impediments, much of the global biomedical research infrastructure was redirected toward vaccine testing and deployment. This redirection of supply chains, personnel, and equipment has additionally hampered restoration of normal research activity. Transition to virtual interactions offset some of these limitations but did not adequately replace the need for scientific exchange and collaboration. Here, we outline key steps to reinvigorate biomedical research, including a call for increased support from the National Institutes of Health. We also call on academic institutions, publishers, reviewers, and supervisors to consider the impact of COVID-19 when assessing productivity, recognizing that the pandemic did not affect all equally. We identify trainees and junior investigators, especially those with caregiving roles, as most at risk of being lost from the biomedical workforce and identify steps to reduce the loss of these key investigators. Although the global pandemic highlighted the power of biomedical science to define, treat, and protect against threats to human health, significant investment in the biomedical workforce is required to maintain and promote well-being.", "Keywords": ["AHA Scientific Statements", "COVID-19", "cardiovascular research", "early career", "health literacy", "research training", "workforce"], "MeSH terms": ["Advisory Committees", "American Heart Association", "Biomedical Research", "COVID-19", "Cardiology", "Diffusion of Innovation", "Education, Professional", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Public Opinion", "Research Design", "Research Personnel", "Time Factors", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "McNally", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivor J", "Last Name": "Benjamin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mina K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Glenn H", "Last Name": "Dillon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adrian F", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chinwe", "Last Name": "Ibeh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald M", "Last Name": "Lloyd-Jones", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Louise D", "Last Name": "McCullough", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Loren E", "Last Name": "Wold", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davene R", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph C", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Circulation", "PubDate": "2021Dec07"}, {"PMID": "34657187", "Title": "Stroke Prevention After Cryptogenic Stroke.", "Abstract": "Cryptogenic stroke represents a heterogenous but clinically important collection of stroke etiologies for which our understanding continues to grow.

Varying study populations, event definitions, and reporting methods make direct comparison of neurologic event risk across clinical trials and registries challenging. We aim to highlight important differences among major VAD studies and standardize rates of neurologic events to facilitate a comprehensive and objective comparison. We systematically identified and analyzed key clinical trials and registries evaluating the HeartMate II (HMII), HeartMate 3 (HM3), and HVAD devices. Reported neurologic events were nonexclusively categorized into ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, disabling stroke, fatal stroke, and other neurologic events per the studies' definitions. Event rates were standardized to events per patient-year (EPPY) and freedom from event formats. Seven key clinical trials and registries were included in our analysis. There is significant variation and overlap in neurologic event rates for the three VAD platforms across clinical trials (all neurologic events [EPPY]: HM3 0.17-0.21; HMII 0.19-0.26; HVAD 0.16-0.28).
