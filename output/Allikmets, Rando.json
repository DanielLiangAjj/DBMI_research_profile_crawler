[{"PMID": "38540785", "Title": "Towards Uncovering the Role of Incomplete Penetrance in Maculopathies through Sequencing of 105 Disease-Associated Genes.", "Abstract": "Inherited macular dystrophies (iMDs) are a group of genetic disorders, which affect the central region of the retina. To investigate the genetic basis of iMDs, we used single-molecule Molecular Inversion Probes to sequence 105 maculopathy-associated genes in 1352 patients diagnosed with iMDs. Within this cohort, 39.8% of patients were considered genetically explained by 460 different variants in 49 distinct genes of which 73 were novel variants, with some affecting splicing. The top five most frequent causative genes were ABCA4 (37.2%), PRPH2 (6.7%), CDHR1 (6.1%), PROM1 (4.3%) and RP1L1 (3.1%). Interestingly, variants with incomplete penetrance were revealed in almost one-third of patients considered solved (28.1%), and therefore, a proportion of patients may not be explained solely by the variants reported. This includes eight previously reported variants with incomplete penetrance in addition to CDHR1:c.783G>A and CNGB3:c.1208G>A. Notably, segregation analysis was not routinely performed for variant phasing-a limitation, which may also impact the overall diagnostic yield. The relatively high proportion of probands without any putative causal variant (60.2%) highlights the need to explore variants with incomplete penetrance, the potential modifiers of disease and the genetic overlap between iMDs and age-related macular degeneration. Our results provide valuable insights into the genetic landscape of iMDs and warrant future exploration to determine the involvement of other maculopathy genes.", "Keywords": ["inherited", "macula", "maculopathies", "penetrance", "retinal", "sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mutation", "Penetrance", "Pedigree", "Macular Degeneration", "Retina", "Phenotype", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Eye Proteins", "Cadherin Related Proteins", "Nerve Tissue Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebekkah J", "Last Name": "Hitti-Malin", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Daan M", "Last Name": "Panneman", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Zelia", "Last Name": "Corradi", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Erica G M", "Last Name": "Boonen", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Galuh", "Last Name": "Astuti", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Claire-Marie", "Last Name": "Dhaenens", "Affiliation": "Univ.

ABCA4-associated retinopathies missing heritability.", "Abstract": "The ABCA4 gene is the most frequently mutated Mendelian retinopathy-associated gene. Biallelic variants lead to a variety of phenotypes, however, for thousands of cases the underlying variants remain unknown. Here, we aim to shed further light on the missing heritability of ABCA4-associated retinopathy by analyzing a large cohort of macular dystrophy probands. A total of 858 probands were collected from 26 centers, of whom 722 carried no or one pathogenic ABCA4 variant, while 136 cases carried two ABCA4 alleles, one of which was a frequent mild variant, suggesting that deep-intronic variants (DIVs) or other cis-modifiers might have been missed. After single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs)-based sequencing of the complete 128-kb ABCA4 locus, the effect of putative splice variants was assessed in\u00a0vitro by midigene splice assays in HEK293T cells. The breakpoints of copy number variants (CNVs) were determined by junction PCR and Sanger sequencing. ABCA4 sequence analysis solved 207 of 520 (39.8%) naive or unsolved cases and 70 of 202 (34.7%) monoallelic cases, while additional causal variants were identified in 54 of 136 (39.7%) probands carrying two variants. Seven novel DIVs and six novel non-canonical splice site variants were detected in a total of 35 alleles and characterized, including the c.6283-321C>G variant leading to a complex splicing defect. Additionally, four novel CNVs were identified and characterized in five alleles. These results confirm that smMIPs-based sequencing of the complete ABCA4 gene provides a cost-effective method to genetically solve retinopathy cases and that several rare structural and splice altering defects remain undiscovered in Stargardt disease cases.", "Keywords": ["ABCA4", "ABCA4-associated retinopathies", "deep-intronic variants", "missing heritability", "smMIPs sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "HEK293 Cells", "Mutation", "Macular Degeneration", "Retinal Dystrophies", "Sequence Analysis", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zelia", "Last Name": "Corradi", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a rare, late-onset degenerative retinal disease with an extremely heterogeneous genetic architecture, lending itself to the use of iPSCs. Whole-exome sequencing screens and pedigree analyses have identified rare causative mutations that account for less than 5% of cases. Metabolomic surveys of patient populations and GWAS have linked MacTel to decreased circulating levels of serine and elevated levels of neurotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids (1-dSLs). However, retina-specific, disease-contributing factors have yet to be identified. Here, we used iPSC-differentiated retinal pigmented epithelial (iRPE) cells derived from donors with or without MacTel to screen for novel cell-intrinsic pathological mechanisms. We show that MacTel iRPE cells mimicked the low serine levels observed in serum from patients with MacTel. Through RNA-Seq and gene set enrichment pathway analysis, we determined that MacTel iRPE cells are enriched in cellular stress pathways and dysregulation of central carbon metabolism. Using respirometry and mitochondrial stress testing, we functionally validated that MacTel iRPE cells had a reduction in mitochondrial function that was independent of defects in serine biosynthesis and 1-dSL accumulation. Thus, we identified phenotypes that may constitute alternative disease mechanisms beyond the known serine/sphingolipid pathway.", "Keywords": ["Mitochondria", "Ophthalmology", "Retinopathy", "Stem cells", "iPS cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Retinal Telangiectasis", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Mitochondria", "Epithelial Cells", "Serine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kevin T", "Last Name": "Eade", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brendan Robert E", "Last Name": "Ansell", "Affiliation": "Population Health and Immunity Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Giles", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Regis", "Last Name": "Fallon", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Harkins-Perry", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Nagasaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and."}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Tzaridis", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina", "Last Name": "Wallace", "Affiliation": "Institute of Food and Health, School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Mills", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samaneh", "Last Name": "Farashi", "Affiliation": "Population Health and Immunity Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Alec", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lydia", "Last Name": "Sauer", "Affiliation": "Moran Eye Center, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara", "Last Name": "Hart", "Affiliation": "Moran Eye Center, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "M Elena", "Last Name": "Diaz-Rubio", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Bahlo", "Affiliation": "Population Health and Immunity Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Metallo", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and."}, {"First Name": "Marin L", "Last Name": "Gantner", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Bernstein", "Affiliation": "Moran Eye Center, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Friedlander", "Affiliation": "The Lowy Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2023May01"}, {"PMID": "37115124", "Title": "Re: Agr\u00f3n et\u00a0al.: Reticular pseudodrusen status, ARMS2/HTRA1 genotype, and geographic atrophy enlargement: Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Report 32.

An important next step is to understand the functional consequences and downstream effects of the identified AMD-associated genetic variants. Instrumental for this next step are 'omics' technologies, which enable high-throughput characterization and quantification of biological molecules, and subsequent integration of genomics with these omics datasets, a field referred to as systems genomics. Single cell sequencing studies of the retina and choroid demonstrated that the majority of candidate AMD genes identified through genomic studies are expressed in non-neuronal cells, such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), glia, myeloid and choroidal cells, highlighting that many different retinal and choroidal cell types contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies in retinal tissue have identified putative causal genes by demonstrating a genetic overlap between gene regulation and AMD risk. Linking genetic data to complement measurements in the systemic circulation has aided in understanding the effect of AMD-associated genetic variants in the complement system, and supports that protein QTL (pQTL) studies in plasma or serum samples may aid in understanding the effect of genetic variants and pinpointing causal genes in AMD. A recent epigenomic study fine-mapped AMD causal variants by determing regulatory regions in RPE cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPE). Another approach that is being employed to pinpoint causal AMD genes is to produce synthetic DNA assemblons representing risk and protective haplotypes, which are then delivered to cellular or animal model systems. Pinpointing causal genes and understanding disease mechanisms is crucial for the next step towards clinical translation. Clinical trials targeting proteins encoded by the AMD-associated genomic loci C3, CFB, CFI, CFH, and ARMS2/HTRA1 are currently ongoing, and a phase III clinical trial for C3 inhibition recently showed a modest reduction of lesion growth in geographic atrophy. The EYERISK consortium recently developed a genetic test for AMD that allows genotyping of common and rare variants in AMD-associated genes. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were applied to quantify AMD genetic risk, and may aid in predicting AMD progression. In conclusion, genomic studies represent a turning point in our exploration of AMD. The results of those studies now serve as a driving force for several clinical trials. Expanding to omics and systems genomics will further decipher function and causality from the associations that have been reported, and will enable the development of therapies that will lessen the burden of AMD.", "Keywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Clinical trial", "Complement system", "Expression quantitative trait locus", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Omics", "Polygenic risk scores", "Single cell sequencing", "Systems genomics", "iPSc-RPE"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Complement System Proteins", "Choroid", "Proteins", "Genomics", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Complement Factor H", "High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anneke I", "Last Name": "den Hollander", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; AbbVie, Genomics Research Center, Cambridge, MA, USA.

The resulting ABCA4/Stargardt disease is the most prevalent Mendelian eye disorder, although its underlying clinical heterogeneity, including penetrance of many alleles, are not well-understood. We hypothesized that a share of this complexity is explained by trans-modifiers, i.e., variants in unlinked loci, which are currently unknown. We sought to identify these by performing exome sequencing in a large cohort for a rare disease of 622 cases and compared variation in seven genes known to clinically phenocopy ABCA4 disease to cohorts of ethnically matched controls. We identified a significant enrichment of variants in 2 out of the 7 genes. Moderately rare, likely functional, variants, at the minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.005 and CADD>25, were enriched in ROM1, where 1.3% of 622 patients harbored a ROM1 variant compared to 0.3% of 10,865 controls (p = 2.41E04; OR 3.81 95% CI [1.77; 8.22]). More importantly, analysis of common variants (MAF>0.1) identified a frequent haplotype in PRPH2, tagged by the p.Asp338 variant with MAF = 0.21 in the matched general population that was significantly increased in the patient cohort, MAF 0.25, p = 0.0014. Significant differences were also observed between ABCA4 disease subgroups. In the late-onset subgroup, defined by the hypomorphic p.Asn1868Ile variant and including c.4253+43G>A, the allele frequency for the PRPH2 p.Asp338 variant was 0.15 vs 0.27 in the remaining cohort, p = 0.00057. Known functional data allowed suggesting a mechanism by which the PRPH2 haplotype influences the ABCA4 disease penetrance. These associations were replicated in an independent cohort of 408 patients. The association was highly statistically significant in the combined cohorts of 1,030 cases, p = 4.00E-05 for all patients and p = 0.00014 for the hypomorph subgroup, suggesting a substantial trans-modifying role in ABCA4 disease for both rare and common variants in two unlinked loci.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Eye Proteins", "Gene Frequency", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Stargardt Disease", "Tetraspanins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jana", "Last Name": "Zernant", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kerry", "Last Name": "Goetz", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ehsan", "Last Name": "Ullah", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Nagasaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pei-Yin", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gerald A", "Last Name": "Fishman", "Affiliation": "The Pangere Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases, The Chicago Lighthouse, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Santa J", "Last Name": "Tumminia", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Brian P", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert B", "Last Name": "Hufnagel", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "35089312", "Title": "Comparisons Among Optical Coherence Tomography and Fundus Autofluorescence Modalities as Measurements of Atrophy in ABCA4-Associated Disease.", "Abstract": "In ABCA4-associated retinopathy, central atrophy was assessed by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and by short-wavelength (SW-AF) and near-infrared (NIR-AF) autofluorescence.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Atrophy", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Fovea Centralis", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rait", "Last Name": "Parmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jana", "Last Name": "Zernant", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivienne C", "Last Name": "Greenstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Translational vision science & technology", "PubDate": "2022Jan03"}, {"PMID": "34874912", "Title": "A genotype-phenotype correlation matrix for ABCA4 disease based on long-term prognostic outcomes.", "Abstract": "BackgroundMore than 1500 variants in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4 (ABCA4), locus underlie a heterogeneous spectrum of retinal disorders ranging from aggressive childhood-onset chorioretinopathy to milder late-onset macular disease. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies have been limited in clinical applicability as patient cohorts are typically small and seldom capture the full natural history of individual genotypes. To overcome these limitations, we constructed a genotype-phenotype correlation matrix that provides quantifiable probabilities of long-term disease outcomes associated with specific ABCA4 genotypes from a large, age-restricted patient cohort.MethodsThe study included 112 unrelated patients at least 50 years of age in whom 2 pathogenic variants were identified after sequencing of the ABCA4 locus. Clinical characterization was performed using the results of best corrected visual acuity, retinal imaging, and full-field electroretinogram testing.ResultsFour distinct prognostic groups were defined according to the spatial severity of disease features across the fundus. Recurring genotypes were observed in milder prognoses, including a newly defined class of rare hypomorphic alleles. PVS1 (predicted null) variants were enriched in the most severe prognoses; however, missense variants were present in a larger-than-expected fraction of these patients. Analysis of allele combinations and their respective prognostic severity showed that certain variants, such as p.(Gly1961Glu), and both rare and frequent hypomorphic alleles, were \"clinically dominant\" with respect to patient phenotypes irrespective of the allele in trans.ConclusionThese results provide much-needed structure to the complex genetic and clinical landscape of ABCA4 disease and add a tool to the clinical repertoire to quantitatively assess individual genotype-specific prognoses in patients.FUNDINGNational Eye Institute, NIH, grants R01 EY028203, R01 EY028954, R01 EY029315, P30 19007 (Core Grant for Vision Research); the Foundation Fighting Blindness USA, grant no.

Thus, there is a need for better tools to identify a precise genetic diagnosis in individuals when conventional testing approaches have been exhausted. We performed targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) using adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore platform on 40 individuals, 10 of whom lacked a complete molecular diagnosis. We computationally targeted up to 151 Mbp of sequence per individual and searched for pathogenic substitutions, structural variants, and methylation differences using a single data source. We detected all genomic aberrations-including single-nucleotide variants, copy number changes, repeat expansions, and methylation differences-identified by prior clinical testing. In 8/8 individuals with complex structural rearrangements, T-LRS enabled more precise resolution of the mutation, leading to changes in clinical management in one case. In ten individuals with suspected Mendelian conditions lacking a precise genetic diagnosis, T-LRS identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in six and variants of uncertain significance in two others.

Disease-causing variation encompasses all mutation categories, from large copy number variants to very mild, hypomorphic missense variants. The most prevalent disease-causing ABCA4 variant, present in ~\u200920% of cases of European descent, c.5882G\u2009>\u2009A p.(Gly1961Glu), has been a subject of controversy since its minor allele frequency (MAF) is as high as ~\u20090.1 in certain populations, questioning its pathogenicity, especially in homozygous individuals. We sequenced the entire ~140Kb ABCA4 genomic locus in an extensive cohort of 644 bi-allelic, i.e. genetically confirmed, patients with ABCA4 disease and analyzed all variants in 140 compound heterozygous and 10 homozygous cases for the p.(Gly1961Glu) variant. A total of 23 patients in this cohort additionally harbored the deep intronic c.769-784C\u2009>\u2009T variant on the p.(Gly1961Glu) allele, which appears on a specific haplotype in ~\u200915% of p.(Gly1961Glu) alleles. This haplotype was present in 5/7 of homozygous cases, where the p.(Gly1961Glu) was the only known pathogenic variant. Three cases had an exonic variant on the same allele with the p.(Gly1961Glu). Patients with the c.[769-784C\u2009>\u2009T;5882G\u2009>\u2009A] complex allele exhibit a more severe clinical phenotype, as seen in compound heterozygotes with some more frequent ABCA4 mutations, e.g. p.(Pro1380Leu). Our findings indicate that the c.769-784C\u2009>\u2009T variant is major cis-acting modifier of the p.(Gly1961Glu) allele.

Over the next two decades, variation in ABCA4 has been attributed to phenotypes other than the classically defined STGD1 or fundus flavimaculatus, ranging from early onset and fast progressing cone-rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa-like phenotypes to very late onset cases of mostly mild disease sometimes resembling, and confused with, age-related macular degeneration. Similarly, analysis of the ABCA4 locus uncovered a trove of genetic information, including >1200 disease-causing mutations of varying severity, and of all types - missense, nonsense, small deletions/insertions, and splicing affecting variants, of which many are located deep-intronic. Altogether, this has greatly expanded our understanding of complexity not only of the diseases caused by ABCA4 mutations, but of all Mendelian diseases in general.

Identifying these associations are not only of significant diagnostic value, but also provides scientific insight into the expanded molecular etiology of rare diseases. This reports describes the discordant clinical manifestation of a family segregating mutations in ABCA4 and PROM1. Methods: Three patients across a two generation family underwent multimodal imaging and functional testing of the retina including color photography, fundus autofluorescence (AF), spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and full-field electroretinography (ffERG). Genetic characterization was carried out by direct Sanger and whole exome sequencing. Results: Clinical examination revealed similar retinal degenerative phenotypes in the proband and her mother. Despite being younger, the proband's phenotype was more advanced and exhibited additional features related to Stargardt disease not found in the mother. Whole exome sequencing identified a pathogenic missense variant in PROM1, c.400C\u00a0>\u00a0T, p.(Arg134Cys), as the underlying cause of retinal disease in both the proband and mother. Sequencing of the ABCA4 locus uncovered a single disease-causing variant, c.5714\u00a0+\u00a05G\u00a0>\u00a0A in the daughter segregating from the father who, surprisingly, also exhibited very subtle disease changes associated with STGD1 despite being a heterozygous carrier.

Due to reduced absorption of 532\u2009nm and 787\u2009nm light by macular pigment, foveal sparing was more readily demonstrable by green/UWF-AF and NIR-AF imaging. Prominent in green/UWF-AF images is a central zone of relatively elevated AF that is continuous inferonasal with a demarcation line bordering lower AF nasally and higher AF temporally. This zone and border are more visible in STGD1 than in healthy eyes and more visible with green/UWF-AF. With the development of AF flecks, inferonasal retina is initially spared. Central atrophic areas were larger in NIR-AF images than in blue/SW-AF and green/UWF-AF images and the presence of a contiguous hyperAF ring varied with imaging modality. Flecks visible as hyperAF foci in blue/SW-AF images were also visible in green/UWF-AF but were often hypoAF in NIR-AF.

Localized at the rims of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs), it is required for the maintenance of OS structure. Here, we describe a case with a phenotypic manifestation of a homozygous single-base pair deletion, c.712delC (p.Leu238Cysfs*78) in the ROM1 gene, resulting in early termination at exon 2. The variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a 63-yr-old Caucasian woman with late-onset pattern macular dystrophy. Notably, although the phenotype resembles those caused by pathogenic variants in ABCA4 or RDS/PRPH2, no pathogenic variants in these, or any other plausible candidate genes, were identified by WES. Clinical features include the presence of hyperautofluorescent flecks, relative sparing of the central macula, and preserved visual acuity. Reduced visual sensitivity was detected among flecked regions in the retina; however, full-field electroretinogram testing revealed no generalized cone dysfunction. The described first case of the complete loss of ROM1 protein function in the retina suggests its sufficiency for late-onset macular dystrophy. ROM1 and PRPH2 pattern macular dystrophies exhibit phenotype overlap, which may be attributable to their shared role in maintenance of the photoreceptor outer segment structure.", "Keywords":

Age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) matches the age-dependent increase in the incidence of the atrophic (dry) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and therefore may be one of several pathogenic factors contributing to AMD progression. Lipofuscin bisretinoid synthesis in the retina depends on the influx of serum retinol from the circulation into the RPE. Formation of the tertiary retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4)-transthyretin-retinol complex in the serum is required for this influx. Herein, we report the pharmacological effects of the non-retinoid RBP4 antagonist, BPN-14136. BPN-14136 dosing in the Abca4-/- mouse model of increased lipofuscinogenesis significantly reduced serum RBP4 levels and inhibited bisretinoid synthesis, and this inhibition correlated with a partial reduction in visual cycle retinoids such as retinaldehydes serving as bisretinoid precursors. BPN-14136 administration at doses inducing maximal serum RBP4 reduction did not produce changes in the rate of the visual cycle, consistent with minimal changes in dark adaptation. Abca4-/- mice exhibited dysregulation of the complement system in the retina, and BPN-14136 administration normalized the retinal levels of proinflammatory complement cascade components such as complement factors D and H, C-reactive protein, and C3. We conclude that BPN-14136 has several beneficial characteristics, combining inhibition of bisretinoid synthesis and reduction in retinaldehydes with normalization of the retinal complement system.

Complete sequencing of the ABCA4 locus in STGD1 patients identifies two expected disease-causing alleles in \u223c75% of patients and only one mutation in \u223c15% of patients. Recently, many possibly pathogenic variants in deep intronic sequences of ABCA4 have been identified in the latter group. We extended our analyses of deep intronic ABCA4 variants and determined that one of these, c.4253+43G>A (rs61754045), is present in 29/1155 (2.6%) of STGD1 patients. The variant is found at statistically significantly higher frequency in patients with only one pathogenic ABCA4 allele, 23/160 (14.38%), MAF = 0.072, compared to MAF = 0.013 in all STGD1 cases and MAF = 0.006 in the matching general population (P < 1 \u00d7 10-7). The variant, which is not predicted to have any effect on splicing, is the first reported intronic \"extremely hypomorphic allele\" in the ABCA4 locus; that is, it is pathogenic only when in trans with a loss-of-function ABCA4 allele. It results in a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by late onset of symptoms and foveal sparing. In \u223c70% of cases the variant was allelic with the c.6006-609T>A (rs575968112) variant, which was deemed nonpathogenic. Another rare deep intronic variant, c.5196+1056A>G (rs886044749), found in 5/834 (0.6%) of STGD1 cases is, conversely, a severe allele.

The short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF) of fundus flecks in recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) suggests a connection to these fluorophores. Through multimodal imaging, we sought to elucidate this link. Flecks observed in SW-AF images often colocalized with foci exhibiting reduced or absent near-infrared autofluorescence signal, the source of which is melanin in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. With serial imaging, changes in near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) preceded the onset of fleck hyperautofluorescence in SW-AF images and fleck profiles in NIR-AF images tended to be larger. Flecks in SW-AF and NIR-AF images also corresponded to hyperreflective lesions traversing photoreceptor-attributable bands in horizontal SD-OCT scans. The hyperreflective lesions interrupted adjacent OCT reflectivity bands and were associated with thinning of the outer nuclear layer. These SD-OCT findings are attributable to photoreceptor cell degeneration. Progressive increases and decreases in the SW-AF intensity of flecks were evident in color-coded quantitative fundus autofluorescence maps. In some cases, flecks appeared to spread radially from the fovea to approximately 8\u00b0 of eccentricity, beyond which a circumferential spread characterized the distribution. Since the NIR-AF signal is derived from melanin and loss of this autofluorescence is indicative of RPE atrophy, the SW-AF of flecks cannot be accounted for by bisretinoid lipofuscin in RPE. Instead, we suggest that the bisretinoid serving as the source of the SW-AF signal, resides in photoreceptors, the cell that is also the site of bisretinoid synthesis.", "Keywords": ["ABCA4", "SD-OCT", "bisretinoid", "fundus autofluorescence", "recessive Stargardt disease", "retinal pigment epithelium", "spectral domain optical coherence tomography"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Lipofuscin", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Optical Imaging", "Photoreceptor Cells", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Stargardt Disease", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Zinc Phosphate Cement"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maarjaliis", "Last Name": "Paavo", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of neuroscience research", "PubDate": "2019Jan"}, {"PMID": "29686068", "Title": "Recurrent structural variation, clustered sites of selection, and disease risk for the complement factor H (CFH) gene family.", "Abstract": "Structural variation and single-nucleotide variation of the complement factor H (CFH) gene family underlie several complex genetic diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (AHUS).

Whole-genome sequencing can identify most of the non-coding variants, but their interpretation is still very challenging, in particular when the relevant gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Deep-intronic variants in ABCA4 have been associated with autosomal-recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1), but the exact pathogenic mechanism is unknown. By generating photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) from fibroblasts obtained from individuals with STGD1, we demonstrated that two neighboring deep-intronic ABCA4 variants (c.4539+2001G>A and c.4539+2028C>T) result in a retina-specific 345-nt pseudoexon insertion (predicted protein change: p.Arg1514Leufs\u221736), likely due to the creation of exonic enhancers. Administration of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the 345-nt pseudoexon can significantly rescue the splicing defect observed in PPCs of two individuals with these mutations. Intriguingly, an AON that is complementary to c.4539+2001G>A rescued the splicing defect only in PPCs derived from an individual with STGD1 with this but not the other mutation, demonstrating the high specificity of AONs. In addition, a single AON molecule rescued splicing defects associated with different neighboring mutations, thereby providing new strategies for the treatment of persons with STGD1.

Due to extensive genetic heterogeneity, observed variant-associated phenotypes can manifest tremendous variability of expression. Furthermore, the high carrier frequency of pathogenic ABCA4 alleles in the general population (~1:20) often results in pseudo-dominant inheritance patterns further complicating the diagnosis and characterization of affected individuals. This study describes a genotype/phenotype analysis of an unusual family with multiple macular disease phenotypes spanning across two generations and segregating four distinct ABCA4 mutant alleles. Complete sequencing of ABCA4 discovered two known missense mutations, p.C54Y and p.G1961E. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a large novel deletion combined with a small insertion, c.6148-698_c.6670del/insTGTGCACCTCCCTAG, and complete sequencing of the entire ABCA4 genomic locus uncovered a new deep intronic variant, c.302+68C>T. Patients with the p.G1961E mutation had the mildest, confined maculopathy phenotype with peripheral flecks while those with all other mutant allele combinations exhibited a more advanced stage of generalized retinal and choriocapillaris atrophy. This family epitomizes the clinical and genetic complexity of ABCA4-associated diseases. It contained variants from all classes of mutations, in the coding region, deep intronic, both single nucleotide variants and copy number variants that accounted for varying phenotypes segregating in an apparent dominant fashion. Unequivocally defining disease-associated alleles in the ABCA4 locus requires a multifaceted approach that includes advanced mutation detection methods and a thorough analysis of clinical phenotypes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Adult", "Aged", "Comparative Genomic Hybridization", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Electroretinography", "Female", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Macula Lutea", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Stargardt Disease"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yajing", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jana", "Last Name": "Zernant", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Srilaxmi", "Last Name": "Bearelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Lupski", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. rla22@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Human genetics", "PubDate": "2016Jan"}, {"PMID": "26312453", "Title": "Reply: To PMID 25545482.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chloride Channels", "Eye Diseases, Hereditary", "Eye Proteins", "Humans", "Mutation", "Retinal Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adrian T", "Last Name": "Fung", "Affiliation": "*Vitreous-Retina-Macula Consultants of New York and the LuEsther T.

To further expand our knowledge of the genetic architecture of the disease, we pursued a candidate gene approach assessing 25 genes and a total of 109 variants. Of these, synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17810398 located in death-associated protein-like 1 (DAPL1) was found to be associated with AMD in a joint analysis of 3,229 cases and 2,835 controls from five studies [combined PADJ = 1.15 \u00d7 10(-6), OR 1.332 (1.187-1.496)]. This association was characterized by a highly significant sex difference (Pdiff = 0.0032) in that it was clearly confined to females with genome-wide significance [PADJ = 2.62 \u00d7 10(-8), OR 1.541 (1.324-1.796); males: PADJ = 0.382, OR 1.084 (0.905-1.298)]. By targeted resequencing of risk and non-risk associated haplotypes in the DAPL1 locus, we identified additional potentially functional risk variants, namely a common 897-bp deletion and a SNP predicted to affect a putative binding site of an exonic splicing enhancer. We show that the risk haplotype correlates with a reduced retinal transcript level of two, less frequent, non-canonical DAPL1 isoforms. DAPL1 plays a role in epithelial differentiation and may be involved in apoptotic processes thereby suggesting a possible novel pathway in AMD pathogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Apoptosis", "Case-Control Studies", "Cell Differentiation", "DNA, Complementary", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Isoforms", "Retina", "Risk", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Sequence Deletion", "Sex Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Felix", "Last Name": "Grassmann", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Regensburg, Franz-Josef-Strauss-Allee 11, 93053, Regensburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ulrike", "Last Name": "Friedrich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sascha", "Last Name": "Fauser", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tina", "Last Name": "Schick", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Milenkovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Heidi L", "Last Name": "Schulz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claudia N", "Last Name": "von Strachwitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Bettecken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Lichtner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Meitinger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Arend", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Armin", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christos", "Last Name": "Haritoglou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guenther", "Last Name": "Rudolph", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Usha", "Last Name": "Chakravarthy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuliana", "Last Name": "Silvestri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gareth J", "Last Name": "McKay", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Freitag-Wolf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Krawczak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "R Theodore", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Merriam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joanna E", "Last Name": "Merriam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Iris M", "Last Name": "Heid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bernhard H F", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuromolecular medicine", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "25573774", "Title": "Gene Therapy of ABCA4-Associated Diseases.", "Abstract": "The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, ABCA4 (ABCR), was characterized in 1997 as the causal gene for autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1).

ABCA4 functions as an important transporter (or \"flippase\") of vitamin A derivatives in the visual cycle. Several ways to alleviate the effects of the defective ABCA4 protein, which cause accumulation of 11-cis and all-trans-retinal in photoreceptors and lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium, have been proposed.

As part of our continued efforts to define genetic causes of macular degeneration, we performed whole exome sequencing in four individuals of a two-generation family with autosomal dominant maculopathy and identified a rare variant p.Glu1144Lys in Fibrillin 2 (FBN2), a glycoprotein of the elastin-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Sanger sequencing validated the segregation of this variant in the complete pedigree, including two additional affected and one unaffected individual. Sequencing of 192 maculopathy patients revealed additional rare variants, predicted to disrupt FBN2 function. We then undertook additional studies to explore the relationship of FBN2 to macular disease. We show that FBN2 localizes to Bruch's membrane and its expression appears to be reduced in aging and AMD eyes, prompting us to examine its relationship with AMD. We detect suggestive association of a common FBN2 non-synonymous variant, rs154001 (p.Val965Ile) with AMD in 10 337 cases and 11 174 controls (OR = 1.10; P-value = 3.79 \u00d7 10(-5)). Thus, it appears that rare and common variants in a single gene--FBN2--can contribute to Mendelian and complex forms of macular degeneration. Our studies provide genetic evidence for a key role of elastin microfibers and Bruch's membrane in maintaining blood-retina homeostasis and establish the importance of studying orphan diseases for understanding more common clinical phenotypes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Bruch Membrane", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Exome", "Extracellular Matrix", "Fibrillin-2", "Fibrillins", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Variation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Microfilament Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Stability", "Retina", "Sequence Alignment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rinki", "Last Name": "Ratnapriya", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology Neurodegeneration and Repair Laboratory."}, {"First Name": "Xiaowei", "Last Name": "Zhan", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics and."}, {"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Fariss", "Affiliation": "Biological Imaging Core."}, {"First Name": "Kari E", "Last Name": "Branham", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Zipprer", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology Neurodegeneration and Repair Laboratory."}, {"First Name": "Christina F", "Last Name": "Chakarova", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, UCL-Institute of Ophthalmology, Bath Street, London EC1V 9EL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Yuri V", "Last Name": "Sergeev", "Affiliation": "Ophthalmic Genetics and Visual Function Branch."}, {"First Name": "Maria M", "Last Name": "Campos", "Affiliation": "Biological Imaging Core."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad", "Last Name": "Othman", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "James S", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology Neurodegeneration and Repair Laboratory."}, {"First Name": "Arvydas", "Last Name": "Maminishkis", "Affiliation": "Section of Epithelial and Retinal Physiology and Disease."}, {"First Name": "Naushin H", "Last Name": "Waseem", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, UCL-Institute of Ophthalmology, Bath Street, London EC1V 9EL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology Neurodegeneration and Repair Laboratory."}, {"First Name": "Harsha K", "Last Name": "Rajasimha", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology Neurodegeneration and Repair Laboratory."}, {"First Name": "Albert O", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Institute for Molecular Biology, University of Oregon and Oregon Retina, Eugene, OR 97401, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Lotery", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Barbara E", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and, Public Health, Madison, WI 53726, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barbara J", "Last Name": "Truitt", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bingshan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Genetics Research, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debra A", "Last Name": "Schaumberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02215, USA, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA."}, {"First Name": "Denise J", "Last Name": "Morgan", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaux A", "Last Name": "Morrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Souied", "Affiliation": "H\u00f4pital Intercommunal de Cr\u00e9teil, H\u00f4pital Henri Mondor -

The expression of cadherin 5 (CDH5), the major cell-cell adhesion molecule in vascular endothelium, was downregulated by corticosteroids which may increase permeability of choroidal vasculature, leading to fluid leakage under the retina.
