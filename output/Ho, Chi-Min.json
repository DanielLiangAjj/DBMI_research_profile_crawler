[{"PMID": "36892278", "Title": "mSphere of Influence: the Young Investigators in Parasitology Meeting-Investing in the Future of Our Scientific Community by Lifting Up and Connecting Junior Faculty.", "Abstract": "Drs. Monica Mugnier and Chi-Min Ho work in the field of parasitology. In this mSphere of Influence article, they share their experience as cochairs of the Young Investigators in Parasitology (YIPs) meeting, a 2-day biennial meeting for new PIs in parasitology. Setting up a new lab can be a daunting task. YIPS is designed to make the transition a little easier. YIPs is both a crash course in the skills needed to run a successful research lab and a way to build community among new group leaders in parasitology. In this perspective, they describe YIPs and the benefit it has had on the molecular parasitology community. They also provide some tips for building and running a meeting like YIPs, in the hopes that other fields might replicate their model.", "Keywords": ["junior faculty", "meetings", "new PI", "starting a new lab"], "MeSH terms": ["Parasitology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Monica R", "Last Name": "Mugnier", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Min", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2023Apr20"}, {"PMID": "34887149", "Title": "Structural parasitology of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.", "Abstract": "The difficulty of faithfully recapitulating malarial protein complexes in heterologous expression systems has long impeded structural study for much of the Plasmodium falciparum proteome. However, recent advances in single-particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) now enable structure determination at atomic resolution with significantly reduced requirements for both sample quantity and purity. Combined with recent developments in gene editing, these advances open the door to structure determination and structural proteomics of macromolecular complexes enriched directly from P. falciparum parasites. Furthermore, the combination of cryoEM with the rapidly emerging use of in situ cryo electron tomography (cryoET) to directly visualize ultrastructures and protein complexes in the native cellular context will yield exciting new insights into the molecular machinery underpinning malaria parasite biology and pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["cryoEM", "endogenous structure determination", "in situ cryoET", "malaria"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Malaria", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Parasites", "Plasmodium falciparum"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leonie", "Last Name": "Anton", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Cobb", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Min", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Here, we enrich the endogenous RhopH complex in a native soluble form, comprising RhopH2, CLAG3.1, and RhopH3, directly from parasite cell lysates and determine its atomic structure using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), mass spectrometry, and the cryoID program. CLAG3.1 is positioned between RhopH2 and RhopH3, which both share substantial binding interfaces with CLAG3.1 but make minimal contacts with each other. The forces stabilizing individual subunits include 13 intramolecular disulfide bonds. Notably, CLAG3.1 residues 1210 to 1223, previously predicted to constitute a transmembrane helix, are embedded within a helical bundle formed by residues 979 to 1289 near the C terminus of CLAG3.1. Buried in the core of the RhopH complex and largely shielded from solvent, insertion of this putative transmembrane helix into the erythrocyte membrane would likely require a large conformational rearrangement. Given the unusually high disulfide content of the complex, it is possible that such a rearrangement could be initiated by the breakage of allosteric disulfide bonds, potentially triggered by interactions at the erythrocyte membrane. This first direct observation of an exported Plasmodium falciparum transmembrane protein-in a soluble, trafficking state and with atomic details of buried putative membrane-insertion helices-offers insights into the assembly and trafficking of RhopH and other parasite-derived complexes to the erythrocyte membrane. Our study demonstrates the potential the endogenous structural proteomics approach holds for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of hard-to-isolate complexes in their native, functional forms.", "Keywords": ["cryo-EM", "endogenous structural proteomics", "malaria", "trafficking"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Membrane Permeability", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Erythrocyte Membrane", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Nutrients", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protein Conformation", "Proteomics", "Protozoan Proteins", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chi-Min", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; chi-min.ho@columbia.edu Hong.Zhou@UCLA.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Jih", "Affiliation": "California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095."}, {"First Name": "Mason", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095."}, {"First Name": "Xiaorun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095."}, {"First Name": "Daniel E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110."}, {"First Name": "Josh R", "Last Name": "Beck", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011."}, {"First Name": "Z Hong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095; chi-min.ho@columbia.edu Hong.Zhou@UCLA.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2021Aug31"}, {"PMID": "33793667", "Title": "Transport mechanisms at the malaria parasite-host cell interface.", "Abstract": "Obligate intracellular malaria parasites reside within a vacuolar compartment generated during invasion which is the principal interface between pathogen and host. To subvert their host cell and support their metabolism, these parasites coordinate a range of transport activities at this membrane interface that are critically important to parasite survival and virulence, including nutrient import, waste efflux, effector protein export, and uptake of host cell cytosol. Here, we review our current understanding of the transport mechanisms acting at the malaria parasite vacuole during the blood and liver-stages of development with a particular focus on recent advances in our understanding of effector protein translocation into the host cell by the Plasmodium Translocon of EXported proteins (PTEX) and small molecule transport by the PTEX membrane-spanning pore EXP2.

We present here a bottom-up endogenous structural proteomics approach whereby near-atomic-resolution cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) maps are reconstructed ab initio from unidentified protein complexes enriched directly from the endogenous cellular milieu, followed by identification and atomic modeling of the proteins. The proteins in each complex are identified using cryoID, a program we developed to identify proteins in ab initio cryoEM maps. As a proof of principle, we applied this approach to the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum, an organism that has resisted conventional structural-biology approaches, to obtain atomic models of multiple protein complexes implicated in intraerythrocytic survival of the parasite.
