[{"PMID": "38938840", "Title": "The Causal-Benefit Model to Prevent Cardiovascular Events.", "Abstract": "Selecting individuals for preventive lipid-lowering therapy is presently governed by the 10-year risk model. Once a prespecified level of cardiovascular disease risk is equaled or exceeded, individuals become eligible for preventive lipid-lowering therapy. A key limitation of this model is that only a small minority of individuals below the age of 65 years are eligible for therapy. However, just under one-half of all cardiovascular disease events occur below this age. Additionally, in many, the disease that caused their events after 65 years of age developed and progressed before 65 years of age. The causal-benefit model of prevention identifies individuals based both on their risk and the estimated benefit from lowering atherogenic apoB lipoprotein levels. Adopting the causal-benefit model would increase the number of younger subjects eligible for preventive treatment, would increase the total number of cardiovascular disease events prevented at virtually the same number to treat, and would be cost-effective.", "Keywords": ["cardiovascular prevention", "causal-benefit model", "risk model"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ciaran", "Last Name": "Kohli-Lynch", "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Thanassoulis", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Mike and Valeria Rosenbloom Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Pencina", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Mike and Valeria Rosenbloom Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Sehayek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Mike and Valeria Rosenbloom Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Karol", "Last Name": "Pencina", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Mike and Valeria Rosenbloom Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Division of General Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allan D", "Last Name": "Sniderman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Mike and Valeria Rosenbloom Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}], "Journal": "JACC.

High blood pressure is the most important preventable risk factor for CVD and deaths, worldwide (10.8 million deaths annually). In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched the Global Hearts initiative to support governments in their quest to prevent and control CVD. HEARTS is the core technical package of the initiative and takes a public health approach to treating hypertension and other CVD risk factors at the primary health care level. The HEARTS Partner Forum, led by WHO, brings together the following 11 partner organizations: American Heart Association (AHA), Center for Chronic Disease Control (CCDC), International Society of Hypertension (ISH), International Society of Nephrology (ISN), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Resolve to Save Lives (RTSL), US CDC, World Hypertension League (WHL), World Heart Federation (WHF) and World Stroke Organization (WSO). The partners support countries in their implementation of the HEARTS technical package in various ways, including providing technical expertise, catalytic funding, capacity building and evidence generation and dissemination. HEARTS has demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a public health approach, with more than seven million people already on treatment for hypertension using a simple, algorithmic HEARTS approach. Additionally, HEARTS has demonstrated the feasibility of using hypertension as a pathfinder to universal health coverage and should be a key intervention of all basic benefit packages. The partner forum continues to find ways to expand support and reinvigorate enthusiasm and attention on preventing CVD. Proposed future HEARTS Partner Forum activities are related to more concrete information sharing between partners and among countries, expanded areas of partner synergy, support for implementation, capacity building, and advocacy with country ministries of health, professional societies, academy and civil societies organizations. Advancing toward the shared goals of the HEARTS partners will require a more formal, structured approach to the forum and include goals, targets and published reports. In this way, the HEARTS Partner Forum will mirror successful global partnerships on communicable diseases and assist countries in reducing CVD mortality and achieving global sustainable development goals (SDGs).", "Keywords": ["cardiovascular diseases", "global health", "health systems", "hypertension", "implementation", "partnerships", "primary healthcare", "universal health coverage"], "MeSH terms": ["United States", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Taskeen", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Department of Non-communicable Diseases, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pablo", "Last Name": "Perel", "Affiliation": "Centre for Global Chronic Conditions, Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paul K", "Last Name": "Whelton", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Brainin", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Neurology, Danube University, Krems, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Valery", "Last Name": "Feigin", "Affiliation": "World Stroke Organization, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Deliana", "Last Name": "Kostova", "Affiliation": "Division of Global Health Protection, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health, Atlanta, GA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Richter", "Affiliation": "Division of Global Health Protection, Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health, Atlanta, GA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Ordunez", "Affiliation": "Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization, Washington, DC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anselm", "Last Name": "Hennis", "Affiliation": "Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization, Washington, DC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daniel T", "Last Name": "Lackland", "Affiliation": "World Hypertension League, New Orleans, LA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Slim", "Last Name": "Slama", "Affiliation": "Department of Non-communicable Diseases, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Pineiro", "Affiliation": "World Heart Federation, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Sheila", "Last Name": "Martins", "Affiliation": "World Stroke Organization, Geneva, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Bryan", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "International Society of Hypertension, Essex, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Leonard", "Last Name": "Hofstra", "Affiliation": "Amsterdam UMC-Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Renu", "Last Name": "Garg", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bente", "Last Name": "Mikkelsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Non-communicable Diseases, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in public health", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37487684", "Title": "Landscape of team-based care to manage hypertension: results from two surveys in low/middle-income countries.", "Abstract": "Team-based care is essential for improving hypertension outcomes in low-resource settings.

Task-sharing with pharmacies, typically the first point of contact for rural populations, can bridge the gap in access to formal care and improve health outcomes. In this study, we implemented a hypertension care program involving task-sharing with twenty private pharmacies between November 2020 and April 2021 in two blocks of Bihar, India. Pharmacists conducted free hypertension screening, and a trained physician offered free consultations at the pharmacy. We calculated the number of subjects screened, initiated on treatment (enrolled) and the change in blood pressure using the data collected through the program application. Of the 3403 subjects screened at pharmacies, 1415 either reported having a history of hypertension or had elevated blood pressure during screening. Of these, 371 (26.22%) were enrolled in the program. Of these, 129 (34.8%) made at least one follow-up visit. For these subjects, the adjusted average difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the screening and follow-up visits was -11.53 (-16.95 to -6.11, 95% CI) and -4.68 (-8.53 to -0.82, 95% CI) mmHg, respectively. The adjusted odds of blood pressure being under control in this group during follow-up visits compared to screening visit was 7.07 (1.29 to 12.85, 95% CI).

While RDD is gaining popularity in clinical studies, there are limited real-world studies examining the performance on estimating known trial casual effects. The goal of this paper is to estimate the effect of statins on myocardial infarction (MI) using RDD and compare with propensity score matching and Cox regression. For the RDD, we leveraged a 2008 UK guideline that recommends statins if a patient's 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score\u2009>\u200920%. We used UK electronic health record data from the Health Improvement Network on 49,242 patients aged 65\u2009+\u2009in 2008-2011 (baseline) without a history of CVD and no statin use in the two years prior to the CVD risk score assessment. Both the regression discontinuity (n\u2009=\u200919,432) and the propensity score matched populations (n\u2009=\u200924,814) demonstrated good balance of confounders. Using RDD, the adjusted point estimate for statins on MI was in the protective direction and similar to the statin effect observed in clinical trials, although the confidence interval included the null (HR\u2009=\u20090.8, 95% CI 0.4, 1.4). Conversely, the adjusted estimates using propensity score matching and Cox regression remained in the harmful direction: HR\u2009=\u20092.42 (95% CI 1.96, 2.99) and 2.51 (2.12, 2.97). RDD appeared superior to other methods in replicating the known protective effect of statins with MI, although precision was poor.

Many people in New York City (NYC) have low FV intake and high SSB consumption, partly due to high cost of fresh FVs and low cost of and easy access to SSBs. A potential implementation of an SSB tax and an FV subsidy program could result in substantial public health and economic benefits. We used a validated microsimulation model for predicting CVD events to estimate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of SSB taxes, FV subsidies, and funding FV subsidies with an SSB tax in NYC. Population demographics and health profiles were estimated using data from the NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Policy effects and price elasticity were derived from recent meta-analyses. We found that funding FV subsidies with an SSB tax was projected to be the most cost-effective policy from the healthcare sector perspective. From the societal perspective, the most cost-effective policy was SSB taxes. All policy scenarios could prevent more CVD events and save more healthcare costs among men compared to women, and among Black vs. White adults. Public health practitioners and policymakers may want to consider adopting this combination of policy actions, while weighing feasibility considerations and other unintended consequences.",

Adoption of drug and dose-specific treatment protocols recommended by the World Health Organization-HEARTS Initiative is key for hypertension control programs in LMICs. We estimated the annual medication cost per patient using three such protocols (protocol-1 and protocol-2 with Amlodipine, Telmisartan, using add-on doses and different drug orders, adding Chlorthalidone; protocol-3 with a single-pill combination (SPC) of Amlodipine/Telmisartan with dose up-titration, and addition of Chlorthalidone, if required) in India. The medication cost was simulated with different hypertension control assumptions for each protocol and calculated based on prices in the public and private sectors in India. The estimated annual medication cost per patient for protocol-1 and protocol-2 was $33.88-58.44 and $51.57-68.83 for protocol-3 in the private sector. The medication cost was lower in the generic stores ($5.78-9.57 for protocol-1 and protocol-2, and $7.35-9.89 for protocol-3). The medication cost for patients was the lowest ($2.05-3.89 for protocol-1 and protocol-2, and $2.94-3.98 for protocol-3) in the public sector. At less than $4 per patient per annum, scaling up a hypertension control program with specific treatment protocols is a potentially cost-effective public health intervention. Expanding low-cost generic retail networks would extend affordability in the private sector.

All hypertensive patients received free drug vouchers, baseline serum creatinine, adherence support, self-management counseling and follow-up calls. In the intensive-ward, project supported hub agents facilitated uptake of services. A total of 13,184 hypertensive patients were registered from January 2019 to February 2020.

Despite this, there is no national screening program in the United States to identify individuals with FH or likely pathogenic FH genetic variants. Methods and Results The clinical characteristics and FH variant status of 49\u00a0738 UK Biobank participants were used to develop a regression model to predict the probability of having any FH variants. The regression model and modified Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria were applied to 39\u00a0790 adult participants (aged \u226520\u00a0years) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the yield of FH screening programs using Dutch Lipid Clinic Network clinical criteria alone (excluding genetic variant status), genetic testing alone, or combining clinical criteria with genetic testing. The regression model accurately predicted FH variant status in UK Biobank participants (observed prevalence, 0.27%; predicted, 0.26%; area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve, 0.88). In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the estimated yield per 1000 individuals screened (95% CI) was 3.7 (3.0-4.6) FH cases with the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network clinical criteria alone, 3.8 (2.7-5.1) cases with genetic testing alone, and 6.6 (5.3-8.0) cases by combining clinical criteria with genetic testing. In young adults aged 20 to 39\u00a0years, using clinical criteria alone was estimated to yield 1.3 (95% CI, 0.6-2.5) FH cases per 1000 individuals screened, which was estimated to increase to 4.2 (95% CI, 2.6-6.4) FH cases when combining clinical criteria with genetic testing.

These Roadmaps identify potential roadblocks and their solutions to improve the prevention, detection and management of cardiovascular diseases and provide a generic global framework available for local adaptation. A first Roadmap on raised blood pressure was published in 2015. Since then, advances in hypertension have included the publication of new clinical guidelines (AHA/ACC; ESC; ESH/ISH); the launch of the WHO Global HEARTS Initiative in 2016 and the associated Resolve to Save Lives (RTSL) initiative in 2017; the inclusion of single-pill combinations on the WHO Essential Medicines' list as well as various advances in technology, in particular telemedicine and mobile health. Given the substantial benefit accrued from effective interventions in the management of hypertension and their potential for scalability in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), the WHF has now revisited and updated the 'Roadmap for raised BP' as 'Roadmap for hypertension' by incorporating new developments in science and policy. Even though cost-effective lifestyle and medical interventions to prevent and manage hypertension exist, uptake is still low, particularly in resource-poor areas. This Roadmap examined the roadblocks pertaining to both the demand side (demographic and socio-economic factors, knowledge and beliefs, social relations, norms, and traditions) and the supply side (health systems resources and processes) along the patient pathway to propose a range of possible solutions to overcoming them. Those include the development of population-wide prevention and control programmes; the implementation of opportunistic screening and of out-of-office blood pressure measurements; the strengthening of primary care and a greater focus on task sharing and team-based care; the delivery of people-centred care and stronger patient and carer education; and the facilitation of adherence to treatment. All of the above are dependent upon the availability and effective distribution of good quality, evidence-based, inexpensive BP-lowering agents.", "Keywords": ["WHF", "World Heart Federation", "hypertension", "policy", "raised BP", "raised blood pressure"], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Mass Screening"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Panniyammakal", "Last Name": "Jeemon", "Affiliation": "Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandum, IN."}, {"First Name": "Tania", "Last Name": "S\u00e9verin", "Affiliation": "World Heart Federation, Geneva, CH."}, {"First Name": "Celso", "Last Name": "Amodeo", "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP), S\u00e3o Paulo, BR."}, {"First Name": "Dina", "Last Name": "Balabanova", "Affiliation": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, GB."}, {"First Name": "Norm R C", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, University of Calgary, CA."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Gaita", "Affiliation": "Universitatea de Medicina si Farmacie Victor Babes, Timisoara, RO."}, {"First Name": "Kazuomi", "Last Name": "Kario", "Affiliation": "Jichi Medical University School of Medicine, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, JP."}, {"First Name": "Taskeen", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "University of Pretoria, ZA."}, {"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Melifonwu", "Affiliation": "Stroke Action Nigeria, Onitsha, Anambra State, NG."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Columbia University and Resolve to Save Lives, New York, US."}, {"First Name": "Elijah", "Last Name": "Ogola", "Affiliation": "University of Nairobi, KE."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Ordunez", "Affiliation": "Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC, US."}, {"First Name": "Pablo", "Last Name": "Perel", "Affiliation": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and World Heart Federation, Geneva, GB."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Pi\u00f1eiro", "Affiliation": "Universidad de Buenos Aires, AR."}, {"First Name": "Fausto J", "Last Name": "Pinto", "Affiliation": "Santa Maria University Hospital (CHULN), CAML, CCUL, Lisboa, PT."}, {"First Name": "Aletta E", "Last Name": "Schutte", "Affiliation": "University of New South Wales; The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney, AU."}, {"First Name": "Fernando Stuardo", "Last Name": "Wyss", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Technology and Services of Guatemala - CARDIOSOLUTIONS, Guatemala, GT."}, {"First Name": "Lijing L", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Duke Kunshan University, Kunshan, CN."}, {"First Name": "Neil R", "Last Name": "Poulter", "Affiliation": "Imperial College London, London, GB."}, {"First Name": "Dorairaj", "Last Name": "Prabhakaran", "Affiliation": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, GB."}], "Journal": "Global heart", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34692383", "Title": "Patient-Centered, Sustainable Hypertension Care: The Case for Adopting a Differentiated Service Delivery Model for Hypertension Services in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.", "Abstract": "Expanding hypertension services in low- and middle-income countries requires efficient and effective service delivery approaches that meet the needs and expectations of people living with hypertension within the resource constraints of existing national health systems.

Among 15 randomized controlled trials in a US Food and Drug Administration regulatory review database, dyskalemia events were reported by five trials (24 treatment arms, 11,030 subjects, 8-week median follow up time). The five trials evaluated monotherapy (ARB or HCTZ) alongside dual (ARB\u2009+\u2009HCTZ, ARB\u2009+\u2009CCB, or HCTZ\u2009+\u2009CCB) or triple fixed-dose combinations (ARB\u2009+\u2009CCB\u2009+\u2009HCTZ). Hypo- and hyper-kalemia rates were analyzed jointly to account for correlation. Significant drug class, drug, or dose effects were included in the final model. Effect on various drug- and dose combinations on dyskalemia risk were simulated and compared with model-estimated placebo arm dyskalemia risk. After a typical follow-up of 8 weeks, fixed-dose combinations of ARB with a high dose (25\u2009mg) of HCTZ were associated with a higher hypokalemia risk difference (RD) from placebo (e.g.,Valsartan\u2009+\u2009HCTZ: 2.52%[95%CIs:1.17, 4.38%]). However, when ARB was combined with a lower, 12.5\u2009mg dose of HCTZ, hypokalemia RD from placebo was not significant (Valsartan\u2009+\u2009HCTZ: -0.03%[-0.80, 0.71%]). ARB monotherapy raised hyperkalemia RD from placebo (1.3%[0.3, 3.6%]). Hyperkalemia risk was not appreciably higher than placebo for any FDC that combined ARB with HCTZ (Valsartan\u2009+\u2009HCTZ: 0.06%[-1.48, 1.64%]).

We projected life expectancy after observed follow-up in SPRINT using SPRINT-eligible participants in the NHLBI-PCS (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pooled Cohorts Study). Methods and Results We used propensity scores to weight SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants to resemble SPRINT participants. In SPRINT participants, we estimated in-trial survival (<4\u00a0years) using a time-based flexible parametric survival model. In SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants, we estimated posttrial survival (\u22654\u00a0years) using an age-based flexible parametric survival model and applied the formula to SPRINT participants to predict posttrial survival. We projected overall life expectancy for each SPRINT participant and compared it to parametric regression (eg, Gompertz) projections based on SPRINT data alone. We included 8584 SPRINT and 10\u00a0593 SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants. After propensity weighting, mean (SD) age was 67.9 (9.4) and 68.2 (8.8) years, and 35.5% and 37.6% were women in SPRINT and NHLBI-PCS, respectively. Using the NHLBI-PCS-based method, projected mean life expectancy from randomization was 21.0 (7.4) years with intensive and 19.1 (7.2) years with standard treatment. Using the Gompertz regression, life expectancy was 11.2 (2.3) years with intensive and 10.5 (2.2) years with standard treatment. Conclusions Combining SPRINT and NHLBI-PCS observed data likely offers a more realistic estimate of life expectancy than parametrically extrapolating SPRINT data alone.

Combinations of anti-hypertensive medicines are available as Single Pill Combinations (SPCs) or Single Agent Pills (SAPs). SPCs of two or more anti-hypertensive medicines facilitate simpler dosing schedules, decrease pill burden, increase adherence to medicine, and simplify procurement and distribution. Despite this, equivalent combinations of separate pills (SAPs) are often prescribed instead of SPCs under the assumption that SAPs are priced lower. This study compared prices of anti-hypertensive SPCs and equivalent SAPs in the private health care sector of India. High sales volume anti-hypertensive SPCs and SAPs were selected from 2018 private sector pharmaceutical sales data. SPCs and SAPs price information was collected from online pharmacy websites between November 2019 and January 2020. Anti-hypertensive SPCs represent approximately 39.1% of India's private sector anti-hypertensive drug market. Multiple manufacturers produce the same top-selling SPCs, suggesting a viable and competitive market. A comparison of SPCs and SAPs across different manufacturers showed that the lowest prices of both SPCs and the sum of component SAPs were nearly identical across different manufacturers. An analysis of dual-drug SPCs and SAPs by the same manufacturer showed that most manufacturers (five of six) had priced their SPCs higher than SAPs. These observations suggest that the price of SPCs could be lowered to match the combined price of the component SAPs, and manufacturing costs and market forces do not present a barrier to the implementation of anti-hypertensive SPCs.", "Keywords": ["India", "hypertension", "medicines", "price", "private sector"], "MeSH terms": ["Antihypertensive Agents", "Drugs, Essential", "Health Care Sector", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Hypertension", "India", "Private Sector", "Public Sector"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sagri", "Last Name": "Negi", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dinesh", "Last Name": "Neupane", "Affiliation": "Lancet Commission on Hypertension Group, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Swagata Kumar", "Last Name": "Sahoo", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tanushree", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Analytics, IQVIA Consulting and Information Services, New Delhi, India."}, {"First Name": "Kishan", "Last Name": "Swaroop", "Affiliation": "Department of Analytics, IQVIA Consulting and Information Services, New Delhi, India."}, {"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bhawna", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anupam Khungar", "Last Name": "Pathni", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)", "PubDate": "2021Apr"}, {"PMID": "33309175", "Title": "Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors, 1990-2019: Update From the GBD 2019 Study.", "Abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of global mortality and a major contributor to disability.

GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.

The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019.

We estimated the risk for recurrent ASCVD events among adults meeting the definition of very high risk by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status in a US integrated healthcare system. Methods and Results The study cohort included Kaiser Permanente Southern California members aged \u226521\u00a0years with a history of clinical ASCVD on September 30, 2009. Very high risk for recurrent ASCVD was defined by a history of \u22652 major ASCVD events or a history of 1 major event along with \u22652 high-risk conditions. Patients were followed through 2015 for a first recurrent ASCVD event. Of 77\u00a0101 patients with ASCVD, 50.8% met the definition for very high risk. Among patients meeting the definition of very high risk, recurrent ASCVD rates were higher in older (>75\u00a0years) versus younger patients (21-40\u00a0years) (sex-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI] 1.85; 1.23-2.79), non-Hispanic Black patients versus non-Hispanic White patients (age-, sex-adjusted HR, 1.32; 1.23-1.41), those who lived in neighborhoods with lower (<$35k) versus higher annual household income (\u2265$80k) (HR, 1.20; 1.11-1.30), or with lower (\u226531.2%) versus higher education levels (<8.8% high school or lower) (HR, 1.26; 1.19-1.34).

As a result, there is growing interest in developing statistical tools for estimating optimal ITRs in evidence-based research. In health economic perspectives, policy makers consider the tradeoff between health gains and incremental costs of interventions to set priorities and allocate resources. However, most work on ITRs has focused on maximizing the effectiveness of treatment without considering costs. In this paper, we jointly consider the impact of effectiveness and cost on treatment decisions and define ITRs under a composite-outcome setting, so that we identify the most cost-effective ITR that accounts for individual-level heterogeneity through direct optimization. In particular, we propose a decision-tree-based statistical learning algorithm that uses a net-monetary-benefit-based reward to provide nonparametric estimations of the optimal ITR. We provide several approaches to estimating the reward underlying the ITR as a function of subject characteristics.

Despite the availability of effective antihypertensive medications, the control of hypertension at a global level is dismal, and consequently, the CVD burden continues to increase. In response, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are implementing the HEARTS in the Americas, a community-based program that focuses on increasing hypertension control and CVD secondary prevention through risk factor mitigation. One key pillar is the implementation of a standardized hypertension treatment protocol supported by a small, high-quality formulary. This manuscript describes the methodology used by the HEARTS in the Americas program to implement a population-based standardized hypertension treatment protocol. It is rooted in a seamless transition from existing treatment practices to best practice using pharmacologic protocols built around a core set of ideal antihypertensive medications. In alignment with recent major hypertension guidelines, the HEARTS in the Americas protocols call for the rapid control of blood pressure, through the use of two antihypertensive medications, preferably in the form of a single pill, fixed-dose combination, in the initial treatment of hypertension. To date, the HEARTS in the Americas program has seen the improvement in antihypertensive medication formularies and the establishment of pharmacologic treatment protocols tailored to individual participating countries. This has translated to significant increases in hypertension control rates post-program implementation in these jurisdictions. Thus, the HEARTS in the Americas program could serve as a model, for not only the Americas Region but globally, and ultimately decrease the burden of CVD.", "Keywords": ["HEARTS in the Americas", "fixed-dose combination therapy", "hypertension control", "hypertension formularies", "hypertension protocols"], "MeSH terms": ["Antihypertensive Agents", "Caribbean Region", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Latin America", "Primary Health Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "DiPette", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Goughnour", "Affiliation": "Women Influencing Health, Education and Rule of Law (WI-HER), Vienna, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Zuniga", "Affiliation": "Health Service of Antofagasta, University of Antofagasta, Antofagasta, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Jamario", "Last Name": "Skeete", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Ridley", "Affiliation": "Prisma Health, Columbia, SC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sonia", "Last Name": "Angell", "Affiliation": "California Department of Public Health, California, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Brettler", "Affiliation": "Kaiser Permanente Southern California, California, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norm R C", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Physiology and Pharmacology and Community Health Sciences, O'Brien Institute for Public Health and Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Antionio", "Last Name": "Coca", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Vascular Risk Unit, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Connell", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, St Michael, Barbados."}, {"First Name": "Rohit", "Last Name": "Doon", "Affiliation": "Ministry of Health, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Jaffe", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Kaiser Permanente, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patricio", "Last Name": "Lopez-Jaramillo", "Affiliation": "MASIRA Research Institute, Santander University (UDES), Bucaramanga, Colombia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Resolve to Save Lives, An initiative of Vital Strategies, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcelo", "Last Name": "Orias", "Affiliation": "Sanatorio Allende C\u00f3rdoba, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Cordoba, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Pineiro", "Affiliation": "Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Andres", "Last Name": "Rosende", "Affiliation": "National Ministry of Health, Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Yamil\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s", "Last Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "Affiliation": "National Technical Advisory Commission on Hypertension, Havana, Cuba."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Ordunez", "Affiliation": "Department of Non-Communicable Diseases and Mental Health, Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)", "PubDate": "2020Dec"}, {"PMID": "32993438", "Title": "Challenges and Opportunities for the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease Among Young Adults: Report From a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Working Group.", "Abstract": "Improvements in cardiovascular disease (CVD) rates among young adults in the past 2 decades have been offset by increasing racial/ethnic and gender disparities, persistence of unhealthy lifestyle habits, overweight and obesity, and other CVD risk factors. To enhance the promotion of cardiovascular health among young adults 18 to 39\u00a0years old, the medical and broader public health community must understand the biological, interpersonal, and behavioral features of this life stage. Therefore, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, with support from the Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research, convened a 2-day workshop in Bethesda, Maryland, in September 2017 to identify research challenges and opportunities related to the cardiovascular health of young adults. The current generation of young adults live in an environment undergoing substantial economic, social, and technological transformations, differentiating them from prior research cohorts of young adults. Although the accumulation of clinical and behavioral risk factors for CVD begins early in life, and research suggests early risk is an important determinant of future events, few trials have studied prevention and treatment of CVD in participants <40\u00a0years old. Building an evidence base for CVD prevention in this population will require the engagement of young adults, who are often disconnected from the healthcare system and may not prioritize long-term health.

Methods and Results We pooled individual participant data from 4 randomized clinical trials of SMBP in the United Kingdom (combined n=2590) with varying intensities of support. Multivariable random effects regression was used to estimate the probability of antihypertensive intensification at 12\u00a0months for usual care versus SMBP. Using these data, we simulated 5-year BP control rates using a validated mathematical model. Trial participants were mostly older adults (mean age 66.6\u00a0years, SD 9.5), male (53.9%), and predominantly white (95.6%); mean baseline BP was 151.8/85.0\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Compared with usual care, the likelihood of antihypertensive intensification increased with both SMBP with feedback to patient or provider alone (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.6) and with telemonitoring or self-management (3.3, 2.5-4.2). Over 5\u00a0years, we estimated 33.4% BP control (<140/90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) with usual care (95% uncertainty interval 27.7%-39.4%). One year of SMBP with feedback to patient or provider alone achieved 33.9% (28.3%-40.3%) BP control and SMBP with telemonitoring or self-management 39.0% (33.1%-45.2%) over 5\u00a0years. If SMBP interventions and associated BP control processes were extended to 5\u00a0years, BP control increased to 52.4% (45.4%-59.8 %) and 72.1% (66.5%-77.6%), respectively.

Many adults require 2 or more classes of antihypertensive medication to achieve guideline-recommended BP goals, but the proportion of US adults taking antihypertensive medication monotherapy, versus combination therapy, has not been quantified using contemporary data. We analyzed data from 2005 to 2008, 2009 to 2012, and 2013 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to determine trends in monotherapy and combinations of antihypertensive medication classes among US adults age \u226520 years with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication (n=7837).

Better diagnosis, treatment, and continuity of care are all needed to improve control rates, and five necessary components have been recommended by RTSL, WHO and other partners as being essential for a successful hypertension control program. Several hurdles to hypertension control have been identified, with most related to limitations in the health care system rather than to patient behavior. Treatment according to standardized protocols should be started as soon as hypertension is diagnosed, and medical practices and health systems must closely monitor patient progress and system performance.

To support investigations into CLRD risk determinants and new approaches to primary prevention, we aimed to harmonize and pool respiratory data from US general population-based cohorts. Data were obtained from prospective cohorts that performed prebronchodilator spirometry and were harmonized following 2005 ATS/ERS standards. In cohorts conducting follow-up for noncardiovascular events, CLRD events were defined as hospitalizations/deaths adjudicated as CLRD-related or assigned relevant administrative codes. Coding and variable names were applied uniformly. The pooled sample included 65,251 adults in 9 cohorts followed-up for CLRD-related mortality over 653,380 person-years during 1983-2016. Average baseline age was 52 years; 56% were female; 49% were never-smokers; and racial/ethnic composition was 44% white, 22% black, 28% Hispanic/Latino, and 5% American Indian. Over 96% had complete data on smoking, clinical CLRD diagnoses, and dyspnea. After excluding invalid spirometry examinations (13%), there were 105,696 valid examinations (median, 2 per participant). Of 29,351 participants followed for CLRD hospitalizations, median follow-up was 14 years; only 5% were lost to follow-up at 10 years.

However, hypertension epidemiology and its temporal trends may differ in younger adults compared with older adults. Our study included 41 331 participants \u226518 years of age from 8 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2014) and estimated temporal trends of hypertension, awareness, treatment, and control among young adults (age, 18-39 years) compared with middle-age (age, 40-59 years) and older adults (age, \u226560 years). In 2013 to 2014, 7.3% of the US young adults had hypertension. During 1999 to 2014, young adults saw larger increases in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control than did older adults. However, all of these components of hypertension control were lower among young adults compared with middle-aged or older adults (74.7% younger versus 81.9% middle versus 88.4% older for awareness; 50.0% versus 70.3% versus 83.0% for treatment; and 40.2% versus 56.7% versus 54.4% for control). Worse hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in young adults overall were mostly driven by worse measures in young adult men compared with young adult women. More frequent healthcare visits by young adult women explained \u224828% of the sex-related difference in awareness, 60% of the difference in treatment, and 52% of the difference in control. These findings suggest that improved access to and engagement in medical care might improve hypertension control in young adults, particularly young adult men, and reduce life-time cardiovascular risk.", "Keywords": ["blood pressure", "body mass index", "cardiovascular diseases", "hypertension", "young adult"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Attitude to Health", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Nutrition Surveys", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yiyi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "From the Division of General Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "From the Division of General Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY. aem35@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "28834469", "Title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Intensive versus Standard Blood-Pressure Control.", "Abstract": "In the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease who received intensive systolic blood-pressure control (target, <120 mm Hg) had significantly lower rates of death and cardiovascular disease events than did those who received standard control (target, <140 mm Hg).

A population segmentation analysis.", "Abstract": "Excessive sodium intake is linked to an increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Although health care providers and other health professionals frequently provide counseling on healthful levels of sodium consumption, many people who consume sodium in excess of recommend levels still do not watch or reduce their sodium intake. In this study, we used a population segmentation approach to identify profiles of adults who are not watching or reducing their sodium intake despite been advised to do so. We analyzed sodium intake data in 125,764 respondents sampled in 15 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify and segment adults into subgroups according to differences in sodium intake behaviors. We found that about 16% of adults did not watch or reduce their sodium intake despite been told to do so by a health professional. This proportion varied substantially across the 25 different population subgroups identified. For example, about 44% of adults 18 to 44years of age who live in West Virginia were not reducing their sodium intake whereas only about 7.2% of black adults 65years of age and older with diabetes were not reducing their sodium intake. Population segmentation identifies subpopulations most likely to benefit from targeted and intensive public health and clinical interventions. In the case of sodium consumption, population segmentation can guide public health practitioners and policymakers to design programs and interventions that change sodium intake in people who are resistant to behavior change.", "Keywords": ["Hypertension prevention", "Medical advice", "Population segmentation", "Sodium consumption"], "MeSH terms": ["Administrative Personnel", "Adult", "Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System", "Directive Counseling", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Surveillance", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Health Innovation, The New York Academy of Medicine, New York, NY, USA; Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.

Cardiovascular diseases account for about one-half of NCD deaths, and the majority of cardiovascular disease deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. The GBD (Global Burden of Disease) study measures and benchmarks health loss from death or disability from more than 300 diseases in over 100 countries. According to GBD analyses, the rise of NCD is in part due to increased life expectancy due to reduced premature mortality from communicable, child, and maternal illnesses, but preventable risk factors also contribute and present targets for NCD control efforts. In addition to traditional NCD risk factors, like tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, and unhealthful diet, nontraditional risk factors like air pollution and unhealthful alcohol consumption also play a role. The GBD study continues to grow by gathering more data from country partners than ever before, and by measuring health at the national and subnational levels and in smaller time increments. The GBD study will continue to provide the data to set priorities for and measure progress in the global effort to control the rising burden of NCD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Global Burden of Disease", "Global Health", "Humans", "Morbidity", "Noncommunicable Diseases", "Societies, Medical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Catherine P", "Last Name": "Benziger", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory A", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Division of General Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Despite its critical role in bolstering virion infectivity, the molecular basis for the incorporation of DHX9/RNA helicase A (RHA) to virions remains unclear. Here, cell-based experiments demonstrate that the truncation of segments of the HIV-1 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) distinct from the core encapsidation sequence eliminated virion incorporation of RHA, indicating that RHA recruitment is mediated by specific interactions with the HIV-1 5'-UTR. In agreement with biological data, isothermal titration calorimetry determined that the dimer conformation of the 5'-UTR binds one RHA molecule per RNA strand, and the interaction is independent of nucleocapsid protein binding. NMR spectra employing a deuterium-labeling approach enabled resolution of the dimeric 5'-UTR in complex with the RHA N-terminal domain. The structure of the large molecular mass complex was dependent on RHA binding to a double-stranded region of the primer binding site (PBS)-segment of the 5'-UTR.

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the global burden of ACD and its risk factors and to discuss the main challenges and opportunities for prevention. Publicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease Study were analyzed for ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke and ACD risk factors. Data from the WHO Global Health Observatory were used to describe prevalence of diverse cardiometabolic risk factors. World Bank Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPc) information was used to categorize countries according to income level. Cardiovascular mortality decreased globally from 1990-2010 with important differences by GDPc; during 1990 there was a positive association between IHD mortality and GDPc. Higher-income countries had higher rates compared to those of lower-income countries. High levels of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol have a differential contribution to mortality by income group over time; high-income countries have been able to reduce the contribution from these risk factors in the last 20 years, whereas lower/middle income countries show an increasing trend in mortality attributable to high BMI and glucose. Although age-adjusted ACD mortality rate trends decreased globally, the absolute number of ACD deaths is increasing in part due to the growth of the population and aging, as well as to important lifestyle and food-system changes that likely attenuate gains in prevention. Population and individual level preventable causes of ACD must be aggressively and efficiently targeted in countries of lower economic development in order to reduce the growing burden of disease due to ACD.", "Keywords": ["Cerebrovascular disease", "DALYs", "Epidemiologic transition", "Ischemic heart disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Atherosclerosis", "Brain Ischemia", "Cost of Illness", "Developed Countries", "Developing Countries", "Global Health", "Humans", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Prevalence", "Public Health", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Barquera", "Affiliation": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Nutrici\u00f3n y Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud P\u00fablica, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.

The PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched for studies satisfying the search criteria. Outcomes extracted from each included study were 24-h urinary sodium excretion, salt (sodium chloride) intake, and BP before and after dietary salt lowering. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and results were evaluated for evidence of publication bias and heterogeneity. Because most studies aggregated results for hypertensive and normotensive participants, estimates were made for hypertensive participants only and for hypertensive and normotensive participants combined. Six salt-restriction experiment studies (3,153 participants), 4 cooking salt-restriction spoon studies (3,715 participants), and 4 cooking salt-substitute studies (1,730 participants) were analyzed. In salt-restriction experiment studies, the pooled estimate of mean change in 24-h urinary sodium excretion in hypertensive participants was\u00a0-163.0 mmol/day (95% confidence interval [CI]:\u00a0-233.5 to\u00a0-92.5 mmol/day), which was associated with a mean reduction of\u00a0-8.9 mm Hg (95% CI:\u00a0-14.1 to\u00a0-3.7 mm Hg) in systolic BP. Each 1.00-g dietary salt reduction in hypertensive participants was associated with a reduction of 0.94 mm Hg in systolic BP (95% CI: 0.69 to 1.03 mm Hg). These systolic BP reductions in hypertensive participants were 1.71 times greater compared with the mixed hypertensive and normotensive group. Salt-restriction spoon studies demonstrated a 1.46-g decrease in daily salt intake level. The effect of salt-substitute use on systolic BP control was substantial among the hypertensive participants (-4.2 mm Hg; 95% CI:\u00a0-7.0 to\u00a0-1.3 mm Hg), but the change did not reach statistical significance in hypertensive and normotensive participants combined (-2.31 mm Hg; 95% CI:\u00a0-5.57 to 0.94 mm Hg).

Taken together, these guidelines, though extensively discussed and disseminated in the United States, have not been widely recognized beyond the United States, nor have their implications been considered for lower- and middle-income developing countries. With an estimated 80% of the global burden in CVD occurring in developing countries, it is important to develop strategies to adequately detect those at increased CVD risk and to manage their risk through lifestyle and where appropriate, pharmacologic means. Though certain aspects of each guideline may be suitable for implementation globally, including in developing countries, other recommendations would be unrealistic for many countries based on local epidemiology and resources. CVD prevention priorities can be set using guidance from recently published CVD prevention guidelines if appropriately modified to the context of lower- and middle-income developing countries.

The GBD 2010 searched multiple databases to identify relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010. The GBD 2010 analytical tools were used to calculate region-specific IS incidence, mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratio, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost, including 95% uncertainty intervals (UI). In 2010, there were approximately 11,569,000 incident IS events (63% in low- and middle-income countries [LMIC]), approximately 2,835,000 deaths from IS (57% in LMIC), and approximately 39,389,000 DALY lost due to IS (64% in LMIC). From 1990 to 2010, there was a significant increase in global IS burden in terms of absolute number of people with incident IS (37% increase), deaths from IS (21% increase), and DALY lost due to IS (18% increase). Age-standardized IS incidence, DALY lost, mortality, and mortality-to-incidence ratios in high-income countries declined by about 13% (95% UI: 6% to 18%), 34% (95% UI: 16% to 36%), and 37% (95% UI: 19% to 39%), 21% (95% UI: 10% to 27%), respectively. However, in LMIC there was a modest 6% increase in the age-standardized incidence of IS (95% UI:\u00a0-7% to 18%) despite modest reductions in mortality rates, DALY lost, and mortality-to-incidence ratios. There was considerable variability among country-specific estimates within broad GBD regions. China, Russia, and India were ranked highest in both 1990 and 2010 for IS deaths attributable to tobacco consumption. Although age-standardized IS mortality rates have declined over the last 2 decades, the absolute global burden of IS is increasing, with the bulk of DALY lost in LMIC. Tobacco consumption is an important modifiable risk factor for IS, and in both 1990 and 2010, the top ranked countries for IS deaths that could be attributed to tobacco consumption were China, Russia, and India.

Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010. The GBD 2010 study provided standardized estimates of the incidence, mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost for HS (including intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) by age, sex, and income level (high-income countries [HIC]; low- and middle-income countries [LMIC]) for 21 GBD 2010 regions in 1990, 2005, and 2010. In 2010, there were 5.3 million cases of HS and over 3.0 million deaths due to HS. There was a 47% increase worldwide in the absolute number of HS cases. The largest proportion of HS incident cases (80%) and deaths (63%) occurred in LMIC countries. There were 62.8 million DALY lost (86% in LMIC) due to HS. The overall age-standardized incidence rate of HS per 100,000 person-years in 2010 was 48.41 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.44 to 52.13) in HIC and 99.43 (95% CI: 85.37 to 116.28) in LMIC, and 81.52 (95% CI: 72.27 to 92.82) globally. The age-standardized incidence of HS increased by 18.5% worldwide between 1990 and 2010. In HIC, there was a reduction in incidence of HS by 8% (95% CI: 1% to 15%), mortality by 38% (95% CI: 32% to 43%), DALY by 39% (95% CI: 32% to 44%), and MIR by 27% (95% CI: 19% to 35%) in the last 2 decades. In LMIC countries, there was a significant increase in the incidence of HS by 22% (95% CI: 5% to 30%), whereas there was a significant reduction in mortality rates of 23% (95% CI: -3% to 36%), DALY lost of 25% (95% CI: 7% to 38%), and MIR by 36% (95% CI: 16% to 49%). There were significant regional differences in incidence rates of HS, with the highest rates in LMIC regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and lowest rates in High Income North America and Western Europe. The worldwide burden of HS has increased over the last 2 decades in terms of absolute numbers of HS incident events. The majority of the burden of HS is borne by LMIC. Rates for HS incidence, mortality, and DALY lost, as well as MIR decreased in the past 2 decades in HIC, but increased significantly in LMIC countries, particularly in those patients \u226475 years. HS affected people at a younger age in LMIC than in HIC. The lowest incidence and mortality rates in 2010 were in High Income North America, Australasia, and Western Europe, whereas the highest rates were in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. These results suggest that reducing the burden of HS is a priority particularly in LMIC.

CVD epidemiology data are sparse and of uneven quality in sub-Saharan Africa. Using the available data, the Global Burden of Diseases, Risk Factors, and Injuries (GBD) 2010 Study estimated CVD mortality and burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa in 1990 and 2010. The leading CVD cause of death and disability in 2010 in sub-Saharan Africa was stroke; the largest relative increases in CVD burden between 1990 and 2010 were in atrial fibrillation and peripheral arterial disease. CVD deaths constituted only 8.8% of all deaths and 3.5% of all disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in sub-Sahara Africa, less than a quarter of the proportion of deaths and burden attributed to CVD in high income regions. However, CVD deaths in sub-Saharan Africa occur at younger ages on average than in the rest of the world. It remains uncertain if increased urbanization and life expectancy in some parts of sub-Saharan African nations will transition the region to higher CVD burden in future years.", "Keywords": ["Burden of disease", "CVD", "Cardiovascular disease", "GBD 2010", "Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study", "Global health", "ICD", "International Classification of Diseases", "Mortality", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "YLD", "YLL", "cardiovascular disease", "years lived with disability", "years of life lost due to disability"], "MeSH terms": ["Africa South of the Sahara", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Morbidity", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Sex Distribution", "Survival Rate"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Division of General Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.

However, there are gaps in access to healthcare for some children in China. We assessed health insurance status and associated variables among children under five in twelve communities in 2010: two urban community health centers and two rural township health centers in each of three municipalities located in China's distinctly different East, Central and Western regions. Information on demographic and socio-economic variables and children's insurance status was gathered from parents or caregivers of all children enrolled in local health programs, and others recruited from the local communities. Only 62% of 1131 children assessed were insured. This figure did not vary across geographic regions, but urban children were less likely to be insured than rural children. In multivariate analysis, infants were 2.44 times more likely to be uninsured than older children and children having at least one migrant parent were 1.90 times more likely to be uninsured than those living with non-migrant parents. Low maternal education was also associated with being uninsured. Gaps in China's child health insurance coverage might be bridged if newborns are automatically covered from birth, and if insurance is extended to all urban migrant children, regardless of the family's residential registration status and size.", "Keywords": ["Children", "China", "Coverage", "Health insurance", "Infants"], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Child Welfare", "Child, Preschool", "China", "Female", "Health Care Reform", "Humans", "Infant", "Insurance Coverage", "Insurance, Health", "Male", "Rural Population", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Urban Population"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Juyang", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "The School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Division of General Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Hipgrave", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karoline", "Last Name": "Myklebust", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sufang", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert W", "Last Name": "Scherpbier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xuetao", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Social science & medicine (1982)", "PubDate": "2013Nov"}, {"PMID": "25690382", "Title": "Scorecard for NCDs.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Division of General Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jagat", "Last Name": "Narula", "Affiliation": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.
