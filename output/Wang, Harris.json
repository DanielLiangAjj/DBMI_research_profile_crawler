Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool from a genetically engineered mouse model driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and loss of p53 and Cdh1 in gastric parietal cells (known as TCON mice) identified differentially abundant proteins compared to littermate controls. Immunoblot assays validated a panel of proteins including actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2 (ASAH2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and valosin-containing protein (VCP) as enriched in TCON stool compared to littermate control stool. Immunofluorescence analysis of these proteins in TCON stomach sections revealed increased protein expression as compared to littermate controls. Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool obtained from HDGC patients with CDH1 mutations identified increased expression of ASAH2, DPP4, VCP, lactotransferrin (LTF), and tropomyosin-2 (TPM2) relative to stool from healthy sex and age-matched donors. Chemical inhibition of ASAH2 using C6-urea ceramide was toxic to GC cell lines and patient derived-GC organoids. This toxicity was reversed by adding downstream products of the S1P synthesis pathway, suggesting a dependency on ASAH2 activity in GC. An exploratory analysis of the HDGC stool microbiome identified features which correlated with patient tumors.

While gut microbes have been extensively studied over the past decades, little is known about the proteins that they secrete into the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we developed and applied a computational pipeline to a comprehensive catalog of human-associated metagenome-assembled genomes in order to predict and analyze the bacterial metasecretome of the human gut, i.e., the collection of proteins secreted out of the cytoplasm by human gut bacteria. We identified the presence of large and diverse families of secreted carbohydrate-active enzymes and assessed their phylogenetic distributions across different taxonomic groups, which revealed an enrichment in Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia. By mapping secreted proteins to available metagenomic data from endoscopic sampling of the human gastrointestinal tract, we specifically pinpointed regions in the upper and lower intestinal tract along the lumen and mucosa where specific glycosidases are secreted by resident microbes. The metasecretome analyzed in this study constitutes the most comprehensive list of secreted proteins produced by human gut bacteria reported to date and serves as a useful resource for the microbiome research community. IMPORTANCE Bacterially secreted proteins are necessary for the proper functioning of bacterial cells and communities. Secreted proteins provide bacterial cells with the ability to harvest resources from the exterior, import these resources into the cell, and signal to other bacteria. In the human gut microbiome, these actions impact host health and allow the maintenance of a healthy gut bacterial community. We utilized computational tools to identify the major components of human gut bacterially secreted proteins and determined their spatial distribution in the gastrointestinal tract.

While the evolutionary forces driving these polyphyletic deletion events are not well understood, the consequence is that extant metazoans are unable to produce nine essential amino acids (EAAs). Previous studies have highlighted that EAA biosynthesis tends to be more energetically costly, raising the possibility that these pathways were lost from organisms with access to abundant EAAs. It is unclear whether present-day metazoans can reaccept these pathways to resurrect biosynthetic capabilities that were lost long ago or whether evolution has rendered EAA pathways incompatible with metazoan metabolism. Here, we report progress on a large-scale synthetic genomics effort to reestablish EAA biosynthetic functionality in mammalian cells. We designed codon-optimized biosynthesis pathways based on genes mined from Escherichia coli. These pathways were de novo synthesized in 3 kilobase chunks, assembled in yeasto and genomically integrated into a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. One synthetic pathway produced valine at a sufficient level for cell viability and proliferation. 13C-tracing verified de novo biosynthesis of valine and further revealed build-up of pathway intermediate 2,3-dihydroxy-3-isovalerate. Increasing the dosage of downstream ilvD boosted pathway performance and allowed for long-term propagation of second-generation cells in valine-free medium at 3.2 days per doubling. This work demonstrates that mammalian metabolism is amenable to restoration of ancient core pathways, paving a path for genome-scale efforts to synthetically restore metabolic functions to the metazoan lineage.", "Keywords": ["Cricetulus griseus", "cell biology", "essential amino acids", "genetics", "genomics", "synthetic biology", "synthetic genomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Amino Acids, Essential", "Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Escherichia coli", "Genome", "Mammals", "Valine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Trolle", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ross M", "Last Name": "McBee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sudarshan", "Last Name": "Pinglay", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Henri", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sergei", "Last Name": "German", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Liyuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xinyi", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, New York University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "J Andrew", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Pacold", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Drew R", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jef D", "Last Name": "Boeke", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Harris H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2022Sep27"}, {"PMID": "36049050", "Title": "Decreased Gut Microbiome Tryptophan Metabolism and Serotonergic Signaling in Patients With Persistent Mental Health and Gastrointestinal Symptoms After COVID-19.", "Abstract": "An estimated 15%-29% of patients report new gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms after coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) while 4%-31% report new depressive symptoms.

Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner.

Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells.

We2 and others3-6 recently reported results confirming such a concern. Continuing surveillance of the evolution of Omicron has since revealed the rise in prevalence of two sublineages, BA.1 with an R346K alteration (BA.1+R346K, also known as BA.1.1) and B.1.1.529.2 (BA.2), with the latter containing 8 unique spike alterations and lacking 13 spike alterations found in BA.1. Here we extended our studies to include antigenic characterization of these new sublineages. Polyclonal sera from patients infected by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 or recipients of current mRNA vaccines showed a substantial loss in neutralizing activity against both BA.1+R346K and BA.2, with drops comparable to that already reported for BA.1 (refs. 2,3,5,6).

We sought to determine how the intensive care unit (ICU) patient gut microbiome shapes the ICU room surface microbiome, focusing on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), a common ICU pathogen. This was an ICU-based prospective cohort study. Rectal swabs were performed in adult ICU patients immediately at the time of ICU admission and environmental surface swabs were performed at five predetermined time points. All swabs underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and culture for VRE. 304 ICU patients and 24 ICU rooms were sampled (5 longitudinal samples per ICU room). Spatially adjacent ICU rooms were no more microbially similar than nonadjacent rooms. Microbial signatures within rooms diverged rapidly over time: in 14\u2009days, ICU rooms were as similar to other ICU rooms as they were to their prior selves. This divergence over time was more pronounced in rooms with higher patient turnover. Examining VRE status by culture, patient VRE gut colonization had modest agreement with room surface VRE (kappa statistic 0.36). There were no ICU rooms that consistently cultured positive for VRE, including those that housed VRE positive patients. Individual ICU patients had a limited impact on ICU room surface microbiome, and rooms diverged similarly over time regardless of patients. Patient VRE gut colonization may have a modest influence on room surface VRE but there were no \"bad rooms\" that consistently cultured positive for VRE. These results may be useful in planning infection control measures. IMPORTANCE This study found that intensive care unit (ICU) room microbial signatures diverged from their baseline quickly: within 2 weeks, individual ICU rooms had lost distinguishing characteristics and were as similar to other ICU rooms as they were to their former selves. Patient turnover within rooms accelerated this drift. Patient gut colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) was associated with ICU room surface contamination with VRE; again, within 2 weeks, this association was substantially diminished. These results provide dynamic information regarding how patients control the microbiota on local hospital room surfaces and may facilitate decision making for infection prevention and control measures targeting VRE or other organisms.", "Keywords": ["gut microbiome", "healthcare-associated infections", "intensive care unit", "vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cross Infection", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Prospective Studies", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Vancomycin", "Vancomycin Resistance", "Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel E", "Last Name": "Freedberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miles", "Last Name": "Richardson", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Nattakom", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacky", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elissa", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Zachariah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harris H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2022Feb23"}, {"PMID": "35016198", "Title": "Striking antibody evasion manifested by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.", "Abstract": "The B.1.1.529/Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was only recently detected in southern Africa, but its subsequent spread has been extensive, both regionally and globally1.

A striking feature of this variant is the large number of spike mutations3 that pose a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies4. This concern is amplified by the findings of our study. Here we found that B.1.1.529 is markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from patients who recovered from COVID-19, but also from individuals who were vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from individuals who were vaccinated and received a booster dose of mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529. By evaluating a panel of monoclonal antibodies against all known epitope clusters on the spike protein, we noted that the activity of 17 out of the 19 antibodies tested were either abolished or impaired, including ones that are currently authorized or approved for use in patients. Moreover, we also identified four new spike mutations (S371L, N440K, G446S and Q493R) that confer greater antibody resistance on B.1.1.529.

Because taxanes target cell microtubules, measuring microtubule dynamic instability is an important step in determining the mechanisms of taxane resistance and provides insight into how to overcome this resistance.

However, the biological insights generated from ChIP-seq analysis have been limited to predictions of binding sites and cooperative interactions. Furthermore, ChIP-seq data often poorly correlate with in vitro measurements or predicted motifs, highlighting that binding affinity alone is insufficient to explain transcription factor (TF)-binding in vivo. One possibility is that binding sites are not equally accessible across the genome. A more comprehensive biophysical representation of TF-binding is required to improve our ability to understand, predict, and alter gene expression. Here, we show that genome accessibility is a key parameter that impacts TF-binding in bacteria. We developed a thermodynamic model that parameterizes ChIP-seq coverage in terms of genome accessibility and binding affinity. The role of genome accessibility is validated using a large-scale ChIP-seq dataset of the M. tuberculosis regulatory network. We find that accounting for genome accessibility led to a model that explains 63% of the ChIP-seq profile variance, while a model based in motif score alone explains only 35% of the variance. Moreover, our framework enables de novo ChIP-seq peak prediction and is useful for inferring TF-binding peaks in new experimental conditions by reducing the need for additional experiments. We observe that the genome is more accessible in intergenic regions, and that increased accessibility is positively correlated with gene expression and anti-correlated with distance to the origin of replication.

Our biotic GET (BGET) model provides an a priori theory of the growth benefits of microbial trade, yielding several novel insights relevant to understanding microbial ecology and engineering synthetic communities. We find that the economic concept of comparative advantage is a necessary condition for mutualistic trade. Our model suggests that microbial communities can grow faster when species are unable to produce essential resources that are obtained through trade, thereby promoting metabolic specialization and increased intercellular exchange. Furthermore, we find that species engaged in trade exhibit a fundamental tradeoff between growth rate and relative population abundance, and that different environments that put greater pressure on group selection versus individual selection will promote varying strategies along this growth-abundance spectrum. We experimentally tested this tradeoff using a synthetic consortium of Escherichia coli cells and found the results match the predictions of the model.

Bacteria represent an especially striking puzzle, because closely related strains possess radically different metabolic and ecological capabilities. Differences in protein repertoire arising from gene transfer are currently considered the primary mechanism underlying phenotypic plasticity in bacteria. Although bacterial coding plasticity has been extensively studied in previous decades, little is known about the role that regulatory plasticity plays in bacterial evolution. Here, we show that bacterial genes can rapidly shift between multiple regulatory modes by acquiring functionally divergent nonhomologous promoter regions. Through analysis of 270,000 regulatory regions across 247 genomes, we demonstrate that regulatory \"switching\" to nonhomologous alternatives is ubiquitous, occurring across the bacterial domain. Using comparative transcriptomics, we show that at least 16% of the expression divergence between Escherichia coli strains can be explained by this regulatory switching. Further, using an oligonucleotide regulatory library, we establish that switching affects bacterial promoter architecture. We provide evidence that regulatory switching can occur through horizontal regulatory transfer, which allows regulatory regions to move across strains, and even genera, independently from the genes they regulate. Finally, by experimentally characterizing the fitness effect of a regulatory transfer on a pathogenic E. coli strain, we demonstrate that regulatory switching elicits important phenotypic consequences.

The resulting mutant library was characterized by high-throughput sequencing to show that all attempted insertions were estimated to have occurred at an average frequency of 0.02% per locus with 0.4 average insertions per cell. MO-MAGE enables cost-effective large-scale targeted genome engineering that should be useful for a variety of applications in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.", "Keywords": ["MAGE", "genome engineering", "library synthesis", "metabolic engineering", "microarray"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteriophage T7", "Escherichia coli", "Gene Library", "Genetic Engineering", "Genome, Bacterial", "Metabolic Engineering", "Mutagenesis", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Operon", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Synthetic Biology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mads T", "Last Name": "Bonde", "Affiliation": "Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark , DK-2970 H\u00f8rsholm, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Sriram", "Last Name": "Kosuri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hans J", "Last Name": "Genee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kira", "Last Name": "Sarup-Lytzen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George M", "Last Name": "Church", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Morten O A", "Last Name": "Sommer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harris H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS synthetic biology", "PubDate": "2015Jan16"}, {"PMID": "24838875", "Title": "Recent progress in engineering human-associated microbiomes.", "Abstract": "Recent progress in molecular biology and genetics opens up the possibility of engineering a variety of biological systems, from single-cellular to multicellular organisms.

This enables efficient creation of genetic variants including both single mutants with specifically targeted modifications as well as combinatorial cell libraries. Manual design of oligonucleotides for these approaches can be tedious, time-consuming, and may not be practical for larger projects targeting many genomic sites. At present, the change from a desired phenotype (e.g. altered expression of a specific protein) to a designed MAGE oligo, which confers the corresponding genetic change, is performed manually. To address these challenges, we have developed the MAGE Oligo Design Tool (MODEST). This web-based tool allows designing of MAGE oligos for (i) tuning translation rates by modifying the ribosomal binding site, (ii) generating translational gene knockouts and (iii) introducing other coding or non-coding mutations, including amino acid substitutions, insertions, deletions and point mutations. The tool automatically designs oligos based on desired genotypic or phenotypic changes defined by the user, which can be used for high efficiency recombineering and MAGE.

However, little is known about specific crossfeeding principles that drive the formation and maintenance of individuals within a mixed population. Here, we devised a series of synthetic syntrophic communities to probe the complex interactions underlying metabolic exchange of amino acids. We experimentally analyzed multimember, multidimensional communities of Escherichia coli of increasing sophistication to assess the outcomes of synergistic crossfeeding. We find that biosynthetically costly amino acids including methionine, lysine, isoleucine, arginine, and aromatics, tend to promote stronger cooperative interactions than amino acids that are cheaper to produce. Furthermore, cells that share common intermediates along branching pathways yielded more synergistic growth, but exhibited many instances of both positive and negative epistasis when these interactions scaled to higher dimensions. In more complex communities, we find certain members exhibiting keystone species-like behavior that drastically impact the community dynamics. Based on comparative genomic analysis of >6,000 sequenced bacteria from diverse environments, we present evidence suggesting that amino acid biosynthesis has been broadly optimized to reduce individual metabolic burden in favor of enhanced crossfeeding to support synergistic growth across the biosphere. These results improve our basic understanding of microbial syntrophy while also highlighting the utility and limitations of current modeling approaches to describe the dynamic complexities underlying microbial ecosystems.
