Such information gaps may lead to unintended impacts of policy changes. Following the phase-out of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, states were allowed to redetermine Medicaid eligibility and disenroll individuals. Yet, financial barriers remain a common and significant hurdle for patients with OUD and are associated with worse outcomes. We studied 3842 patients entering care in 2022 at Ophelia Health, one of the nation's largest OUD telehealth companies, to assess associations between insurance status and 6-month retention. In multivariable analyses, in-network patients who could use insurance benefits were more likely to be retained compared with cash-pay patients (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.40-1.62; P < .001). Among a subsample of 882 patients for whom more detailed insurance data were available (due to phased-in electronic health record updates), in-network patients were also more likely to be retained at 6 months compared with insured, yet out-of-network patients (aRR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.54-2.23; P < .001). Findings show that insurance status, and specifically the use of in-network benefits, is associated with superior retention and suggest that Medicaid disenrollment and insurance plan hesitation to engage with telehealth providers may undermine the nation's response to the opioid crisis.", "Keywords": ["Medicaid", "buprenorphine", "financial barriers", "opioid use disorder", "telehealth"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arthur Robin", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Ophelia Health, Inc, New York, NY 10003, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Rowe", "Affiliation": "Ophelia Health, Inc, New York, NY 10003, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lexie", "Last Name": "Minarik", "Affiliation": "Ophelia Health, Inc, New York, NY 10003, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zack", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Ophelia Health, Inc, New York, NY 10003, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sean M", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Harold A", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States."}], "Journal": "Health affairs scholar", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "38285559", "Title": "Care Fragmentation, Care Continuity, and Care Coordination-How They Differ and Why It Matters.", "Abstract": "This Viewpoint considers why fragmentation occurs and suggests a potential path forward for developing evidenced-based strategies that can reduce the occurrence of fragmentation and its associated harms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Continuity of Patient Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "Kern", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Julie P W", "Last Name": "Bynum", "Affiliation": "University of Michigan, Ann Arbor."}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "JAMA internal medicine", "PubDate": "2024Mar01"}, {"PMID": "38158192", "Title": "Providing Behavioral Health Care in PACE - A Review of Federal and State Manual Regulations.", "Abstract": "Present analysis of the federal and state regulations that guide The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) operations and core clinical features for direction on behavioral health (BH).", "Keywords": ["Behavioral health integration", "centers for medicare and medicaid services (CMS)", "dually eligible individuals", "the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE)"], "MeSH terms": ["United States", "Humans", "Health Services for the Aged", "Aged", "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S.", "State Government", "Mental Health Services"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexa", "Last Name": "Fleet", "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioral Health Services and Policy Research, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alya", "Last Name": "Simoun", "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioral Health Services and Policy Research, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meril", "Last Name": "Tomy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Shalev", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brigitta", "Last Name": "Spaeth-Rublee", "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioral Health Services and Policy Research, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioral Health Services and Policy Research, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Pyschiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Adding to these underlying challenges, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted established patterns of care. To advance policy strategy for addressing gaps in the mental health services system, RAND researchers investigate the availability and accessibility of mental health services in NYC. The RAND team used two complementary approaches to address these issues. First, the team conducted interviews with a broad group of professionals and patients in the mental health system to identify barriers to care and potential strategies for improving access and availability.

These metrics would expand the Army's outcome monitoring, which currently includes symptom improvement metrics, for patients who received BH care. The authors developed rigorous criteria to evaluate candidate readiness metrics, conducted interviews with stakeholders (Army subject-matter experts and BH providers), reviewed existing sources of data that could support the development of a readiness metric, and conducted a literature review to identify instruments that have been used to measure readiness-related domains in both military and civilian populations. The authors found that no existing data source or patient self-report instrument met criteria for implementation of a readiness metric for soldiers, but one instrument, the Walter Reed Functional Impairment Scale (WRFIS), is promising. No existing data source or patient self-report instrument met criteria for Army-wide implementation of a readiness metric for adult family members. Stakeholders reported that psychiatric symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and impaired functioning are important indicators of lack of readiness among soldiers and adult family members.

This led to the development of strategies for the seclusion of a patient in this state within a particular area separated from other patients in the ward. While versions of this practice have been used in different countries and settings, a systematic framework for describing the various parameters and types of seclusion interventions has not been available. The aims of the project were to develop and test a valid and reliable checklist for characterizing seclusion in inpatient psychiatric care. Methods: Development and testing of the checklist were accomplished in five stages. Staff in psychiatric units completed detailed descriptions of seclusion episodes. Elements of seclusion were identified by thematic analysis of this material, and consensus regarding these elements was achieved through a Delphi process comprising two rounds. Good content validity was ensured through the sample of seclusion episodes and the representative participants in the Delphi process. The first draft of the checklist was revised based on testing by clinicians assessing seclusion episodes. The revised checklist with six reasons for and 10 elements of seclusion was tested with different response scales, and acceptable interrater reliability was achieved. Results: The Clinical Seclusion Checklist is a brief and feasible tool measuring six reasons for seclusion, 10 elements of seclusion, and four contextual factors. It was developed through a transparent process and exhibited good content validity and acceptable interrater reliability. Conclusion: The checklist is a step toward achieving valid and clinically relevant measurements of seclusion. Its use in psychiatric units may contribute to quality assurance, more reliable statistics and comparisons across sites and periods, improved research on patients' experiences of seclusion and its effects, reduction of negative consequences of seclusion, and improvement of psychiatric intensive care.", "Keywords": ["checklist", "clinical seclusion checklist", "emergency psychiatry", "measurement properties", "measuring", "psychiatric acute wards", "psychiatric intensive care", "seclusion"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Torleif", "Last Name": "Ruud", "Affiliation": "Mental Health Services, Akershus University Hospital, L\u00f8renskog, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Espen Woldsengen", "Last Name": "Haugom", "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York City, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Torfinn", "Last Name": "Hynnekleiv", "Affiliation": "Department of Acute Psychiatry and Psychosis Treatment, Division of Mental Health, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Reinsvoll, Norway."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34555921", "Title": "A Continuum-Based Framework as a Practice Assessment Tool for Integration of General Health in Behavioral Health Care.", "Abstract": "General medical conditions among patients with mental and substance use disorders are often not adequately detected and managed in behavioral health settings.

In this special communication, our cross-domain working group of the CTSA consortium, comprised of experts in methods and processes, workforce development, evaluation, stakeholder engagement, and D&I sciences, share a vision of how CTSAs can enhance translation across the translational spectrum through the integration of D&I sciences into the critical areas of methods and processes, workforce development, and evaluation.

PBHCI grants are designed to improve the overall wellness and physical health status of people with serious mental illness or co-occurring substance use disorders by supporting the integration of primary care and preventive PH services into community behavioral health centers where individuals already receive care. From 2010 to 2013, RAND conducted a program evaluation of PBHCI, describing the structure, process, and outcomes for the first three cohorts of grantee programs (awarded in 2009 and 2010). The current study extends previous work by investigating the impact of PBHCI on consumers' health care utilization, total costs of care to Medicaid, and quality of care in three states. The evidence suggests that PBHCI was successful in reducing frequent use of emergency room and inpatient services for physical health conditions, reducing costs of care, and improving follow-up after hospitalization for a mental illness. However, PBHCI evidence does not suggest that PBHCI had a consistent effect on quality of preventive care and health monitoring for chronic physical conditions. These findings can guide the design of future cohorts of PBHCI clinics to build on the strengths with respect to shifting emergency department and inpatient care to less costly and more effective settings and address the continuing challenge of integrating care between specialty behavioral health providers and general medical care providers.", "Keywords": ["Health Care Quality", "Health Care Quality Measurement", "Health and Health Care", "Medicaid", "Mental Health Treatment"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Breslau", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark J", "Last Name": "Sorbero", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Kusuke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah M", "Last Name": "Scharf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole Schmidt", "Last Name": "Hackbarth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Rand health quarterly", "PubDate": "2021Aug"}, {"PMID": "34362369", "Title": "Empirically identified networks of healthcare providers for adults with mental illness.", "Abstract": "Policies target networks of providers who treat people with mental illnesses, but little is known about the empirical structures of these networks and related variation in patient care.

In the United States, there is growing interest in models integrating physical health care delivery, management, or coordination into specialty mental health programs, sometimes called \"reverse integration.\" In November 2019, the Johns Hopkins ALACRITY Center for Health and Longevity in Mental Illness convened a forum of 25 experts to discuss the current state of the evidence on integrated care models based in the specialty mental health system and to identify priorities for future research, policy, and practice. This article summarizes the group's conclusions. Key research priorities include identifying the active ingredients in multicomponent integrated care models and developing and validating integration performance metrics. Key policy and practice recommendations include developing new financing mechanisms and implementing strategies to build workforce and data capacity. Forum participants also highlighted an overarching need to address socioeconomic risks contributing to excess mortality among adults with serious mental illness.", "Keywords": ["Community mental health services", "Internal medicine", "Public policy issues", "Service delivery systems"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "United States", "Workforce"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emma E", "Last Name": "McGinty", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore (McGinty, Presskreischer); RAND Corporation, Pittsburgh (Breslau) and Boston (Horvitz-Lennon); Mathematica, Washington, D.C.

Informal check-in calls and site visits using qualitative semistructured individual and group interviews were conducted with 10 of the 11 sites. A mixed-methods approach was used to incorporate the survey data and qualitative thematic analysis. All practices advanced at least one level of behavioral health integration along various components of the framework. These advances included implementing depression screening, standardizing workflows for positive screens, integrating patient tracking tools for follow-up behavioral health visits, incorporating warm hand-offs to on-site or off-site behavioral health providers, and formalized external referrals using collaborative agreements. Practices reported they had overall positive experiences using the framework and offered feedback for how to improve future iterations. The framework continuum, in combination with technical assistance, was shown to be useful for primary care practices to advance integrated behavioral health care based on their priorities and resource availability.

The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program hubs are uniquely suited to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations across universities and academic medical centers. This paper describes the activities at the Columbia University CTSA Program hub to address a current public health crisis, the opioid epidemic. Columbia's CTSA Program hub led a three-phase approach, based on the Conceptual Model of Transdisciplinary Scientific Collaboration as described by Stokols et al.: (1) a university-wide planning and brainstorming phase to identify key leaders across many domains who are influential in addressing the opioid epidemic, (2) a campus-wide and community outreach to identify all interested parties, and (3) ongoing targeted support for collaboration development. Preliminary metrics of success are interdisciplinary collaborations and grant funding. We describe recent examples of how interdisciplinary collaboration, academic-community partnership, and pilot funding contributed to the development and funding of innovative interdisciplinary research, including the New York site of the HEALing Communities initiative. The processes are now being used to support interdisciplinary approaches for other translational public health issues.", "Keywords": ["CTSA", "Opioids", "interdisciplinary", "public health", "public

Core competency frameworks to close behavioral health training gaps in primary care exist, but these have not extended to some of the distinct skills and roles required in serious illness care settings.

The resulting mental disease similarity network offered a new view for navigating and investigating disease relations; it also revealed popular mental disease in the literature in terms of the number of connections and similarities with other diseases. It shows that depressive disorder is directly connected with nine other popular diseases and connects 52 other diseases in the network.

However, the extent to which the resulting patterns of utilization represent high-quality care (compared to fee-for-service products) remains controversial. The authors sought to compare patterns of ambulatory care (including how diffuse or fragmented the care patterns were) for Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries vs. Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. A serial cross-sectional study of adults (\u226518 years old) was conducted using statewide Medicaid claims from New York State for calendar years 2010-2013. Beneficiaries were required to be continuously enrolled and have \u22654 ambulatory visits for each year they contributed data, yielding a sample of more than 1 million beneficiaries per year. Beneficiaries were characterized by age, sex, and case mix. For each year, ambulatory care patterns were compared across subgroups of beneficiaries using Poisson models (for numbers of visits and providers) and bounded Tobit models (for fragmentation scores). In 2010, among those who were not dual eligible, managed care beneficiaries had on average fewer visits (10.9 visits vs. 11.4 visits [P\u2009<\u20090.0001]) but more providers (3.8 providers vs. 3.3 providers [P\u2009<\u20090.0001]) and therefore more fragmentation (0.58 vs. 0.51 [P\u2009<\u20090.0001]) than fee-for-service beneficiaries, adjusting for age, sex, and case mix.

This study is a comprehensive assessment of the quality of care delivered by the MHS in 2013-2014 for over 38,000 active-component service members with PTSD or depression. The assessment includes performance on 30 quality measures to evaluate the receipt of recommended assessments and treatments. These measures draw on multiple data sources including administrative encounter data, medical record review data, and patient self-reported outcome monitoring data. The assessment identified strengths and areas for improvement for the MHS. In particular, the MHS excels at screening for suicide risk and substance use, but rates of appropriate follow-up for service members with suicide risk are lower. Most service members received at least some psychotherapy, but less than half of psychotherapy delivered was evidence-based. In analyses focused on Army soldiers, outcome monitoring increased notably over time, yet preliminary analyses suggest that more work is needed to ensure that services are effective in reducing symptoms.

It is unclear whether the current system of care meets the needs of service members with PTSD or MDD, and little is known about the barriers to delivering guideline-concordant care. RAND used existing provider workforce data, a provider survey, and key informant interviews to (1) provide an overview of the PH workforce at military treatment facilities (MTFs), (2) examine the extent to which care for PTSD and MDD in military treatment facilities is consistent with Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense clinical practice guidelines, and (3) identify facilitators and barriers to providing this care. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of providers' perspectives on their capacity to deliver PH care within MTFs and presents detailed results by provider type and service branch. Findings suggest that most providers report using guideline-concordant psychotherapies, but use varied by provider type. The majority of providers reported receiving at least minimal training and supervision in at least one recommended psychotherapy for PTSD and for MDD. Still, more than one-quarter of providers reported that limits on travel and lack of protected time in their schedule affected their ability to access additional professional training.

Content analysis identified structural, process, organizational (\"internal\") and contextual (\"external\") themes that were relevant to integration of care. Network analysis delineated the interactions between these.

In this paper, we present a framework for promoting quality measurement as a tool for improving quality of mental health care. We identify key barriers to this effort, including lack of standardized information technology-based data sources, limited scientific evidence for mental health quality measures, lack of provider training and support, and cultural barriers to integrating mental health care within general health environments. We describe several innovations that are underway worldwide which can mitigate these barriers. Based on these experiences, we offer several recommendations for improving quality of mental health care. Health care payers and providers will need a portfolio of validated measures of patient-centered outcomes across a spectrum of conditions. Common data elements will have to be developed and embedded within existing electronic health records and other information technology tools. Mental health outcomes will need to be assessed more routinely, and measurement-based care should become part of the overall culture of the mental health care system. Health care systems will need a valid way to stratify quality measures, in order to address potential gaps among subpopulations and identify groups in most need of quality improvement. Much more attention should be devoted to workforce training in and capacity for quality improvement. The field of mental health quality improvement is a team sport, requiring coordination across different providers, involvement of consumer advocates, and leveraging of resources and incentives from health care payers and systems.", "Keywords": ["Mental disorders", "electronic health records", "health care systems", "health informatics", "health policy", "patient-centered outcomes", "quality

Given the rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among U.S. service members, attention has been directed to ensuring the quality and availability of programs and services targeting these and other psychological health (PH) conditions. Understanding the current quality of care for PTSD and depression is an important step toward improving care across the MHS. To help determine whether service members with PTSD or depression are receiving evidence-based care and whether there are disparities in care quality by branch of service, geographic region, and service member characteristics (e.g., gender, age, pay grade, race/ethnicity, deployment history), DoD's Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCoE) asked the RAND Corporation to conduct a review of the administrative data of service members diagnosed with PTSD or depression and to recommend areas on which the MHS could focus its efforts to continuously improve the quality of care provided to all service members. This study characterizes care for service members seen by MHS for diagnoses of PTSD and/or depression and finds that while the MHS performs well in ensuring outpatient follow-up following psychiatric hospitalization, providing sufficient psychotherapy and medication management needs to be improved. Further, quality of care for PTSD and depression varied by service branch, TRICARE region, and service member characteristics, suggesting the need to ensure that all service members receive high-quality care.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kimberly A", "Last Name": "Hepner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Sloss", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carol P", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Heather", "Last Name": "Krull", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan M", "Last Name": "Paddock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shaela", "Last Name": "Moen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martha J", "Last Name": "Timmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Rand health quarterly", "PubDate": "2016Jun20"}, {"PMID": "27996111", "Title": "Growing Old or Just Growing.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adaptation, Psychological", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Female", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Geriatrics Society", "PubDate": "2016Dec"}, {"PMID": "27974005", "Title": "Carrots and Sticks on Opposite Sides of the Atlantic: Integration Incentives for People With Serious Mental Illness in England.", "Abstract": "Integrating care pathways between primary and specialist mental health care is seen as integral to improving the health of people with mental illness.

The delivery and use of GS reports can occur within complex and high-paced healthcare environments. We employ a user-centered software design approach in a focus group setting in order to facilitate gathering rich contextual information from a diverse group of stakeholders potentially impacted by the delivery of GS reports relevant to two precision medicine programs at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Responses from focus group sessions were transcribed, coded and analyzed by two team members. Notification mechanisms and information resources preferred by participants from our first phase of focus groups were incorporated into scenarios and the design of a software prototype for delivering GS reports. The goal of our second phase of focus group, to gain input on the prototype software design, was accomplished through conducting task walkthroughs with GS reporting scenarios. Preferences for notification, content and consultation from genetics specialists appeared to depend upon familiarity with scenarios for ordering and delivering GS reports. Despite familiarity with some aspects of the scenarios we proposed, many of our participants agreed that they would likely seek consultation from a genetics specialist after viewing the test reports. In addition, participants offered design and content recommendations.

In this paper, we present recommendations made to the WHO by the ICD revision's Quality and Safety Topic Advisory Group (Q&S TAG) for a new conceptual approach to capturing healthcare-related harms and injuries in ICD-coded data. The Q&S TAG has grouped causes of healthcare-related harm and injuries into four categories that relate to the source of the event: (a) medications and substances, (b) procedures, (c) devices and (d) other aspects of care. Under the proposed multiple coding approach, one of these sources of harm must be coded as part of a cluster of three codes to depict, respectively, a healthcare activity as a 'source' of harm, a 'mode or mechanism' of harm and a consequence of the event summarized by these codes (i.e. injury or harm). Use of this framework depends on the implementation of a new and potentially powerful code-clustering mechanism in ICD-11.

In particular, at least two psychological health conditions-posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)-have become more common, with prevalence estimates up to 20 percent for PTSD and 37 percent for MDD. Delivering quality care to service members with these conditions is a high-priority goal for the military health system (MHS). Meeting this goal requires understanding the extent to which the care the MHS provides is consistent with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and its own standards for quality. To better understand these issues, RAND Corporation researchers developed a framework to identify and classify a set of measures for monitoring the quality of care provided by the MHS for PTSD and MDD. The goal of this project was to identify, develop, and describe a set of candidate quality measures to assess care for PTSD and MDD. To accomplish this goal, the authors performed two tasks: (1) developed a conceptual framework for assessing the quality of care for psychological health conditions and (2) identified a candidate set of measures for monitoring, assessing, and improving the quality of care for PTSD and MDD. This article describes their research approach and the candidate measure sets for PTSD and MDD that they identified.

Little is also known about the effectiveness of existing policies and other efforts to improve access to services among this population. To help fill these gaps, a team of RAND researchers conducted a geospatial analysis using TRICARE and other data, finding that roughly 300,000 military service members and 1 million dependents are geographically distant from behavioral health care, and an analysis of claims data indicated that remoteness is associated with lower use of specialty behavioral health care. A review of existing policies and programs discovered guidelines for access to care, but no systematic monitoring of adherence to those guidelines, limiting their value. RAND researchers recommend implementing a geospatial data portal and monitoring system to track access to care in the military population and mark progress toward improvements in access to care.

Greater integration of mental health and primary medical care services at the clinic and system levels could address this need. In New York state, there are several ongoing initiatives that promote integrated care for adults with serious mental illness, provided or coordinated by community mental health center staff. This study examines three initiatives. Data were collected by RAND through site visits and surveys of mental health clinic administrators and associated professionals. Results showed that Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration grantees developed infrastructure that supported a broad scope of primary and preventive health care services; these broad changes appeared to contribute to clinic-wide culture shifts toward integration and shared accountability for consumers' \"whole person\" health. Clinics participating in the Medicaid Incentive tended to implement only those services for which they could bill, which resulted in newly identified consumer physical health care needs but did not help consumers to connect to physical health care services. Finally, while administrators and providers were optimistic that Medicaid Health Homes have potential to improve access to care for adults with serious mental illness, the newness of the initiative made it difficult to assess the degree to which Health Home networks would meet these goals. We conclude with recommendations to state policymakers, clinical providers, and technical assistance providers and recommendations for future research, all designed to strengthen New York state's integrated care initiatives for adults with serious mental illness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deborah M", "Last Name": "Scharf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Breslau", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole Schmidt", "Last Name": "Hackbarth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Kusuke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "B Lynette", "Last Name": "Staplefoote", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Rand health quarterly", "PubDate": "2014Dec30"}, {"PMID": "28560076", "Title": "Evaluation of the SAMHSA Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI) Grant Program: Final Report.", "Abstract": "Excess morbidity and mortality in persons with serious mental illness is a public health crisis. Numerous factors contribute to this health disparity, including illness and treatment-related factors, socioeconomic and lifestyle-related factors, and limited access to and poor quality of general medical care. Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI), one of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's service grant programs, is intended to improve the overall wellness and physical health status of people with serious mental illness, including individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders, by making available an array of coordinated primary care services in community mental health and other community-based behavioral health settings where the population already receives care. This article describes the results of a RAND Corporation evaluation of the PBHCI grants program. The evaluation was designed to understand PBHCI implementation strategies and processes, whether the program leads to improvements in outcomes, and which program models and/or model features lead to better program processes and consumer outcomes. Results of the evaluation showed that PBHCI grantee programs were diverse, varying in their structures, procedures, and the extent to which primary and behavioral health care was integrated at the program level. Overall, PBHCI programs also served many consumers with high rates of physical health care needs, although total program enrollment was lower than expected. The results of a small, comparative effectiveness study showed that consumers served at PBHCI clinics (compared to those served at matched control clinics) showed improvements on some (e.g., markers of dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes) but not all of the physical health indicators studied (e.g., smoking, weight). Finally, we found that program features, such as clinic hours, regular staff meetings, and the degree of service integration, increased consumer access to integrated care, but that access to integrated care was not directly associated with improvements in physical health. Implications of the study results for programs and the broader field, plus options for future PBHCI-related research are discussed.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deborah M", "Last Name": "Scharf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole K", "Last Name": "Eberhart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole Schmidt", "Last Name": "Hackbarth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marcela", "Last Name": "Horvitz-Lennon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Beckman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bing", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan L", "Last Name": "Lovejoy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M Audrey", "Last Name": "Burnam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Rand health quarterly", "PubDate": "2014Dec30"}, {"PMID": "25488628", "Title": "Rural urban comparisons: heterogeneity and methodological limitations.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Rural Population", "Urban Population"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Breslau", "Affiliation": "RAND Corporation, USA."}, {"First Name": "Grant", "Last Name": "Marshall", "Affiliation": "RAND Corporation, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harold", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "RAND Corporation and Columbia University, Department of Psychiatry Ryan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "RAND Corporation, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of psychiatric research", "PubDate": "2015Feb"}, {"PMID": "25310537", "Title": "Measuring quality of mental health care: an international comparison.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Consensus", "Developed Countries", "Humans", "International Agencies", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services", "Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care", "Quality Assurance, Health Care", "Quality Indicators, Health Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brigitta", "Last Name": "Spaeth-Rublee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. bspaeth@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. pincush@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Fran", "Last Name": "Silvestri", "Affiliation": "The International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership, Millen Ave, Pakuranga 2010, New Zealand. fran@iimhl.com."}, {"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "The International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership, Millen Ave, Pakuranga 2010, New Zealand. janet@iimhl.com."}], "Journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "PubDate": "2014Oct10"}, {"PMID": "24951953", "Title": "Measuring the quality of mental health care: consensus perspectives from selected industrialized countries.", "Abstract": "This international initiative sought to develop a consensus framework of mental health quality measures.

For adolescents, no association was observed between urbanicity and the prevalence of major depression, with or without statistical adjustments. For adults, no differences were found in the prevalence of major depression or serious mental illness between large metropolitan areas and rural areas, but the prevalence of both was slightly higher in the two intermediate urbanicity categories than in large metropolitan areas, with statistically significant odds ratios after adjustment ranging from 1.12 to 1.19. Contrary to expectations, the prevalence of mental disorders was not higher in the most urban compared with the most rural areas, suggesting that the move to identify mechanistic explanations for risk associated with the urban environment is premature.

researchers or research setting that are associated with translation into patient benefit, in the particular case of schizophrenia. The study combined two methods: forward-tracing case studies to examine where scientific advances of 20 years ago have led to impact today; and backward-tracing perspectives to identify the research antecedents of today's interventions in schizophrenia. These research and impact trails are followed principally in Canada, the UK and the USA. The headline findings are as follows: The case studies and perspectives support the view that mental health research has led to a diverse and beneficial range of academic, health, social and economic impacts over the 20 years since the research was undertaken.Clinical research has had a larger impact on patient care than basic research has over the 20 years since the research was undertaken.Those involved in mental health research who work across boundaries are associated with wider health and social benefits.Committed individuals, motivated by patient need, who effectively champion research agendas and/or translation into practice are key in driving the development and implementation of interventions.This study provides an overview of the methods and presents the full set of findings, with the policy provocations they raise, and an emerging research agenda.

Barriers to SDM included discordant models of illness, stigma, varying role expectations and decision readiness. Respondents reported strategies used to overcome barriers including understanding illness perceptions and the role of the community in the treatment process, dispelling stigma using cultural terms, orienting patients to treatment and remaining available regarding the treatment decision. Findings from this study have implications for planning SDM interventions to guide primary care providers through treatment engagement for depression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Black or African American", "Decision Making", "Depression", "Female", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "New York City", "Physicians, Primary Care", "Primary Health Care", "Stereotyping"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sapana R", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "The New York State Psychiatric Institute, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, USA, sp2309@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Schnall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Virna", "Last Name": "Little", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of immigrant and minority health", "PubDate": "2014Dec"}, {"PMID": "24084917", "Title": "Investing in evidence-based care for the severely mentally ill.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Insurance Coverage", "Medicaid", "Medically Uninsured", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services", "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "Quality of Health Care", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Olfson", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. mo49@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Harold A", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Herbert", "Last Name": "Pardes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "JAMA", "PubDate": "2013Oct02"}, {"PMID": "24043282", "Title": "Evidence for the management of adolescent depression.", "Abstract": "Adolescent depression is a prevalent and disabling condition resulting in emotional suffering and social and educational dysfunction.

This creates a gap in research training at a critical developmental stage. In response, Columbia University Medical Center's Department of Psychiatry, in partnership with the New York State Psychiatric Institute, has created a formal Research Track Program (RTP) for psychiatry residents so that interested individuals can maintain their attention on research training during formative residency years. Clinical and research training are integrated through core clinical rotations on research units. With protected research time and clear developmental milestones for each year of training, the RTP allows research track residents to meet both clinical and research training goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. In coordination with existing postdoctoral research fellowship programs, research track residents can effectively jump-start fellowship training with advanced course work and consistent, continuous mentorship bridging residency and fellowship years. A key element of the program is its provision of core training in research literacy and extensive research opportunities for all residents, stimulating research interest across the whole residency program. Supported by the National Institutes of Health and a private foundation, this RTP capitalizes on a unique academic-private partnership to address many of the challenges facing physician-scientists. By integrating clinical and research exposures and offering protected research time, careful mentoring, and financial resources, the program aims to further the development of those most poised to establish careers in translational research.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Curriculum", "Internship and Residency", "Translational Research, Biomedical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melissa R", "Last Name": "Arbuckle", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, USA. ma2063@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harold A", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria A", "Last Name": "Oquendo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "23584674", "Title": "Integrating primary care into community behavioral health settings: programs and early implementation experiences.", "Abstract": "This article describes the characteristics and early implementation experiences of community behavioral health agencies that received Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI) grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to integrate primary care into programs for adults with serious mental illness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Community Mental Health Services", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "Female", "Health Plan Implementation", "Health Planning Support", "Health Services Research", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Personnel Selection", "Primary Health Care", "Program Evaluation", "Referral and Consultation", "United States", "United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deborah M", "Last Name": "Scharf", "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioral Health Sciences, RAND Corporation, 4570 Fifth Ave., Suite 600, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. dscharf@rand.org"}, {"First Name": "Nicole K", "Last Name": "Eberhart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine A", "Last Name": "Vaughan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Trina", "Last Name": "Dutta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harold Alan", "Last Name": "Pincus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M Audrey", "Last Name": "Burnam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)", "PubDate": "2013Jul01"}, {"PMID": "23188486", "Title": "Behavioral health and health care reform models: patient-centered medical home, health home, and accountable care organization.", "Abstract": "Discussions of health care delivery and payment reforms have largely been silent about how behavioral health could be incorporated into reform initiatives.
