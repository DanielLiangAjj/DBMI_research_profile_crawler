[{"PMID": "38937430", "Title": "Why do adolescents attempt suicide? Insights from leading ideation-to-action suicide theories: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, and recent suicide theories have sought to clarify the factors that facilitate the transition from suicide ideation to action. Specifically, the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS), Integrated Motivational-Volitional Model (IMV), and Three Step Theory (3ST) have highlighted risk factors central to the formation of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors, which is necessary for suicide death. However, these models were initially developed and tested among adults, and given core socioemotional and neurodevelopmental differences in adolescents, the applicability of these models remains unclear. Directly addressing this gap in knowledge, this systematic review aimed to (1) describe the evidence of leading ideation-to-action theories (i.e., IPTS, IMV, 3ST) as they relate to suicide risk among adolescents, (2) integrate ideation-to-action theories within prevailing biological frameworks of adolescent suicide, and (3) provide recommendations for future adolescent suicide research. Overall, few studies provided a complete test of models in adolescent samples, and empirical research testing components of these theories provided mixed support. Future research would benefit from integrating neurodevelopmental and developmentally sensitive psychosocial frameworks to increase the applicability of ideation-to-action theories to adolescents. Further, utilizing real-time monitoring approaches may serve to further clarify the temporal association among risk factors and suicide.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adolescent", "Suicidal Ideation", "Suicide, Attempted", "Risk Factors", "Psychological Theory", "Adolescent Behavior", "Models, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jaclyn S", "Last Name": "Kirshenbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alma", "Last Name": "Bitran", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. rpa2009@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Translational psychiatry", "PubDate": "2024Jun27"}, {"PMID": "38722593", "Title": "The effects of family support and smartphone-derived homestay on daily mood and depression among sexual and gender minority adolescents.", "Abstract": "Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are at elevated risk for depression. This risk is especially pronounced among adolescents whose home environment is unsupportive or nonaffirming, as these adolescents may face familial rejection due to their identity. Therefore, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying this risk by probing temporally sensitive associations between negative mood and time spent in potentially hostile home environments. The current study included adolescents (N = 141; 43% SGM; 13-18 years old), oversampled for depression history, who completed clinical interviews assessing lifetime psychiatric history and depression severity as well as self-report measures of social support. Participants also installed an app on their personal smartphones, which assessed their daily mood and geolocation-determined mobility patterns over a 6-month follow-up period. Over the 6-month follow-up period, SGM adolescents reported elevated depression severity and lower daily mood relative to non-SGM youth. Interestingly, SGM adolescents who reported low family support experienced lower daily mood than non-SGM adolescents, particularly on days when they spent more time at home. Current findings reinforce evidence for disparities in depression severity among SGM adolescents and highlight family support as a key factor. Specifically, more time spent in home environments with low family support was associated with worse mood among SGM adolescents. These results underscore the need for clinical interventions to support SGM youth, particularly interventions that focus on familial relationships and social support within the home environment.

However, few human studies have probed stress-induced neural activation changes in relation to anhedonia, which is critical for clarifying risk for affective disorders. Participants (N\u2009=\u200985, 12-14\u2009years-old, 53 female), oversampled for risk of depression, were administered clinical assessments and completed an fMRI guessing task during a baseline (no-stress) period to probe neural response to receipt of rewards and losses.

Including baseline, participants provided up to 10 self-report assessments of life stress and symptoms over a 2\u2009year period. Linear mixed-effects models estimated whether change in neural activation (post- vs. pre-acute stressor) moderated the longitudinal associations between life stress and symptoms.

Linked-mastoid surface potentials (ERPs) and their corresponding reference-free current source densities (CSDs) were quantified by temporal principal components analysis (PCA). Each PCA solution revealed a midfrontal feedback negativity (FN; peak around 310\u2009ms) and a posterior feedback-P3 (fb-P3; 380\u2009ms) as two distinct reward processing stages. Unbiased permutation tests and multilevel modeling of component scores revealed greater FN to loss than win and neutral for all stratification groups, confirming FN sensitivity to valence. Likewise, all groups had greater fb-P3 to win and loss than neutral, confirming that fb-P3 indexes motivational salience and allocation of attention. By contrast, group effects were subtle, dependent on data transformation (ERP, CSD), and did not confirm reduced FN or fb-P3 for at-risk individuals. Instead, CSD-based fb-P3 was overall reduced in individuals with than without MDD history, whereas ERP-based fb-P3 was greater for high-risk individuals than for low-risk individuals for monetary, but not neutral outcomes.

We recruited children (N\u00a0=\u00a065) ages 4-10-years-old, of which 47.7 % (n\u00a0=\u00a031) reported a maternal history of MDD, and their biological mother (N\u00a0=\u00a065). Children performed a child-friendly Go/NoGo task while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded, and mothers performed a Flanker task. Children exhibited heightened sensitivity to error versus correct responses, which was characterized by an error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe) as well as prominent delta and frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations. Interestingly, worse maternal performance on the Flanker task associated with an increased Go/NoGo error rate and a smaller ERN and Pe in children. However, there was no association between maternal or child control indices with child depression symptoms.

A promising approach to detecting adolescent depression in real-time and at a large scale is through their social communication on the smartphone (e.g., text messages, social media posts). Past research has shown that language from online social communication reliably indicates interindividual differences in depression. To move toward detecting the emergence of depression symptoms intraindividually, the present study tested whether sentiment (i.e., words connoting positive and negative affect) from smartphone social communication prospectively predicted daily mood fluctuations in 83 adolescents (Mage = 16.49, 73.5% female) with a wide range of depression severity. Participants completed daily mood ratings across a 90-day period, during which 354,278 messages were passively collected from social communication apps. Greater positive sentiment (i.e., more positive weighted composite valence score and a greater proportion of words expressing positive sentiment) predicted more positive next-day mood, controlling for previous-day mood. Moreover, greater proportions of positive and negative sentiment were, respectively, associated with lower anhedonia and greater dysphoria symptoms measured at baseline. Exploratory analyses of nonaffective linguistic features showed that greater use of social engagement words (e.g., friends and affiliation) and emojis (primarily consisting of hearts) predicted more positive changes in mood. Collectively, findings suggest that language from smartphone social communication can detect mood fluctuations in adolescents, laying the foundation for language-based tools to identify periods of heightened depression risk.

Participants (N=85, 12-14-years-old, 53 female), oversampled for risk of depression, were administered clinical assessments and completed an fMRI guessing task to probe neural response to receipt of rewards and losses. After the initial task run, participants received an acute stressor and then, were re-administered the guessing task. Including baseline, participants provided up to 10 self-report assessments of life stress and symptoms over a 2-year period. Linear mixed-effects models estimated whether change in neural activation (post- vs. pre-acute stressor) moderated the longitudinal associations between life stress and symptoms over time. Primary analyses indicated that adolescents with stress-related reductions in right ventral striatum response to rewards exhibited stronger longitudinal associations between life stress and anhedonia severity pFDR=.048. Secondary analyses showed that longitudinal associations among life stress and depression severity were moderated by stress-related increases in dorsal striatum response to rewards pFDR<.002. Additionally, longitudinal associations among life stress and anxiety severity were moderated by stress-related reductions in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and right anterior insula response to loss pFDR\u2264.012.

Central to MDD recurrence are the disorder's negative information processing biases, such as heightened responses to errors, which may subsequently impair abilities to monitor performance and adjust behaviors based on environmental demands. However, little is known regarding the neurophysiological correlates of post-error adaptation in depression. The current study investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral performance following errors from a flanker task in 58 participants with remitted MDD (rMDD) and 118 healthy controls (HC). Specifically, using trial-level data, we tested: (a) the impact of errors on response-locked ERPs of the current and post-error trials (error-related negativity [ERN] and correct response negativity [CRN]) and (b) longer-term adaptation to errors (ERN/CRN) over the course of the task. Compared to HC, rMDD participants showed a larger ERN to the current trial and smaller habituation in ERN over time. On trials immediately following errors, rMDD participants showed slower reaction times that were predicted by the previous-trial ERN amplitude but comparable accuracy to HC, suggesting a deficient ability to disengage from errors and/or a compensatory effort to mitigate accuracy decrements. Critically, this pattern of responding: (a) was concurrently associated with greater levels of anhedonia symptoms, more severe MDD history, and interpersonal impairment (but lower impairment in life activities) and (b) predicted more anhedonia symptoms at one-year follow-up. Collectively, a hyperactive performance monitoring system may be a useful risk marker for future MDD recurrence.", "Keywords": ["Anhedonia", "Depression", "Error-related negativity", "Multilevel modeling", "Performance monitoring", "Post-error adaptation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Anhedonia", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials", "Reaction Time"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lilian Y", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.

Accordingly, there is a critical need to develop novel interventions, particularly ones that target neural mechanisms believed to potentiate depressive symptoms. Directly addressing this gap, we developed mindfulness-based fMRI neurofeedback (mbNF) for adolescents that aims to reduce default mode network (DMN) hyperconnectivity, which has been implicated in the onset and maintenance of MDD. In this proof-of-concept study, adolescents (n\u2009=\u20099) with a lifetime history of depression and/or anxiety were administered clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires, and each participant's DMN and central executive network (CEN) were personalized using a resting state fMRI localizer. After the localizer scan, adolescents completed a brief mindfulness training followed by a mbNF session in the scanner wherein they were instructed to volitionally reduce DMN relative to CEN activation by practicing mindfulness meditation. Several promising findings emerged. First, mbNF successfully engaged the target brain state during neurofeedback; participants spent more time in the target state with DMN activation lower than CEN activation. Second, in each of the nine adolescents, mbNF led to significantly reduced within-DMN connectivity, which correlated with post-mbNF increases in state mindfulness. Last, a reduction of within-DMN connectivity mediated the association between better mbNF performance and increased state mindfulness. These findings demonstrate that personalized mbNF can effectively and non-invasively modulate the intrinsic networks associated with the emergence and persistence of depressive symptoms during adolescence.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adolescent", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Pilot Projects", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mindfulness", "Neurofeedback", "Default Mode Network", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Neural Pathways"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiahe", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. j.zhang@northeastern.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jovicarole", "Last Name": "Raya", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Morfini", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zoi", "Last Name": "Urban", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anastasia", "Last Name": "Yendiki", "Affiliation": "Athinoula A.

The purpose of this article is to provide a brief report of the challenges, opportunities, and solutions from some of the ILHBN's cross-study data harmonization efforts. We review the process through which harmonization challenges and opportunities motivated the development of tools and collection of metadata within the ILHBN. A variety of strategies have been adopted within the ILHBN to facilitate harmonization of ecological momentary assessment, location, accelerometer, and participant engagement data while preserving theory-driven heterogeneity and data privacy considerations. Several tools have been developed by the ILHBN to resolve challenges in integrating ILD across multiple data streams and time scales both within and across studies.

At baseline, remitted depressed adults (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 24) were administered clinical interviews and completed self-report symptom measures. Then, smartphone apps were installed on personal smartphones to acquire geolocation data over 21 days and ecological momentary assessment of positive and negative affect during the initial 14-day period. Compared with healthy controls, remitted depressed adults exhibited reduced circadian routine (regularity of one's daily routine) and lower average daily distance traveled. Further, reduced distance traveled associated with greater daily negative affect after controlling for depression severity; however, this effect was not more pronounced among remitted adults. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression indicated that a linear combination of circadian routine, average distance traveled, and baseline depression severity classified remitted depressed individuals with 72% accuracy; outperforming models restricted to either geolocation or clinical measures alone. Mobile sensing approaches hold enormous promise to improve clinical care for depressive disorders. Although barriers remain, leveraging technological advancements related to real-time monitoring can improve treatment for depressed patients and potentially, reduce high rates of recurrence.

Mental health problems can seriously impact students' functioning, interpersonal relationships, and academic achievement. Actively reaching out to college students with mental health problems and offering them internet-based interventions may be a promising way of providing low-threshold access to evidence-based treatment in colleges. This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of a guided web-based transdiagnostic individually tailored Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) in treating college students with depression and/or anxiety symptoms. Through an online survey that screened college students' mental health, we recruited 100 college students aged \u226518 years who reported mild to moderate depression and/or anxiety symptoms and were attending colleges in the Netherlands. Participants were randomly allocated to guided iCBT (n\u00a0=\u00a048) or treatment as usual (TAU) control (n\u00a0=\u00a052). Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression and anxiety measured at post-treatment (7 weeks post-randomization). We also measured all outcomes at 6- and 12-months post-randomization. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle and were repeated using the complete-case sample. We found no evidence of a difference between the effects of guided iCBT and TAU in any of the examined outcomes (i.e., symptoms of depression and anxiety, quality of life, educational achievement, and college dropout) across all time points (p\u00a0>\u00a0.05). There was no evidence that effects of iCBT were associated with treatment satisfaction and adherence. More research into transdiagnostic individually tailored iCBT is necessary.

At baseline, healthy control subjects (HC; n\u00a0=\u00a020) and adults with SAD (n\u00a0=\u00a029), ages 19-43 years, completed the Flanker Task while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. SAD participants then received up to 12 sessions over 8 weeks of GC-MRT, designed to train participants' attention away from threatening and toward neutral faces. Clinical assessments were completed 9- (post-treatment) and 20-weeks (follow-up) after initiating the treatment. At baseline, compared to HC, SAD performed the task more accurately and exhibited increased error-related negativity (ERN) and delta power to error commission. After controlling for age and baseline symptoms, more negative ERN and increased frontal midline theta (FMT) predicted reduced self-reported social anxiety symptoms at post-treatment, and FMT also predicted clinician-rated and self-reported symptom reduction at the follow-up assessment.

Research in depressed adults has shown evidence of hemispheric asymmetry for posterior alpha power, however, the resting posterior alpha-depression link among adolescents remains unclear. To clarify the role of posterior alpha among depressed adolescents, the current study acquired eyes-closed 128-channel resting EEG data from 13 to 18 year-old depressed (n\u00a0=\u00a031) and healthy (n\u00a0=\u00a035) female adolescents. Results indicated a significant group by hemisphere interaction, as depressed adolescents exhibited significantly larger posterior alpha (i.e., lower brain activity) over the right versus left hemisphere, whereas healthy adolescents showed no hemispheric differences. Relatively greater alpha over the right versus left hemisphere correlated with depression symptoms, anhedonia symptoms, rumination, and self-criticism. Further, depressed adolescents had reduced overall posterior alpha compared to healthy youth; though, no associations with symptoms and related traits emerged. Resting posterior alpha may be a promising neurophysiological index of adolescent depression, and more broadly, may relate to risk factors characterized by enhanced perseveration.", "Keywords": ["Adolescence", "Alpha asymmetry", "Anhedonia", "Major depression", "Rumination", "Self-criticism", "Suicidal behaviors", "Suicidal ideation"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Alpha Rhythm", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Rest", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Akina", "Last Name": "Umemoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lidia Y X", "Last Name": "Panier", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sally L", "Last Name": "Cole", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "J\u00fcrgen", "Last Name": "Kayser", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Diego A", "Last Name": "Pizzagalli", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, USA; Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research, McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Division of Clinical Developmental Neuroscience, Sackler Institute, USA.

Previously, we demonstrated an altered pattern of resting state connectivity between the dorsal and ventral posterior cingulate cortex (d/vPCC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), as well as altered low frequency oscillations in these regions, in individuals with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) compared to healthy controls. It remains uncertain, however, whether these markers were directly related to STBs or, more generally, reflect a trait-level risk factor for depression. Here, we examined data from a 3-generational longitudinal study of depression where resting state fMRI data were analyzed from 2nd and 3rd generation offspring of probands with (FH+\u2009=\u200944: STB+\u2009=\u200932, STB-\u2009=\u200912) and without (FH-\u2009=\u200925: STB+\u2009=\u200915, STB-\u2009=\u200910) a family history of major depressive disorder (MDD). Standard seed-based methods and a frequency-based analysis of intrinsic neural activity (ALFF/fALFF) were employed. FH of MDD, but not a personal history of STBs or MDD, was associated with relatively reduced dPCC-dACC, and enhanced vPCC-dACC functional connectivity. FH of MDD showed a pattern of reduced ALFF in the dPCC whereas an STB history was associated with an increase. All findings were invariant to confounding by lifetime MDD and current depression severity. Overall, contrary to predictions, resting state functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) was associated with FH of depression rather than STBs. These findings confirm the relevance of DMN functional connectivity for mood disorders and underscore the importance of disambiguating biological factors that differentially relate to mental disorders versus STBs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Default Mode Network", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Suicide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Henry W", "Last Name": "Chase", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Brent", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Posner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Myrna M", "Last Name": "Weissman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ardesheer", "Last Name": "Talati", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. adi.talati@nyspi.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2021Sep"}, {"PMID": "33965516", "Title": "Reward-Related Neural Circuitry in Depressed and Anxious Adolescents: A Human Connectome Project.", "Abstract": "Although depression and anxiety often have distinct etiologies, they frequently co-occur in adolescence.

Although most studies examining reward processing have focused on monetary rewards, recent research also has tested neural reactivity to social rewards (e.g., positive social feedback). However, the majority of these studies only include two feedback valences (e.g., acceptance, rejection). Yet, social evaluation is rarely binary (positive vs. negative) and people often give 'on the fence' or neutral evaluations of others. Processing of this type of social feedback may be ambiguous and impacted by factors such as psychopathology, self-esteem, and prior experiences of rejection. Thus, the present study probed the reward positivity (RewP), P300, and late positive potential (LPP) following acceptance, rejection, and \"one the fence\" [between acceptance and rejection] feedback in undergraduate students (n = 45). Results indicated that the RewP showed more positive amplitudes following acceptance compared to both rejection and \"on the fence\" feedback, and the RewP was larger (i.e., more positive) following rejection relative to \"on the fence\" feedback. In contrast, the P300 did not differ between rejection and \"on the fence\" feedback, and both were reduced compared to acceptance. The LPP was blunted in response to rejection relative to acceptance and \"on the fence\" feedback (which did not differ from each other). Exploratory analyses demonstrated that greater self-reported rejection sensitivity was associated with a reduced LPP to acceptance. Taken together, these findings suggest that the neural systems underlying the RewP, P300, and LPP may evaluate \"on the fence\" social feedback differently, and that individuals high on rejection sensitivity may exhibit reduced attention toward and elaborative processing of social acceptance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carter J", "Last Name": "Funkhouser", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Autumn", "Last Name": "Kujawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University."}, {"First Name": "Sylvia A", "Last Name": "Morelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "K Luan", "Last Name": "Phan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Stewart A", "Last Name": "Shankman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Illinois at Chicago."}], "Journal": "Journal of psychophysiology", "PubDate": "2020Oct"}, {"PMID": "33789457", "Title": "The Elusive Phenotype of Preadolescent Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors: Can Neuroimaging Deliver on Its Promise?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Neuroimaging", "Suicide and Self-Harm"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Neuroimaging", "Phenotype", "Schools", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Suicidal Ideation", "Suicide, Attempted"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (Auerbach);

Neuroimaging studies have shown abnormal cerebral cortical activation and connectivity in this patient population. The specific role of cerebellar output circuitry, specifically the dentate nuclei (DN), in adolescent anxiety disorders remains largely unexplored. Resting-state functional connectivity analyses have parcellated the DN, the major output nuclei of the cerebellum, into three functional territories (FTs) that include default-mode, salience-motor, and visual networks. The objective of this study was to understand whether FTs of the DN are implicated in adolescent anxiety disorders. Forty-one adolescents (mean age 15.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.82, 26 females) with one or more anxiety disorders and 55 age- and gender-matched healthy controls completed resting-state fMRI scans and a self-report survey on anxiety symptoms. Seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analyses were performed using the FTs from DN parcellation. Brain connectivity metrics were then correlated with State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) measures within each group. Adolescents with an anxiety disorder showed significant hyperconnectivity between salience-motor DN FT and cerebral cortical salience-motor regions compared to controls. Salience-motor FT connectivity with cerebral cortical sensorimotor regions was significantly correlated with STAI-trait scores in HC (R2\u2009=\u20090.41). Here, we report DN functional connectivity differences in adolescents diagnosed with anxiety, as well as in HC with variable degrees of anxiety traits.

"The college years are stressful for many students. Identifying the sources of stress and their relative importance in leading to clinically significant emotional problems may assist in the development of targeted stress management interventions. The current report examines the distribution and associations of perceived stress across major life areas with 12-month prevalence of common mental disorders in a cross-national sample of first-year college students. The 20,842 respondents were from 24 universities in 9 countries that participated in the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student Initiative. Logistic regression analysis examined associations of current perceived stress in six life areas (financial situation, health, love life, relationships with family, relationships at work/school, problems experienced by loved ones) with six types of 12-month mental disorders (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder). Population attributable risk proportions (PARPs) were calculated to estimate the upper-bound potential effects of interventions focused on perceived stress in reducing prevalence of mental disorders. The majority of students (93.7%) reported at least some stress in at least one of the six areas. A significant dose-response association was found between extent of stress in each life area and increased odds of at least one of the six disorders. The multivariable models that included all stress measures were significant for all disorders (F = 20.6-70.6, p < 0.001). Interpretation of PARPs as representing causal effects of stresses on disorders suggests that up to 46.9-80.0% of 12-month disorder prevalence might be eliminated if stress prevention interventions were developed to block the associations of stress with these disorders.", "Keywords": ["anxiety disorders", "college students", "mental disorder", "mood disorders", "stress", "substance use disorders"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eirini", "Last Name": "Karyotaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pim", "Last Name": "Cuijpers", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical, Neuro and Developmental Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Yesica", "Last Name": "Albor", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiologic and Psychosocial Research, National Institute of Psychiatry Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente Mu\u00f1iz, Mexico City, Mexico."}, {"First Name": "Jordi", "Last Name": "Alonso", "Affiliation": "Health Services Research Unit, IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Bantjes", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Ronny", "Last Name": "Bruffaerts", "Affiliation": "Universitair Psychiatrisch Centrum - Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ebert", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Penelope", "Last Name": "Hasking", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Glenn", "Last Name": "Kiekens", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health Psychiatry, Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Sue", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "McLafferty", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Ulster University, Londonderry, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Mak", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Mortier", "Affiliation": "Health Services Research Unit, IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Nancy A", "Last Name": "Sampson", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dan J", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health and South African Medical Council Research Unit on Risk and Resilience in Mental Disorders, University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Gemma", "Last Name": "Vilagut", "Affiliation": "Health Services Research Unit, IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Ronald C", "Last Name": "Kessler", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32782140", "Title": "Neural Correlates Associated With Suicide and Nonsuicidal Self-injury in Youth.", "Abstract": "There is no definitive neural marker of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) or nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), and relative to adults, research in youth is more limited.

Forty-seven articles were reviewed (STBs\u00a0= 27; NSSI\u00a0= 20), and notably, 63% of STB articles and 45% of NSSI articles were published in the previous 3 years. Structural magnetic resonance imaging research suggests reduced volume in the ventral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices among youth reporting STBs, and there is reduced anterior cingulate cortex volume related to STBs and NSSI. With regard to functional alterations, blunted striatal activation may characterize STB and NSSI youth, and there is reduced frontolimbic task-based connectivity in suicide ideators and attempters. Resting-state functional connectivity findings highlight reduced positive connectivity between the default mode network and salience network in attempters and show that self-injurers exhibit frontolimbic alterations. Together, suicidal and nonsuicidal behaviors are related to top-down and bottom-up neural alterations, which may compromise approach, avoidance, and regulatory systems.

The current report investigates this by examining associations of summary physical and mental health scores from the widely-used Short-Form 12 (SF-12) Health Survey with self-reported academic role functioning in a self-report survey of 3,855 first-year students from five universities in the northeastern United States (US; mean age 18.5; 53.0% female). The mean SF-12 physical component summary (PCS) score (55.1) was half a standard deviation above the benchmark US adult population mean. The mean SF-12 mental component summary (MCS) score (38.2) was more than a full standard deviation below the US adult population mean. Two-thirds of students (67.1%) reported at least mild and 10.5% severe health-related academic role impairment on a modified version of the Sheehan Disability Scale. Both PCS and MCS scores were significantly and inversely related to these impairment scores, but with nonlinearities and interactions and much stronger associations involving MCS than PCS.

However, among vulnerable adolescents, peer evaluation can be detrimental, contributing to affective disorders. It is, therefore, critical to improve our understanding of neural underpinnings of peer evaluation. Prior research has investigated averaged neural responses to peer acceptance or rejection, neglecting to probe trial-by-trial computations that mirror real-time updating of daily activities. In non-social decision-making, a common neural valuation system centered on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has emerged, which evaluates different reward types on a common scale to guide choices. However, it is unclear whether the mPFC also tracks complex social scenarios involving peer feedback. To address this gap, we acquired fMRI data from 55 healthy adolescents during the Chatroom Task, which probes peer evaluation, and implemented a computational approach to characterize trial-by-trial social value, thereby allowing us to interrogate the neural correlates of social value. Consistent with our hypothesis, social value signals were encoded in the mPFC. Interestingly, analyses also revealed a wider social-specific valuation network including the precuneus and amygdala.

has identified two resting EEG biomarkers with potential for predicting functional outcomes in depression: theta current density in frontal brain regions (especially rostral anterior cingulate cortex) and alpha power over posterior scalp regions. As little is known about the discriminant and convergent validity of these putative biomarkers, a thorough evaluation of these psychometric properties was conducted toward the goal of improving clinical utility of these markers. Resting 71-channel EEG recorded from 35 healthy adults at two sessions (1-week retest) were used to systematically compare different quantification techniques for theta and alpha sources at scalp (surface Laplacian or current source density [CSD]) and brain (distributed inverse; exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography [eLORETA]) level. Signal quality was evaluated with signal-to-noise ratio, participant-level spectra, and frequency PCA covariance decomposition. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed within a multitrait-multimethod framework. Posterior alpha was reliably identified as two spectral components, each with unique spatial patterns and condition effects (eyes open/closed), high signal quality, and good convergent and discriminant validity. In contrast, frontal theta was characterized by one low-variance component, low signal quality, lack of a distinct spectral peak, and mixed validity. Correlations between candidate biomarkers suggest that posterior alpha components constitute reliable, convergent, and discriminant biometrics in healthy adults.

Using time-frequency decomposition, we isolated distinct frequency bands sensitive to wins (delta = < 3Hz) and losses (theta = 4 Hz to 7 Hz). Compared with BPD participants, HCs showed significantly larger delta power to wins, specifically. The groups did not differ in delta power to losses, nor theta power to wins or losses. Collectively, findings implicate altered reward processing in the pathophysiology of BPD and may inform early identification and targeted intervention.

In depressed adults, abnormalities in the dynamic functioning of frontoinsular networks, in particular, have been observed and linked to negative rumination. Thus, network dynamics may provide new insight into teen pathophysiology. Here, adolescents (n\u2009=\u200945, ages 13-19) with varying severity of depressive symptoms completed a resting-state functional MRI scan. Functional networks were evaluated using co-activation pattern analysis to identify whole-brain states of spatial co-activation that recurred across participants and time. Measures included: dwell time (proportion of scan spent in that network state), persistence (volume-to-volume maintenance of a network state), and transitions (frequency of moving from state A to state B). Analyses tested associations between depression or trait rumination and dynamics of network states involving frontoinsular and default network systems. Results indicated that adolescents showing increased dwell time in, and persistence of, a frontoinsular-default network state involving insula, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior regions of default network, reported more severe symptoms of depression. Further, adolescents who transitioned more frequently between the frontoinsular-default state and a prototypical default network state reported higher depression. Increased dominance and transition frequency of frontoinsular-default network states were also associated with higher rumination, and rumination mediated the associations between network dynamics and depression. Findings support a model in which abnormal frontoinsular dynamics confer vulnerability to maladaptive introspection, which in turn contributes to symptoms of adolescent depression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Cerebral Cortex", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Rest", "Rumination, Cognitive", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roselinde H", "Last Name": "Kaiser", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, USA.

To advance understanding of the relation between stress and suicide, we examined whether specific, theoretically-pertinent life stressors were differentially related to suicidal thinking versus suicidal behaviors among hospitalized adolescents. Participants were 197 (144 female) adolescents aged 13 to 19\u00a0years old (M\u2009=\u200915.61, SD\u2009=\u20091.48) recruited from an acute residential psychiatric treatment program.

Adolescents completed the Stress and Adversity Inventory for Adolescents (Adolescent STRAIN), which assessed life events and chronic difficulties occurring in five social-psychological categories: Interpersonal Loss, Physical Danger, Humiliation, Entrapment, and Role Change/Disruption. Additionally, they completed a structured interview and symptom questionnaires to capture concurrent psychopathology. Controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, only Interpersonal Loss events distinguished attempters from psychiatric controls (OR\u2009=\u20092.27) and ideators (OR\u2009=\u20091.49); no events or difficulties differentiated ideators from controls. These effects persisted when analyses were restricted to single attempters and when events following the most recent attempt were excluded. The findings elucidate potential social-environmental triggers of suicide.

Participants were female youth (n = 53) aged 13-20 years (M = 17.00, SD = 1.89) completing a 1-month residential DBT program. At pre-treatment, participants were administered a diagnostic interview and self-report measures assessing BPD, depression, and anxiety symptom severity. Following one month of treatment, participants were re-administered the self-report instruments. Results showed significant pre- to post-treatment reductions in both BPD and depression symptom severity with large effects. However, there was no significant change in general anxious distress or anxious arousal over time. The experience of childhood abuse (sexual, physical, or both) was tested as moderator of treatment effectiveness. Although experiencing multiple types of abuse was related to symptom severity, abuse did not moderate the effects of treatment.

While prior animal and adult research has shown that stress contributes to reward dysfunction, less is known about how stress impacts reward processing in youth. Towards addressing this gap, the present study probed neural activation associated with reward processing following an acute stressor. Healthy adolescents (n = 40) completed a clinical assessment, and fMRI data were acquired while participants completed a monetary guessing task under a no-stress condition and then under a stress condition. Based on prior literature, analyses focused on a priori defined regions-of-interest, specifically the striatum (win trials) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC] and insula (loss trials). Two main findings emerged. First, reward-related neural activation (i.e., striatum) was blunted in the stress relative to the no-stress condition. Second, the stress condition also contributed to blunted neural response following reward in loss-related regions (i.e., dACC, anterior insula); however, there were no changes in loss sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of conceptualizing neural vulnerability within the presence of stress, as this may clarify risk for mental disorders during a critical period of development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Corpus Striatum", "Feedback, Psychological", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Psychology, Adolescent", "Reward", "Social Behavior", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah Hope", "Last Name": "Lincoln", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Pisoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Erin", "Last Name": "Bondy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Poornima", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Paris", "Last Name": "Singleton", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Greg", "Last Name": "Hajcak", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biomedical Sciences and Psychology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Diego A", "Last Name": "Pizzagalli", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "33015362", "Title": "Inpatient Psychiatric Care Outcomes for Adolescents: A Test of Clinical and Psychosocial Moderators.", "Abstract": "Financial pressures have led to a reduced length of stay (LOS) in inpatient psychiatric facilities for adolescents, yet research on the outcomes of short-term programs remains scant.

Participants included adolescents (n = 777) aged 13-19 years admitted to an inpatient treatment program for acute psychiatric concerns. Clinical interviews were administered to probe mental disorders and past suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), and self-report measures assessed symptom severity, child abuse, and peer victimization (i.e., bullying). Results showed a significant decrease in depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation from admission to discharge. Comorbidity, past month NSSI, and lifetime suicide attempts emerged as moderators of treatment response, and peer victimization predicted symptom severity at discharge. Although findings suggest an overall improvement, participants with more severe clinical presentations (e.g., comorbidity, past month NSSI, lifetime suicide attempts, and more severe bullying) reported greater symptom severity at admission and discharge, suggesting that these patients may benefit from longer inpatient stays to achieve further symptom reduction.

The present study reports initial results from the first stage of the WHO World Mental Health International College Student project, in which a series of surveys in 19 colleges across 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States) were carried out with the aim of estimating prevalence and basic sociodemographic correlates of common mental disorders among first-year college students. Web-based self-report questionnaires administered to incoming first-year students (45.5% pooled response rate) screened for six common lifetime and 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder. We focus on the 13,984 respondents who were full-time students: 35% of whom screened positive for at least one of the common lifetime disorders assessed and 31% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Syndromes typically had onsets in early to middle adolescence and persisted into the year of the survey. Although relatively modest, the strongest correlates of screening positive were older age, female sex, unmarried-deceased parents, no religious affiliation, nonheterosexual identification and behavior, low secondary school ranking, and extrinsic motivation for college enrollment. The weakness of these associations means that the syndromes considered are widely distributed with respect to these variables in the student population. Although the extent to which cost-effective treatment would reduce these risks is unclear, the high level of need for mental health services implied by these results represents a major challenge to institutions of higher education and governments.

Electrophysiology also has provided insight into these mechanisms through the examination of event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the P100 and LPP. It remains unclear, however, whether the P100 and LPP may be related to fear learning processes within the FPS paradigm. To this end, we tested differences in ERP amplitudes for conditioned stimuli associated (CS+) and not associated (CS-) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear acquisition. Participants included 54 female undergraduate students (mean age\u202f=\u202f20.26). The FPS response was measured via electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscle. EEG data were collected during the FPS paradigm. While the difference between CS+ and CS- P100 amplitude was not significant, LPP amplitudes were significantly enhanced following the CS+ relative to CS-. Furthermore, the LPP difference wave (CS+ minus CS-) was associated with FPS scores for the CS- during the later portion of fear acquisition. These findings suggest that conditioned stimuli may have altered emotional encoding (LPP) during the FPS paradigm. Thus, the LPP may be a promising neurophysiological marker that is related to fear learning processes.", "Keywords": ["Fear discrimination", "Fear inhibition", "Fear-potentiated startle", "Late positive potential", "P100"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Conditioning, Classical", "Electroencephalography", "Electromyography", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Neurophysiology", "Reflex, Startle", "Students", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Antonia V", "Last Name": "Seligowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA, USA.

Few investigations have been conducted to determine how task performance might be linked to cognitive functioning. The objective of the current study is to better understand this empirical gap. A total of 70 adults (30 healthy controls and 40 HP individuals) were administered an experimental task in which they listened to multispeaker babble and were instructed to report any words or chains of consecutive words (CCWs) perceived. Participants also were administered nonverbal and verbal working memory tasks. Findings revealed that relative to the control group, the HP individuals perceived more words and longer CCWs during the task. While there were no significant differences in working memory tasks between the HP and control groups, longer CCW's were associated with decreased verbal working memory scores in the HP group.

To address this gap, test-retest stability and internal consistency of behavioral indices and ERPs resulting from the EIT in healthy, female youth (n\u2009=\u200928) were examined. At baseline, participants were administered the EIT while high-density 128-channel EEG data were recorded to probe the late positive potential (LPP). One month later, participants were readministered the EIT. Four principal findings emerged. First, there is evidence of an interference effect at baseline, as participants showed a slower reaction time for unpleasant and pleasant images relative to neutral images, and test-retest of behavioral measures was relatively stable over time. Second, participants showed a potentiated LPP to unpleasant and pleasant images compared to neutral images, and these effects were stable over time. Moreover, in a test of the difference waves (unpleasant-neutral vs. pleasant-neutral), there was sustained positivity for unpleasant images. Third, behavioral measures and LPP demonstrated excellent internal consistency (odd/even correlations) across conditions. Fourth, highlighting important age-related differences in LPP activity, younger age was associated with larger LPP amplitudes across conditions.

To improve the applicability and clinical reach of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), research is needed to develop shortened, yet reliable, MRS scanning procedures for standard 1.5-3-T clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, particularly with young or vulnerable populations unable to tolerate longer protocols. To this end, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of a shortened J-resolved MRS sequence in healthy adolescents (n\u00a0=\u00a022) aged 12-14\u00a0years. Participants underwent a series of sequential 6-min MRS scans, with the participants remaining in situ between successive scans. Glutamate and other metabolites were acquired from the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, as glutamatergic function in this region has been implicated in a number of psychiatric illnesses. Thirteen neurochemicals were quantified as ratios to total creatine, and reliability scores were expressed as the percentage difference between the two scans for each metabolite. Test-retest assessment of glutamate was reliable, as scores were less than 10% different (7.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2%), and glutamate values across scans were significantly correlated (Pearson r\u00a0=\u00a00.680, p\u00a0<\u00a010-4 ).

At the three-month follow-up, participants provided self-report assessments of anhedonia, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Three main findings emerged. First, in cross-sectional analyses, right nucleus accumbens volume was inversely related to anhedonia severity. Second, reduced bilateral putamen volume prospectively predicted anhedonia severity while controlling for baseline anhedonia, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Third, a blunted subjective response to peer acceptance (ie, neutral response to positive feedback), but not a more negative subjective response to peer rejection, contributed to anhedonia severity, but only among youth with smaller putamen volume. Collectively, these results suggest that smaller volume in striatal regions critically implicated in reward processing is associated with current and future anhedonic symptoms among healthy female youth.

Recent findings suggest that depressed adolescents are characterized by hypersensitivity to negative outcomes and blunted responsiveness to rewards. However, our understanding of the pathophysiology and time course of these abnormalities remains limited. Due to their high temporal resolution, event-related potentials (ERPs) provide an ideal probe to investigate these processes. In the present study, healthy (n = 25) and depressed (n = 26) female adolescents (13-18 years) completed a gambling task during 128-channel ERP recording. Time-domain analyses focused on ERPs linked to initial processing of negative versus rewarding outcomes (feedback-related negativity; FRN), and later, elaborative processing (late positive potential; LPP). Additionally, time-frequency analyses were used to decompose the FRN into its 2 constituent neural signals: loss-related theta and reward-related delta activity, thereby allowing us to separately probe these 2 putative mechanisms underlying FRN abnormalities in depression. Relative to healthy adolescents, depressed youth showed potentiated FRN (loss vs. reward) responses. Time-frequency analyses revealed that this group difference in the FRN was driven by increased loss-related theta activity in depressed youth, and not by reward-related delta activity. For the LPP, healthy adolescents exhibited sustained positivity to rewards versus losses, whereas depressed adolescents showed the opposite pattern. Moreover, an enhanced LPP to losses was associated with rumination. In summary, the LPP may be a sensitive probe of depressive rumination, whereas FRN-linked theta activity may represent a neural marker of hypersensitivity to negative outcomes in depressed youth. Implications for treatment and future ERP research are discussed.

Although a growing body of research has focused on the complex association between nonsuicidal and suicidal self-injury, the temporal relationship between these two classes of behaviors is unclear. The current study addresses this empirical gap by examining the course of SITBs in adolescents receiving outpatient (N\u00a0=\u00a0106; 82.1\u00a0% female) and inpatient (N\u00a0=\u00a0174; 75.9\u00a0% female) treatment. SITBs (co-occurrence, age-of-onset, and time lag between SITBs) and major psychiatric disorders were assessed at a single time point with well-validated structured interviews. Adolescents in both clinical samples reported high co-occurrence of SITBs: most adolescents reported both lifetime nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal thoughts. A similar temporal pattern of SITBs was reported in the two samples: thoughts of NSSI and suicide ideation had the earliest age-of-onset, followed by NSSI behaviors, suicide plans, and suicide attempts. However, the age-of-onset for each SITB was younger in the inpatient sample than in the outpatient sample. In terms of time lag between SITBs, suicide ideation occurred on average before initial engagement in NSSI, suggesting that pathways to NSSI and suicidal behavior may occur simultaneously rather than in succession from nonsuicidal to suicidal self-injury. Results also indicated that the time to transition between SITBs was relatively fast, and that a key period for intervention and prevention is within the first 6-12\u00a0months after the onset of suicidal thinking.

Indeed, depression is associated with the endorsement and recall of more negative and fewer positive emotional words (i.e., recall biases) in the self-referential encoding task (SRET). In addition, currently depressed adults and adolescents, compared to healthy controls, show an enhanced late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential (ERP) component that reflects sustained attentional engagement, during the processing of negative relative to positive words in the SRET. However, it is unclear whether these behavioral and neural measures in the SRET are indicators of risk for depression, or are concomitants of the disorder. The present study included 121 8 to 14 year-old girls with no lifetime history of depression, and examined the association between maternal history of depression (i.e., risk) and both behavioral and ERP measures while viewing positive and negative adjectives during the SRET. Lifetime history of major depressive disorder and/or dysthymia in the biological mother was assessed via a semistructured diagnostic interview. Results indicated that participants with maternal history of depression, compared with those with no maternal history of depression, demonstrated an enhanced LPP to negative words. There were no group differences in the LPP to positive words. Maternal history of depression was also related to faster response time when rejecting negative words. Participant's current depression symptoms were associated with increased negative recall bias and decreased positive recall bias.

In this review, we integrate well-established cognitive-vulnerability factors for MDD and corresponding neural mechanisms in intrinsic networks using a dual-process framework. We propose that the dynamic alteration and imbalance among the intrinsic networks, both in the resting-state and the rest-task transition stages, contribute to the development of cognitive vulnerability and MDD. Specifically, we propose that abnormally increased resting-state default mode network (DMN) activity and connectivity (mainly in anterior DMN regions) contribute to the development of cognitive vulnerability. Furthermore, when subjects confront negative stimuli in the period of rest-to-task transition, the following three kinds of aberrant network interactions have been identified as facilitators of vulnerability and dysphoric mood, each through a different cognitive mechanism: DMN dominance over the central executive network (CEN), an impaired salience network-mediated switching between the DMN and CEN, and ineffective CEN modulation of the DMN.

Concurrent analysis of these factors confirmed hypotheses of unique associations with suicide ideation and attempts in the past month. Specifically, whereas Pervasive Influence of Feelings (i.e., tendency for emotions to shape thoughts about the self and the future) is uniquely associated with greater suicidal ideation, Feelings Trigger Action (i.e., impulsive behavioral reactivity to emotions) is uniquely associated with the occurrence of suicide attempts, even after controlling for current psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide an ideal approach to investigate cognitive-affective processes associated with depression in adolescents, especially in the context of negative self-referential processing biases. In this study, healthy (n = 30) and depressed (n = 22) female adolescents completed a self-referential encoding task while ERP data were recorded. To examine cognitive-affective processes associated with self-referential processing, P1, P2, and late positive potential (LPP) responses to negative and positive words were investigated, and intracortical sources of scalp effects were probed using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Additionally, we tested whether key cognitive processes (e.g., maladaptive self-view, self-criticism) previously implicated in depression related to ERP components. Relative to healthy female subjects, depressed females endorsed more negative and fewer positive words, and free recalled and recognized fewer positive words. With respect to ERPs, compared with healthy female adolescents, depressed adolescents exhibited greater P1 amplitudes following negative words, which was associated with a more maladaptive self-view and self-criticism. In both early and late LPP responses, depressed females showed greater activity following negative versus positive words, whereas healthy females demonstrated the opposite pattern. For both P1 and LPP, LORETA revealed reduced inferior frontal gyrus activity in response to negative words in depressed versus healthy female adolescents. Collectively, these findings suggest that the P1 and LPP reflect biased self-referential processing in female adolescents with depression. Potential treatment implications are discussed.

Evaluate the relationship between reward processes, stress, and depression. 2. Assess the characteristics of the three etiological models of stress and reward processes. 3. Identify the biological basis for stress and reward processes. Adolescence is a peak period for the onset of depression, and it is also a time marked by substantial stress as well as neural development within the brain reward circuitry. In this review, we provide a selective overview of current animal and human research investigating the relationship among reward processes, stress, and depression. Three separate, but related, etiological models examine the differential roles that stress may play in relation to reward dysfunction and adolescent depression. First, the reward mediation model suggests that both acute and chronic stress contribute to reward deficits, which, in turn, potentiate depressive symptoms or increase the risk for depression. Second, in line with the stress generation perspective, it is plausible that premorbid reward-related dysfunction generates stress--in particular, interpersonal stress--which then leads to the manifestation of depressive symptoms. Third, consistent with a diathesis-stress model, the interaction between stress and premorbid reward dysfunction may contribute to the onset of depression. Given the equifinal nature of depression, these models could shed important light on different etiological pathways during adolescence, particularly as they may relate to understanding the heterogeneity of depression. To highlight the translational potential of these insights, a hypothetical case study is provided as a means of demonstrating the importance of targeting reward dysfunction in both assessment and treatment of adolescent depression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Animals", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Humans", "Reward", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School; Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research, McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA."}, {"First Name": "Roee", "Last Name": "Admon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Diego A", "Last Name": "Pizzagalli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Harvard review of psychiatry", "PubDate": "2014May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "24639362", "Title": "'Weakest Link' as a Cognitive Vulnerability Within the Hopelessness Theory of Depression in Chinese University Students.", "Abstract": "The current study tested the cognitive vulnerability-stress component of hopelessness theory using a 'weakest link' approach (e.g. an individual is as cognitively vulnerable to depression as his or her most depressogenic attributional style makes him or her) in a sample of Chinese university students.

During an initial assessment, participants completed measures assessing weakest link, depressive symptoms and occurrence of negative events once a month for 6\u2009months.

This research is critical as cognitive and interpersonal vulnerability factors likely shape expectations, perspectives, and interpretations of a given situation prior to the onset of a stressor. In the current study, adolescents (n\u2009=\u2009157; boys=64, girls=93), ages 12 to 18, participated in a 6-month, multi-wave longitudinal study examining the impact of negative cognitive style, self-criticism, and dependency on stress and depression. Results of time-lagged, idiographic multilevel analyses indicate that depressogenic attributional styles (i.e., composite score and weakest link approach) and self-criticism predict dependent interpersonal, but not noninterpersonal stress. Moreover, the occurrence of stress mediates the relationship between cognitive vulnerability and depressive symptoms over time. At the same time, self-criticism predicts above and beyond depressogenic attributional styles (i.e., composite and weakest link approach). In contrast to our hypotheses, dependency does not contribute to the occurrence of stress, and additionally, no gender differences emerge. Taken together, the findings suggest that self-criticism may be a particularly damaging vulnerability factor in adolescence, and moreover, it may warrant greater attention in the context of psychotherapeutic interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Child", "Cognition", "Depressive Disorder", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Risk Factors", "Self Concept", "Self-Assessment", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Randy P", "Last Name": "Auerbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research, McLean Hospital, 115 Mill Street, deMarneffe, Room 240, Belmont, MA, 02478, USA, rauerbach@mclean.harvard.edu."}, {"First Name": "Moon-Ho Ringo", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Judy C", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of abnormal child psychology", "PubDate": "2014Aug"}]
