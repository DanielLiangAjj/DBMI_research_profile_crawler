We present the case of a 73-year-old man who developed eosinophilic spongiosis shortly after initiating atorvastatin therapy, an adverse effect which to our knowledge has not yet been reported in association with atorvastatin. Our investigation explores the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of eosinophilic spongiosis induced by atorvastatin, delving into potential mechanisms behind statin-induced eosinophilia. A literature review, focusing on atorvastatin's dermatological side effects, revealed a limited number of relevant studies, emphasizing the scarcity of documented cases. Our aim is to raise awareness of eosinophilic spongiosis as a potential side effect of atorvastatin, emphasizing its impact on patients' quality of life. This case prompts further research into the mechanisms underlying such dermatologic reactions, contributing to a better understanding of atorvastatin's diverse adverse effects.", "Keywords": ["atorvastatin", "diabetes", "eosinophilic", "eosinophilic spongiosis", "mellitus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Feras", "Last Name": "Al-Moussally", "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine, University of Central Florida College of Medicine, Orlando, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brittany M", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA."}, {"First Name": "Omar M", "Last Name": "Masarweh", "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine, University of Central Florida, Kissimmee, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neel", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, University of Central Florida College of Medicine, Orlando, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sudeep", "Last Name": "Gaudi", "Affiliation": "Dermatopathology, James A.

Decades of research has identified various mechanisms of VILI, largely focusing on airspace forces of plateau pressure, tidal volume and driving pressure. Experimental evidence indicates the role of adverse cardiopulmonary interaction during mechanical ventilation, contributing to VILI genesis mostly by modulating pulmonary vascular dynamics. Under passive mechanical ventilation, high transpulmonary pressure increases afterload on right heart while high pleural pressure reduces the RV preload. Together, they can result in swings of pulmonary vascular flow and pressure. Altered vascular flow and pressure result in increased vascular shearing and wall tension, in turn causing direct microvascular injury accompanied with permeability to water, proteins and cells. Moreover, abrupt decreases in airway pressure, may result in sudden overperfusion of the lung and result in similar microvascular injury, especially when the endothelium is stretched or primed at high positive end-expiratory pressure. Microvascular injury is universal in VILI models and presumed in the diagnosis of ARDS; preventing such microvascular injury can reduce VILI and impact outcomes in ARDS. Consequently, developing cardiovascular targets to reduce macro and microvascular stressors in the pulmonary circulation can potentially reduce VILI.

Most mutations in SHP2 increase its basal catalytic activity by disrupting auto-inhibitory interactions between its phosphatase domain and N-terminal SH2 (phosphotyrosine recognition) domain. By contrast, some disease-associated mutations located in the ligand-binding pockets of the N- or C-terminal SH2 domains do not increase basal activity and likely exert their pathogenicity through alternative mechanisms. We lack a molecular understanding of how these SH2 mutations impact SHP2 structure, activity, and signaling. Here, we characterize five SHP2 SH2 domain ligand-binding pocket mutants through a combination of high-throughput biochemical screens, biophysical and biochemical measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. We show that, while some of these mutations alter binding affinity to phosphorylation sites, the T42A mutation in the N-SH2 domain is unique in that it also substantially alters ligand-binding specificity, despite being 8-10 \u00c5 from the specificity-determining region of the SH2 domain. This mutation exerts its effect on sequence specificity by remodeling the phosphotyrosine binding pocket, altering the mode of engagement of both the phosphotyrosine and surrounding residues on the ligand. The functional consequence of this altered specificity is that the T42A mutant has biased sensitivity toward a subset of activating ligands and enhances downstream signaling.

This network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and the composition of macromolecular machines differ between cell types and physiological conditions. Therefore, characterizing PPI networks and their dynamic changes is vital for discovering novel biological functions and underlying mechanisms of cellular processes. However, producing an in-depth, global snapshot of PPIs from a given specimen requires measuring tens to thousands of LC-MS/MS runs. Consequently, while recent works made seminal contributions by mapping PPIs at great depth, almost all focused on just 1-2 conditions, generating comprehensive but mostly static PPI networks. In this study we report the development of SEC-TMT, a method that enables identifying and measuring PPIs in a quantitative manner from only 4-8 LC-MS/MS runs per biological sample. This was accomplished by incorporating tandem mass tag (TMT) multiplexing with a size exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) work-flow. SEC-TMT reduces measurement time by an order of magnitude while maintaining resolution and coverage of thousands of cellular interactions, equivalent to the gold standard in the field. We show that SEC-TMT provides benefits for conducting differential analyses to measure changes in the PPI network between conditions.

We used ancestral sequence reconstruction to generate a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) variant that can be expressed in bacteria and purified in soluble form, unlike the human members of this family (Syk and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase of 70\u2009kDa [ZAP-70]). The catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and regulation by phosphorylation of this Syk variant are similar to the corresponding properties of human Syk and ZAP-70. Taking advantage of the ability to express this novel Syk-family kinase in bacteria, we developed a two-hybrid assay that couples the growth of E. coli in the presence of an antibiotic to successful phosphorylation of a bait peptide by the kinase. Using this assay, we screened a site-saturation mutagenesis library of the kinase domain of this reconstructed Syk-family kinase. Sites of loss-of-function mutations identified in the screen correlate well with residues established previously as critical to function and/or structure in protein kinases. We also identified activating mutations in the regulatory hydrophobic spine and activation loop, which are within key motifs involved in kinase regulation. Strikingly, one mutation in an ancestral Syk-family variant increases the soluble expression of the protein by 75-fold.

Previously, we reported that deep mutagenesis of H-Ras using a bacterial assay identified many other activating mutations (Bandaru et al., 2017). We now show that the results of saturation mutagenesis of H-Ras in mammalian Ba/F3 cells correlate well with the results of bacterial experiments in which H-Ras or K-Ras are co-expressed with a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The prominent cancer hotspots are not dominant in the Ba/F3 data. We used the bacterial system to mutagenize Ras constructs of different stabilities and discovered a feature that distinguishes the cancer hotspots. While mutations at the cancer hotspots activate Ras regardless of construct stability, mutations at lower-frequency sites (e.g. at Val 14 or Asp 119) can be activating or deleterious, depending on the stability of the Ras construct. We characterized the dynamics of three non-hotspot activating Ras mutants by using NMR to monitor hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). These mutations result in global increases in HDX rates, consistent with destabilization of Ras. An explanation for these observations is that mutations that destabilize Ras increase nucleotide dissociation rates, enabling activation by spontaneous nucleotide exchange. A further stability decrease can lead to insufficient levels of folded Ras - and subsequent loss of function. In contrast, the cancer hotspot mutations are mechanism-based activators of Ras that interfere directly with the action of GAPs. Our results demonstrate the importance of GAP surveillance and protein stability in determining the sensitivity of Ras to mutational activation.", "Keywords": ["E. coli", "ba/f3", "cancer", "cancer mutants", "h-ras", "high throughput screening", "k-ras", "molecular biophysics", "ras", "saturation-mutagenesis", "signaling activation", "structural biology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "GTPase-Activating Proteins", "Mammals", "Mutagenesis", "Mutation", "Neoplasms", "Nucleotides", "ras GTPase-Activating Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Hidalgo", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Laura M", "Last Name": "Nocka", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Neel H", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kent", "Last Name": "Gorday", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Naomi R", "Last Name": "Latorraca", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pradeep", "Last Name": "Bandaru", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sage", "Last Name": "Templeton", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Deepti", "Last Name": "Karandur", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey G", "Last Name": "Pelton", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Marqusee", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Wemmer", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Kuriyan", "Affiliation": "California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3), University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2022Mar11"}, {"PMID": "35261439", "Title": "Comparison of predictive blood transfusion scoring systems in trauma patients and application to pre-hospital medicine.", "Abstract": "Hemorrhage leads to 30% to 40% of trauma deaths, with up to 50% of these deaths transpiring before hospital arrival.

The promise of this approach hinges on an improved understanding of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), which serve as central hubs in biosynthetic pathways. These small, flexible proteins mediate the transport of molecular building blocks and intermediates to enzymatic partners that extend and tailor the growing natural products. Past combinatorial biosynthesis efforts have failed due to incompatible ACP-enzyme pairings. Herein, we report the design of chimeric ACPs with features of the actinorhodin polyketide synthase ACP (ACT) and of the Escherichia coli fatty acid synthase (FAS) ACP (AcpP). We evaluate the ability of the chimeric ACPs to interact with the E. coli FAS ketosynthase FabF, which represents an interaction essential to building the carbon backbone of the synthase molecular output. Given that AcpP interacts with FabF but ACT does not, we sought to exchange modular features of ACT with AcpP to confer functionality with FabF. The interactions of chimeric ACPs with FabF were interrogated using sedimentation velocity experiments, surface plasmon resonance analyses, mechanism-based cross-linking assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. Results suggest that the residues guiding AcpP-FabF compatibility and ACT-FabF incompatibility may reside in the loop I, \u03b1-helix II region. These findings can inform the development of strategic secondary element swaps that expand the enzyme compatibility of ACPs across systems and therefore represent a critical step toward the strategic

"Abstract": "Drugs that block the activity of the methyltransferase EZH2 are in clinical development for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphomas harboring EZH2 gain-of-function mutations that enhance its polycomb repressive function. We have previously reported that EZH2 can act as a transcriptional activator in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Now we show that EZH2 inhibitors can also block the transactivation activity of EZH2 and inhibit the growth of CRPC cells. Gene expression and epigenomics profiling of cells treated with EZH2 inhibitors demonstrated that in addition to derepressing gene expression, these compounds also robustly down-regulate a set of DNA damage repair (DDR) genes, especially those involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Methylation of the pioneer factor FOXA1 by EZH2 contributes to the activation of these genes, and interaction with the transcriptional coactivator P300 via the transactivation domain on EZH2 directly turns on the transcription. In addition, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout screens in the presence of EZH2 inhibitors identified these BER genes as the determinants that underlie the growth-inhibitory effect of EZH2 inhibitors. Interrogation of public data from diverse types of solid tumors expressing wild-type EZH2 demonstrated that expression of DDR genes is significantly correlated with EZH2 dependency and cellular sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors. Consistent with these findings, treatment of CRPC cells with EZH2 inhibitors dramatically enhances their sensitivity to genotoxic stress. These studies reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism of action of EZH2 inhibitors and provide a mechanistic basis for potential combination cancer therapies.", "Keywords": ["DNA damage repair",

The binding of the tSH2 module to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs necessitates a conformational change, thereby relieving kinase inhibition and promoting activation. We determined the crystal structure of the isolated tSH2 module of Syk and find, in contrast to ZAP-70, that its conformation more closely resembles that of the peptide-bound state, rather than the autoinhibited state. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, reveal that the dynamics of the tSH2 modules of Syk and ZAP-70 differ, with most of these differences occurring in the C-terminal SH2 domain. Our data suggest that the conformational landscapes of the tSH2 modules in Syk and ZAP-70 have been tuned differently, such that the autoinhibited conformation of the Syk tSH2 module is less stable.

To characterize the hemodynamic profile of this cohort, 156 patients with COVID pneumonia and shock requiring vasopressors had interpretable echocardiography with measurement of ejection fraction (EF) by Simpson's rule and stroke volume (SV) by Doppler. RV systolic pressure (RVSP) was estimated from the tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity. Patients were divided into groups with low or preserved EF (EFL or EFP, cutoff \u226445%), and low or normal cardiac index (CIL or CIN, cutoff \u22642.2 L/min/m2). Mean age was 67 \u00b1 12.0, EF 59.5 \u00b1 12.9, and CI 2.40 \u00b1 0.86. A minority of patients had depressed EF (EFLCIL, n\u00a0=\u00a015, EFLCIN, n\u00a0=\u00a08); of those with preserved EF, less than half had low CI (EFPCIL, n\u00a0=\u00a055, EFPCIN, n\u00a0=\u00a073). Overall hospital mortality was 73%. Mortality was highest in the EFLCIL group (87%), but the difference between groups was not significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.68 by ANOVA). High PEEP correlated with low CI in the EFPCIL group (r\u00a0=\u00a00.44, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In conclusion, this study reports the prevalence of shock characterized by EF and CI in patients with COVID-19. COVID-induced shock had a cardiogenic profile (EFLCIL) in 9.6% of patients, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on myocardial function. Low CI despite preservation of EF and the correlation with PEEP suggests underfilling of the LV in this subset; these patients might benefit from additional volume.

This unusual phenotype was traced to the anchoring of long colanic acid polymers (CAP) that project from the cell surface. Although each characterized mutant activated this same mechanism, the genes responsible and the strengths of the phenotypes varied. Mutations in rcsC, lpp, igaA, or the yjbEFGH operon were sufficient to stimulate sedimentation resistance, while mutations altering the cps promoter, cdgI, or yjbF provided phenotypic enhancements. The sedimentation resistances changed in response to temperature, growth phase, and carbon source and each mutant exhibited significantly reduced biofilm formation. We discovered that the degree of colony mucoidy exhibited by these mutants was not related to the degree of Rcs pathways activation or to the amount of CAP that was produced; rather, it was related to the fraction of CAP that was shed as a true exopolysaccharide. Therefore, these and other mutations that activate this phenotype are likely to be absent from genetic screens that relied on centrifugation to harvest bacteria. We also found that this anchored CAP form is not linked to LPS cores and may not be attached to the outer membrane.IMPORTANCEBacteria can partition in aqueous environments between surface-dwelling, planktonic, sedimentary, and biofilm forms. Residence in each location provides an advantage depending on nutritional and environmental stresses and a community of a single species is often observed to be distributed throughout two or more of these niches. Another adaptive strategy is to produce an extracellular capsule, which provides an environmental shield for the microbe and can allow escape from predators and immune systems. We discovered that bacteria can either shed or stably anchor capsules to dramatically alter their propensity to sediment. The degree to which the bacteria anchor their capsule is controlled by a stress sensing system, suggesting that anchoring may be used as an adaptive response to severe environmental challenges.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nickolas G", "Last Name": "Kessler", "Affiliation": "Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Caraballo Delgado", "Affiliation": "Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neel K", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeff A", "Last Name": "Dickinson", "Affiliation": "Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sean D", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA sean.moore@ucf.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of bacteriology", "PubDate": "2021Jun01"}, {"PMID": "33608970", "Title": "Local insulin application has a dose-dependent effect on lumbar fusion in a rabbit model.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if locally applied insulin has a dose-responsive effect on posterolateral lumbar fusion. Adult male New Zealand White rabbits underwent posterolateral intertransverse spinal fusions (PLFs) at L5-L6 using suboptimal amounts of autograft. Fusion sites were treated with collagen sponge soaked in saline (control, n\u00a0=\u00a011), or with insulin at low (5 or 10 units, n\u00a0=\u00a013), mid (20 units, n\u00a0=\u00a011), and high (40 units, n\u00a0=\u00a011) doses. Rabbits were euthanized at 6\u00a0weeks. The L5-L6 spine segment underwent manual palpation and radiographic evaluation performed by two fellowship trained spine surgeons blinded to treatment. Differences between groups were evaluated by analysis of variance on ranks followed by post-hoc Dunn's tests. Forty-three rabbits were euthanized at the planned 6\u00a0weeks endpoint, while three died or were euthanized prior to the endpoint. Radiographic evaluation found bilateral solid fusion in 10%, 31%, 60%, and 60% of the rabbits from the control and low, mid, and high-dose insulin-treated groups, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). As per manual palpation, 7 of 10 rabbits in the mid-dose insulin group were fused as compared to 1 of 10 rabbits in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

However, in established adenocarcinoma, it is unknown how the ERG oncogene promotes a cancerous phenotype and maintains downstream androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways. In this study, we utilized a murine prostate organoid system to explore the effects of ERG on tumorigenesis and determined the mechanism underlying prostate cancer dependence on ERG. Prostate organoids lacking PTEN and overexpressing ERG (Pten-/- R26-ERG) faithfully recapitulated distinct stages of prostate cancer disease progression. In this model, deletion of ERG significantly dampened AR-dependent gene expression. While ERG was able to reprogram the AR cistrome in the process of prostate carcinogenesis, ERG knockout in established prostate cancer organoids did not drastically alter AR binding, H3K27ac enhancer, or open chromatin profiles at these reprogrammed sites. Proteomic analysis of DNA-bound AR complexes demonstrated that ERG deletion causes a loss of recruitment of critical AR coregulators and basal transcriptional machinery, including NCOA3 and RNA polymerase II, but does not alter AR binding itself. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism of ERG oncogene addiction in prostate cancer, whereby ERG facilitates AR signaling by maintaining coregulator complexes at AR bound sites across the genome.

Data from 174 ECMO-supported patients were collected up to 24 h prior to, and for the duration of, the ECMO course. Thirty-five variables were collected, including physiological data, markers of end-organ perfusion, acid-base homeostasis, vasoactive infusions, markers of coagulation, and ECMO-machine factors. The primary outcome was the presence of radiologic evidence of moderate to severe brain injury as established by brain CT or MRI. This information was analyzed by a neural network, and results were compared to a logistic regression model as well as clinician judgement. The neural network model was able to predict brain injury with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.76, 73% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. Logistic regression had 62% sensitivity and 61% specificity. Clinician judgment had 39% sensitivity and 69% specificity.

Six recommendations are made for conducting and reporting research to catalyze value creation: develop interventions systematically by using user-centered design and a building-block approach; assess value in terms of cost, quality, outcomes, and work required of providers and patients; consider the time horizon for the intervention; test best practices for implementation in a range of real-world contexts; assess subtleties of behavior change tools used to improve high-value behaviors; and report the intervention in enough detail that it can be replicated, including context.

As key policymakers and stakeholders grapple with higher maternity care costs and poorer outcomes, including lagging access, equity, and maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in the United States compared with other high-income countries, the opportunity to improve prenatal care has been given insufficient attention. In this manuscript, we present a new conceptual model for prenatal care that incorporates both patients' medical and social needs into four phenotypes, and use human-centered design methods to describe how better matching patient needs with prenatal services can increase the use of high-value services and decrease the use of low-value services.

By analyzing such information collected from users, health of the general population can be gauged.

Public health is becoming a primary concern for many governments around the world. It is believed that it is necessary to analyze the current scenario within a given population before creating any new policies. Traditionally, governments use a variety of ways to gauge the flavor for any new policy including door to door surveys, a national level census, or hospital information to decide health policies. This information is limited and sometimes takes a long time to collect and analyze sufficiently enough to aid in decision making.

Here, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the T cell adapter protein LAT at position Y132 is a critical kinetic bottleneck for ligand discrimination. LAT phosphorylation at Y132, mediated by the kinase ZAP-70, leads to the recruitment and activation of phospholipase C-\u03b31 (PLC-\u03b31), an important effector molecule for T cell activation. The slow phosphorylation of Y132, relative to other phosphosites on LAT, is governed by a preceding glycine residue (G131) but can be accelerated by substituting this glycine with aspartate or glutamate. Acceleration of Y132 phosphorylation increases the speed and magnitude of PLC-\u03b31 activation and enhances T cell sensitivity to weaker stimuli, including weak agonists and self-peptides.

Given heightened public and professional awareness of this problem and the updated 2014 national guidelines to reduce the frequency of caesarean delivery, we analysed trends in caesarean delivery by type of facility in Mexico from 2008 to 2017. We obtained birth-certificate data from the Mexican General Directorate for Health Information and grouped the total number of vaginal and caesarean deliveries into five categories of facility: health-ministry hospitals; private hospitals; government employment-based insurance hospitals; military hospitals; and other facilities. Delivery rates were calculated for each category nationally and for each state. On average, 2\u2009114\u2009630 (95% confidence interval, CI: 2\u2009061\u2009487-2\u2009167\u2009773) live births occurred nationally each year between 2008 and 2017. Of these births, 53.5% (1\u2009130\u2009570; 95% CI: 1\u2009108\u2009068-1\u2009153\u2009072) were vaginal deliveries, and 45.3% (957\u2009105; 95% CI: 922\u2009936-991\u2009274) were caesarean deliveries, with little variation over time. During the study period, the number of live births increased by 4.4% (from 1\u2009978\u2009380 to 2\u2009064\u2009507). The vaginal delivery rate decreased from 54.8% (1\u2009083\u2009331/1\u2009978\u2009380) to 52.9% (1\u2009091\u2009958/2\u2009064\u2009507), giving a relative percentage decrease in the rate of 3.5%. The caesarean delivery rate increased from 43.9% (869\u2009018/1\u2009978\u2009380) to 45.5% (940\u2009206/2\u2009064\u2009507), giving a relative percentage increase in the rate of 3.7%. The biggest change in delivery rates was in private-sector hospitals. Since 2014, rates of caesarean delivery have fallen slightly in all sectors, but they remain high at 45.5%.

The kinase domain of CaMKII is connected by a flexible linker to a C-terminal hub domain that assembles into a 12- or 14-subunit scaffold that displays the kinase domains around it. Studies on CaMKII suggest that the stoichiometry and dynamic assembly/disassembly of hub oligomers may be important for CaMKII regulation. Although CaMKII is a metazoan protein, genes encoding predicted CaMKII-like hub domains, without associated kinase domains, are found in the genomes of some green plants and bacteria. We show that the hub domains encoded by three related green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Volvox carteri f. nagarensis, and Gonium pectoral, assemble into 16-, 18-, and 20-subunit oligomers, as assayed by native protein mass spectrometry. These are the largest known CaMKII hub domain assemblies. A crystal structure of the hub domain from C. reinhardtii reveals an 18-subunit organization. We identified four intra-subunit hydrogen bonds in the core of the fold that are present in the Chlamydomonas hub domain, but not in metazoan hubs. When six point mutations designed to recapitulate these hydrogen bonds were introduced into the human CaMKII-\u03b1 hub domain, the mutant protein formed assemblies with 14 and 16 subunits, instead of the normal 12- and 14-subunit assemblies.

From a clinical perspective, bacteria from surgical specimens are cultured in a planktonic state to determine antibiotic sensitivity. However, S. aureus exists primarily as established biofilms in PJI. To address this dichotomy, we developed a prospective registry of total knee and hip arthroplasty PJI S. aureus isolates to quantify the activity of clinically important antibiotics against isolates grown as biofilms. S. aureus planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed using clinical laboratory standard index assays for 10 antibiotics (cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin, rifampin, linezolid, nafcillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and daptomycin). Mature biofilms of each strain were grown in vitro, after which biofilm MIC (MBIC) and biofilm MBC (MBBC) were determined. Overall, isolates grown as biofilms displayed larger variations in antibiotic MICs as compared to planktonic MIC values. Only rifampin, doxycycline, and daptomycin had measurable biofilm MIC values across all S. aureus isolates tested. Biofilm MBC observations complemented biofilm MIC observations; rifampin, doxycycline, and daptomycin were the only antibiotics with measurable biofilm MBC values. 90% of S. aureus biofilms could be killed by rifampin, 50% by doxycycline, and only 15% by daptomycin. Biofilm formation increased bacterial antibiotic tolerance nonspecifically across all antibiotics, in both MSSA and MRSA samples.

The article was marked as recommended. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare attitudes regarding cost-consciousness between student populations at two medical schools in the United States and Canada. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of students at Harvard Medical School and University of Toronto. We performed chi-square analyses comparing responses from the two institutions. Results: Response rates were 48% (n=162) and 45% (n=228) at Harvard and the University of Toronto, respectively. At both institutions, >96% of students agreed clinicians at all stages of training should be familiar with cost-conscious decision-making, 80% agreed physicians are responsible for discussing healthcare costs with patients, and over 80% felt they had too little education on the topic in medical school. Students differed in opinions about the extent to which patients should inquire about costs, with students at Harvard more likely to endorse this opinion compared with those from Toronto (51% vs 28%, respectively), and differed over whether cost-consciousness led to rationing of healthcare (Harvard 30% vs Toronto 51%). Fewer than 10% of all students expressed concerns that incorporating costs into care was unethical. Overall, 85% of students from both countries would like more formal teaching on this topic. Discussion: Students from both schools strongly endorsed a need to learn more about cost-conscious decision-making. Findings suggest students in both systems can benefit from learning similar core concepts related to high-value, cost-conscious care, and teaching in this topic can be customized to reflect specific differences in expectations and practices in the two healthcare systems.", "Keywords": ["Choosing Wisely", "Costs of Care", "learner values", "medical education", "resource stewardship"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marisa", "Last Name": "Leon-Carlyle", "Affiliation": "University of Toronto."}, {"First Name": "Rory", "Last Name": "McQuillan", "Affiliation": "University of Toronto."}, {"First Name": "Ioana", "Last Name": "Baiu", "Affiliation": "Stanford University."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School."}, {"First Name": "Dmitry", "Last Name": "Dukhovny", "Affiliation": "Oregon Health & Science University."}, {"First Name": "Neel", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School."}], "Journal": "MedEdPublish (2016)", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30598552", "Title": "Understanding molecular mechanisms in cell signaling through natural and artificial sequence variation.", "Abstract": "The functionally tolerated sequence space of proteins can now be explored in an unprecedented way, owing to the expansion of genomic databases and the development of high-throughput methods to interrogate protein function.

The sequences flanking the tyrosine residues (referred to as \"phosphosites\") must be compatible with phosphorylation by the EGFR kinase domain and the recruitment of adapter proteins, while minimizing phosphorylation that would reduce the fidelity of signal transmission. To understand how phosphosite sequences encode these functions within a small set of residues, we carried out high-throughput mutational analysis of three phosphosite sequences in the EGFR tail. We used bacterial surface display of peptides coupled with deep sequencing to monitor phosphorylation efficiency and the binding of the SH2 and PTB domains of the adapter proteins Grb2 and Shc1, respectively. We found that the sequences of phosphosites in the EGFR tail are restricted to a subset of the range of sequences that can be phosphorylated efficiently by EGFR. Although efficient phosphorylation by EGFR can occur with either acidic or large hydrophobic residues at the -1 position with respect to the tyrosine, hydrophobic residues are generally excluded from this position in tail sequences. The mutational data suggest that this restriction results in weaker binding to adapter proteins but also disfavors phosphorylation by the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases c-Src and c-Abl.

Taking this into consideration, we proposed development of mannosylated nanostructured lipid carrier system (Mn-NLCs) for active targeting and site-specific delivery of budesonide to the inflamed tissues. The developed Mn-NLCs were characterized for particle size and size distribution, zeta potential, %entrapment efficiency, FTIR and TEM analysis. Furthermore, to ensure delivery of developed cargo to the colonic region, the Mn-NLCs were encapsulated using Eudragit\u00ae S100 coated pellets. The in vivo evaluation of developed system was performed by employing oxazolone colitis rat model. The average particle size of Mn-NLCs (301.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.88\u2009nm) was found to be more than that of unconjugated NLCs (284.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.53\u2009nm) with marginally reduced % entrapment efficiency (90.88\u2009\u00b1\u20093.86%). The in vitro cytotoxicity studies using J774A.1 cell line revealed that Mn-NLCs were non-toxic as compared to pure drug. The in vivo evaluation depicted that Mn-NLCs showed significant reduction in clinical activity scoring, macroscopic and microscopic indexing, colonic myeloperoxidase activity and inflammatory cytokines.

As nanoparticles possess the ability to accumulate at the site of inflammation, present investigation aims at development of Budesonide-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier systems (BDS-NLCs) for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. BDS-NLCs were prepared by employing a high pressure homogenization technique. Various preliminary trials were performed for optimization of the NLCs in which different processes, as well as formulation parameters, were studied. The BDS-NLCs was optimized statistically by applying a 3-factor/3-level Box-Behnken design.

The mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or cesarean section) has a significant effect on labor and delivery resource needs. Further, resource management decisions may impact the amount of time a physician or nurse is able to spend with any given patient. In this work, we employ queueing theory to model one year of transactional patient information at a tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts. First, we observe that the M/G/\u221e model effectively predicts patient flow in an obstetrics department. This model captures the dynamics of labor and delivery where patients arrive randomly during the day, the duration of their stay is based on their individual acuity, and their labor progresses at some rate irrespective of whether they are given a bed.

The high conservation of Ras requires mechanistic explanation, especially given the general mutational tolerance of proteins.

Ras exhibits global sensitivity to mutation when regulated by a GTPase activating protein and a nucleotide exchange factor. Removing the regulators shifts the distribution of mutational effects to be largely neutral, and reveals hotspots of activating mutations in residues that restrain Ras dynamics and promote the inactive state. Evolutionary analysis, combined with structural and mutational data, argue that Ras has co-evolved with its regulators in the vertebrate lineage.

Recent genomic landscape studies of such cancers have reported recurrent point mutations and focal deletions of another ETS member, the ETS2 repressor factor ERF. Here we show these ERF mutations cause decreased protein stability and mostly occur in tumours without ERG upregulation. ERF loss recapitulates the morphological and phenotypic features of ERG gain in normal mouse prostate cells, including expansion of the androgen receptor transcriptional repertoire, and ERF has tumour suppressor activity in the same genetic background of Pten loss that yields oncogenic activity by ERG. In the more common scenario of ERG upregulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicates that ERG inhibits the ability of ERF to bind DNA at consensus ETS sites both in normal and in cancerous prostate cells. Consistent with a competition model, ERF overexpression blocks ERG-dependent tumour growth, and ERF loss rescues TMPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancer cells from ERG dependency. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the oncogenicity of ERG is mediated, in part, by competition with ERF and they raise the larger question of whether other gain-of-function oncogenic

This lineage plasticity is enabled by the loss of TP53 and RB1 function, is mediated by increased expression of the reprogramming transcription factor SOX2, and can be reversed by restoring TP53 and RB1 function or by inhibiting SOX2 expression.

In this Series paper, we present the main care delivery models, with case studies of the USA and Sweden, and examine the main drivers of these models. Although nearly all births are attended by a skilled birth attendant and are in an institution, practice, cadre, facility size, and place of birth vary widely; for example, births occur in homes, birth centres, midwifery-led birthing units in hospitals, and in high intervention hospital birthing facilities. Not all care is evidenced-based, and some care provision may be harmful. Fear prevails among subsets of women and providers. In some settings, medical liability costs are enormous, human resource shortages are common, and costs of providing care can be very high. New challenges linked to alteration of epidemiology, such as obesity and older age during pregnancy, are also present. Data are often not readily available to inform policy and practice in a timely way and surveillance requires greater attention and investment. Outcomes are not equitable, and disadvantaged segments of the population face access issues and substantially elevated risks. At the same time, examples of excellence and progress exist, from clinical interventions to models of care and practice. Labourists (who provide care for all the facility's women for labour and delivery) are discussed as a potential solution. Quality and safety factors are informed by women's experiences, as well as medical evidence. Progress requires the ability to normalise birth for most women, with integrated services available if complications develop. We also discuss mechanisms to improve quality of care and highlight areas where research can address knowledge gaps with potential for impact.

Herein, we describe the use of a consensus design approach to engineer a split intein with enhanced stability and activity that make it more robust than any known PTS system. Using batch mutagenesis, we first conduct a detailed analysis of the difference in splicing rates between the Npu (fast) and Ssp (slow) split inteins of the DnaE family and find that most impactful residues lie on the second shell of the protein, directly adjacent to the active site. These residues are then used to generate an alignment of 73 naturally occurring DnaE inteins that are predicted to be fast.

Consequently, adherens junction structure and function is often perturbed in clinically advanced tumors of epithelial origin. Some of the most studied factors driving adherens junction complex perturbation in epithelial cancers are transcriptional and epigenetic down-regulation of E-cadherin expression. However, numerous reports demonstrate that post-translational regulatory mechanisms such as endocytosis also regulate early phases of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic progression. In already assembled healthy epithelia, E-cadherin endocytosis recycles cadherin-catenin complexes to regulate the number of mature adherens junctions found at cell-cell contact sites. However, following de novo epithelial cell-cell contact, endocytosis negatively regulates adherens junction assembly by removing E-cadherin from the cell surface. By contrast, following de novo epithelial cell-cell contact, spatially localized \u03b2-actin translation drives cytoskeletal remodeling and consequently E-cadherin clustering at cell-cell contact sites and therefore positively regulates adherens junction assembly. In this report we demonstrate that dynamin-mediated endocytosis and \u03b2-actin translation-dependent cadherin-catenin complex anchoring oppose each other following epithelial cell-cell contact. Consequently, the final extent of adherens junction assembly depends on which of these processes is dominant following epithelial cell-cell contact. We expressed \u03b2-actin transcripts impaired in their ability to properly localize monomer synthesis (\u03943'UTR) in MDCK cells to perturb actin filament remodeling and anchoring, and demonstrate the resulting defect in adherens junction structure and function is rescued by inhibiting dynamin mediated endocytosis. Therefore, we demonstrate balancing spatially regulated \u03b2-actin translation and dynamin-mediated endocytosis regulates epithelial monolayer structure and barrier function.", "Keywords": ["Pearson's correlation coefficient", "actin cytoskeleton", "adherens junctions", "endocytosis", "\u03b2-actin mRNA zipcode"], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Cytoskeleton", "Endocytosis", "Epithelial Cells", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lissette A", "Last Name": "Cruz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Pavan", "Last Name": "Vedula", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Natasha", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Neel", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Ayee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Alexis J", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, Newark, New Jersey."}], "Journal": "Cytoskeleton (Hoboken, N.J.)", "PubDate": "2015Dec"}, {"PMID": "26595452", "Title": "In reference to \"National cohort study of opioid analgesic dose and risk of future hospitalization\".", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Analgesics, Opioid", "Drug Overdose", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Pain", "Risk Assessment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pranathi R", "Last Name": "Sundaragiri", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Saraschandra", "Last Name": "Vallabhajosyula", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Neel B", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Division of Hospital Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota."}], "Journal": "Journal of hospital medicine", "PubDate": "2016Feb"}, {"PMID": "26595246", "Title": "The Challenge of Understanding Health Care Costs and Charges.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Clinical Decision-Making", "Comprehension", "Fees and Charges", "Health Care Costs", "Humans", "Moral Obligations", "Patient Compliance", "Physician's Role", "Reimbursement Mechanisms", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vineet", "Last Name": "Arora", "Affiliation": "associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Moriates", "Affiliation": "assistant clinical professor in the Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)."}, {"First Name": "Neel", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a member of the associate faculty at the Ariadne Labs for Health Systems Innovation."}], "Journal": "AMA journal of ethics", "PubDate": "2015Nov01"}, {"PMID": "26567111", "Title": "Tumor-associated Endo180 requires stromal-derived LOX to promote metastatic prostate cancer cell migration on human ECM surfaces.", "Abstract": "The diverse composition and structure of extracellular matrix (ECM) interfaces encountered by tumor cells at secondary tissue sites can influence metastatic progression. Extensive in vitro and in vivo data has confirmed that metastasizing tumor cells can adopt different migratory modes in response to their microenvironment. Here we present a model that uses human stromal cell-derived matrices to demonstrate that plasticity in tumor cell movement is controlled by the tumor-associated collagen receptor Endo180 (CD280, CLEC13E, KIAA0709, MRC2, TEM9, uPARAP) and the crosslinking of collagen fibers by stromal-derived lysyl oxidase (LOX). Human osteoblast-derived and fibroblast-derived ECM supported a rounded 'amoeboid-like' mode of cell migration and enhanced Endo180 expression in three prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, VCaP, DU145). Genetic silencing of Endo180 reverted PC3 cells from their rounded mode of migration towards a bipolar 'mesenchymal-like' mode of migration and blocked their translocation on human fibroblast-derived and osteoblast-derived matrices. The concomitant decrease in PC3 cell migration and increase in Endo180 expression induced by stromal LOX inhibition indicates that the Endo180-dependent rounded mode of prostate cancer cell migration requires ECM crosslinking. In conclusion, this study introduces a realistic in vitro model for the study of metastatic prostate cancer cell plasticity and pinpoints the cooperation between tumor-associated Endo180 and the stiff microenvironment imposed by stromal-derived LOX as a potential target for limiting metastatic progression in prostate cancer.", "Keywords": ["Bone", "Cell migration", "Collagen", "Fibroblast", "Osteoblast", "Prostate cancer"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "Extracellular Matrix", "Fibroblasts", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "In Vitro Techniques", "Male", "Mannose-Binding Lectins", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Osteoblasts", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Stromal Cells", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew P", "Last Name": "Caley", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Helen", "Last Name": "King", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neel", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Biological, Biomedical & Environmental Sciences, University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull, HU6 7RX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mercedes", "Last Name": "Rodriguez-Teja", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Julian H", "Last Name": "Gronau", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Waxman", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Sturge", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK. j.sturge@hull.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Clinical & experimental metastasis", "PubDate": "2016Feb"}, {"PMID": "26432404", "Title": "Androgen Receptor Upregulation Mediates Radioresistance after Ionizing Radiation.", "Abstract": "Clinical trials have established the benefit of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with radiotherapy in prostate cancer.

A validated claims-based algorithm has been developed to estimate the effectiveness of biologics for RA, allowing for estimation of cost and effectiveness in the same database. Objectives: To implement a validated claims-based effectiveness algorithm in a US managed care claims database to compute the 1-year biologic cost per effectively treated patient among first-line biologics approved for moderate-to-severe RA (abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab). Methods: This retrospective cohort study used administrative claims data for individuals in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM). The first claim for a first-line biologic between July 1, 2009, and January 31, 2013, after 6 months of continuous enrollment, was defined as the index event and date. Patients were aged 18-63 years on the index date and had at least one claim for RA in the 6-month pre- index period. Biologic costs included plan and patient paid amounts on claims for the biologic drug and administration. The algorithm defined effectiveness during the 12-month post-index period as achieving all six of the following: high adherence (medication possession ratio \u226580% or infusions consistent with the product label); no increase in biologic dose or decrease in dosing interval; no new biologic; no new nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; no new or increased oral glucocorticoid use; and \u22641 glucocorticoid injection. Cost per effectively treated patient was calculated as the total biologic cost (drug and administration) divided by the number of patients categorized by the algorithm as effectively treated. Results: The cohort comprised 4844 patients (mean age 48.6 years, 76.4% female). Average first-year biologic cost ranged from $14 795 (golimumab) to $19 520 (abatacept). Average first-year biologic cost per effectively treated patient was significantly lower for etanercept ($50 217) than for golimumab ($56 427, p<0.001) adalimumab ($56 879, p<0.001), abatacept ($68 062, p<0.001), certolizumab pegol ($76 427, p<0.001), and infliximab ($95 126, p<0.001).

By 2030, it is predicted that approximately 4 million total hip and knee arthroplasties will be performed yearly in the United States [2]. One of the major complications associated with this procedure is prosthetic joint infection (PJI), occurring at a rate of 1-2% [3-7]. In 2011, the Musculoskeletal Infectious Society created a unifying definition for prosthetic joint infection [8]. The following year, the Infectious Disease Society of America published practice guidelines that focused on the diagnosis and management of PJI. These guidelines focused on the management of commonly encountered organisms associated with PJI, including staphylococci, streptococci and select aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. However, with the exception of Propionibacterium acnes, management of other anaerobic organisms was not addressed in these guidelines [1]. Although making up approximately 3-6% of PJI [9,10], anaerobic microorganisms cause devastating complications, and similar to the more common organisms associated with PJI, these bacteria also result in significant morbidity, poor outcomes and increased health-care costs. Data on diagnosis and management of anaerobic PJI is mostly derived from case reports, along with a few cohort studies [3]. There is a paucity of published data outlining factors associated with risks, diagnosis and management of anaerobic PJI. We therefore reviewed available literature on anaerobic PJI by systematically searching the PubMed database, and collected data from secondary searches to determine information on pathogenesis, demographic data, clinical features, diagnosis and management.

Measuring the levels of molecules in biological fluids believing them to be the representatives of biochemical pathways of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, nucleic acids or xenobiotic metabolism and deciphering meaningful data from it is what can be called as metabolomics, just as high glucose in urine suggests diabetes mellitus. Genomics, epigenetics, proteomics, transcriptomics finally converge to metabolomics, which are the signatures of mechanisms of bodily processes which is why understanding this science can have many applications. Just as a heap of stones does not make a house, having data of metabolite levels does not make it a science. Analyzing this data would help us in constructing biochemical pathways and their interactions. Analyzing the changes caused by a drug in the metabolite levels would help us in deriving the mechanisms by which the drug acts. Comparing metabolite levels in diseased with non-diseased, good-responders with poor-responders to a particular drug can help in identifying new markers of a disease or response to a drug respectively. Also, metabolite levels of an endogenous substrate can tell us the status of a person's metabolizing enzymes and help in drug dose titration. Generating hypothesis by identifying the new molecular markers and testing their utility in clinics seems to be the most promising approach in future.

Unfortunately the malignancy will return to form lethal castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC). The androgen receptor (AR) remains transcriptionally active in CRPC in spite of castrate levels of androgens in the blood. AR transcriptional activity resides in its N-terminal domain (NTD). Possible mechanisms of continued AR transcriptional activity may include, at least in part, expression of constitutively active splice variants of AR that lack the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Current therapies that target the AR LBD, would not be effective against these AR variants. Currently no drugs are clinically available that target the AR NTD which should be effective against these AR variants as well as full-length AR. Niphatenones were originally isolated and identified in active extracts from Niphates digitalis marine sponge. Here we begin to characterize the mechanism of niphatenones in blocking AR transcriptional activity. Both enantiomers had similar IC50 values of 6 \u00b5M for inhibiting the full-length AR in a functional transcriptional assay. However, (S)-niphatenone had significantly better activity against the AR NTD compared to (R)-niphatenone. Consistent with niphatenones binding to and inhibiting transactivation of AR NTD, niphatenones inhibited AR splice variant. Niphatenone did not affect the transcriptional activity of the related progesterone receptor, but slightly decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity and covalently bound to GR activation function-1 (AF-1) region. Niphatenone blocked N/C interactions of AR without altering either AR protein levels or its intracellular localization in response to androgen.

Despite this fact, the activity of these inteins is context-dependent: certain peptide sequences surrounding their ligation junction (called local N- and C-exteins) are strongly preferred, while other sequences cause a dramatic reduction in the splicing kinetics and yield. These sequence constraints limit the utility of inteins, and thus, a more detailed understanding of their participation in protein splicing is needed.

Despite the widespread use of EPL, the generation and isolation of the required recombinant protein \u03b1-thioesters remain challenging. We describe here a new method for the preparation and purification of recombinant protein \u03b1-thioesters using engineered versions of naturally split DnaE inteins. This family of autoprocessing enzymes is closely related to the inteins currently used for protein \u03b1-thioester generation, but they feature faster kinetics and are split into two inactive polypeptides that need to associate to become active. Taking advantage of the strong affinity between the two split intein fragments, we devised a streamlined procedure for the purification and generation of protein \u03b1-thioesters from cell lysates and applied this strategy for the semisynthesis of a variety of proteins including an acetylated histone and a site-specifically modified monoclonal antibody.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Esters", "Inteins", "Protein Engineering", "Recombinant Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Miquel", "Last Name": "Vila-Perell\u00f3", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Frick Laboratory, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhihua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neel H", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Willis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juliana", "Last Name": "Idoyaga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tom W", "Last Name": "Muir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2013Jan09"}, {"PMID": "23195160", "Title": "A role for physicians: an observation on cost containment.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Cost Control", "Delivery of Health Care", "Health Care Costs", "Humans", "Physician's Role", "Physicians", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neel T", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "The Costs of Care, Inc., and Departments of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology, Brigham & Women's Hospital/Massuchusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. neel@costsofcare.org"}], "Journal": "American journal of preventive medicine", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "23143866", "Title": "Burden of emergency and non-emergency colorectal cancer surgeries in West Virginia and the USA.", "Abstract": "Elective surgical resection is the curative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC).
