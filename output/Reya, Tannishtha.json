[{"PMID": "38772707", "Title": "Imaging Approaches in Cancer Biology.", "Abstract": "A majority of cancer research is focused on defining the cellular and molecular basis of cancer cells and the signals that control oncogenic transformation; as a consequence, we know very little about the dynamic behavior of cancer cells in vivo. To begin to view and understand the mechanisms and interactions that control cancer initiation, growth, and metastatic progression and how these processes are influenced by the microenvironment and the signals derived from it, it is essential to develop strategies that allow imaging of the cancer cells in the context of the living microenvironment. Here, we discuss emerging work designed to visualize how cancer cells function within the microenvironment to discover how these interactions act coordinately to enable aberrant growth and to understand how they could be targeted to design new approaches to intercept the disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nirakar", "Last Name": "Rajbhandari", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcie", "Last Name": "Kritzik", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tannishtha", "Last Name": "Reya", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093, USA t.reya@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine", "PubDate": "2024May21"}, {"PMID": "38234720", "Title": "Identification of a Musashi2 translocation as a novel oncogene in myeloid leukemia.", "Abstract": "Myeloid leukemias, diseases marked by aggressiveness and poor outcomes, are frequently triggered by oncogenic translocations. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the BCR-ABL fusion initiates chronic phase disease with second hits allowing progression to blast crisis. Although Gleevec has been transformative for CML, blast crisis CML remains relatively drug resistant. Here we show that MSI2-HOXA9, a translocation with an unknown role in cancer, can serve as a second hit in driving bcCML. Compared to BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 led to a more aggressive disease in vivo with decreased latency, increased lethality and a differentiation blockade that is a hallmark of blast crisis. Domain mapping revealed that the MSI2 RNA binding domain RRM1 had a preferential impact on growth and lethality of bcCML relative to RRM2 or the HOXA9 domain. Mechanistically, MSI2-HOXA9 triggered global downstream changes with a preferential upregulation of mitochondrial components. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells exhibited a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that MSI2-HOXA9 acts, at least in part, by increasing expression of the mitochondrial polymerase Polrmt and augmenting mitochondrial function and basal respiration in blast crisis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that translocations involving the stem and developmental signal MSI2 can be oncogenic, and suggest that MSI, which we found to be a frequent partner for an array of translocations, could also be a driver mutation across solid cancers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyle", "Last Name": "Spinler", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Jeevisha", "Last Name": "Bajaj", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Yutaka", "Last Name": "Shima", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Marcie", "Last Name": "Kritzik", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Tannishtha", "Last Name": "Reya", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine La Jolla, CA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Dec29"}, {"PMID": "37802055", "Title": "Single-cell mapping identifies MSI+ cells as a common origin for diverse subtypes of pancreatic cancer.", "Abstract": "Identifying the cells from which cancers arise is critical for understanding the molecular underpinnings of tumor evolution. To determine whether stem/progenitor cells can serve as cells of origin, we created a Msi2-CreERT2 knock-in mouse.

Combining single-cell genomics with computational analysis of developmental states and lineage trajectories, we demonstrate that MYC preferentially triggers transformation of the most immature MSI2+ pancreas cells into multi-lineage pre-cancer cells. These pre-cancer cells subsequently diverge to establish pancreatic cancer subtypes by activating distinct transcriptional programs and large-scale genomic changes, and enforced expression of specific signals like Ras can redirect subtype specification.

Specifically, we carry out a high throughput screen using Msi2-reporter blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML) and identify several adhesion molecules that are preferentially expressed in therapy resistant bcCML cells and play a key role in bcCML. In particular, we focus on syndecan-1, whose deletion triggers defects in bcCML growth and propagation and markedly improves survival of transplanted mice. Further, live imaging reveals that the spatiotemporal dynamics of leukemia cells are critically dependent on syndecan signaling, as loss of this signal impairs their localization, migration and dissemination to distant sites. Finally, at a molecular level, syndecan loss directly impairs integrin \u03b27 function, suggesting that syndecan exerts its influence, at least in part, by coordinating integrin activity in bcCML.

MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination of CD98 is required for UM7F8's capacity to reduce CD98 surface expression and its capacity to inhibit the proliferation of murine T cells. Similarly, CD98 ubiquitination is required for UM7F8's capacity to block the colony-forming ability of murine leukemia-initiating cells. To test the potential generality of the paradigm that MARCH E3 ligases can mediate the antiproliferative response to antitumor Abs, we examined the potential effects of MARCH proteins on responses to emibetuzumab, an anti-MET Ab currently in clinical trials for various cancers. We report that MET surface expression is reduced by MARCH1, 4, or 8-mediated ubiquitination and that emibetuzumab-induced MET ubiquitination contributes to its capacity to downregulate MET and inhibit human tumor cell proliferation.

We interrogated purified sorted tumor fractions from these samples with whole-genome copy-number variant (CNV), whole-exome sequencing, and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses. These identified a variety of somatic genomic lesions targeting chromatin regulators in ASCP genomes that were superimposed on well-characterized genomic lesions including mutations in TP53 (87%) and KRAS (73%), amplification of MYC (47%), and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (40%) that are common in PDACs. Furthermore, a comparison of ATAC-seq profiles of three ASCP and three PDAC genomes using flow-sorted PDX models identified genes with accessible chromatin unique to the ASCP genomes, including the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 and the pancreatic cancer stem cell regulator RORC in all three ASCPs, and a FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion associated with focal CNVs in both genes in a single ASCP.

We also describe emerging evidence for the role of developmental signals in cancer initiation, propagation, and therapy resistance and discuss how targeting these pathways may be of therapeutic value.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Disease Progression", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeevisha", "Last Name": "Bajaj", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Tannishtha", "Last Name": "Reya", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of cell biology", "PubDate": "2020Jan06"}, {"PMID": "30996350", "Title": "Targeting LIF-mediated paracrine interaction for pancreatic cancer therapy and monitoring.", "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis largely owing to inefficient diagnosis and tenacious drug resistance. Activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and consequent development of dense stroma are prominent features accounting for this aggressive biology1,2. The reciprocal interplay between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) not only enhances tumour progression and metastasis but also sustains their own activation, facilitating a vicious cycle to exacerbate tumorigenesis and drug resistance3-7. Furthermore, PSC activation occurs very early during PDAC tumorigenesis8-10, and activated PSCs comprise a substantial fraction of the tumour mass, providing a rich source of readily detectable factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the communication between PSCs and PCCs could be an exploitable target to develop effective strategies for PDAC therapy and diagnosis. Here, starting with a\u00a0systematic proteomic investigation of secreted disease mediators and underlying molecular mechanisms, we reveal that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a key paracrine factor from activated PSCs acting on cancer cells. Both pharmacologic LIF blockade and genetic Lifr deletion markedly slow tumour progression and augment the\u00a0efficacy of chemotherapy to prolong survival of PDAC mouse models, mainly by modulating cancer cell differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition status. Moreover, in both mouse models and human PDAC, aberrant production of LIF in the pancreas is restricted to pathological conditions and correlates with PDAC pathogenesis, and changes in the levels of\u00a0circulating LIF correlate well with tumour response to therapy. Collectively, these findings reveal a function of LIF in PDAC tumorigenesis, and suggest its translational potential as an attractive therapeutic target and circulating marker. Our studies underscore how a better understanding of cell-cell communication within the tumour microenvironment can suggest novel strategies for cancer therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

Under aerobic conditions, glucose is generally assumed to be burned fully by tissues via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) to carbon dioxide. Alternatively, glucose can be catabolized anaerobically via glycolysis to lactate, which is itself also a potential nutrient for tissues and tumours. The quantitative relevance of circulating lactate or other metabolic intermediates as fuels remains unclear. Here we systematically examine the fluxes of circulating metabolites in mice, and find that lactate can be a primary source of carbon for the TCA cycle and thus of energy. Intravenous infusions of 13C-labelled nutrients reveal that, on a molar basis, the circulatory turnover flux of lactate is the highest of all metabolites and exceeds that of glucose by 1.1-fold in fed mice and 2.5-fold in fasting mice; lactate is made primarily from glucose but also from other sources. In both fed and fasted mice, 13C-lactate extensively labels TCA cycle intermediates in all tissues. Quantitative analysis reveals that during the fasted state, the contribution of glucose to tissue TCA metabolism is primarily indirect (via circulating lactate) in all tissues except the brain. In genetically engineered lung and pancreatic cancer tumours in fasted mice, the contribution of circulating lactate to TCA cycle intermediates exceeds that of glucose, with glutamine making a larger contribution than lactate in pancreatic cancer. Thus, glycolysis and the TCA cycle are uncoupled at the level of lactate, which is a primary circulating TCA substrate in most tissues and tumours.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Glucose", "Brain", "Carbon", "Citric Acid Cycle", "Fasting", "Glucose", "Glutamine", "Glycolysis", "Lactic Acid", "Mice", "Muscles", "Pancreatic Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Hui", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan M", "Last Name": "Ghergurovich", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raphael J", "Last Name": "Morscher", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cholsoon", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenyun", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lourdes A", "Last Name": "Esparza", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tannishtha", "Last Name": "Reya", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Le ZhanRutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA.Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey, 08854, USA.", "Affiliation": "Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessie", "Last Name": "Yanxiang Guo", "Affiliation": "Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eileen", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08903, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Rabinowitz", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2017Nov02"}, {"PMID": "27908736", "Title": "CD98-Mediated Adhesive Signaling Enables the Establishment and Propagation of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.", "Abstract": "Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease associated with drug resistance and relapse.

Using these tools, and a new Msi2 reporter model, we show that haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells display preferential spatial affinity for contacting the vascular niche, and a temporal affinity for making stable associations with these cells. These preferences are markedly diminished as cells mature, suggesting that programs that control differentiation state are key determinants of spatiotemporal behaviour, and thus dictate the signals a cell receives from specific microenvironmental domains.

The genomic alterations that commonly occur in pancreatic cancer include activation of KRAS2 and inactivation of p53 and SMAD4 (refs 2-4). So far, however, it has been challenging to target these pathways therapeutically; thus the search for other key mediators of pancreatic cancer growth remains an important endeavour. Here we show that the stem cell determinant Musashi (Msi) is a critical element of pancreatic cancer progression both in genetic models and in patient-derived xenografts. Specifically, we developed Msi reporter mice that allowed image-based tracking of stem cell signals within cancers, revealing that Msi expression rises as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia progresses to adenocarcinoma, and that Msi-expressing cells are key drivers of pancreatic cancer: they preferentially harbour the capacity to propagate adenocarcinoma, are enriched in circulating tumour cells, and are markedly drug resistant. This population could be effectively targeted by deletion of either Msi1 or Msi2, which led to a striking defect in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to adenocarcinoma and an improvement in overall survival. Msi inhibition also blocked the growth of primary patient-derived tumours, suggesting that this signal is required for human disease. To define the translational potential of this work we developed antisense oligonucleotides against Msi; these showed reliable tumour penetration, uptake and target inhibition, and effectively blocked pancreatic cancer growth. Collectively, these studies highlight Msi reporters as a unique tool to identify therapy resistance, and define Msi signalling as a central regulator of pancreatic cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Progression to the more aggressive stages of the diseases limits effective treatment and significantly exacerbates patient prognosis. The mechanisms causing delay and disease progression are largely unknown. The later stages of these diseases are characterized by excessive build up of primitive cell types, indicating a disruption in the normal cell differentiation process that is commonly regulated through feedback from differentiated types. In this study, we propose a mechanism where mutated primitive cells produce a feedback interference signal that desensitizes them to a normal homeostatic feedback.
