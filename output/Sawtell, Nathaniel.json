Extracellular electrophysiology delivers this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To minimize these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with much smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device samples neuronal activity at ultra-high spatial density (~10 times higher than previous probes) with low noise levels, while trading off recording span. NP Ultra is effectively an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neuron's electrical field. We use a spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes to demonstrate that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves up to ~3-fold. We show that NP Ultra can record from small neuronal structures including axons and dendrites. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of extracellular action potentials with unexpectedly small spatial spread and axon-like features. We share a large-scale dataset of these brain-wide recordings in mice as a resource for studies of neuronal biophysics. Finally, using ground-truth identification of three major inhibitory cortical cell types, we found that these cell types were discriminable with approximately 75% success, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings.

Here we provide evidence for improvements in neural coding and behavioral detection of prey-like stimuli due to negative images. In addition, we find that manipulating synaptic plasticity leads to specific changes in circuit output that disrupt neural coding and detection of prey-like stimuli.

Yet how the DCN contributes to early auditory processing has been a longstanding puzzle. Using electrophysiological recordings in mice during licking behavior, we show that DCN neurons are largely unaffected by self-generated sounds while remaining sensitive to external acoustic stimuli. Recordings in deafened mice, together with neural activity manipulations, indicate that self-generated sounds are cancelled by non-auditory signals conveyed by mossy fibers. In addition, DCN neurons exhibit gradual reductions in their responses to acoustic stimuli that are temporally correlated with licking. Together, these findings suggest that DCN may act as an adaptive filter for cancelling self-generated sounds. Adaptive filtering has been established previously for cerebellum-like sensory structures in fish, suggesting a conserved function for such structures across vertebrates.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Action Potentials", "Animals", "Auditory Perception", "Behavior, Animal", "Cerebellum", "Cochlear Nucleus", "Deafness", "Lidocaine", "Male", "Mice", "Neurons", "Trigeminal Nucleus, Spinal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shobhit", "Last Name": "Singla", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Conor", "Last Name": "Dempsey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Warren", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Armen G", "Last Name": "Enikolopov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel B", "Last Name": "Sawtell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature neuroscience", "PubDate": "2017Jul"}, {"PMID": "27930905", "Title": "The Timing Is Right for Cerebellar Learning.", "Abstract": "In this issue of Neuron, Suvrathan et\u00a0al.

Some of the clearest insights into the neural mechanisms underlying this process have come from studies of the electrosensory systems of fish. Neurons at the first stage of electrosensory processing generate negative images of the electrosensory consequences of the animal's own behavior. By canceling out the effects of predictable, self-generated inputs, negative images allow for the selective encoding of unpredictable, externally generated stimuli. Combined experimental and theoretical studies of electrosensory systems have led to detailed accounts of how negative images are formed at the level of synaptic plasticity rules, cells, and circuits.

The larval zebrafish is particularly promising in this regard because of its accessibility to optical monitoring and manipulations of neural activity. Although several studies suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in behavior at larval stages, little is known about the signals conveyed by particular classes of cerebellar neurons. Here we use electrophysiological recordings to characterize subthreshold, simple spike, and climbing fiber responses in larval zebrafish Purkinje cells in the context of the fictive optomotor response (OMR)-a paradigm in which fish adjust motor output to stabilize their virtual position relative to a visual stimulus. Although visual responses were prominent in Purkinje cells, they lacked the direction or velocity sensitivity that would be expected for controlling the OMR. On the other hand, Purkinje cells exhibited strong responses during fictive swim bouts. Temporal characteristics of these responses are suggestive of a general role for the larval zebrafish cerebellum in controlling swimming. Climbing fibers encoded both visual and motor signals but did not appear to encode signals that could be used to adjust OMR gain, such as retinal slip. Finally, the observation of diverse relationships between simple spikes and climbing fiber responses in individual Purkinje cells highlights the importance of distinguishing between these two types of activity in calcium imaging experiments.", "Keywords": ["cerebellum", "optomotor", "zebrafish"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Cerebellum", "Motor Activity", "Photic Stimulation", "Purkinje Cells", "Visual Perception", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karina", "Last Name": "Scalise", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Takashi", "Last Name": "Shimizu", "Affiliation": "Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Masahiko", "Last Name": "Hibi", "Affiliation": "Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel B", "Last Name": "Sawtell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York; and ns2635@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "PubDate": "2016Nov01"}, {"PMID": "27504860", "Title": "A comparative approach to cerebellar function: insights from electrosensory systems.", "Abstract": "Despite its simple and highly-ordered circuitry the function of the cerebellum remains a topic of vigorous debate.

In vivo recordings from ELL neurons and theoretical modeling suggest that negative images are formed via anti-Hebbian plasticity acting on random, nonlinear mixtures of CD and proprioception. In support of this, we find that CD and proprioception are randomly mixed in spinal mossy fibers and that properties of granule cells are consistent with a nonlinear recoding of these signals.
