Here, we leveraged a diversity outbred mouse population to map the genetic drivers of fresh/stored RBC metabolism and extravascular hemolysis upon storage and transfusion in 350 mice. We identify the ferrireductase Steap3 as a critical regulator of a ferroptosis-like process of lipid peroxidation. Steap3 polymorphisms were associated with RBC iron content, in vitro hemolysis, and in vivo extravascular hemolysis both in mice and 13,091 blood donors from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor evaluation Study. Using metabolite Quantitative Trait Loci analyses, we identified a network of gene products (FADS1/2, EPHX2 and LPCAT3) - enriched in donors of African descent - associated with oxylipin metabolism in stored human RBCs and related to Steap3 or its transcriptional regulator, the tumor protein TP53.

The hallmark of ferroptosis is uncontrolled and overwhelming peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in membrane phospholipids, which eventually leads to rupture of the plasma membrane. Ferroptosis is unique in that it is essentially a spontaneous, uncatalyzed chemical process based on perturbed iron and redox homeostasis contributing to the cell death process, but that it is nonetheless modulated by many metabolic nodes that impinge on the cells' susceptibility to ferroptosis. Among the various nodes affecting ferroptosis sensitivity, several have emerged as promising candidates for pharmacological intervention, rendering ferroptosis-related proteins attractive targets for the treatment of numerous currently incurable diseases. Herein, the current members of a Germany-wide research consortium focusing on ferroptosis research, as well as key external experts in ferroptosis who have made seminal contributions to this rapidly growing and exciting field of research, have gathered to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review on ferroptosis. Specific topics include: basic mechanisms, in vivo relevance, specialized methodologies, chemical and pharmacological tools, and the potential contribution of ferroptosis to disease etiopathology and progression. We hope that this article will not only provide established scientists and newcomers to the field with an overview of the multiple facets of ferroptosis, but also encourage additional efforts to characterize further molecular pathways modulating ferroptosis, with the ultimate goal to develop novel pharmacotherapies to tackle the various diseases associated with - or caused by - ferroptosis.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Cell death", "Iron", "Ischemia/reperfusion", "Lipid peroxidation", "Neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carsten", "Last Name": "Berndt", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hamed", "Last Name": "Alborzinia", "Affiliation": "Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM GGmbH), Heidelberg, Germany;

It acts as a lipolysis-targeting chimera (LIPTAC), preferentially targeting iron-rich CD44high cell-subpopulations7,8 associated with the metastatic disease and drug resistance9,10. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fentomycin also depletes CD44high cells in vivo and reduces intranodal tumour growth in an immunocompetent murine model of breast cancer metastasis.

Here, through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screenings, we identify GAS41 as a repressor of ferroptosis. GAS41 interacts with NRF2 and is critical for NRF2 to activate its targets such as SLC7A11 for modulating ferroptosis. By recognizing the H3K27-acetylation (H3K27-ac) marker, GAS41 is recruited to the SLC7A11 promoter, independent of NRF2 binding. By bridging the interaction between NRF2 and the H3K27-ac marker, GAS41 acts as an anchor for NRF2 on chromatin in a promoter-specific manner for transcriptional activation. Moreover, the GAS41-mediated effect on ferroptosis contributes to its oncogenic role in vivo. These data demonstrate that GAS41 is a target for modulating tumor growth through ferroptosis. Our study reveals a mechanism for GAS41-mediated regulation in transcription by anchoring NRF2 on chromatin, and provides a model in which the DNA binding activity on chromatin by transcriptional factors (NRF2) can be directly regulated by histone markers (H3K27-ac).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Histones", "Chromatin", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Ferroptosis", "Oncogenes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanqing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiming", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shoufu", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. wg8@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2024Mar21"}, {"PMID": "38430542", "Title": "Proteomic analysis of ferroptosis pathways reveals a role of CEPT1 in suppressing ferroptosis.", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis has been recognized as a unique cell death modality driven by excessive lipid peroxidation and unbalanced cellular metabolism.

Our research revealed a significant accumulation of diacyl-PUFA phosphatidylcholines (PC-PUFA2s) following fatty acid or phospholipid treatments, correlating with cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis. Depletion of PC-PUFA2s occurred in aging and Huntington's disease brain tissue, linking it to ferroptosis.

MQ treatment of murine B16F10 melanoma cells promoted activation of melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells and increased the efficacy of a tumor cell vaccine using MQ-treated cells even when the B16F10 cells lacked p53. We then designed a novel combination of APR-246 with the TLR-4 agonist, monophosphoryl lipid A, and a CD40 agonist to further enhance these immunogenic effects and demonstrated a significant antitumor response.

Our results thus indicate that combination of APR-246 with immunomodulatory agents may elicit effective antitumor immune response irrespective of the tumor's p53 mutation status.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "Melanoma"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Michels", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Divya", "Last Name": "Venkatesh", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cailian", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sadna", "Last Name": "Budhu", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariam M", "Last Name": "George", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Thach", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhong-Ke", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "The Organic Synthesis Core Facility, MSK, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ouathek", "Last Name": "Ouerfelli", "Affiliation": "The Organic Synthesis Core Facility, MSK, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hengrui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luis Felipe", "Last Name": "Campesato", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dmitriy", "Last Name": "Zamarin", "Affiliation": "Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Immunology Program, Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roberta", "Last Name": "Zappasodi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jedd D", "Last Name": "Wolchok", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA jwolchok@med.cornell.edu."}, {"First Name": "Taha", "Last Name": "Merghoub", "Affiliation": "https://ror.org/02r109517 Department of Pharmacology, Swim Across America and Ludwig Collaborative Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA tmerghoub@med.cornell.edu."}], "Journal": "Life science alliance", "PubDate": "2024Jan"}, {"PMID": "37752118", "Title": "Dehydroascorbic acid sensitizes cancer cells to system xc- inhibition-induced ferroptosis by promoting lipid droplet peroxidation.", "Abstract": "Since the discovery of ferroptosis, it has been postulated that this type of cell death could be utilized in treatments for cancer.

Lack of early detection methods, limited therapeutic agents, and low 5-year survival rate reflect the urgent need to develop new therapies. Eupenifeldin, a bistropolone, originally isolated from Eupenicillium brefeldianum, is a cytotoxic fungal metabolite. In three HSGOC cell lines (OVCAR3, OVCAR5, OVCAR8), eupenifeldin was found to have an IC50 value less than 10 nM, while 10 times higher concentrations were required for cytotoxicity in nontumorigenic fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell lines (FTSEC). An in vivo hollow fiber assay showed significant cytotoxicity in OVCAR3. Eupenifeldin significantly increased Annexin V staining in OVCAR3 and -8, but not OVCAR5. Eupenifeldin activated caspases 3/7 in OVCAR3, OVCAR5, and OVCAR8; however, cleaved PARP was only detected in OVCAR3. Quantitative proteomics performed on OVCAR3 implicated ferroptosis as the most enriched cell death pathway. However, validation experiments did not support ferroptosis as part of the cytotoxic mechanism of eupenifeldin. Autophagic flux and LC3B puncta assays found that eupenifeldin displayed weak autophagic induction in OVCAR3.

In this study, through a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen, followed by mechanistic investigation, we identified phospholipid-modifying enzymes MBOAT1 and MBOAT2 as ferroptosis suppressors. MBOAT1/2 inhibit ferroptosis by remodeling the cellular phospholipid profile, and strikingly, their ferroptosis surveillance function is independent of GPX4 or FSP1. MBOAT1 and MBOAT2 are transcriptionally upregulated by sex hormone receptors, i.e., estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR), respectively. A combination of ER or AR antagonist with ferroptosis induction significantly inhibited the growth of ER+ breast cancer and AR+ prostate cancer, even when tumors were resistant to single-agent hormonal therapies.", "Keywords": ["MBOAT1", "MBOAT2", "androgen receptor", "estrogen receptor", "ferroptosis", "phospholipid remodeling", "sex hormone signaling"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Humans", "Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase", "Lipid Peroxidation", "Ferroptosis", "Peroxides", "Phospholipids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deguang", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fereshteh", "Last Name": "Zandkarimi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeda", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinnie", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanyan", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

Pharmacological and genetic strategies that experimentally inhibit or delay apoptosis in mammalian systems have elucidated the key contribution of this process not only to (post-)embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, but also to the etiology of multiple human disorders. Consistent with this notion, while defects in the molecular machinery for apoptotic cell death impair organismal development and promote oncogenesis, the unwarranted activation of apoptosis promotes cell loss and tissue damage in the context of various neurological, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, infectious, neoplastic and inflammatory conditions. Here, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) gathered to critically summarize an\u00a0abundant pre-clinical literature mechanistically linking the core apoptotic apparatus to organismal homeostasis in the context of disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Apoptosis", "Cell Death", "Caspases", "Carcinogenesis", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ilio",

disease.", "Abstract": "Although it is well established that Huntington's disease (HD) is mainly caused by polyglutamine-expanded mutant huntingtin (mHTT), the molecular mechanism of mHTT-mediated actions is not fully understood. Here, we showed that expression of the N-terminal fragment containing the expanded polyglutamine (HTTQ94) of mHTT is able to promote both the ACSL4-dependent and the ACSL4-independent ferroptosis. Surprisingly, inactivation of the ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis fails to show any effect on the life span of Huntington's disease mice. Moreover, by using RNAi-mediated screening, we identified ALOX5 as a major factor required for the ACSL4-independent ferroptosis induced by HTTQ94. Although ALOX5 is not required for the ferroptotic responses triggered by common ferroptosis inducers such as erastin, loss of ALOX5 expression abolishes HTTQ94-mediated ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Interestingly, ALOX5 is also required for HTTQ94-mediated ferroptosis in neuronal cells upon high levels of glutamate. Mechanistically, HTTQ94 activates ALOX5-mediated ferroptosis by stabilizing FLAP, an essential cofactor of ALOX5-mediated lipoxygenase activity. Notably, inactivation of the Alox5 gene abrogates the ferroptosis activity in the striatal neurons from the HD mice; more importantly, loss of ALOX5 significantly ameliorates the pathological phenotypes and extends the life spans of these HD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ALOX5 is critical for mHTT-mediated ferroptosis and suggest that ALOX5 is a potential new target for Huntington's disease.", "Keywords": ["ACSL4", "ALOX5", "GPX4", "HTT", "ROS", "ferroptosis", "oxidative stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Disease Models, Animal", "Ferroptosis", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Neurons", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shujuan", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhenyi", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianyuan", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA; wg8@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2023Mar01"}, {"PMID": "36865302", "Title": "A cell state specific metabolic vulnerability to GPX4-dependent ferroptosis in glioblastoma.", "Abstract": "Glioma cells hijack developmental transcriptional programs to control cell state. During neural development, lineage trajectories rely on specialized metabolic pathways. However, the link between tumor cell state and metabolic programs is poorly understood in glioma.

To model cell state diversity, we generated genetically engineered murine gliomas, induced by deletion of p53 alone (p53) or with constitutively active Notch signaling (N1IC), a pathway critical in controlling cellular fate. N1IC tumors harbored quiescent astrocyte-like transformed cell states while p53 tumors were predominantly comprised of proliferating progenitor-like cell states. N1IC cells exhibit distinct metabolic alterations, with mitochondrial uncoupling and increased ROS production rendering them more sensitive to inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 and induction of ferroptosis.

NFE2L2/NRF2 knockout cells have low HERC2 expression, leading to a simultaneous increase in ferritin and NCOA4 and recruitment of apoferritin into the autophagosome. NFE2L2/NRF2 knockout cells also have low VAMP8 expression, which leads to ferritinophagy blockage.

Further, Gls2 KO mice subjected to the hepatocarcinogenic Stelic Animal Model (STAM) protocol produce larger HCC tumors than seen in wild-type (WT) mice. GLS2 has been shown to promote ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides. In line with this, GLS2 deficiency, either in cells derived from Gls2 KO mice or in human cancer cells depleted of GLS2, conferred significant resistance to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, GLS2, but not GLS1, increased lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by facilitating the conversion of glutamate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG), thereby promoting ferroptosis. Ectopic expression of WT GLS2 in a human hepatic adenocarcinoma xenograft model significantly reduced tumor size; this effect was nullified by either expressing a catalytically inactive form of GLS2 or by blocking ferroptosis.

We predicted that the metabolic stress induced by the bacteria in the host cells shapes an immune response that tolerates infection. We combined in situ metabolic imaging and transcriptional analyses to demonstrate that Kp ST258 activates host glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation. This response creates an oxidant-rich microenvironment conducive to the accumulation of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells. In this setting, metabolically active Kp ST258 elicits a disease-tolerant immune response. The bacteria, in turn, adapt to airway oxidants by upregulating the type VI secretion system, which is highly conserved across ST258 strains worldwide. Thus, much of the global success of Kp ST258 in hospital settings can be explained by the metabolic activity provoked in the host that promotes disease tolerance.", "Keywords": ["Klebsiella pneumoniae", "M2 macrophages", "MDSCs", "bacterial adaptation", "disease tolerance", "immunometabolism", "immunosuppression", "itaconate", "pulmonary infection", "type 6 secretion system"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Klebsiella Infections", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Stress, Physiological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tania", "Last Name": "Wong Fok Lung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

"Determining cell death mechanisms occurring in patient and animal tissues is a longstanding goal that requires suitable biomarkers and accurate quantification. However, effective methods remain elusive. To develop more powerful and unbiased analytic frameworks, we developed a machine learning approach for automated cell death classification. Image sets were collected of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells undergoing ferroptosis or apoptosis and stained with an anti-transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) antibody, together with nuclear and F-actin staining. Features were extracted using high-content-analysis software, and a classifier was constructed by fitting a multinomial logistic lasso regression model to the data. The prediction accuracy of the classifier within three classes (control, ferroptosis, apoptosis) was 93%. Thus, TfR1 staining, combined with nuclear and F-actin staining, can reliably detect both apoptotic and ferroptotis cells when cell features are analyzed in an unbiased manner using machine learning, providing a method for unbiased analysis of modes of cell death.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Apoptosis", "Biomarkers", "Ferroptosis", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Receptors, Transferrin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenji", "Last Name": "Schorpp", "Affiliation": "HelmholtzZentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Cell Signaling and Chemical Biology, Institute for Molecular Toxicology and Pharmacology, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Samaga", "Affiliation": "HelmholtzZentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Research Unit Radiation Cytogenetics, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kristian", "Last Name": "Unger", "Affiliation": "HelmholtzZentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Research Unit Radiation Cytogenetics, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kamyar", "Last Name": "Hadian", "Affiliation": "HelmholtzZentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Cell Signaling and Chemical Biology, Institute for Molecular Toxicology and Pharmacology, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2022Mar18"}, {"PMID": "35213158", "Title": "Discovery of Anticancer Agents of Diverse Natural Origin.", "Abstract": "Research progress from mainly over the last five years is described for a multidisciplinary collaborative program project directed toward the discovery of potential anticancer agents from a broad range of taxonomically defined organisms.

The calcium-independent phospholipase iPLA2\u03b2 is known to cleave acyl tails from the glycerol backbone of lipids and release oxidized fatty acids from phospholipids. We found that iPLA2\u03b2-mediated detoxification of peroxidized lipids is sufficient to suppress p53-driven ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress, even in GPX4-null cells. Moreover, iPLA2\u03b2 is overexpressed in human cancers; inhibition of endogenous iPLA2\u03b2 sensitizes tumor cells to p53-driven ferroptosis and promotes p53-dependent tumor suppression in xenograft mouse models. These results demonstrate that iPLA2\u03b2 acts as a major ferroptosis repressor in a GPX4-independent manner. Notably, unlike GPX4, loss of iPLA2\u03b2 has no obvious effect on normal development or cell viability in normal tissues but iPLA2\u03b2 plays an essential role in regulating ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress.

in the context of liver cancer. Our study investigates CAF functions in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a highly desmoplastic liver tumor. Genetic tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and ligand-receptor analyses uncovered hepatic stellate cells (HSC) as the main source of CAF and HSC-derived CAF as the dominant population interacting with tumor cells. In mice, CAF promotes ICC progression, as revealed by HSC-selective CAF depletion. In patients, a high panCAF signature is associated with decreased survival and increased recurrence. Single-cell RNA sequencing segregates CAF into inflammatory and growth factor-enriched (iCAF) and myofibroblastic (myCAF) subpopulations, displaying distinct ligand-receptor interactions. myCAF-expressed hyaluronan synthase 2, but not type I collagen, promotes ICC. iCAF-expressed hepatocyte growth factor enhances ICC growth via tumor-expressed MET, thus directly linking CAF to tumor cells.

This assay is based on rescuing protease-mediated cytotoxicity and does not require live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of 15 distantly related coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, we identified compounds with broad 3CLpro-inhibitory activity. We also adapted the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncovered additional severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CLpro inhibitors. We observed strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live-virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identified two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested, including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Multiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last 2 decades. This has highlighted a need to be proactive in the development of therapeutics that can be readily deployed in the case of future coronavirus pandemics. We developed and validated a simplified cell-based assay for the identification of chemical inhibitors of 3CL proteases encoded by a wide range of coronaviruses. This assay is reporter free, does not require specialized biocontainment, and is optimized for performance in high-throughput screening. By testing reported 3CL protease inhibitors against a large collection of 3CL proteases with variable sequence similarity, we identified compounds with broad activity against 3CL proteases and uncovered structural insights into features that contribute to their broad activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this assay is suitable for identifying chemical inhibitors of proteases from families other than 3CL proteases.", "Keywords": ["3CL protease", "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "antiviral drugs", "cell-based assay", "coronavirus", "protease inhibitors", "protease-mediated cytotoxicity", "zoonotic coronaviruses"], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Coronavirus 3C Proteases", "Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel J", "Last Name": "Resnick", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seo Jung", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arie", "Last Name": "Zask", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hengrui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sungsoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Schuyler", "Last Name": "Melore", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang-Yu", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "WuXi AppTec, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manoj S", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sumin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas E S", "Last Name": "Tay", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomislav", "Last Name": "Rovis", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hee Won", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "WuXi AppTec, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Chavez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2021Jun24"}, {"PMID": "33795671", "Title": "Lead compounds for the development of SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitors.", "Abstract": "We report the identification of three structurally diverse compounds - compound 4, GC376, and MAC-5576 - as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease.

This unique modality of cell death, driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, is regulated by multiple cellular metabolic pathways, including redox homeostasis, iron handling, mitochondrial activity and metabolism of amino acids, lipids and sugars, in addition to various signalling pathways relevant to disease. Numerous organ injuries and degenerative pathologies are driven by ferroptosis. Intriguingly, therapy-resistant cancer cells, particularly those in the mesenchymal state and prone to metastasis, are exquisitely vulnerable to ferroptosis. As such, pharmacological modulation of ferroptosis, via both its induction and its inhibition, holds great potential for the treatment of drug-resistant cancers, ischaemic organ injuries and other degenerative diseases linked to extensive lipid peroxidation. In this Review, we provide a critical analysis of the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of ferroptosis, the potential physiological functions of ferroptosis in tumour suppression and immune surveillance, and its pathological roles, together with a potential for therapeutic targeting. Importantly, as in all rapidly evolving research areas, challenges exist due to misconceptions and inappropriate experimental methods. This Review also aims to address these issues and to provide practical guidelines for enhancing reproducibility and reliability in studies of ferroptosis.

Here, we provide evidence to support these latter two roles of p21 by exploring its ability to regulate ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that is associated with certain degenerative diseases, some of which are aging-related. Our results reveal a correlation between p21 protein levels in cell lines that are resistant to ferroptosis (p21 high) versus cell lines that are sensitive and easily undergo ferroptosis (p21 low). We also show that p21 levels themselves are differentially regulated in response to ferroptosis in a p53-independent manner. Further, experimentally altering the abundance of p21 protein inverts the ferroptosis-sensitivity of both resistant and sensitive human cancer cell lines. Our data also indicate that the interaction of p21 with CDKs is crucial for its ability to restrict the progression of ferroptosis.

MDM2 also has pro-oncogenic roles in cells, tissues, and animals that are independent of p53. There is less information available about p53-independent roles of MDMX or the MDM2-MDMX complex. We found that MDM2 and MDMX facilitate ferroptosis in cells with or without p53. Using small molecules, RNA interference reagents, and mutant forms of MDMX, we found that MDM2 and MDMX, likely working in part as a complex, normally facilitate ferroptotic death. We observed that MDM2 and MDMX alter the lipid profile of cells to favor ferroptosis. Inhibition of MDM2 or MDMX leads to increased levels of FSP1 protein and a consequent increase in the levels of coenzyme Q10, an endogenous lipophilic antioxidant. This suggests that MDM2 and MDMX normally prevent cells from mounting an adequate defense against lipid peroxidation and thereby promote ferroptosis.

The enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a central regulator of ferroptosis, and protects cells by neutralizing lipid peroxides, which are by-products of cellular metabolism. The direct inhibition of GPX4, or indirect inhibition by depletion of its substrate glutathione or the building blocks of glutathione (such as cysteine), can trigger ferroptosis3. Ferroptosis contributes to the antitumour function of several tumour suppressors such as p53, BAP1 and fumarase4-7. Counterintuitively, mesenchymal cancer cells-which are prone to metastasis, and often resistant to various treatments-are highly susceptible to ferroptosis8,9. Here we show that ferroptosis can be regulated non-cell-autonomously by cadherin-mediated intercellular interactions. In epithelial cells, such interactions mediated by E-cadherin suppress ferroptosis by activating the intracellular NF2 (also known as merlin) and Hippo signalling pathway. Antagonizing this signalling axis allows the proto-oncogenic transcriptional co-activator YAP to promote ferroptosis by upregulating several ferroptosis modulators, including ACSL4 and TFRC. This finding provides mechanistic insights into the observations that cancer cells with mesenchymal or metastatic property are highly sensitive to ferroptosis8. Notably, a similar mechanism also modulates ferroptosis in some non-epithelial cells. Finally, genetic inactivation of the tumour suppressor NF2, a frequent tumorigenic event in mesothelioma10,11, rendered cancer cells more sensitive to ferroptosis in an orthotopic mouse model of malignant mesothelioma. Our results demonstrate the role of intercellular interactions and intracellular NF2-YAP signalling in dictating ferroptotic death, and also suggest that malignant mutations in NF2-YAP signalling could predict the responsiveness of cancer cells to future ferroptosis-inducing therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Cadherins", "Cell Count", "Coenzyme A Ligases", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Ferroptosis", "HCT116 Cells", "Hippo Signaling Pathway", "Humans", "Mesothelioma", "Mice", "Mutation", "Neurofibromin 2", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Receptors, Transferrin", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "YAP-Signaling Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiao", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Alexander M", "Last Name": "Minikes", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Minghui", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huijie", "Last Name": "Bian", "Affiliation": "National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Nan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "National Translational Science Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, China. znchen@fmmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. jiangx@mskcc.org."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "31269423", "Title": "A Physiological Function for Ferroptosis in Tumor Suppression by the Immune System.", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death involving lethal peroxidation of phospholipids (Hirschhorn and Stockwell, 2019).

The high prevalence of KRAS mutations and its essential role in many cancers make it a potentially attractive drug target; however, it has been difficult to create small molecule inhibitors of mutant K-Ras proteins. Here, we identified a putative small molecule binding site on K-RasG12D using computational analyses of the protein structure and then used a combination of computational and biochemical approaches to discover small molecules that may bind to this pocket, which we have termed the P110 site, due to its adjacency to proline 110. We confirmed that one compound, named K-Ras allosteric ligand KAL-21404358, bound to K-RasG12D, as measured by microscale thermophoresis, a thermal shift assay, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. KAL-21404358 did not bind to four mutants in the P110 site, supporting our hypothesis that KAL-21404358 binds to the P110 site of K-RasG12D.

A small-molecule screen identified cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) as a stressor to which stem cell-derived motor neurons were more sensitive than interneurons.

F508del destabilizes nucleotide-binding domain 1 (hNBD1) in hCFTR relative to an aggregation-prone intermediate. We developed a fluorescence self-quenching assay for compounds that prevent aggregation of hNBD1 by stabilizing its native conformation. Unexpectedly, we found that dTTP and nucleotide analogs with exocyclic methyl groups bind to hNBD1 more strongly than ATP and preserve electrophysiological function of full-length F508del-hCFTR channels at temperatures up to 37 \u00b0C. Furthermore, nucleotides that increase open-channel probability, which reflects stabilization of an interdomain interface to hNBD1, thermally protect full-length F508del-hCFTR even when they do not stabilize isolated hNBD1. Therefore, stabilization of hNBD1 itself or of one of its interdomain interfaces by a small molecule indirectly offsets the destabilizing effect of the F508del mutation on full-length hCFTR.

We also discuss the potential evolutionary roles of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.", "Keywords": ["ROS", "cell death", "ferroptosis", "iron", "lipid peroxidation", "vitamin E"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antioxidants", "Biological Evolution", "Cell Death", "Humans", "Iron", "Lipid Peroxidation", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Species Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marcus", "Last Name": "Conrad", "Affiliation": "Institute of Developmental Genetics, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Deutsches Forschungszentrum f\u00fcr Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Valerian E", "Last Name": "Kagan", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bayir", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriela C", "Last Name": "Pagnussat", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas (CONICET), Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, 7600 Mar del Plata, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Head", "Affiliation": "Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97330."}, {"First Name": "Maret G", "Last Name": "Traber", "Affiliation": "Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97330."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2018May01"}, {"PMID": "29795546", "Title": "Unsolved mysteries: How does lipid peroxidation cause ferroptosis?", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is a cell death process driven by damage to cell membranes and linked to numerous human diseases. Ferroptosis is caused by loss of activity of the key enzyme that is tasked with repairing oxidative damage to cell membranes-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). GPX4 normally removes the dangerous products of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, protecting cell membranes from this type of damage; when GPX4 fails, ferroptosis ensues. Ferroptosis is distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis, necrosis, and other modes of cell death. Several key mysteries regarding how cells die during ferroptosis remain unsolved. First, the drivers of lipid peroxidation are not yet clear. Second, the subcellular location of lethal lipid peroxides remains an outstanding question. Finally, how exactly lipid peroxidation leads to cell death is an unsolved mystery.

However, the effects on macrophage biology of acutely ingesting large numbers of RBCs are not completely understood. To investigate this issue, we used a mouse model of RBC transfusion and clearance, which mimics the clinical setting. In this model, transfusions of refrigerator storage-damaged (ie, \"old\") RBCs led to increased erythrophagocytosis by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs). This robust erythrophagocytosis induced ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death, in RPMs. This was accompanied by increases in reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in vivo, which were reduced by treatment in vitro with ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor. Old RBC transfusions also induced RPM-dependent chemokine expression by splenic Ly6Chi monocytes, which signaled Ly6Chi monocyte migration from bone marrow to spleen, where these cells subsequently differentiated into RPMs. The combination of cell division among remaining splenic RPMs, along with the influx of bone marrow-derived Ly6Chi monocytes, suggests that, following RPM depletion induced by robust erythrophagocytosis, there is a coordinated effort to restore homeostasis of the RPM population by local self-maintenance and contributions from circulating monocytes.

In this study, we demonstrated that PDI is upregulated in the HD human brain, in cell and mouse models. Chronic administration of a reversible, brain penetrable small molecule PDI modulator, LOC14 (20 mg/kg/day), significantly improved motor function, attenuated brain atrophy and extended survival in the N171-82Q HD mice.

frequently mutated among the three RAS isoforms (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS). However, directly targeting oncogenic KRAS with small molecules in the nucleotide-binding site has been difficult because of the high affinity of KRAS for GDP and GTP. We designed an engineered allele of KRAS and a covalent inhibitor that competes for GTP and GDP. This ligand-receptor combination demonstrates that the high affinity of GTP and GDP for RAS proteins can be overcome with a covalent inhibitor and a suitably engineered binding site. The covalent inhibitor irreversibly modifies the protein at the engineered nucleotide-binding site and is able to compete with GDP and GTP. This provides a new tool for studying KRAS function and suggests strategies for targeting the nucleotide-binding site of oncogenic RAS proteins.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Drug Design", "Guanosine Diphosphate", "Guanosine Triphosphate", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Engineering", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Small Molecule Libraries"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "Last Name": "Larraufie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leila", "Last Name": "Musavi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hemanth", "Last Name": "Akkiraju", "Affiliation": "Quantitative Proteomics and Metabolomics Center, Columbia University , New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lewis M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Quantitative Proteomics and Metabolomics Center, Columbia University , New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2018Feb27"}, {"PMID": "29053966", "Title": "Transforming Lipoxygenases: PE-Specific Enzymes in Disguise.", "Abstract": "In this issue of Cell, Wenzel et\u00a0al. solve a long-standing mystery regarding how damage to cell membranes occurs during ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death.

Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents an ancient vulnerability caused by the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cellular membranes, and cells have developed complex systems that exploit and defend against this vulnerability in different contexts. The sensitivity to ferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including amino acid, iron, and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of glutathione, phospholipids, NADPH, and coenzyme Q10. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological cell death associated with degenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases), carcinogenesis, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and kidney degeneration in mammals and is also implicated in heat stress in plants. Ferroptosis may also have a tumor-suppressor function that could be harnessed for cancer therapy.

On the other hand, neurodegenerative diseases are thought to involve chronic microglia activation resulting in release of excess glutamate, proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, leading to neuronal death. System xC- cystine/glutamate antiporter (SXC), a sodium independent heterodimeric transporter found in microglia and astrocytes in the CNS, imports cystine into the cell and exports glutamate. SXC has been shown to be upregulated in neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis, ALS, neuroAIDS Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, SXC inhibitors could be of use in the treatment of diseases characterized by neuroinflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity. We report on the optimization of a primary microglia-based assay to screen for SXC inhibitors. Rat primary microglia were activated using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and glutamate release and cystine uptake were monitored by fluorescence and radioactivity respectively. LPS-induced glutamate release increased with increasing cell density, time of incubation and LPS concentration. Conditions to screen for SXC inhibitors were optimized in 96-well format and subsequently used to evaluate SXC inhibitors. Known SXC inhibitors sulfasalazine, S-4CPG and erastin blocked glutamate release and cystine uptake while R-4CPG, the inactive enantiomer of S-4CPG, failed to inhibit glutamate release or cystine transport.

All students participated in the same class, which consisted of a lecture with periodic breaks for students to solve problems using an audience response system.

The exam had two types of questions-recall questions, in which students had to simply recall information provided to them, and predict questions, in which students had to apply their new knowledge to a new context. Students in the individual and group-based learning conditions performed similarly well on recall questions. However, students who had been in the group-based learning condition performed significantly better as individuals on the predict questions.

A high-mesenchymal cell state observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has been associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities across diverse cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning for this state has remained incompletely understood. Here we molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant high-mesenchymal cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show that it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects against ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by the build-up of toxic lipid peroxides. We show that this cell state is characterized by activity of enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are the substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This lipid metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates lipid peroxides and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found to exist across diverse therapy-resistant states characterized by high expression of ZEB1, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived carcinomas, TGF\u03b2-mediated therapy-resistance in melanoma, treatment-induced neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer, and sarcomas, which are fixed in a mesenchymal state owing to their cells of origin.

Considering that regulation of fatty acid metabolism is responsible for the membrane-resident pool of oxidizable fatty acids that undergo lipid peroxidation in ferroptotic processes, we examined the contribution of the key fatty acid metabolism enzyme, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), in regulating ferroptosis. By using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we found that knockout of Acsl4 in ferroptosis-sensitive murine and human cells conferred protection from erastin- and RSL3-induced cell death. In the same cell types, deletion of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (Mlkl) blocked susceptibility to necroptosis, as expected. Surprisingly, these studies also revealed ferroptosis and necroptosis are alternative, in that resistance to one pathway sensitized cells to death via the other pathway. These data suggest a mechanism by which one regulated necrosis pathway compensates for another when either ferroptosis or necroptosis is compromised. We verified the synergistic contributions of ferroptosis and necroptosis to tissue damage during acute organ failure in vivo. Interestingly, in the course of pathophysiological acute ischemic kidney injury, ACSL4 was initially upregulated and its expression level correlated with the severity of tissue damage.

Small molecules that inhibit glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a phospholipid peroxidase, cause lethal accumulation of lipid peroxides and induce ferroptotic cell death. Although ferroptosis has been suggested to involve accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lipid environments, the mediators and substrates of ROS generation and the pharmacological mechanism of GPX4 inhibition that generates ROS in lipid environments are unknown. We report here the mechanism of lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, which involves phosphorylase kinase G2 (PHKG2) regulation of iron availability to lipoxygenase enzymes, which in turn drive ferroptosis through peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at the bis-allylic position; indeed, pretreating cells with PUFAs containing the heavy hydrogen isotope deuterium at the site of peroxidation (D-PUFA) prevented PUFA oxidation and blocked ferroptosis. We further found that ferroptosis inducers inhibit GPX4 by covalently targeting the active site selenocysteine, leading to accumulation of PUFA hydroperoxides. In summary, we found that PUFA oxidation by lipoxygenases via a PHKG2-dependent iron pool is necessary for ferroptosis and that the covalent inhibition of the catalytic selenocysteine in Gpx4 prevents elimination of PUFA hydroperoxides; these findings suggest new strategies for controlling ferroptosis in diverse contexts.", "Keywords": ["Gpx4", "PHKG2", "PUFAs", "ferroptosis", "lipoxygenase"], "MeSH terms": ["Catalytic Domain", "Cell Death", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Deuterium", "Epithelial Cells", "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glutathione Peroxidase", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Humans", "Iron", "Lipid Peroxidation", "Lipid Peroxides", "Lipoxygenases", "Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase", "Phosphorylase Kinase", "Protein Transport", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Selenocysteine", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wan Seok", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439; yangw@stjohns.edu bstockwell@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Katherine J", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Gaschler", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "Milesh", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016;"}, {"First Name": "Mikhail S", "Last Name": "Shchepinov", "Affiliation": "Retrotope, Inc., Los Altos, CA 94022."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; yangw@stjohns.edu bstockwell@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2016Aug23"}, {"PMID": "27373155", "Title": "Protein Prenylation Constitutes an Endogenous Brake on Axonal Growth.", "Abstract": "Suboptimal axonal regeneration contributes to the\u00a0consequences of nervous system trauma and neurodegenerative disease, but the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate axon growth remain unclear.

In an examination of 56 caspase-independent lethal compounds, modulatory profiling showed that 10 compounds induced three different types of regulated non-apoptotic cell death. Optimization of one of those ten resulted in the discovery of FIN56, a specific inducer of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis has been found to occur when the lipid-repair enzyme GPX4 is inhibited. FIN56 promoted degradation of GPX4. FIN56 also bound to and activated squalene synthase, an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis, independent of GPX4 degradation.

We analyzed the compound sensitivity data of 6,259 lethal compounds from the NCI-60 project.

Further transcriptome analysis revealed a biomarker, NADPH abundance, for predicting sensitivity to ferroptosis-inducing compounds, which we experimentally validated.

in disease. Although apoptosis has been the focus of drug discovery for many years, recent research has identified regulatory mechanisms and signalling pathways for previously unrecognized, regulated necrotic cell death routines. Distinct critical nodes have been characterized for some of these alternative cell death routines, whereas other cell death routines are just beginning to be unravelled. In this Review, we describe forms of regulated necrotic cell death, including necroptosis, the emerging cell death modality of ferroptosis (and the related oxytosis) and the less well comprehended parthanatos and cyclophilin D-mediated necrosis. We focus on small molecules, proteins and pathways that can induce and inhibit these non-apoptotic forms of cell death, and discuss strategies for translating this understanding into new therapeutics for certain disease contexts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Necrosis", "Signal Transduction", "Small Molecule Libraries"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marcus", "Last Name": "Conrad", "Affiliation": "Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Institute of Developmental Genetics, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 Pedro Friedmann", "Last Name": "Angeli", "Affiliation": "Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, Institute of Developmental Genetics, 85764 Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Vandenabeele", "Affiliation": "Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, Inflammation Research Center, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, 9052 Ghent, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, 550 West 120th Street, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, New York, New York 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

We show that securinine is protective in a cell model of Huntington disease and identify the binding site of securinine to its target, protein disulfide isomerase using NMR chemical shift perturbation studies. We show that securinine displays favorable pharmaceutical properties, making it a promising compound for in vivo studies in neurodegenerative disease models.

Most screening efforts have been conducted with immortalized cell lines grown with fetal bovine serum, which have little relevance to the genomic features found in GBM patients. Patient-derived neurosphere cultures, while being more physiologically relevant, are difficult to screen and therefore are only used to test a few drug candidates after initial screening efforts. Laminin has been used to generate two-dimensional cell lines from patient tumors, preserving the genomic signature and alleviating some screening hurdles. We present here the first side-by-side comparison of inhibitor sensitivity of laminin and neurosphere-grown patient-derived GBM cell lines and show that both of these culture methods result in the same pattern of inhibitor sensitivity. We used these screening methods to evaluate the dependencies of seven patient-derived cell models: three grown on laminin and four grown as neurospheres, against 56 agents in 17-point dose-response curves in 384-well format in triplicate. This allowed us to establish differential sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agents across the seven patient-derived models. We found that MEK inhibition caused patient-sample-specific growth inhibition and that bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, was potently lethal in all patient-derived models. Furthermore, the screening results led us to test the combination of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-263, and the mTOR inhibitor AZD-8055, which we found to be synergistic in a subset of patient-derived GBM models.

LOC14 was identified using a high-throughput screen of \u223c10,000 lead-optimized compounds for potent rescue of viability of PC12 cells expressing mutant huntingtin protein, followed by an evaluation of compounds on PDI reductase activity in an in vitro screen. Isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence experiments revealed that binding to PDI was reversible with a Kd of 62 nM, suggesting LOC14 to be the most potent PDI inhibitor reported to date. Using 2D heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR experiments, we were able to map the binding site of LOC14 as being adjacent to the active site and to observe that binding of LOC14 forces PDI to adopt an oxidized conformation. Furthermore, we found that LOC14-induced oxidation of PDI has a neuroprotective effect not only in cell culture, but also in corticostriatal brain slice cultures.

parenchymal cells in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and loss of either Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) or caspase-8 is known to sensitize tissues to undergo spontaneous necroptosis. Here, we demonstrate that renal tubules do not undergo sensitization to necroptosis upon genetic ablation of either FADD or caspase-8 and that the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) does not protect freshly isolated tubules from hypoxic injury. In contrast, iron-dependent ferroptosis directly causes synchronized necrosis of renal tubules, as demonstrated by intravital microscopy in models of IRI and oxalate crystal-induced acute kidney injury. To suppress ferroptosis in vivo, we generated a novel third-generation ferrostatin (termed 16-86), which we demonstrate to be more stable, to metabolism and plasma, and more potent, compared with the first-in-class compound ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Even in conditions with extraordinarily severe IRI, 16-86 exerts strong protection to an extent which has not previously allowed survival in any murine setting. In addition, 16-86 further potentiates the strong protective effect on IRI mediated by combination therapy with necrostatins and compounds that inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition.

The resource can be used to develop novel therapeutic hypotheses and to accelerate discovery of drugs matched to patients by their cancer genotype and lineage.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Databases, Pharmaceutical", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amrita", "Last Name": "Basu", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole E", "Last Name": "Bodycombe", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jaime H", "Last Name": "Cheah", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edmund V", "Last Name": "Price", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ke", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giannina I", "Last Name": "Schaefer", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard Y", "Last Name": "Ebright", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle L", "Last Name": "Stewart", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daisuke", "Last Name": "Ito", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abigail L", "Last Name": "Bracha", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ted", "Last Name": "Liefeld", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mathias", "Last Name": "Wawer", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua C", "Last Name": "Gilbert", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Stransky", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory V", "Last Name": "Kryukov", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vlado", "Last Name": "Dancik", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordi", "Last Name": "Barretina", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Levi A", "Last Name": "Garraway", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "C Suk-Yee", "Last Name": "Hon", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benito", "Last Name": "Munoz", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Bittker", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dineo", "Last Name": "Khabele", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew M", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Clemons", "Affiliation": "The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

Here we sought to systematically identify non-apoptotic cell death pathways in mammalian cells. We screened 69,612 compounds for those that induce non-canonical cell death by counter screening in the presence of inhibitors of apoptosis and necrosis. We further selected compounds that require active protein synthesis for inducing cell death. Using this tiered approach, we identified NID-1 (Novel Inducer of Death-1), a small molecule that induces an active, energy-dependent cell death in diverse mammalian cell lines. NID-1-induced death required components of the autophagic machinery, including ATG5, and the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin L, but was distinct from classical macroautophagy. Since macroautophagy can prevent cell death in several contexts, we tested and found that NID-1 suppressed cell death in a cell-based model of Huntington's disease, suggesting that NID-1 activates a specific pathway. Thus the discovery of NID-1 identifies a previously unexplored cell death pathway, and modulating this pathway may have therapeutic applications. Furthermore, these findings provide a proof-of-principle for using chemical screening to identify novel cell death paradigms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Protein 5", "Cathepsin L", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Huntingtin Protein", "Mice", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Necrosis", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "PC12 Cells", "Peptides", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Rats", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Thiophenes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hemant", "Last Name": "Varma", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, United States; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nidhi M", "Last Name": "Gangadhar", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Reka R", "Last Name": "Letso", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Wolpaw", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rohitha", "Last Name": "Sriramaratnam", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, United States; Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, United States.

While inhibitors of protein activity are relatively common, small molecules that can increase protein abundance are rare. Small molecule protein upregulators with targeted activities would be of value in the study of the mechanisms underlying loss-of-function diseases. We developed a high-throughput screening approach to identify small molecule upregulators of the Survival of Motor Neuron protein (SMN), whose decreased levels cause the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We screened 69,189 compounds for SMN upregulators and performed mechanistic studies on the most active compound, a bromobenzophenone analogue designated cuspin-1. Mechanistic studies of cuspin-1 revealed that increasing Ras signaling upregulates SMN protein abundance via an increase in translation rate. These findings suggest that controlled modulation of the Ras signaling pathway may benefit patients with SMA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Blood-Brain Barrier", "Computer Simulation", "Fibroblasts", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Pyridines", "Reproducibility of Results", "SMN Complex Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "ras Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Reka R", "Last Name": "Letso", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, Northwest Corner Building, MC 4846, 550 West 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andras J", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell R", "Last Name": "Lunn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wan Seok", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2013May17"}]
