Oral immunotherapy therapy (OIT) in early childhood has been demonstrated to be highly effective and safe in preschoolers with and without AD, especially in young infants. Delays in initiation of OIT in infants and children due to uncontrolled AD risks expansion of the number of foods children develop allergy to via unnecessary avoidance of multiple foods. Parents and caregivers may attribute eczema flares to OIT doses, which physicians usually ascribe to non-food triggers such as weather changes, psychological stress, and infection. There is a lack of published literature confirming OIT as a trigger of AD flares, and the degree to which OIT may be associated with AD flares needs to be further studied. We describe eight case scenarios with varying degrees of AD flare before and during OIT. We propose management algorithms for children with pre-existing concurrent AD and food allergy who are being considered for starting OIT, and children with AD flares during OIT. Optimizing AD control strategies and providing adequate AD care education prior to starting OIT can reduce confusion for both parents and allergists if rashes arise during OIT, thus improving adherence to OIT.", "Keywords": ["Atopic Dermatitis", "food allergy", "oral immunotherapy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gilbert T", "Last Name": "Chua", "Affiliation": "Allergy Centre, Union Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China; Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.

Typically, sequencing-based screens require cell lysis, which limits the examination of critical phenotypes such as cell morphology, protein subcellular localization, and cell-cell/tissue interactions. In contrast, emerging optical pooled screening methods enable the investigation of these spatial phenotypes in response to targeted CRISPR perturbations. In this study, we report a multi-omic optical pooled CRISPR screening method, which we have named CRISPRmap. Our method combines a novel in situ CRISPR guide identifying barcode readout approach with concurrent multiplexed immunofluorescence and in situ RNA detection. CRISPRmap barcodes are detected and read out through combinatorial hybridization of DNA oligos, enhancing barcode detection efficiency, while reducing both dependency on third party proprietary sequencing reagents and assay cost. Notably, we conducted a multi-omic base-editing screen in a breast cancer cell line on core DNA damage repair genes involved in the homologous recombination and Fanconi anemia pathways investigating how nucleotide variants in those genes influence DNA damage signaling and cell cycle regulation following treatment with ionizing radiation or DNA damaging agents commonly used for cancer therapy. Approximately a million cells were profiled with our multi-omic approach, providing a comprehensive phenotypic assessment of the functional consequences of the studied variants. CRISPRmap enabled us to pinpoint likely-pathogenic patient-derived mutations that were previously classified as variants of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore, our approach effectively distinguished barcodes of a pooled library in tumor tissue, and we coupled it with cell-type and molecular phenotyping by cyclic immunofluorescence. Multi-omic spatial analysis of how CRISPR-perturbed cells respond to various environmental cues in the tissue context offers the potential to significantly expand our understanding of tissue biology in both health and disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiacheng", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abhishek", "Last Name": "Iyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ben", "Last Name": "Wesley", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "Taglialatela", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Leuzzi", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Hangai", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aubrianna", "Last Name": "Decker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruoyu", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naomi", "Last Name": "Klickstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuanlong", "Last Name": "Shuai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristina", "Last Name": "Jankovic", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lucy", "Last Name": "Parker-Burns", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yinuo", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jia Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steve", "Last Name": "Niu", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Chou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan A", "Last Name": "Landau", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elham", "Last Name": "Azizi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edmond M", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Ciccia", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jellert T", "Last Name": "Gaublomme", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Dec26"}, {"PMID": "38070650", "Title": "Milk-induced anaphylaxis among children presenting to Canadian emergency departments.", "Abstract": "Cow's milk is one of the most common and burdensome allergens in pediatrics, and it can induce severe anaphylactic reactions in children.

Respondents recommend introduction of peanut (89.5%) and allergenic solids (91.2%) within the recommended age of 4-6 months for infants at high risk of food allergy, but only 26.2% recommend offering peanut three times per week once it has been introduced. In identifying what constitutes an infant at high risk of developing peanut allergy, dietitians expressed lower comfort levels and lower number of correct responses.Conclusions: Dietitians demonstrated they are up to date regarding the timing of introduction of allergenic solids, but not the frequency of consumption once introduced, for infants at high risk of food allergy.

Whilst Lymphotoxin \u03b11\u03b22 (LT\u03b11\u03b22) stimulated the expected slow, delayed, sustained activation of serine 866/870 p100 phosphorylation and increased cellular expression of p52 NF\u03baB, we found that canonical agonists, Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and also Tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) generated a rapid transient increase in pp100, which was maximal by 15-30\u00a0min. This rapid phosphorylation was also observed in other cells types, such as DU145 and HCAECs suggesting the phenomenon is universal. IKK\u03b1 deletion using CRISPR/Cas9 revealed an IKK\u03b1-dependent mechanism for serine 866/870 and additionally serine 872 p100 phosphorylation for both IL-1\u03b2 and LT\u03b11\u03b22. In contrast, knockdown of IKK\u03b2 using siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of IKK\u03b2 activity was without effect on p100 phosphorylation. Pre-incubation of cells with the NF\u03baB inducing-kinase (NIK) inhibitor, CW15337, had no effect on IL-1\u03b2 induced phosphorylation of p100 however, the response to LT\u03b11\u03b22 was virtually abolished. Surprisingly IL-1\u03b2 also stimulated p52 nuclear translocation as early as 60\u00a0min, this response and the concomitant p65 translocation was partially reduced by IKK\u03b1 deletion. Furthermore, p52 nuclear translocation was unaffected by CW15337. In contrast, the response to LT\u03b11\u03b22 was essentially abolished by both IKK\u03b1 deletion and CW15337. Taken together, these finding reveal novel forms of NF\u03baB non-canonical signalling stimulated by ligands that activate the canonical NF\u03baB pathway strongly such as IL-1\u03b2.", "Keywords": ["IKK\u03b1", "Interleukin-1\u03b2", "Lymphotoxin", "Non-canonical", "Nuclear factor kappa B"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cell Line, Tumor", "I-kappa B Kinase", "Interleukin-1beta", "NF-kappa B", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "McIntosh", "Affiliation": "Strathclyde Institute for Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, 161 Cathedral Street, Glasgow, G4 0RE Scotland, UK.

This algorithm was developed because of a significant clinical need, given the number of new-to-OIT providers that include practicing allergists, trainees transitioning into practice, and allied health care providers who manage GI symptoms in OIT patients. We developed the algorithm based on the opinions of community and academic allergy clinics across Canada with significant clinical experience offering infant, preschool, and school-aged OIT patients, with gastroenterologist input.

As mitochondria form hubs of cellular metabolic activity, it is reasonable to propose that pathways within these organelles can form targets that can be manipulated to compromise the ability of cancer cells to cause disease. However, mitochondria are highly multi-functional, and the full range of mechanistic inter-connections are still being unravelled to enable the full potential of targeting mitochondria in cancer therapeutics. Here, we aim to highlight the potential of modulating mitochondrial dynamics to target key metabolic or apoptotic pathways in cancer cells. Distinct roles have been demonstrated for mitochondrial fission and fusion in different cancer contexts. Targeting of factors mediating mitochondrial dynamics may be directly related to impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential to sustain cancer cell growth and can also alter sensitivity to chemotherapeutic compounds. This area is still lacking a unified model, although further investigation will more comprehensively map the underlying molecular mechanisms to enable better rational therapeutic strategies based on these pathways.", "Keywords": ["cancer cell metabolism", "mitochondria", "mitochondrial dynamics", "oxidative phosphorylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Mitochondria", "Neoplasms", "Cell Proliferation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kaylee B", "Last Name": "Punter", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Medical Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Medical Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Edmond Y W", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Medical Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada."}], "Journal": "Endocrine-related cancer", "PubDate": "2023Jan01"}, {"PMID": "36162798", "Title": "Impact of Reaction Setting on the Management, Severity, and Outcome of Pediatric Food-Induced Anaphylaxis: A Cross-Sectional Study.", "Abstract": "Prompt epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) use is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis.

When cow's milk protein formula has been introduced in an infant's diet, make sure that regular ingestion (as little as 10\u00a0mL daily) is maintained to prevent loss of tolerance. For high-risk infants, there is compelling evidence that introducing allergenic foods early-at around 6\u00a0months, but not before 4\u00a0months of age-can prevent common food allergies, and allergies to peanut and egg in particular. Once an allergenic food has been introduced, regular ingestion (e.g., a few times a week) is important to maintain tolerance. Common allergenic foods can be introduced without pausing for days between new foods, and the risk for a severe reaction at first exposure in infancy is extremely low.

Recent studies have suggested that home-based peanut OIT could be a safe and effective option for low-risk peanut-allergic children. In the period between September 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021, nine preschoolers with a history of mild allergic reactions to peanut underwent home-based peanut OIT. Eight of them (88.9%) completed the build-up phase at home in 11-28 weeks, tolerating a daily maintenance dose of 320 mg peanut protein. During the build-up, six patients (75.0%) reported urticaria, three (33.3%) reported gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and one (14.3%) reported oral pruritis. None of the patients developed anaphylaxis, required epinephrine, or attended emergency services related to OIT. One or two virtual follow-up visits were completed per patient during the build-up phase.

In this way, tests are used for diagnosis, monitoring, screening, and prognosis. There are 2 schools of thought for using tests: Frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The Frequentist approach defines probability in terms of the frequency of an event if it were to be repeated numerous times and uses parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values to make a diagnosis. In contrast, the Bayesian approach defines probability as the degree of belief or disbelief regarding the diagnosis and asserts that only data are real and that test parameters are to be inferred from the data. There are strengths and limitations to each approach; however, the Bayesian approach provides an algorithm leading to a disease probability. To use the Bayesian approach, test results need to be expressed as a likelihood ratio. This helps to determine how much the result of a test changes the probability of a particular diagnosis. Once a probability of disease is determined, decision thresholds need to be defined so that a treatment decision can be made.

Parents reported allergic reactions to emerging food allergens experienced by their child (<\u200918\u00a0years) which occurred in the past 12\u00a0months, and allergists categorized/confirmed them according to likelihood of IgE-mediated food allergy.

Median allergist ranking for legumes was 'probable' IgE-mediated food allergy, 'possible' for seeds and fruits/vegetables, and 'unlikely' for other. Median reaction severity was mild for legumes, and moderate for seeds, fruits/vegetables, and other. Our study highlights that non-priority food allergens, namely legumes and seeds, can lead to probable/likely allergic reactions in Canadian children.

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.", "Keywords": ["Autophagosome", "LC3", "cancer", "flux", "lysosome", "macroautophagy", "neurodegeneration", "phagophore", "stress", "vacuole"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autophagosomes", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Biological Assay", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Lysosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Klionsky", "Affiliation": "Life Sciences Institute and Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amal Kamal", "Last Name": "Abdel-Aziz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt;

Infants are a unique subgroup, which presents specific challenges because infants are unable to verbalize symptoms, although the magnitude of underrecognition is not well studied. Data show that strict avoidance of allergens is difficult to achieve in the infant age group and a source of stress and anxiety for their caregivers. Recent studies suggest that infant anaphylaxis is less severe than in older children, which could greatly assist with implementation of food allergy prevention and treatment. New evidence from clinical trials and observational and real-world studies show that infant anaphylaxis is rare on first ingestion of a new food and typically not severe when it occurs, which parents may not be aware of when preparing to introduce peanut or other common food allergens to infants for the purpose of prevention. The better safety and efficacy of oral immunotherapy in infants and preschoolers could help prevent undesired psychosocial consequences of longstanding food allergy such as anxiety, bullying, and poor quality of life.

As humans age, their HSCs acquire mutations that allow some HSCs to disproportionately contribute to normal blood production. This process, known as age-related clonal hematopoiesis, predisposes certain individuals to cancer, cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that factors outside cells, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs), contribute to the disruption of stem cell homeostasis during aging. We have characterized blood EVs from humans and determined that they are remarkably consistent with respect to size, concentration, and total protein content, across healthy subjects aged 20-85\u00a0years. When analyzing EV protein composition from mass spectroscopy data, our machine-learning-based algorithms are able to distinguish EV proteins based on age and suggest that different cell types dominantly produce EVs released into the blood, which change over time. Importantly, our data show blood EVs from middle and older age groups (>40\u00a0years) significantly stimulate HSCs in contrast to untreated and EVs sourced from young subjects. Our study establishes for the first time that although EV particle size, concentration, and total protein content remain relatively consistent over an adult lifespan in humans, EV content evolves during aging and potentially influences HSC regulation.", "Keywords": ["aging", "clonal hematopoiesis", "exosomes", "extracellular vesicles", "hematopoiesis", "hematopoietic stem cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Extracellular Vesicles", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Grenier-Pleau", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kathrin", "Last Name": "Tyryshkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Tri Dung", "Last Name": "Le", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Rudan", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Kingston Health Sciences Centre, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Bonneil", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Research Unit, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Pierre", "Last Name": "Thibault", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Research Unit, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Cecilia", "Last Name": "L\u00e4sser", "Affiliation": "Krefting Research Centre, Institute of Medicine at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Mallinson", "Affiliation": "Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dimitrios", "Last Name": "Lamprou", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Queen's University, Belfast, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jialui", "Last Name": "Hui", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Lynne-Marie", "Last Name": "Postovit", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Edmond Y W", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sheela A", "Last Name": "Abraham", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}], "Journal": "Aging cell", "PubDate": "2020Nov"}, {"PMID": "32999459", "Title": "Repeat expansions confer WRN dependence in microsatellite-unstable cancers.", "Abstract": "The RecQ DNA helicase WRN is a synthetic lethal target for cancer cells with microsatellite instability (MSI), a form of genetic hypermutability that arises from impaired mismatch repair1-4. Depletion of WRN induces widespread DNA double-strand breaks in MSI cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which WRN protects MSI-associated cancers from double-strand breaks remains unclear. Here we show that TA-dinucleotide repeats are highly unstable in MSI cells and undergo large-scale expansions, distinct from previously described insertion or deletion mutations of a few nucleotides5. Expanded TA repeats form non-B DNA secondary structures that stall replication forks, activate the ATR checkpoint kinase, and require unwinding by the WRN helicase. In the absence of WRN, the expanded TA-dinucleotide repeats are susceptible to cleavage by the MUS81 nuclease, leading to massive chromosome shattering. These findings identify a distinct biomarker that underlies the synthetic lethal dependence on WRN, and support the development of therapeutic agents that target WRN for MSI-associated cancers.",

The seemingly abrupt worldwide spread of this disease resulted in immediate changes and a reduction in many allergy-focussed services and procedures. The reality of the long-term circulation of this virus in our communities requires us to evolve as a specialty. In this article, we outline current and future challenges in the management of food allergy in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We focus on infant food allergy prevention, management of anaphylaxis, accurate diagnosis with oral food challenges, and active management of food allergy with oral immunotherapy. This article identifies the challenges of conflicting guidelines, shortcomings of acute management approaches, and inherent system deficiencies. We offer perspectives and strategies that can be implemented now, including an evaluation of virtual care and telemedicine for the management of food allergy. The use of a shared decision-making model results in novel approaches that can benefit our patients and our specialty for years to come.

As part of physical distancing measures, the CDC is recommending that schools who traditionally have had students eat in a cafeteria or common large space instead have children eat their lunch or other meals in the classroom at already physically distanced desks. This has sparked concern for the safety of food-allergic children attending school, and some question of how the new CDC recommendations can coexist with recommendations in the 2013 CDC Voluntary Guidelines on Managing Food Allergy in Schools as well as accommodations that students may be afforded through disability law that may have previously prohibited eating in the classroom. This expert consensus explores the issues related to evidence-based management of food allergy at school, the issues of managing the health of children attending school that are acutely posed by the constraints of an infectious pandemic, and how to harmonize these needs so that all children can attend school with minimal risk from both an infectious and allergic standpoint.", "Keywords": ["Allergen bans", "Americans with Disabilities Act", "Anaphylaxis", "CDC", "COVID-19", "Epinephrine", "Food allergy", "Hand washing", "Rehabilitation Act of 1973", "SARS-CoV-2", "Schools", "Social distancing", "Stock epinephrine"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adrenergic alpha-Agonists", "Anaphylaxis", "Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.", "Child", "Coronavirus Infections", "Educational Personnel", "Epinephrine", "Food Hypersensitivity", "Humans", "Inservice Training", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "SARS-CoV-2", "School Health Services", "Schools", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Greenhawt", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Section of Allergy/Immunology, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo.

In the ensuing months, there has been rapid spread of the infection. In March 2020, in response to the virus, state/provincial and local governments instituted shelter-in-place orders, and nonessential ambulatory care was significantly curtailed, including allergy/immunology services. With rates of new infections and fatalities potentially reaching a plateau and/or declining, restrictions on provision of routine ambulatory care are lifting, and there is a need to help guide the allergy/immunology clinician on how to reinitiate services. Given the fact that coronavirus disease 2019 will circulate within our communities for months or longer, we present a flexible, algorithmic best-practices planning approach on how to prioritize services, in 4 stratified phases of reopening according to community risk level, as well as highlight key considerations for how to safely do so. The decisions on what services to offer and how fast to proceed are left to the discretion of the individual clinician and practice, operating in accordance with state and local ordinances with respect to the level of nonessential ambulatory care that can be provided. Clear communication with staff and patients before and after all changes should be incorporated into this new paradigm on continual change, given the movement may be forward and even backward through the phases because this is an evolving situation.", "Keywords": ["Allergic rhinitis", "Allergy", "Angioedema", "Asthma", "Atopic dermatitis", "COVID-19", "Food allergy", "Immunotherapy", "Personal protective equipment", "Primary immunodeficiency", "SARS-CoV-2", "Urticaria"], "MeSH terms": ["Allergy and Immunology", "Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Infections", "Delivery of Health Care", "Humans", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2", "Telemedicine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Searing", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo."}, {"First Name": "Cullen M", "Last Name": "Dutmer", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Fleischer", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo."}, {"First Name": "Marcus S", "Last Name": "Shaker", "Affiliation": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Section of Allergy and Immunology, Lebanon, NH; Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, Hanover, NH."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Oppenheimer", "Affiliation": "UMDMJ Rutgers University School of Medicine, Newark, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell H", "Last Name": "Grayson", "Affiliation": "Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University School of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Stukus", "Affiliation": "Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University School of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Hartog", "Affiliation": "Spectrum Health Helen DeVos Children's Hospital, Grand Rapids, Mich."}, {"First Name": "Elena W Y", "Last Name": "Hsieh", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo; Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, Colo."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas L", "Last Name": "Rider", "Affiliation": "The Texas Children's Hospital, Section of Immunology, Allergy, and Retrovirology and the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Timothy K", "Last Name": "Vander Leek", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Allergy and Asthma, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Harold", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Western University, London, ON, Canada; McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Edmond S", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "BC Children's Hospital, Division of Allergy & Immunology, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Doug", "Last Name": "Mack", "Affiliation": "McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada; Halton Pediatric Allergy, Burlington, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Anne K", "Last Name": "Ellis", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Elissa M", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Section of Allergy and Immunology, The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Priya", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "Asthma and Allergy Wellness Center, St Charles, Ill."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Lang", "Affiliation": "Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, The University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tenn."}, {"First Name": "David Bk", "Last Name": "Golden", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Md."}, {"First Name": "Dana", "Last Name": "Wallace", "Affiliation": "Nova Southeastern University College of Allopathic Medicine, Fort Lauderdale, Fla."}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Portnoy", "Affiliation": "Children's Mercy, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, Mo."}, {"First Name": "Giselle", "Last Name": "Mosnaim", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, NorthShore University Health System, Evanston, Ill."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Greenhawt", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo.

A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual.

Here, we aimed to explore whether autophagy inhibition could prevent bacterial infections. We first confirmed widely distinct patterns of autophagy responses in host cells infected with Staphylococcus aureus, as compared with Salmonella Only infection with Staphylococcus produced strong accumulation of lipidated autophagy-related protein LC3B (LC3B-II). Infection with virulent Staphylococcus strains induced formation of p62-positive aggregates, suggestive of accumulated ubiquitinated targets. During Salmonella infection, bacteria remain enclosed by lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2)-positive lysosomes, whereas virulent Staphylococcus apparently exited from enlarged lysosomes and invaded the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, Staphylococcus appeared to escape from the lysosome without generation of membrane-damage signals as detected by galectin-3 recruitment. In contrast, Salmonella infection produced high levels of lysosomal damage, consistent with a downstream antibacterial xenophagy response. Finally, we studied the Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) regulatory complex, including the essential subunit autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13). Infection of cells with either Staphylococcus or Salmonella led to recruitment of ATG13 to sites of cytosolic bacterial cells to promote autophagosome formation. Of note, genetic targeting of ATG13 suppressed autophagy and the ability of Staphylococcus to infect and kill host cells. Two different ULK1 inhibitors also prevented Staphylococcus intracellular replication and host cell death. Interestingly, inhibition of the ULK1 pathway had the opposite effect on Salmonella, sensitizing cells to the infection.

Beclin 1 forms a complex with several other autophagy proteins and functions in the initiation phase of autophagy, but the exact role of Beclin 1 subcellular localization in autophagy initiation is still unclear. In order to elucidate the role of Beclin 1 localization in autophagosome biogenesis, we generated constructs that target Beclin 1 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria. Our results confirmed the proper organelle-specific targeting of the engineered Beclin 1 constructs, and the proper formation of autophagy-regulatory Beclin 1 complexes. The ULK kinases are required for autophagy initiation upstream of Beclin 1, and autophagosome biogenesis is severely impaired in ULK1/ULK2 double knockout cells. We tested whether Beclin 1 targeting facilitated its ability to rescue autophagosome formation in ULK1/ULK2 double knockout cells. ER-targeted Beclin 1 was most effective in the rescue experiments, while mitochondria-targeted and non-targeted Beclin 1 also showed an ability to rescue, but with lower activity.

DNA repair processes represent attractive synthetic lethal targets, because many cancers exhibit an impairment of a DNA repair pathway, which can lead to dependence on specific repair proteins2. The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitors in cancers with deficiencies in homologous recombination highlights the potential of this approach3. Hypothesizing that other DNA repair defects would give rise to synthetic lethal relationships, we queried dependencies in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), which results from deficient DNA mismatch repair. Here we analysed data from large-scale silencing screens using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout and RNA interference, and found that the RecQ DNA helicase WRN was selectively essential in MSI models in vitro and in vivo, yet dispensable in models of cancers that are microsatellite stable. Depletion of WRN induced double-stranded DNA breaks and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest selectively in MSI models. MSI cancer models required the helicase activity of WRN, but not its exonuclease activity. These findings show that WRN is a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target for MSI cancers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Apoptosis", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "Humans", "Microsatellite Instability", "Microsatellite Repeats", "Models, Genetic", "Neoplasms", "RNA Interference", "Synthetic Lethal Mutations", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Werner Syndrome Helicase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edmond M", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tsukasa", "Last Name": "Shibue", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "McFarland", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Gaeta", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mahmoud", "Last Name": "Ghandi", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nancy", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alfredo", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justine S", "Last Name": "McPartlan", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tianxia", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanxi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Bin Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Bernard", "Last Name": "Lazaro", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peili", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cortt G", "Last Name": "Piett", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.

Peanut-allergic individuals can be both cosensitized and coallergic to such items, requiring foresight when eliciting a clinical history of a reaction, in the diagnostic evaluation of such allergies, and in the counseling of patients as to food avoidances after a diagnosis is made. Legume allergens belong to the Fabaceae family and encompass the cupin, prolamin, PR-10, and lipid transfer protein families, which mediate cross-sensitization including that between peanut and tree nut. Among legumes, the most common patterns of clinical cross-reactivity are between peanut and lupine, peanut and soy, as well as chickpea and lentil, though this is highly dependent on geography and prevalence of these foods in the diet. Issues of cross-sensitization may exist between peanut and certain tree nuts, as well as among tree nuts though such patterns do not always result in clinically relevant allergy. Molecular diagnostic testing may be a future tool to help parse out the aforementioned patterns, but oral food challenges are still the gold standard for accurate diagnosis.

Amino acid deficiency suppresses mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1), while glucose deficiency promotes AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The MTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways converge onto the ULK1/2 autophagy initiation complex. Here, we show that amino acid starvation promoted formation of ULK1- and sequestosome 1/p62-positive early autophagosomes. Autophagosome initiation was controlled by MTORC1 sensing glutamine, leucine, and arginine levels together. In contrast, glucose starvation promoted AMPK activity, phosphorylation of ULK1 Ser555, and LC3-II accumulation, but with dynamics consistent with a block in autophagy flux. We studied the flux pathway and found that starvation of amino acid but not of glucose activated lysosomal acidification, which occurred independently of autophagy and ULK1. In addition to lack of activation, glucose starvation inhibited the ability of amino acid starvation to activate both autophagosome formation and the lysosome. Activation of AMPK and phosphorylation of ULK1 were determined to specifically inhibit autophagosome formation. AMPK activation also was sufficient to prevent lysosome acidification.

Clinical trials are in progress testing chloroquine (CQ) or its derivatives in combination with chemo- or radiotherapy for solid and haematological cancers. Although CQ has shown efficacy in preclinical models, its mechanism of action remains equivocal. Here, we tested how effectively CQ sensitises metastatic breast cancer cells to further stress conditions such as ionising irradiation, doxorubicin, PI3K-Akt inhibition and serum withdrawal. Contrary to the conventional model, the cytotoxic effects of CQ were found to be autophagy-independent, as genetic targeting of ATG7 or the ULK1/2 complex could not sensitise cells, like CQ, to serum depletion. Interestingly, although CQ combined with serum starvation was robustly cytotoxic, further glucose starvation under these conditions led to a full rescue of cell viability. Inhibition of hexokinase using 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) similarly led to CQ resistance. As this form of cell death did not resemble classical caspase-dependent apoptosis, we hypothesised that CQ-mediated cytotoxicity was primarily via a lysosome-dependent mechanism. Indeed, CQ treatment led to marked lysosomal swelling and recruitment of Galectin3 to sites of membrane damage. Strikingly, glucose starvation or 2DG prevented CQ from inducing lysosomal damage and subsequent cell death. Importantly, we found that the related compound, amodiaquine, was more potent than CQ for cell killing and not susceptible to interference from glucose starvation. Taken together, our data indicate that CQ effectively targets the lysosome to sensitise towards cell death but is prone to a glucose-dependent resistance mechanism, thus providing rationale for the related compound amodiaquine (currently used in humans) as a better therapeutic option for cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Autophagy", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Chloroquine", "Glucose", "Humans",

This fundamental and conserved mechanism is based on a membrane trafficking pathway in which nascent autophagosomes engulf cytoplasmic cargo to form vesicles that transport their content to the lysosome for degradation. Based on this simple scheme, autophagy modulates cellular metabolism and cytoplasmic quality control to influence an unexpectedly wide range of normal mammalian physiology and pathophysiology. In this review, we summarise recent advancements in three broad areas of autophagy regulation. We discuss current models on how autophagosomes are initiated from endogenous membranes. We detail how the uncoordinated 51-like kinase (ULK) complex becomes activated downstream of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1). Finally, we summarise the upstream signalling mechanisms that can sense amino acid availability leading to activation of MTORC1.", "Keywords": ["ATG14L", "Beclin 1", "MTOR", "ULK", "VPS34", "amino acids", "autophagosome", "autophagy", "isolation membrane"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura E", "Last Name": "Gallagher", "Affiliation": "Strathclyde Institute for Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland G4 0RE, UK.

Investigation of strategies aiming to inhibit alternative survival pathways in CML is therefore critical. We have previously shown that a nonspecific pharmacological inhibition of autophagy potentiates TKI-induced death in Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells. Here we provide further understanding of how specific and pharmacological autophagy inhibition affects nonmitochondrial and mitochondrial energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated differentiation of CML cells and highlight ATG7 (a critical component of the LC3 conjugation system) as a potential specific therapeutic target. By combining extra- and intracellular steady state metabolite measurements by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with metabolic flux assays using labeled glucose and functional assays, we demonstrate that knockdown of ATG7 results in decreased glycolysis and increased flux of labeled carbons through the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle. This leads to increased oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Furthermore, following ROS accumulation, CML cells, including primary CML CD34(+) progenitor cells, differentiate toward the erythroid lineage. Finally, ATG7 knockdown sensitizes CML progenitor cells to TKI-induced death, without affecting survival of normal cells, suggesting that specific inhibitors of ATG7 in combination with TKI would provide a novel therapeutic approach for CML patients exhibiting persistent disease.", "Keywords": ["ATG7", "autophagy", "chronic myeloid leukemia", "energy metabolism", "erythroid differentiation",

We also demonstrate that there is no association between the composition of the gut microbiota in older children and the diagnosis of asthma, further suggesting the importance of the gut microbiota-immune system axis in the first 3\u00a0months of life.", "Keywords": ["asthma", "germ-free mice", "gut microbiota", "infants", "lung"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bacteria", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Germ-Free Life", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Ovalbumin", "Pneumonia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marie-Claire", "Last Name": "Arrieta", "Affiliation": "a Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Manish", "Last Name": "Sadarangani", "Affiliation": "c Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Eric M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "a Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Shannon L", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "a Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Nimmo", "Affiliation": "f Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Dean", "Affiliation": "g Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Stuart E", "Last Name": "Turvey", "Affiliation": "g Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "Edmond S", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "g Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}, {"First Name": "B Brett", "Last Name": "Finlay", "Affiliation": "a Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia , Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada."}], "Journal": "Gut microbes", "PubDate": "2016Jul03"}, {"PMID": "27004676", "Title": "Adrenal insufficiency exists for both swallowed budesonide and fluticasone propionate in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adrenal Insufficiency", "Androstadienes", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Budesonide", "Deglutition", "Eosinophilic Esophagitis", "Fluticasone", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shira", "Last Name": "Harel", "Affiliation": "Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Brenden E", "Last Name": "Hursh", "Affiliation": "Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Edmond S", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Vishal", "Last Name": "Avinashi", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Constadina", "Last Name": "Panagiotopoulos", "Affiliation": "Endocrinology and Diabetes Unit, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "Journal": "The Journal of pediatrics", "PubDate": "2016Jul"}, {"PMID": "26968960", "Title": "The Complexities of Early Peanut Introduction for the Practicing Allergist.", "Abstract": "Recommendations for the timing of introducing major food allergens, such as peanut, into the diet of at-risk infants have undergone major changes in the past decade. The most substantial modification has been a shift toward advice that delaying beyond 4 to 6 months does not prevent and might actually increase the risk of food allergy. The Learning Early About Peanut (LEAP) study published last year provided strong evidence that early peanut introduction with regular ingestion has a potentially dramatic benefit. Although there is little current doubt of the effectiveness of early peanut introduction, many unanswered questions remain. Previous guidelines defined infants at risk as those with a first-degree relative with allergic disease, whereas the LEAP study defined high risk as severe eczema or egg allergy. The LEAP study chose to screen infants but did not have a comparison group randomized without screening. In the following case-based discussion, we explore the complexities of LEAP implementation for the practicing allergist. These include nonuniformity in the literature for defining at-risk infants, difficulties in assessing eczema severity objectively, variable adherence to current guidelines, proposed peanut screening methods contrasting with existing food allergy guidelines to not routinely screen before ingestion, unclear interpretation of positive test results if screened, risks of screening extending to foods not studied in the LEAP study, and uncertainties about the optimal dose and duration of peanut once introduced.", "Keywords": ["Complementary feeding", "Early introduction", "Eczema", "Peanut allergy", "Prevention"], "MeSH terms": ["Allergens", "Allergists", "Antigens, Plant", "Arachis", "Diet Therapy", "Eczema", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin E", "Infant", "Peanut Hypersensitivity", "Risk"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Greenhawt", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo; Allergy Section, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colo."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Fleischer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo; Allergy Section, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colo."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Atkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colo; Allergy Section, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colo."}, {"First Name": "Edmond S", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

We have previously shown that treatment of androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells with a non-selective SK isoform inhibitor, 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SKi), induces the proteasomal degradation of SK1. This is concomitant with a significant increase in C22:0-ceramide and sphingosine levels and a reduction in S1P levels, resulting in the apoptosis of LNCaP cells. In contrast, we show here that a SK2-selective inhibitor, (R)-FTY720 methyl ether (ROME), increases sphingosine and decreases S1P levels but has no effect on ceramide levels and does not induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells. We also show that several glycolytic metabolites and (R)-S-lactoylglutathione are increased upon treatment of LNCaP cells with SKi, which induces the proteasomal degradation of c-Myc. These changes reflect an indirect antagonism of the Warburg effect. LNCaP cells also respond to SKi by diverting glucose 6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway to provide NADPH, which serves as an antioxidant to counter an oxidative stress response. SKi also promotes the formation of a novel pro-apoptotic molecule called diadenosine 5',5'''-P(1),P(3)-triphosphate (Ap3A), which binds to the tumor suppressor fragile histidine triad protein (FHIT). In contrast, the SK2-selective inhibitor, ROME, induces a reduction in some glycolytic metabolites and does not affect oxidative stress.

Autophagy has multiple beneficial roles for maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and these roles are related to the implications of autophagy in disease mechanisms including neurodegeneration and cancer. We previously searched for novel autophagy regulators and identified Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1) as a candidate. Here, we show that activated ROCK1 inhibits autophagy in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Conversely, ROCK inhibitory compounds enhanced the autophagy response to amino acid starvation or rapamycin treatment. Inhibition of ROCK during the starvation period led to a more rapid response with the production of larger early autophagosomes that matured into enlarged late degradative autolysosomes. Despite the production of enlarged LC3-positive early autophagosomes, membrane precursors containing WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides 1 (WIPI1) and mammalian Atg9 were not affected by ROCK inhibition, suggesting that phagophore elongation had been unusually extended. However, the enlarged autophagosomes were enriched in ULK1 which was essential to allow progression of autophagy flux. Our results demonstrate a novel role for ROCK in the control of autophagosome size and degradative capacity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Carrier Proteins", "Cell Line", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Lysosomes", "Membrane Proteins", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Rats", "Signal Transduction", "Sirolimus", "Vesicular Transport Proteins", "rho-Associated Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrzej", "Last Name": "Mleczak", "Affiliation": "Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, G61 1BD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Millar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sharon A", "Last Name": "Tooze", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edmond Y W", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cellular signalling", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
