[{"PMID": "38755281", "Title": "Optical genome mapping unveils hidden structural variants in neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Abstract": "While short-read sequencing currently dominates genetic research and diagnostics, it frequently falls short of capturing certain structural variants (SVs), which are often implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Optical genome mapping (OGM) is an innovative technique capable of capturing SVs that are undetectable or challenging-to-detect via short-read methods. This study aimed to investigate NDDs using OGM, specifically focusing on cases that remained unsolved after standard exome sequencing. OGM was performed in 47 families using ultra-high molecular weight DNA. Single-molecule maps were assembled de novo, followed by SV and copy number variant calling. We identified 7 variants of interest, of which 5 (10.6%) were classified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic, located in BCL11A, OPHN1, PHF8, SON, and NFIA. We also identified an inversion disrupting NAALADL2, a gene which previously was found to harbor complex rearrangements in two NDD cases. Variants in known NDD genes or candidate variants of interest missed by exome sequencing mainly consisted of larger insertions (>\u20091kbp), inversions, and deletions/duplications of a low number of exons (1-4 exons). In conclusion, in addition to improving molecular diagnosis in NDDs, this technique may also reveal novel NDD genes which may harbor complex SVs often missed by standard sequencing techniques.", "Keywords": ["Copy number variants", "Neurodevelopmental disorders", "Optical genome mapping", "Structural variants", "Unsolved cases"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Female", "Male", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Chromosome Mapping", "Exome Sequencing", "Child", "Genomic Structural Variation", "Child, Preschool"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Statistical Genetics, Gertrude H.

Notable clinical features include upper motoneuron dysfunction, dysarthria and asymmetric quadriparesis. Cognitive impairment and epilepsy are frequently observed. To identify genetic variants underlying bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria in Finland, we examined 21 families using standard exome sequencing, complemented by optical genome mapping and/or deep exome sequencing. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 5/21 (24%) of families, of which all were confirmed as de novo.

The underlying gene has been identified for many of the ~100 syndromes that include polydactyly. While for the more common form, nonsydromic polydactyly, eleven candidate genes have been reported. We investigated the underlying genetic cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic postaxial polydactyly in four consanguineous Pakistani families. Some family members with postaxial polydactyly also present with syndactyly, camptodactyly, or clinodactyly. Analysis of the exome sequence data revealed two novel homozygous frameshift deletions in EFCAB7: [c.830delG;p.(Gly277Valfs*5)]; in three families and [c.1350_1351delGA;p.(Asn451Phefs*2)] in one family. Sanger sequencing confirmed that these variants segregated with postaxial polydactyly, i.e., family members with postaxial polydactyly were found to be homozygous while unaffected members were heterozygous or wild type. EFCAB7 displays expressions in the skeletal muscle and on the cellular level in cilia. IQCE-EFCAB7 and EVC-EVC2 are part of the heterotetramer EvC complex, which is a positive regulator of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, that plays a key role in limb formation. Depletion of either EFCAB7 or IQCE inhibits induction of Gli1, a direct Hh target gene. Variants in IQCE and GLI1 have been shown to cause nonsyndromic postaxial polydactyly, while variants in EVC and EVC2 underlie Ellis van Creveld and Weyers syndromes, which include postaxial polydactyly as a phenotype.

Results: We found several genome-wide significant variants in and around the JAZF1 gene that are associated with asthma, T2D, or height with two of these variants shared by the three phenotypes. We also observed an association in this region with WC when adjusted for BMI. However, there was no association with WC when it was not adjusted for BMI or weight.

Several studies showed that common variants increase ARHL susceptibility. Here, we demonstrate that rare-variants play a crucial role in ARHL etiology. We analyzed exome and imputed data from white-European UK Biobank volunteers, performing both single-variant and rare-variant aggregate association analyses using self-reported ARHL phenotypes. We identified and replicated associations between ARHL and rare-variants in KLHDC7B, PDCD6, MYO6, SYNJ2, and TECTA. PUS7L and EYA4 also revealed rare-variant associations with ARHL. EYA4, MYO6, and TECTA are all known to underline Mendelian nonsyndromic HL. PDCD6, a new HL gene, plays an important role in apoptosis and has widespread inner ear expression, particularly in the inner hair cells. An unreplicated common variant association was previously observed for KHLDC7B, here we demonstrate that rare-variants in this gene also play a role in ARHL etiology. Additionally, the first replicated association between SYNJ2 and ARHL was detected. Analysis of common variants revealed several previously reported, i.e., ARHGEF28, and new, i.e., PIK3R3, ARHL associations, as well as ones we replicate here for the first time, i.e., BAIAP2L2, CRIP3, KLHDC7B, MAST2, and SLC22A7. It was also observed that the odds ratios for rare-variant ARHL associations, were higher than those for common variants. In conclusion, we demonstrate the vital role rare-variants, including those in Mendelian nonsyndromic HL genes, play in the etiology of ARHL.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Humans", "Presbycusis", "Trans-Activators", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Diana M", "Last Name": "Cornejo-Sanchez", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Gertrude H.

These traits have been extensively studied in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), with hundreds of genome-wide significant loci identified. We performed a whole-exome sequence analysis of the genetics of height, body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR). We meta-analyzed single-variant and gene-based associations of whole-exome sequence variation with height, BMI, and WHR in up to 22,004 individuals, and we assessed replication of our findings in up to 16,418 individuals from 10 independent cohorts from Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed). We identified four trait associations with single-nucleotide variants (SNVs; two for height and two for BMI) and replicated the LECT2 gene association with height. Our expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis within previously reported GWAS loci implicated CEP63 and RFT1 as potential functional genes for known height loci. We further assessed enrichment of SNVs, which were monogenic or syndromic variants within loci associated with our three traits. This led to the significant enrichment results for height, whereas we observed no Bonferroni-corrected significance for all SNVs. With a sample size of \u223c20,000 whole-exome sequences in our discovery dataset, our findings demonstrate the importance of genomic sequencing in genetic association studies, yet they also

We ascertained 56 small families mainly of Yoruba ethno-lingual ancestry in or near Ibadan, Nigeria, that had at least one individual with nonsyndromic, severe-to-profound, prelingual-onset, bilateral hearing loss not attributed to nongenetic factors. We performed a combination of exome and Sanger sequencing analyses to evaluate both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. No biallelic pathogenic variants were identified in GJB2, a common cause of deafness in many populations. Potential causative variants were identified in genes associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (CIB2, COL11A1, ILDR1, MYO15A, TMPRSS3, and WFS1), nonsyndromic hearing loss or Usher syndrome (CDH23, MYO7A, PCDH15, and USH2A), and other syndromic forms of hearing loss (CHD7, OPA1, and SPTLC1). Several rare mitochondrial variants, including m.1555A>G, were detected in the gene MT-RNR1 but not in control Yoruba samples. Overall, 20 (33%) of 60 independent cases of hearing loss in this cohort of families were associated with likely causal variants in genes reported to underlie deafness in other populations. None of these likely causal variants were present in more than one family, most were detected as compound heterozygotes, and 77% had not been previously associated with hearing loss.

DNA samples from a South African family presenting with progressive, autosomal dominant non-syndromic HI were subjected to whole-exome sequencing, and a novel monoallelic variant in REST [c.1244GC; p.(C415S)], was identified as the putative causative variant. The co-segregation of the variant was confirmed with Sanger Sequencing. The variant is absent from databases, 103 healthy South African controls, and 52 South African probands with isolated HI. In silico analysis indicates that the p.C415S variant in REST substitutes a conserved cysteine and results in changes to the surrounding secondary structure and the disulphide bonds, culminating in alteration of the tertiary structure of REST. Localization studies using ectopically expressed GFP-tagged Wild type (WT) and mutant REST in HEK-293 cells show that WT REST localizes exclusively to the nucleus; however, the mutant protein localizes throughout the cell. Additionally, mutant REST has an impaired ability to repress its known target AF1q.

OGDHL expression is restricted mainly to the brain in humans. Here, we report nine individuals from eight unrelated families carrying bi-allelic variants in OGDHL with a range of neurological and neurodevelopmental phenotypes including epilepsy, hearing loss, visual impairment, gait ataxia, microcephaly, and hypoplastic corpus callosum. The variants include three homozygous missense variants (p.Pro852Ala, p.Arg244Trp, and p.Arg299Gly), three compound heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (p.Arg673Gln/p.Val488Val, p.Phe734Ser/p.Ala327Val, and p.Trp220Cys/p.Asp491Val), one homozygous frameshift variant (p.Cys553Leufs\u221716), and one homozygous stop-gain variant (p.Arg440Ter). To support the pathogenicity of the variants, we developed a novel CRISPR-Cas9-mediated tissue-specific knockout with cDNA rescue system for dOgdh, the Drosophila ortholog of human OGDHL. Pan-neuronal knockout of dOgdh led to developmental lethality as well as defects in Krebs cycle metabolism, which was fully rescued by expression of wild-type dOgdh. Studies using the Drosophila system indicate that p.Arg673Gln, p.Phe734Ser, and p.Arg299Gly are severe loss-of-function alleles, leading to developmental lethality, whereas p.Pro852Ala, p.Ala327Val, p.Trp220Cys, p.Asp491Val, and p.Arg244Trp are hypomorphic alleles, causing behavioral defects. Transcript analysis from fibroblasts obtained from the individual carrying the synonymous variant (c.1464T>C [p.Val488Val]) in family 2 showed that the synonymous variant affects splicing of exon 11 in OGDHL. Human neuronal cells with OGDHL knockout exhibited defects in mitochondrial respiration, indicating the essential role of OGDHL in mitochondrial metabolism in humans.

susceptibility to otitis media.", "Abstract": "Otitis media (OM) is common in young children and can cause hearing loss and speech, language, and developmental delays. OM has high heritability; however, little is known about OM-related molecular and genetic processes. CDHR3 was previously identified as a locus for OM susceptibility, but to date, studies have focused on how the CDHR3 p.Cys529Tyr variant increases epithelial binding of rhinovirus-C and risk for lung or sinus pathology. In order to further delineate a role for CDHR3 in OM, we performed the following: exome sequencing using DNA samples from OM-affected individuals from 257 multi-ethnic families; Sanger sequencing, logistic regression and transmission disequilibrium tests for 407 US trios or probands with OM; 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis for middle ear and nasopharyngeal samples; and single-cell RNA sequencing and differential expression analyses for mouse middle ear. From exome sequence data, we identified a novel pathogenic CDHR3 splice variant that co-segregates with OM in US and Finnish families. Additionally, a frameshift and six missense rare or low-frequency variants were identified in Finnish probands. In US probands, the CDHR3 p.Cys529Tyr variant was associated with the absence of middle ear fluid at surgery and also with increased relative abundance of Lysobacter in the nasopharynx and Streptomyces in the middle ear. Consistent with published data on airway epithelial cells and our RNA-sequence data from human middle ear tissues, Cdhr3 expression is restricted to ciliated epithelial cells of the middle ear and is downregulated after acute OM. Overall, these findings suggest a critical role for CDHR3 in OM susceptibility. KEY MESSAGES: \u2022 Novel rare or low-frequency CDHR3 variants putatively confer risk for otitis media. \u2022 Pathogenic variant CDHR3 c.1653\u2009+\u20093G\u2009>\u2009A was found in nine families with otitis media. \u2022 CDHR3 p.Cys529Tyr was associated with lack of effusion and bacterial otopathogens. \u2022 Cdhr3 expression was limited to ciliated epithelial cells in mouse middle ear. \u2022 Cdhr3 was downregulated 3\u00a0h after infection of mouse middle ear.", "Keywords": ["CDHR3", "Expression", "Microbiome", "Middle ear", "Otitis media", "rs6967330"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherin Related Proteins", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microbiota", "Mutation", "Otitis Media", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Transcriptome", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Scott D", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christina L", "Last Name": "Elling", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tori C", "Last Name": "Bootpetch", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa A", "Last Name": "Scholes", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lena", "Last Name": "Hafr\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Tukholmankatu 8A, 00290, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Sven-Olrik", "Last Name": "Streubel", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harold S", "Last Name": "Pine", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), 301 8th St, Galveston, TX, 77550, USA."}, {"First Name": "Todd M", "Last Name": "Wine", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wasyl", "Last Name": "Szeremeta", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), 301 8th St, Galveston, TX, 77550, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy D", "Last Name": "Prager", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisabet", "Last Name": "Einarsdottir", "Affiliation": "Folkh\u00e4lsan Institute of Genetics and Molecular Neurology Research Program, University of Helsinki, PO Box 63, Biomedicum 1, 3rd floor, Haartmaninkatu 8, 00014, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Ayesha", "Last Name": "Yousaf", "Affiliation": "Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, 60000, Punjab, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Erin E", "Last Name": "Baschal", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), 12700 E. 19th Ave, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sakina", "Last Name": "Rehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, 670 West Baltimore St., Room 7181, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bamshad", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, William H.

A previous study implicated common variants in FBN1 with TAA disease risk. Here, we report a genome-wide scan of 1,351 TAA-affected individuals and 18,295 control individuals from the Cardiovascular Health Improvement Project and Michigan Genomics Initiative at the University of Michigan. We identified a genome-wide significant association with TAA for variants within the third intron of TCF7L2 following replication with meta-analysis of four additional independent cohorts. Common variants in this locus are the strongest known genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Although evidence indicates the presence of different causal variants for TAA and type 2 diabetes at this locus, we observed an opposite direction of effect. The genetic association for TAA colocalizes with an aortic eQTL of TCF7L2, suggesting a functional relationship. These analyses predict an association of higher expression of TCF7L2 with TAA disease risk.

Investigation of novel HI genes and variants will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and to aid genetic diagnosis. We performed exome sequencing and analysis using DNA samples from affected members of two large families from Ghana and Pakistan, segregating autosomal-dominant (AD) non-syndromic HI (NSHI). Using in silico approaches, we modeled and evaluated the effect of the likely pathogenic variants on protein structure and function. We identified two likely pathogenic variants in SLC12A2, c.2935G>A:p.(E979K) and c.2939A>T:p.(E980V), which segregate with NSHI in a Ghanaian and Pakistani family, respectively. SLC12A2 encodes an ion transporter crucial in the homeostasis of the inner ear endolymph and has recently been reported to be implicated in syndromic and non-syndromic HI. Both variants were mapped to alternatively spliced exon 21 of the SLC12A2 gene. Exon 21 encodes for 17 residues in the cytoplasmatic tail of SLC12A2, is highly conserved between species, and preferentially expressed in cochlear tissues. A review of previous studies and our current data showed that out of ten families with either AD non-syndromic or syndromic HI, eight (80%) had variants within the 17 amino acid residue region of exon 21 (48 bp), suggesting that this alternate domain is critical to the transporter activity in the inner ear. The genotypic spectrum of SLC12A2 was expanded and the involvement of SLC12A2 in ADNSHI was confirmed. These results also demonstrate the role that SLC12A2 plays in ADNSHI in diverse populations including sub-Saharan Africans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Solute Carrier Family 12, Member 2", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel M", "Last Name": "Adadey", "Affiliation": "West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens (WACCBIP), University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Gertrude H.

Immunohistochemistry of the mouse cochlear tissue, further confirmed the expression of ADAMTS1, SEZ6, and MPDZ in the neurosensory hair cells of the organ of Corti, while MVD expression was more prominent in the spiral ganglion cells.

This study aims to analyze the splicing characteristics of dystrophin PEs and compare them with those of dystrophin canonical exons (CEs). Forty-two reported dystrophin PEs were divided into a splice site (ss) group and a splicing regulatory element (SRE) group. Five dystrophin PEs with characteristics of poison exons were identified and categorized as the possible poison exon group. The comparative analysis of each essential splicing signal among different groups of dystrophin PEs and dystrophin CEs revealed that the possible poison exon group had a stronger 3' ss compared to any other group. As for auxiliary SREs, different groups of dystrophin PEs were found to have a smaller density of diverse types of exonic splicing enhancers and a higher density of several types of exonic splicing silencers compared to dystrophin CEs.

RV-QNPL has greater power than the traditional QNPL that tests for excess sharing of minor and major alleles. RV-QNPL is robust to population substructure and admixture, locus heterogeneity, and inclusion of nonpathogenic variants and can be readily applied outside of coding regions. When QNPL was used to analyze common variants, it often led to loci mapping to large intervals, e.g., >40\u2009Mb. In contrast, when RVs are analyzed, regions are well defined, e.g., a gene. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that RV-QNPL is substantially more powerful than applying traditional QNPL methods to analyze RVs. RV-QNPL was also applied to analyze age-at-onset (AAO) data for 107 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pedigrees of Caribbean Hispanic and European ancestry with whole-genome sequence data.

By performing exome sequencing in two families with congenital nonsyndromic profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), we identified autosomal dominantly inherited missense variants [p.(Asn283Ser); p.(Thr116Ile)] in GREB1L, a neural crest regulatory molecule. The p.(Thr116Ile) variant was also associated with bilateral cochlear aplasia and cochlear nerve aplasia upon temporal bone imaging, an ultra-rare phenotype previously seen in patients with de novo GREB1L variants. An important role of GREB1L in normal ear development has also been demonstrated by greb1l-/- zebrafish, which show an abnormal sensory epithelia innervation. Last, we performed a review of all disease-associated variation described in GREB1L, as it has also been implicated in renal, bladder and genital malformations. We show that the spectrum of features associated with GREB1L is broad, variable and with a high level of reduced penetrance, which is typically characteristic of neurocristopathies. So far, seven GREB1L variants (14%) have been associated with ear-related abnormalities. In conclusion, these results show that autosomal dominantly inherited variants in GREB1L cause profound SNHL. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the phenotypic spectrum associated with GREB1L variants and strengthen the evidence of the involvement of GREB1L in human hearing.", "Keywords": ["GREB1L", "autosomal dominant inheritance", "cochlear aplasia", "cochlear nerve aplasia", "exome sequencing", "neural crest", "neurocristopathy", "profound nonsyndromic hearing impairment"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Child, Preschool", "Exome", "Female", "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural", "Humans", "Kidney", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation, Missense", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neural Crest", "Pedigree", "Exome Sequencing", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Khurram", "Last Name": "Liaqat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schatteman", "Affiliation": "Department of ENT, St-Augustinus Hospital Antwerp, 2610 Antwerp, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Thashi", "Last Name": "Bharadwaj", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Nasir", "Affiliation": "Synthetic Protein Engineering Lab (SPEL), Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon 443-749, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Anushree", "Last Name": "Acharya", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Van Camp", "Affiliation": "Center of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp & Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Antwerp, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute for Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes", "PubDate": "2020Jun23"}, {"PMID": "32447804", "Title": "A non-coding RNASEH1 gene variant associates with type 1 diabetes and interacts with HLA tagSNPs in families from Colombia.", "Abstract": "RNASEH1 gene has recently been associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Colombia.

Cytosine methylation (5-methylcytosine [5mC]) of DNA is the quintessential epigenetic mark, yet no human Mendelian disorder of DNA demethylation has yet been delineated. Here, we describe in detail a Mendelian disorder caused by the disruption of DNA demethylation. TET3 is a methylcytosine dioxygenase that initiates DNA demethylation during early zygote formation, embryogenesis, and neuronal differentiation and is intolerant to haploinsufficiency in mice and humans. We identify and characterize 11 cases of human TET3 deficiency in eight families with the common phenotypic features of intellectual disability and/or global developmental delay; hypotonia; autistic traits; movement disorders; growth abnormalities; and facial dysmorphism. Mono-allelic frameshift and nonsense variants in TET3 occur throughout the coding region. Mono-allelic and bi-allelic missense variants localize to conserved residues; all but one such variant occur within the catalytic domain, and most display hypomorphic function in an assay of catalytic activity. TET3 deficiency and other Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery show substantial phenotypic overlap, including features of intellectual disability and abnormal growth, underscoring shared disease mechanisms.", "Keywords": ["5-hydroxymethylcytosine", "5-methylcytosine", "DNA methylation", "TET", "epigenetic", "genetic", "intellectual disability"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "DNA Demethylation", "Developmental Disabilities", "Dioxygenases", "Embryonic Development", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Growth Disorders", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement Disorders", "Pedigree", "Protein Conformation", "Sequence Homology", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Beck", "Affiliation": "National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ana", "Last Name": "Petracovici", "Affiliation": "Graduate Group in Genetics and Epigenetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Epigenetics Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chongsheng", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Epigenetics Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Current address: Hunan Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Developmental Regulation, Hunan University, Changsha 410082 Hunan, P.R.

The RV-NPL differs from the NPL in that RVs are analyzed, and allele sharing among affected relative-pairs is estimated only for minor alleles. Analyzing families can increase power because causal variants with familial aggregation usually have larger effect sizes than those underlying sporadic diseases. Differing from association analysis, for NPL only affected individuals are analyzed, which can increase power, since unaffected family members can be susceptibility variant carriers. RV-NPL is robust to population substructure and admixture, inclusion of nonpathogenic variants, as well as allelic and locus heterogeneity and can readily be applied outside of coding regions. In contrast to analyzing common variants using NPL, where loci localize to large genomic regions (e.g., >50 Mb), mapped regions are well defined for RV-NPL. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that RV-NPL is substantially more powerful than applying traditional NPL methods to analyze RVs. The RV-NPL was applied to analyze 107 late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) pedigrees of Caribbean Hispanic and European ancestry with WGS data, and statistically significant linkage (LOD \u2265 3.8) was found with RVs in PSMF1 and PTPN21 which have been shown to be involved in LOAD etiology. Additionally, nominally significant linkage was observed with RVs in ABCA7, ACE, EPHA1, and SORL1, genes that were previously reported to be associated with LOAD.

For East Asians, Latinos, non-Finish Europeans, and South Asians, ARNSHI prevalence due to PLP variants ranges from 17.1 to 33.7 affected per 100,000 individuals. ARNSHI variants that were previously reported in a single ancestry or family were observed in additional populations, e.g., USH1C p.(Q723*) reported in a Chinese family was the most prevalent pathogenic variant observed in gnomAD for African/African Americans.

Molecular evaluation of polydactyly can serve as a tool to elucidate genetic and signaling pathways that regulate limb development, specifically, the anterior-posterior specification of the limb. To date, only five genes have been identified for nonsyndromic PAP: FAM92A, GLI1, GLI3, IQCE and ZNF141. In this study, two Pakistani multiplex consanguineous families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic PAP were clinically and molecularly evaluated. From both pedigrees, a DNA sample from an affected member underwent exome sequencing. In each family, we identified a segregating frameshift (c.591dupA [p.(Q198Tfs*21)]) and nonsense variant (c.2173A\u2009>\u2009T [p.(K725*)]) in KIAA0825 (also known as C5orf36). Although KIAA0825 encodes a protein of unknown function, it has been demonstrated that its murine ortholog is expressed during limb development.

culturally distinct isolated population with genetically divergent subisolates, residing mainly across Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe. We evaluated the genetic etiology of hearing impairment (HI) in 15 Hungarian Roma families through exome sequencing. A family with autosomal dominant non-syndromic HI segregating a rare variant in the Calponin-homology 2 domain of PLS1, or Plastin 1 [p.(Leu363Phe)] was identified. Young adult Pls1 knockout mice have progressive HI and show morphological defects to their inner hair cells. There is evidence that PLS1 is important in the preservation of adult stereocilia and normal hearing. Four families segregated the European ancestral variant c.35delG [p.(Gly12fs)] in GJB2, and one family was homozygous for p.(Trp24*), an Indian subcontinent ancestral variant which is common amongst Roma from Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Spain. We also observed variants in known HI genes USH1G, USH2A, MYH9, MYO7A, and a splice site variant in MANBA (c.2158-2A>G) in a family with HI, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and respiratory inflammation, which was previously reported in a Czech Roma family with similar features. Lastly, using multidimensional scaling and ADMIXTURE analyses, we delineate the degree of Asian/European admixture in the HI families understudy, and show that Roma individuals carrying the GJB2 p.(Trp24*) and MANBA c.2158-2A>G variants have a more pronounced South Asian background, whereas the other hearing-impaired Roma display an ancestral background similar to Europeans.

clinical significance.", "Abstract": "Sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness (SANDD) syndrome is rare and characterized by a low heart beat and severe-to-profound deafness. Additional features include fatigue, dizziness, and episodic syncope. The sinoatrial node (SAN) drives heart automaticity and continuously regulates heart rate. The CACNA1D gene encoding the Cav1.3 protein expressed in inner hair cells, atria and SAN, induces loss-of-function in channel activity and underlies SANDD. To date, only one variant c.1208_1209insGGG:p.(G403_V404insG) has been reported for SANDD syndrome. We studied five Pakistani families with SANDD and characterized a new missense variant p.(A376V) in CACNA1D in one family, and further characterized the founder variant p.(G403_V404insG) in four additional pedigrees. We show that affected individuals in the four families which segregate p.(G403_V404insG) share a 1.03\u2009MB haplotype on 3p21.1 suggesting they share a common distant ancestor. In conclusion, we identified new and known variants in CACNA1D in five Pakistani families with SANDD. This study is of clinical importance as the CACNA1D founder variant is only observed in families from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, in Pakistan. Therefore, screening patients with congenital deafness for SAN dysfunction in this province could ensure adequate follow-up and prevent cardiac failure associated with SAN.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Deafness", "Female", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Pakistan", "Pedigree", "Prognosis", "Sinoatrial Node"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Khurram", "Last Name": "Liaqat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Schrauwen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syed Irfan", "Last Name": "Raza", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, HBS Medical College, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Kwanghyuk", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shabir", "Last Name": "Hussain", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Imen", "Last Name": "Chakchouk", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Nasir", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Anushree", "Last Name": "Acharya", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Izoduwa", "Last Name": "Abbe", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Umair", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Ansar", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Irfan", "Last Name": "Ullah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Khadim", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "University of Washington Center for Mendelian Genomics", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bamshad", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah A", "Last Name": "Nickerson", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. sleal@bcm.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of human genetics", "PubDate": "2019Feb"}, {"PMID": "30461122", "Title": "Mutational and phenotypic spectra of KCNE1 deficiency in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome and Romano-Ward Syndrome.", "Abstract": "KCNE1 encodes a regulatory subunit of the KCNQ1 potassium channel-complex. Both KCNE1 and KCNQ1 are necessary for normal hearing and cardiac ventricular repolarization. Recessive variants in these genes are associated with Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome (JLNS1 and JLNS2), a cardio-auditory syndrome characterized by congenital profound sensorineural deafness and a prolonged QT interval that can cause ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Some normal-hearing carriers of heterozygous missense variants of KCNE1 and KCNQ1 have prolonged QT intervals, a dominantly inherited phenotype designated Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), which is also associated with arrhythmias and elevated risk of sudden death. Coassembly of certain mutant KCNE1 monomers with wild-type KCNQ1 subunits results in RWS by a dominant negative mechanism. This paper reviews variants of KCNE1 and their associated phenotypes, including biallelic truncating null variants of KCNE1 that have not been previously reported. We describe three homozygous nonsense mutations of KCNE1 segregating in families ascertained ostensibly for nonsyndromic deafness: c.50G>A (p.Trp17*), c.51G>A (p.Trp17*), and c.138C>A (p.Tyr46*). Some individuals carrying missense variants of KCNE1 have RWS.

We determined the role of FUT2 in otitis media susceptibility by obtaining DNA samples from 609 multi-ethnic families and simplex case subjects with otitis media. Exome and Sanger sequencing, linkage analysis, and Fisher exact and transmission disequilibrium tests (TDT) were performed. The common FUT2 c.604C>T (p.Arg202\u2217) variant co-segregates with otitis media in a Filipino pedigree (LOD = 4.0). Additionally, a rare variant, c.412C>T (p.Arg138Cys), is associated with recurrent/chronic otitis media in European-American children (p = 1.2\u00a0\u00d7 10-5) and US trios (TDT p = 0.01). The c.461G>A (p.Trp154\u2217) variant was also over-transmitted in US trios (TDT p = 0.01) and was associated with shifts in middle ear microbiota composition (PERMANOVA p < 10-7) and increased biodiversity. When all missense and nonsense variants identified in multi-ethnic US trios with CADD > 20 were combined, FUT2 variants were over-transmitted in trios (TDT p = 0.001). Fut2 is transiently upregulated in mouse middle ear after inoculation with non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Four FUT2 variants-namely p.Ala104Val, p.Arg138Cys, p.Trp154\u2217, and p.Arg202\u2217-reduced A antigen in mutant-transfected COS-7 cells, while the nonsense variants also reduced FUT2 protein levels. Common and rare FUT2 variants confer susceptibility to otitis media, likely by modifying the middle ear microbiome through regulation of A antigen levels in epithelial cells.

Postaxial polydactyly (PAP) is characterized by one or more posterior or postaxial digits. In a Pakistani family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic postaxial polydactyly type A (PAPA), we performed genomewide genotyping, linkage analysis, and exome and Sanger sequencing. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense variant (c.478C>T, p.[Arg160*]) in the FAM92A gene within the mapped region on 8q21.13-q24.12 that segregated with the PAPA phenotype. We found that FAM92A is expressed in the developing mouse limb and E11.5 limb bud including the progress zone and the apical ectodermal ridge, where it strongly localizes at the cilia level, suggesting an important role in limb patterning. The identified variant leads to a loss of the FAM92A/Chibby1 complex that is crucial for ciliogenesis and impairs the recruitment and the colocalization of FAM92A with Chibby1 at the base of the cilia. In addition, we show that Fam92a-/- homozygous mice also exhibit an abnormal digit morphology, including metatarsal osteomas and polysyndactyly, in addition to distinct abnormalities on the deltoid tuberosity of their humeri.

In this study, we utilized genome-wide genotyping, Sanger and exome sequencing to identify 163 DNA variants in 41 previously reported HL genes segregating in 321 Pakistani families. Of these, 70 (42.9%) variants identified in 29 genes are novel. As expected from genetic studies of disorders segregating in consanguineous families, the majority of affected individuals (94.4%) are homozygous for HL-associated variants, with the other variants being compound heterozygotes. The five most common HL genes in the Pakistani population are SLC26A4, MYO7A, GJB2, CIB2 and HGF, respectively. Our study provides a profile of the genetic etiology of HL in Pakistani families, which will allow for the development of more efficient genetic diagnostic tools, aid in accurate genetic counseling, and guide application of future gene-based therapies. These findings are also valuable in interpreting pathogenicity of variants that are potentially associated with HL in individuals of all ancestries.

To identify causal variants for syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID), exome sequencing was performed using DNA samples from 22 consanguineous Pakistani families with ARID, of which 21 have additional phenotypes including microcephaly. To aid in variant identification, homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis were performed. DNA samples from affected family member(s) from every pedigree underwent exome sequencing. Identified rare damaging exome variants were tested for co-segregation with ID using Sanger sequencing. For seven ARID families, variants were identified in genes not previously associated with ID, including: EI24, FXR1 and TET3 for which knockout mouse models have brain defects; and CACNG7 and TRAPPC10 where cell studies suggest roles in important neural pathways. For two families, the novel ARID genes CARNMT1 and GARNL3 lie within previously reported ID microdeletion regions. We also observed homozygous variants in two ID candidate genes, GRAMD1B and TBRG1, for which each has been previously reported in a single family. An additional 14 families have homozygous variants in established ID genes, of which 11 variants are novel. All ARID genes have increased expression in specific structures of the developing and adult human brain and 91% of the genes are differentially expressed in utero or during early childhood.

necessary to perform power calculations. Although for Mendelian traits the power of detecting linkage for pedigree(s) can be determined, it is also of great interest to determine the probability of identifying multiple pedigrees or unrelated cases with variants in the same gene. For many diseases, due to extreme locus heterogeneity this probability can be small. If only one family is observed segregating a variant classified as likely pathogenic or of unknown significance, the gene cannot be implicated in disease etiology. The probability of identifying several disease families or cases is dependent on the gene-specific disease prevalence and the sample size. The observation of multiple disease families or cases with variants in the same gene as well as evidence of pathogenicity from other sources, e.g. in silico prediction, expression and functional studies, can aid in implicating a gene in disease etiology. MendelProb can determine the probability of detecting a minimum number of families or cases with variants in the same gene. It can also calculate the probability of detecting genes with variants in different data types, e.g. identifying a variant in at least one family that can establish linkage and more the two additional families regardless of their size.

However, many families in which multiple members have thoracic aortic disease do not have alterations in the known aortopathy genes. Genes highly expressed in the aorta were assessed for rare variants in exome sequencing data from such families, and compound rare heterozygous variants (p.Pro45Argfs\u221725 and p.Glu750\u2217) in LTBP3 were identified in affected members of one family. A homozygous variant (p.Asn678_Gly681delinsThrCys) that introduces an additional cysteine into an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain in the corresponding protein, latent TGF-\u03b2 binding protein (LTBP-3), was identified in a second family. Individuals with compound heterozygous or homozygous variants in these families have aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta, as well as aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and other arteries, along with dental abnormalities and short stature. Heterozygous carriers of the p.Asn678_Gly681delinsThrCys variant have later onset of thoracic aortic disease, as well as dental abnormalities. In these families, LTBP3 variants segregated with thoracic aortic disease with a combined LOD score of 3.9. Additionally, heterozygous rare LTBP3 variants were found in individuals with early onset of acute aortic dissections, and some of these variants disrupted LTBP-3 levels or EGF-like domains.

The underlying genetic cause of ARIH syndrome has been associated with sequence variants of the gene ST14, encoding type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase, which maps to chromosome 11q24.3. The current report aimed to investigate the clinical features and genetic cause of ARIH syndrome in a large consanguineous family of Pakistani origin. The technique of homozygosity mapping with highly polymorphic microsatellite markers was employed to establish linkage within the family. Sanger sequencing of exons and intron-exon boundaries of ST14 was performed to identify the potential pathogenic sequence variants, followed by structural analysis of the mutated protein. Linkage was established to chromosome 11q24.3, comprising the gene ST14. Sequence analysis led to the identification of a novel homozygous missense variant (c.1315G>A, p.Gly439Ser) in the ST14 gene that co-segregated with the disease phenotype in all affected members. Homology modelling and molecular docking analysis of ST14 with wild-type TMEFF1 protein was performed which revealed that glycine at position 439 is crucial for maintaining normal structural confirmation and interaction with the EGF domain of TMEFF1 protein. Taken together, the data strongly advocate this ST14 variant as the underlying genetic cause of ARIH syndrome in this first reported affected family from Pakistan.

The etiology of keloids has not been resolved but previous studies suggest that keloids are a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Although possible candidate genes have been suggested by genome-wide association studies using common variants, by upregulation in keloids or their involvement in syndromes that include keloid formation, rare coding variants that contribute to susceptibility in non-syndromic keloid formation have not been previously identified. Through analysis of whole-genome data we mapped a locus to chromosome 8p23.3-p21.3 with a statistically significant maximum multipoint LOD score of 4.48. This finding was followed up using exome sequencing and led to the identification of a c.1202T>C (p.(Leu401Pro)) variant in the N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (ASAH1) gene that co-segregates with the keloid phenotype in a large Yoruba family. ASAH1 is an acid ceramidase known to be involved in tumor formation by controlling the ratio of ceramide and sphingosine.

Due to modest effect sizes, large sample sizes of tens to hundreds of thousands of individuals are required for adequately powered studies. Current analytical tools are obsolete when it comes to handling these large datasets. To facilitate the analysis of large-scale sequence-based studies, we developed SEQSpark which implements parallel processing based on Spark to increase the speed and efficiency of performing data quality control, annotation, and association analysis. To demonstrate the versatility and speed of SEQSpark, we analyzed whole-genome sequence data from the UK10K, testing for associations with waist-to-hip ratios. The analysis, which was completed in 1.5\u00a0hr, included loading data, annotation, principal component analysis, and single variant and rare variant aggregate association analysis of >9 million variants. For rare variant aggregate analysis, an exome-wide significant association (p < 2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10-6) was observed with CCDC62 (SKAT-O [p = 6.89\u00a0\u00d7 10-7], combined multivariate collapsing [p = 1.48\u00a0\u00d7 10-6], and burden of rare variants [p = 1.48\u00a0\u00d7 10-6]). SEQSpark was also used to analyze 50,000 simulated exomes and it required 1.75\u00a0hr for the analysis of a quantitative trait using several rare variant aggregate association methods. Additionally, the performance of SEQSpark was compared to Variant Association Tools and PLINK/SEQ.

Causal variants that aggregate in families usually have larger effect sizes than those found in sporadic cases, so family-based designs can be a more powerful approach than population-based designs. Moreover, some family-based designs are robust to confounding due to population admixture or substructure. We developed a RV extension of the generalized disequilibrium test (GDT) to analyze sequence data obtained from nuclear and extended families. The GDT utilizes genotype differences of all discordant relative pairs to assess associations within a family, and the RV extension combines the single-variant GDT statistic over a genomic region of interest. The RV-GDT has increased power by efficiently incorporating information beyond first-degree relatives and allows for the inclusion of covariates. Using simulated genetic data, we demonstrated that the RV-GDT method has well-controlled type I error rates, even when applied to admixed populations and populations with substructure. It is more powerful than existing family-based RV association methods, particularly for the analysis of extended pedigrees and pedigrees with missing data. We analyzed whole-genome sequence data from families affected by Alzheimer disease to illustrate the application of the RV-GDT. Given the capability of the RV-GDT to adequately control for population admixture or substructure and analyze pedigrees with missing genotype data and its superior power over other family-based methods, it is an effective tool for elucidating the involvement of RVs in the etiology of complex traits.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "TNK1", "exome sequence data", "extended and nuclear pedigrees", "family-based association analysis", "generalized disequilibrium test", "missing data", "pedigree disequilibrium test", "rare variants", "whole-genome sequence data"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Axin Protein", "Computer Simulation", "Databases, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zongxiao", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan E", "Last Name": "Renton", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linhai", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gao T", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alison M", "Last Name": "Goate", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and Gertrude H.

Previous studies have suggested a high heritability with a complex genetic architecture, such that only a few LSL loci have been identified. We performed a genome-wide case-control association study to address the role of common variants using a discovery cohort of 778 cases and 2756 controls. We identified a genome-wide significant association mapping to a 200 kb region on chromosome 20q11 [P= 1.72 \u00d7 10-8 for rs3746446; imputed Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) rs6088703 P= 3.01 \u00d7 10-9, odds ratio (OR)= 1.6 for both]. This result was supported by transmission disequilibrium analyses using a subset of 541 case families (lowest P in region= 4.51 \u00d7 10-5, OR= 1.5). Replication in a cohort of 367 LSL cases and 5159 controls showed nominal association (P= 0.03 for rs3746446) resulting in P= 9.49 \u00d7 10-9 for rs3746446 upon meta-analysis of the combined cohorts. In addition, a group of seven SNPs on chromosome 1q21.3 met threshold for suggestive association (lowest P= 9.35 \u00d7 10-7 for rs12045807). Both regions include genes involved in cardiac development-MYH7B/miR499A on chromosome 20 and CTSK, CTSS and ARNT on chromosome 1. Genome-wide heritability analysis using case-control genotyped SNPs suggested that the mean heritability of LSLs attributable to common variants is moderately high ([Formula: see text] range= 0.26-0.34) and consistent with previous assertions. These results provide evidence for the role of common variation in LSLs, proffer new genes as potential biological candidates, and give further insight to the complex genetic architecture of

genetics. These data are now being used to understand the role of rare variants in complex traits and to advance the goals of precision medicine. The technological and computing advances that have enabled us to generate WGS data on thousands of individuals have also outpaced our ability to perform analyses in scientifically and statistically rigorous and thoughtful ways. The past several years have witnessed the application of whole-exome sequencing (WES) to complex traits and diseases. From our analysis of NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) data, not only have a number of important disease and complex trait association findings emerged, but our collective experience offers some valuable lessons for WGS initiatives. These include caveats associated with generating automated pipelines for quality control and analysis of rare variants; the importance of studying minority populations; sample size requirements and efficient study designs for identifying rare-variant associations; and the significance of incidental findings in population-based genetic research.

These SNPs may tag correlated variants with biological importance. Fine-mapping around GWAS loci can facilitate detection of functional candidates and additional independent risk variants. We analyzed 11,900 cases and 14,311 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon Cancer Family Registry. To fine-map genomic regions containing all known common risk variants, we imputed high-density genetic data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We tested single-variant associations with colorectal tumor risk for all variants spanning genomic regions 250-kb upstream or downstream of 31 GWAS-identified SNPs (index SNPs). We queried the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser to examine evidence for biological function. Index SNPs did not show the strongest association signals with colorectal tumor risk in their respective genomic regions. Bioinformatics analysis of SNPs showing smaller P-values in each region revealed 21 functional candidates in 12 loci (5q31.1, 8q24, 11q13.4, 11q23, 12p13.32, 12q24.21, 14q22.2, 15q13, 18q21, 19q13.1, 20p12.3, and 20q13.33). We did not observe evidence of additional independent association signals in GWAS-identified regions. Our results support the utility of integrating data from comprehensive fine-mapping with expanding publicly available genomic databases to help clarify GWAS associations and identify functional candidates that warrant more onerous laboratory follow-up. Such efforts may aid the eventual discovery of disease-causing variant(s).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["A549 Cells", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caco-2 Cells", "Chromosome Mapping",

Across diverse ethnic groups, mutations of MYO15A at the DFNB3 locus appear to be the third or fourth most common cause of autosomal-recessive, nonsyndromic deafness. In 49 of the 67 exons of MYO15A, there are currently 192 recessive mutations identified, including 14 novel mutations reported here. These mutations are distributed uniformly across MYO15A with one enigmatic exception; the alternatively spliced giant exon 2, encoding 1,233 residues, has 17 truncating mutations but no convincing deafness-causing missense mutations. MYO15A encodes three distinct isoform classes, one of which is 395 kDa (3,530 residues), the largest member of the myosin superfamily of molecular motors. Studies of Myo15 mouse models that recapitulate DFNB3 revealed two different pathogenic mechanisms of hearing loss. In the inner ear, myosin 15 is necessary both for the development and the long-term maintenance of stereocilia, mechanosensory sound-transducing organelles that extend from the apical surface of hair cells. The goal of this Mutation Update is to provide a comprehensive review of mutations and functions of MYO15A.", "Keywords": ["DFNB3", "MYO15A", "deafness", "giant exon", "micro exon", "myosin 15", "shaker 2"], "MeSH terms": ["Alternative Splicing", "Animals", "Deafness", "Disease Models, Animal", "Ear, Inner", "Exons", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Mice", "Mutation", "Myosins", "Stereocilia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Atteeq U", "Last Name": "Rehman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan E", "Last Name": "Bird", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892."}, {"First Name": "Rabia", "Last Name": "Faridi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892."}, {"First Name": "Mohsin", "Last Name": "Shahzad", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201."}, {"First Name": "Sujay", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892."}, {"First Name": "Kwanghyuk", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030."}, {"First Name": "Shaheen N", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, 54550, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Ayesha", "Last Name": "Imtiaz", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892."}, {"First Name": "Zubair M", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201."}, {"First Name": "Saima", "Last Name": "Riazuddin", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201."}, {"First Name": "Regie Lyn P", "Last Name": "Santos-Cortez", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030."}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, 45320, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030."}, {"First Name": "Sheikh", "Last Name": "Riazuddin", "Affiliation": "Allama Iqbal Medical Research Centre, Jinnah Hospital Complex, University of Health Sciences, Lahore, 54550, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Thomas B", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892. friedman@nidcd.nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Human mutation", "PubDate": "2016Oct"}, {"PMID": "27018473", "Title": "Frequency and Complexity of De Novo Structural Mutation in Autism.", "Abstract": "Genetic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have established that de novo duplications and deletions contribute to risk. However, ascertainment of structural variants (SVs) has been restricted by the coarse resolution of current approaches. By applying a custom pipeline for SV discovery, genotyping, and de novo assembly to genome sequencing of 235 subjects (71 affected individuals, 26 healthy siblings, and their parents), we compiled an atlas of 29,719 SV loci (5,213/genome), comprising 11 different classes.

In addition, we observed complex mutation clusters where combinations of de novo SVs, nucleotide substitutions, and indels occurred as a single event.

Thoracic aortic aneurysms and acute aortic dissections (TAADs) occur as a result of genetically triggered defects in aortic structure and a dysfunctional response to these forces. Here, we describe mutations in the forkhead transcription factor FOXE3 that predispose mutation-bearing individuals to TAAD. We performed exome sequencing of a large family with multiple members with TAADs and identified a rare variant in FOXE3 with an altered amino acid in the DNA-binding domain (p.Asp153His) that segregated with disease in this family. Additional pathogenic FOXE3 variants were identified in unrelated TAAD families. In mice, Foxe3 deficiency reduced smooth muscle cell (SMC) density and impaired SMC differentiation in the ascending aorta. Foxe3 expression was induced in aortic SMCs after transverse aortic constriction, and Foxe3 deficiency increased SMC apoptosis and ascending aortic rupture with increased aortic pressure. These phenotypes were rescued by inhibiting p53 activity, either by administration of a p53 inhibitor (pifithrin-\u03b1), or by crossing Foxe3-/- mice with p53-/- mice.

However, S1PRs have not been previously reported to be involved in the genetic etiology of human traits. S1PR2 lies within the autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (ARNSHI) locus DFNB68 on 19p13.2. From exome sequence data we identified two pathogenic S1PR2 variants, c.323G>C (p.Arg108Pro) and c.419A>G (p.Tyr140Cys). Each of these variants co-segregates with congenital profound hearing impairment in consanguineous Pakistani families with maximum LOD scores of 6.4 for family DEM4154 and 3.3 for family PKDF1400. Neither S1PR2 missense variant was reported among \u223c120,000 chromosomes in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database, in 76 unrelated Pakistani exomes, or in 720 Pakistani control chromosomes. Both DNA variants affect highly conserved residues of S1PR2 and are predicted to be damaging by multiple bioinformatics tools. Molecular modeling predicts that these variants affect binding of sphingosine-1-phosphate (p.Arg108Pro) and G protein docking (p.Tyr140Cys). In the previously reported S1pr2(-/-) mice, stria vascularis abnormalities, organ of Corti degeneration, and profound hearing loss were\u00a0observed. Additionally, hair cell defects were seen in both knockout mice and morphant zebrafish. Family PKDF1400 presents with ARNSHI, which is consistent with the lack of gross malformations in S1pr2(-/-) mice, whereas family DEM4154 has lower limb malformations in addition to hearing loss. Our findings suggest the possibility of developing therapies against hair cell damage (e.g., from ototoxic drugs) through targeted stimulation of S1PR2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Asian People", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19", "Exome", "Genes, Recessive", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Lod Score", "Logistic Models", "Lysophospholipids", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation, Missense", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Receptors, Lysosphingolipid", "Sphingosine", "Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Regie Lyn P", "Last Name": "Santos-Cortez", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rabia", "Last Name": "Faridi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA;

A high WHR indicates more intra-abdominal fat deposition and is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified numerous common genetic loci influencing WHR, but the contributions of rare variants have not been previously reported. We investigated rare variant associations with WHR in 1510 European-American and 1186 African-American women from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-Exome Sequencing Project. Association analysis was performed on the gene level using several rare variant association methods. The strongest association was observed for rare variants in IKBKB (P=4.0 \u00d7 10(-8)) in European-Americans, where rare variants in this gene are predicted to decrease WHRs. The activation of the IKBKB gene is involved in inflammatory processes and insulin resistance, which may affect normal food intake and body weight and shape. Meanwhile, aggregation of rare variants in COBLL1, previously found to harbor common variants associated with WHR and fasting insulin, were nominally associated (P=2.23 \u00d7 10(-4)) with higher WHR in European-Americans. However, these significant results are not shared between African-Americans and European-Americans that may be due to differences in the allelic architecture of the two populations and the small sample sizes. Our study indicates that the combined effect of rare variants contribute to the inter-individual variation in fat distribution through the regulation of insulin response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

However, in the clinical setting, a large number of NSHI families have unexplained etiology, suggesting that there are many more genes to be identified. In this study we used SNP-based linkage analysis and follow up microsatellite markers to identify a novel locus (DFNA66) on chromosome 6q15-21 (LOD 5.1) in a large Danish family with dominantly inherited NSHI. By locus specific capture and next-generation sequencing, we identified a c.574C>T heterozygous nonsense mutation (p.R192*) in CD164. This gene encodes a 197 amino acid transmembrane sialomucin (known as endolyn, MUC-24 or CD164), which is widely expressed and involved in cell adhesion and migration. The mutation segregated with the phenotype and was absent in 1200 Danish control individuals and in databases with whole-genome and exome sequence data. The predicted effect of the mutation was a truncation of the last six C-terminal residues of the cytoplasmic tail of CD164, including a highly conserved canonical sorting motif (YXX\u0424). In whole blood from an affected individual, we found by RT-PCR both the wild-type and the mutated transcript suggesting that the mutant transcript escapes nonsense mediated decay. Functional studies in HEK cells demonstrated that the truncated protein was almost completely retained on the plasma cell membrane in contrast to the wild-type protein, which targeted primarily to the endo-lysosomal compartments, implicating failed endocytosis as a possible disease mechanism. In the mouse ear, we found CD164 expressed in the inner and outer hair cells of the organ of Corti, as well as in other locations in the cochlear duct. In conclusion, we have identified a new DFNA locus located on chromosome 6q15-21 and implicated CD164 as a novel gene for hearing impairment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Base Sequence", "Cell Line", "Codon, Nonsense", "Deafness", "Denmark", "Endolyn", "Family", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microsatellite Repeats", "Organ of Corti", "Pedigree", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mette", "Last Name": "Nyegaard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark;

This is a formidable gap in biomedical knowledge. Accordingly, in December 2011, the NIH established the Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMGs) to provide the collaborative framework and infrastructure necessary for undertaking large-scale whole-exome sequencing and discovery of the genetic variants responsible for Mendelian phenotypes. In partnership with 529 investigators from 261 institutions in 36 countries, the CMGs assessed 18,863 samples from 8,838 families representing 579 known and 470 novel Mendelian phenotypes as of January 2015. This collaborative effort has identified 956 genes, including 375 not previously associated with human health, that underlie a Mendelian phenotype. These results provide insight into study design and analytical strategies, identify novel mechanisms of disease, and reveal the extensive clinical variability of Mendelian phenotypes.

Currently mutations in five genes CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, PDE6C and PDE6H have been implicated in ACHM. We performed homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis in a consanguineous Pakistani ACHM family and mapped the locus to a 15.12-Mb region on chromosome 1q23.1-q24.3 with a maximum LOD score of 3.6. A DNA sample from an affected family member underwent exome sequencing. Within the ATF6 gene, a single-base insertion variant c.355_356dupG (p.Glu119Glyfs*8) was identified, which completely segregates with the ACHM phenotype within the family. The frameshift variant was absent in public variant databases, in 130 exomes from unrelated Pakistani individuals, and in 235 ethnically matched controls. The variant is predicted to result in a truncated protein that lacks the DNA binding and transmembrane domains and therefore affects the function of ATF6 as a transcription factor that initiates the unfolded protein response during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Immunolabeling with anti-ATF6 antibodies showed localization throughout the mouse neuronal retina, including retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptor cells, inner nuclear layer, inner and outer plexiform layers, with a more prominent signal in retinal ganglion cells. In contrast to cytoplasmic expression of wild-type protein, in heterologous cells ATF6 protein with the p.Glu119Glyfs*8 variant is mainly confined to the nucleus. Our results imply that response to ER stress as mediated by the ATF6 pathway is essential for color vision in humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Activating Transcription Factor 6", "Adolescent", "Animals", "Asian People", "Color Vision Defects", "Consanguinity", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Exome", "Female", "Frameshift Mutation", "Genotyping Techniques", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Limit of Detection", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Pakistan", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Retina", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Ansar", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Center for Statistical Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza 700D, Houston, TX, 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Regie Lyn P", "Last Name": "Santos-Cortez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Muhammad Arif Nadeem", "Last Name": "Saqib", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fareeha", "Last Name": "Zulfiqar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kwanghyuk", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Naeem Mahmood", "Last Name": "Ashraf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ehsan", "Last Name": "Ullah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sundus", "Last Name": "Sajid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Falak Sher", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Amin-ud-Din", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "University of Washington Center for Mendelian Genomics", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Shendure", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bamshad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah A", "Last Name": "Nickerson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Hameed", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saima", "Last Name": "Riazuddin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zubair M", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Human genetics", "PubDate": "2015Sep"}, {"PMID": "26024889", "Title": "Genome-wide association study of platelet aggregation in African Americans.", "Abstract": "We have previously shown that platelet aggregation has higher heritability in African Americans than European Americans.

Hypothesizing that mutant COPA leads to defective intracellular transport via coat protein complex I (COPI), we show that COPA variants impair binding to proteins targeted for retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport. Additionally, expression of mutant COPA results in ER stress and the upregulation of cytokines priming for a T helper type 17 (TH17) response.

Significant genetic heterogeneity is established for this familial condition. Whole-genome linkage analysis and exome sequencing of distant relatives from a large family with autosomal-dominant inheritance of thoracic aortic aneurysms variably associated with the bicuspid aortic valve was used for identification of additional genes predisposing individuals to this condition. A rare variant, c.1031A>C (p.Glu344Ala), was identified in MAT2A, which encodes methionine adenosyltransferase II alpha (MAT II\u03b1). This variant segregated with disease in the family, and Sanger sequencing of DNA from affected probands from unrelated families with thoracic aortic disease identified another MAT2A rare variant, c.1067G>A (p.Arg356His). Evidence that these variants predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections includes the following: there is a paucity of rare variants in MAT2A in the population; amino acids Glu344 and Arg356 are conserved from humans to zebrafish; and substitutions of these amino acids in MAT I\u03b1 are found in individuals with hypermethioninemia. Structural analysis suggested that p.Glu344Ala and p.Arg356His disrupt MAT II\u03b1 enzyme function. Knockdown of mat2aa in zebrafish via morpholino oligomers disrupted cardiovascular development. Co-transfected wild-type human MAT2A mRNA rescued defects of zebrafish cardiovascular development at significantly higher levels than mRNA edited to express either the Glu344 or Arg356 mutants, providing further evidence that the p.Glu344Ala and p.Arg356His substitutions impair MAT II\u03b1 function.

However, many NGS studies fall short of identifying causal variants, with estimates for success rates as low as 25% for uncovering the pathological variant underlying disease etiology. An important reason for such failures is familial locus heterogeneity, where within a single pedigree causal variants in two or more genes underlie Mendelian trait etiology. As examples of intra- and inter-sibship familial locus heterogeneity, we present 10 consanguineous Pakistani families segregating hearing impairment due to homozygous variants in two different hearing impairment genes and a European-American pedigree in which hearing impairment is caused by four variants in three different genes. We have identified 41 additional pedigrees with syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing impairment for which a single previously reported hearing impairment gene has been identified but only segregates with the phenotype in a subset of affected pedigree members. We estimate that locus heterogeneity occurs in 15.3% (95% confidence interval: 11.9%, 19.9%) of the families in our collection. We demonstrate novel approaches to apply linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping (for autosomal recessive consanguineous pedigrees), which can be used to detect locus heterogeneity using either NGS or SNP array data. Results from linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping can also be used to group sibships or individuals most likely to be segregating the same causal variants and thereby increase the success rate of

To date, inferences of human population structure have primarily been made with common variants. However, recent large-scale resequencing studies have shown an abundance of rare variation in humans, which may be particularly useful for making inferences of fine-scale population structure. To this end, we used an information theory framework and extensive coalescent simulations to rigorously quantify the informativeness of rare and common variation to detect signatures of fine-scale population structure. We show that rare variation affords unique insights into patterns of recent population structure. Furthermore, to empirically assess our theoretical findings, we analyzed high-coverage exome sequences in 6,515 European and African American individuals. As predicted, rare variants are more informative than common polymorphisms in revealing a distinct cluster of European-American individuals, and subsequent analyses demonstrate that these individuals are likely of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

Genome-wide association studies have identified CRP-associated common variants associated in \u223c25 genes. Our aims were to apply exome sequencing to (1) assess whether the candidate loci contain rare coding variants associated with CRP levels and (2) perform an exome-wide search for rare variants in novel genes associated with CRP levels. We exome-sequenced 6050 European-Americans (EAs) and 3109 African-Americans (AAs) from the NHLBI-ESP and the CHARGE consortia, and performed association tests of sequence data with measured CRP levels. In single-variant tests across candidate loci, a novel rare (minor allele frequency = 0.16%) CRP-coding variant (rs77832441-A; p.Thr59Met) was associated with 53% lower mean CRP levels (P = 2.9 \u00d7 10(-6)). We replicated the association of rs77832441 in an exome array analysis of 11 414 EAs (P = 3.0 \u00d7 10(-15)). Despite a strong effect on CRP levels, rs77832441 was not associated with inflammation-related phenotypes including coronary heart disease. We also found evidence for an AA-specific association of APOE-\u03b52 rs7214 with higher CRP levels. At the exome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 \u00d7 10(-8)), we confirmed associations for reported common variants of HNF1A, CRP, IL6R and TOMM40-APOE. In gene-based tests, a burden of rare/lower frequency variation in CRP in EAs (P \u2264 6.8 \u00d7 10(-4)) and in retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b1 (RORA) in AAs (P = 1.7 \u00d7 10(-3)) were associated with CRP levels at the candidate gene level (P < 2.0 \u00d7 10(-3)). This inquiry did not elucidate novel genes, but instead demonstrated that variants distributed across the allele frequency spectrum within candidate genes contribute to CRP levels.", "Keywords": [],

"Novel somatic and germline mutations in intracranial germ cell tumours.", "Abstract": "Intracranial germ cell tumours (IGCTs) are a group of rare heterogeneous brain tumours that are clinically and histologically similar to the more common gonadal GCTs. IGCTs show great variation in their geographical and gender distribution, histological composition and treatment outcomes. The incidence of IGCTs is historically five- to eightfold greater in Japan and other East Asian countries than in Western countries, with peak incidence near the time of puberty. About half of the tumours are located in the pineal region. The male-to-female incidence ratio is approximately 3-4:1 overall, but is even higher for tumours located in the pineal region. Owing to the scarcity of tumour specimens available for research, little is currently known about this rare disease. Here we report the analysis of 62 cases by next-generation sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism array and expression array. We find the KIT/RAS signalling pathway frequently mutated in more than 50% of IGCTs, including novel recurrent somatic mutations in KIT, its downstream mediators KRAS and NRAS, and its negative regulator CBL. Novel somatic alterations in the AKT/mTOR pathway included copy number gains of the AKT1 locus at 14q32.33 in 19% of patients, with corresponding upregulation of AKT1 expression. We identified loss-of-function mutations in BCORL1, a transcriptional co-repressor and tumour suppressor. We report significant enrichment of novel and rare germline variants in JMJD1C, which codes for a histone demethylase and is a coactivator of the androgen receptor, among Japanese IGCT patients. This study establishes a molecular foundation for understanding the biology of IGCTs and suggests potentially promising therapeutic strategies focusing on the inhibition of KIT/RAS activation and the AKT1/mTOR pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain Neoplasms", "Child", "Female", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Humans", "Japan", "Male", "Mutation", "Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal",

Highlights of VAT include variant-site and call-level quality control (QC), summary statistics, phenotype- and genotype-based sample selection, variant annotation, selection of variants for association analysis, and a collection of rare-variant association methods for analyzing qualitative and quantitative traits. The association testing framework for VAT is regression based, which readily allows for flexible construction of association models with multiple covariates and weighting themes based on allele frequencies or predicted functionality. Additionally, pathway analyses, conditional analyses, and analyses of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions can be performed. VAT is capable of rapidly scanning through data by using multi-process computation, adaptive permutation, and simultaneously conducting association analysis via multiple methods. Results are available in text or graphic file formats and additionally can be output to relational databases for further annotation and filtering. An interface to R language also facilitates user implementation of novel association methods. The VAT's data QC and association-analysis pipeline can be applied to sequence, imputed, and genotyping array, e.g., \"exome chip,\" data, providing a reliable and reproducible computational environment in which to analyze small- to large-scale studies with data from the latest genotyping and sequencing technologies.

This mutation is predicted to cause the loss of 82 amino acids from the carboxyl tail, including highly conserved residues within the catalytic domain, plus a calmodulin-stimulation defect, both of which are expected to decrease enzymatic efficiency. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation had symmetric, mild-to-moderate mixed hearing impairment. Zebrafish adcy1b morphants had no FM1-43 dye uptake and lacked startle response, indicating hair cell dysfunction and gross hearing impairment. In the mouse, Adcy1 expression was observed throughout inner ear development and maturation. ADCY1 was localized to the cytoplasm of supporting cells and hair cells of the cochlea and vestibule and also to cochlear hair cell nuclei and stereocilia. Ex vivo studies in COS-7 cells suggest that the carboxyl tail of ADCY1 is essential for localization to actin-based microvilli. These results demonstrate that ADCY1 has an evolutionarily conserved role in hearing and that cAMP signaling is important to hair cell function within the inner ear.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenylyl Cyclases", "Animals", "COS Cells", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Codon, Nonsense", "Cyclic AMP", "Cytoplasm", "Ear, Inner", "Female", "Hair Cells, Auditory", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Labyrinth Supporting Cells", "Male", "Mice", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Regie Lyn P", "Last Name": "Santos-Cortez", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Center for Statistical Genetics and."}, {"First Name": "Kwanghyuk", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Center for Statistical Genetics and."}, {"First Name": "Arnaud P", "Last Name": "Giese", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Ansar", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Center for Statistical Genetics and Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Amin-Ud-Din", "Affiliation": "Dera Ghazi Khan Campus, University of Education, Lahore 32200, Pakistan and."}, {"First Name": "Kira", "Last Name": "Rehn", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Center for Statistical Genetics and."}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Aziz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Ilene", "Last Name": "Chiu", "Affiliation": "Bobby R.

We recently mapped DFNB86, a locus associated with nonsyndromic deafness, to chromosome 16p. In this study, whole-exome sequencing was performed with genomic DNA from affected individuals from three large consanguineous families in which markers linked to DFNB86 segregate with profound deafness. Analyses of these data revealed homozygous mutation c.208G>T (p.Asp70Tyr) or c.878G>C (p.Arg293Pro) in TBC1D24 as the underlying cause of deafness in the three families. Sanger sequence analysis of TBC1D24 in an additional large family in which deafness segregates with DFNB86 identified the c.208G>T (p.Asp70Tyr) substitution. These mutations affect TBC1D24 amino acid residues that are conserved in orthologs ranging from fruit fly to human. Neither variant was observed in databases of single-nucleotide variants or in 634 chromosomes from ethnically matched control subjects. TBC1D24 in the mouse inner ear was immunolocalized predominantly to spiral ganglion neurons, indicating that DFNB86 deafness might be an auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. Previously, six recessive mutations in TBC1D24 were reported to cause seizures (hearing loss was not reported) ranging in severity from epilepsy with otherwise normal development to epileptic encephalopathy resulting in childhood death. Two of our four families in which deafness segregates with mutant alleles of TBC1D24 were available for neurological examination. Cosegregation of epilepsy and deafness was not observed in these two families.

A drawback of analyzing population-based data is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and admixture, and spurious associations can occur. For RVs, this problem can be substantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to analyze parent-child trio data, by using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), which is robust to population substructure and admixture. We extended the TDT to test for RV associations using four commonly used methods. We demonstrate that for all RV-TDT methods, using proper analysis strategies, type I error is well-controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. For trio data, unlike for population-based data, RV allele-counting association methods will lead to inflated type I errors. However type I errors can be properly controlled by obtaining p values empirically through haplotype permutation. The power of the RV-TDT methods was evaluated and compared to the analysis of case-control data with a number of genetic and disease models. The RV-TDT was also used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection autism trios and an association was observed with variants in ABCA7.

locus associated with autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (ARNSHI), was mapped to chromosomal region 16q21-q23.2 in three unrelated, consanguineous Pakistani families. Through whole-exome sequencing of a hearing-impaired individual from each family, missense mutations were identified at highly conserved residues of lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS): the c.1129G>A (p.Asp377Asn) variant was found in one family, and the c.517T>C (p.Tyr173His) variant was found in the other two families. Both variants were predicted to be damaging by multiple bioinformatics tools. The two variants both segregated with the nonsyndromic-hearing-impairment phenotype within the three families, and neither mutation was identified in ethnically matched controls or within variant databases. Individuals homozygous for KARS mutations had symmetric, severe hearing impairment across all frequencies but did not show evidence of auditory or limb neuropathy. It has been demonstrated that KARS is expressed in hair cells of zebrafish, chickens, and mice. Moreover, KARS has strong localization to the spiral ligament region of the cochlea, as well as to Deiters' cells, the sulcus epithelium, the basilar membrane, and the surface of the spiral limbus. It is hypothesized that KARS variants affect aminoacylation in inner-ear cells by interfering with binding activity to tRNA or p38 and with tetramer formation. The identification of rare KARS variants in ARNSHI-affected families defines a gene that is associated with ARNSHI.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Case-Control Studies", "Chickens", "Cochlea", "Computational Biology", "Consanguinity", "Female", "Genetic Linkage", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner", "Haplotypes", "Hearing Loss", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Lysine-tRNA Ligase", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation, Missense", "Pedigree", "Transfer RNA Aminoacylation", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Regie Lyn P", "Last Name": "Santos-Cortez", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kwanghyuk", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zahid", "Last Name": "Azeem", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Antonellis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lana M", "Last Name": "Pollock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saadullah", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Irfanullah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paula B", "Last Name": "Andrade-Elizondo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ilene", "Last Name": "Chiu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark D", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sulman", "Last Name": "Basit", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "University of Washington Center\u00a0for\u00a0Mendelian Genomics", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah A", "Last Name": "Nickerson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian M", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wasim", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of human genetics", "PubDate": "2013Jul11"}, {"PMID": "23757187", "Title": "Testing for rare variant associations in the presence of missing data.", "Abstract": "For studies of genetically complex diseases, many association methods have been developed to analyze rare variants.

In each family, affected individuals were homozygous for a different pathogenic CLPP allele: c.433A>C (p.Thr145Pro), c.440G>C (p.Cys147Ser), or an experimentally demonstrated splice-donor-site mutation, c.270+4A>G.

Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent explosive population growth, notable for an excess of rare genetic variants, suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals of European American and African American ancestry and inferred the age of 1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that approximately 73% of all protein-coding SNVs and approximately 86% of SNVs predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000-10,000\u2009years. The average age of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious SNVs than other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the Out-of-Africa dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human protein-coding variation, show the profound effect of recent human history on the burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provide important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in disease-gene discovery.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Africa", "Alleles", "Black People", "Europe", "Evolution, Molecular", "Exome", "Exons", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Open Reading Frames", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "United States", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenqing", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA. wqfu@u.washington.edu"}, {"First Name": "Timothy D", "Last Name": "O'Connor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Goo", "Last Name": "Jun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hyun Min", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Goncalo", "Last Name": "Abecasis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Leal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stacey", "Last Name": "Gabriel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark J", "Last Name": "Rieder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Altshuler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Shendure", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah A", "Last Name": "Nickerson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bamshad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua M", "Last Name": "Akey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Jan10"}]
