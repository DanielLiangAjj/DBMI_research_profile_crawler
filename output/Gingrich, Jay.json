[{"PMID": "37732425", "Title": "Maternal childhood maltreatment: associations to offspring brain volume and white matter connectivity.", "Abstract": "The deleterious effects of adversity are likely intergenerational, such that one generation's adverse experiences can affect the next. Epidemiological studies link maternal adversity to offspring depression and anxiety, possibly via transmission mechanisms that influence offspring fronto-limbic connectivity. However, studies have not thoroughly disassociated postnatal exposure effects nor considered the role of offspring sex. We utilized infant neuroimaging to test the hypothesis that maternal childhood maltreatment (CM) would be associated with increased fronto-limbic connectivity in infancy and tested brain-behavior associations in childhood. Ninety-two dyads participated (32 mothers with CM, 60 without; 52 infant females, 40 infant males). Women reported on their experiences of CM and non-sedated sleeping infants underwent MRIs at 2.44 \u00b1 2.74 weeks. Brain volumes were estimated via structural MRI and white matter structural connectivity (fiber counts) via diffusion MRI with probabilistic tractography. A subset of parents (n = 36) reported on children's behaviors at age 5.17 \u00b1 1.73 years. Males in the maltreatment group demonstrated greater intra-hemispheric fronto-limbic connectivity (b = 0.96, p= 0.008, [95%CI 0.25, 1.66]), no differences emerged for females. Fronto-limbic connectivity was related to somatic complaints in childhood only for males (r = 0.673, p = 0.006). Our findings suggest that CM could have intergenerational associations to offspring brain development, yet mechanistic studies are needed.", "Keywords": ["Adversity", "infant neuroimaging", "intergenerational transmission"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Infant", "Child", "Humans", "Female", "Child, Preschool", "White Matter", "Mothers", "Brain", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Anxiety"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Lugo-Candelas", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Le", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordan D", "Last Name": "Dworkin", "Affiliation": "Federation of American Scientists Washington, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Aw", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Fields", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Reed", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marisa", "Last Name": "Spann", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle A", "Last Name": "Gilchrist", "Affiliation": "Advocate Aurora Health, Milwaukee, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walter", "Last Name": "Hinds", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "William P", "Last Name": "Fifer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Myrna", "Last Name": "Weissman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bernd Uwe", "Last Name": "Foerster", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Marina Giorgi", "Last Name": "Manin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Ivaldo", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Bradley", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ana Carolina", "Last Name": "Coelho Milani", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Gingrich", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Monk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cristiane S", "Last Name": "Duarte", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Jackowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Posner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of developmental origins of health and disease", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "37328889", "Title": "Prenatal antidepressant exposure and emotional disorders until age 22: a danish register study.", "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most frequently prescribed antidepressants in pregnancy.

We investigated whether tianeptine (TIA), which exerts its therapeutic effects through agonism of the mu-opioid receptor instead of targeting monoaminergic systems, would be more effective in this model. We found that C57BL/6J pups exposed to FLX from postnatal day 2 to 11 (PNFLX, the mouse equivalent in terms of brain development to the human third trimester) showed increased avoidant behaviors as adults that failed to improve, or were even exacerbated, by chronic SSRI treatment. By contrast, avoidant behaviors in these same mice were drastically improved following chronic treatment with TIA.

Whereas the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity (FC) measures derived from resting fMRI data have been characterized in the adult and child brain, similar assessments have not been conducted in infants. In this study, we examined the intra-session test-retest reliability of FC measures from 119 infant brain MRI scans from four neurodevelopmental studies. We investigated edge-level and subject-level reliability within one MRI session (between and within runs) measured by the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). First, using an atlas-based approach, we examined whole-brain connectivity as well as connectivity within two common resting fMRI networks - the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network (SMN). Second, we examined the influence of run duration, study site, and scanning manufacturer (e.g., Philips and General Electric) on ICCs. Lastly, we tested spatial similarity using the Jaccard Index from networks derived from independent component analysis (ICA). Consistent with resting fMRI studies from adults, our findings indicated poor edge-level reliability (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.14-0.18), but moderate-to-good subject-level intra-session reliability for whole-brain, DMN, and SMN connectivity (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.40-0.78). We also found significant effects of run duration, site, and scanning manufacturer on reliability estimates. Some ICA-derived networks showed strong spatial reproducibility (e.g., DMN, SMN, and Visual Network), and were labelled based on their spatial similarity to analogous networks measured in adults. These networks were reproducibly found across different study sites. However, other ICA-networks (e.g. Executive Control Network) did not show strong spatial reproducibility, suggesting that the reliability and/or maturational course of functional connectivity may vary by network. In sum, our findings suggest that developmental scientists may be on safe ground examining the functional organization of some major neural networks (e.g. DMN and SMN), but judicious interpretation of functional connectivity is essential to its ongoing success.", "Keywords": ["Edge-level", "ICA", "ICC", "Infant", "Jaccard Index", "Network", "Subject-level", "Test-retest reliability", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Cluster Analysis", "Connectome", "Datasets as Topic", "Default Mode Network", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Reproducibility of Results", "Rest"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walter", "Last Name": "Hinds", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cristiane S", "Last Name": "Duarte", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seonjoo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Mental Health Data Science, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Monk", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Mental Health Data Science, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Glorisa", "Last Name": "Canino", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Medical Science Campus, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ana Carolina C", "Last Name": "Milani", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Jackowski", "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Lab for Clinical Neurosciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Marina Griorgi", "Last Name": "Mamin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Bernd U", "Last Name": "Foerster", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Gingrich", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Myrna M", "Last Name": "Weissman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bradley S", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "Institute for the Developing Mind, The Saban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Semanek", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edna Acosta", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Medical Science Campus, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, USA; Graduate School of Public Health, Medical Science Campus, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eduardo", "Last Name": "Labat", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Medical Science Campus, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ioannisely Berrios", "Last Name": "Torres", "Affiliation": "Behavioral Science Research Insitute, Academic Deanship, Medical Science Campus, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivaldo", "Last Name": "Da Silva", "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Camila", "Last Name": "Parente", "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Nitamar", "Last Name": "Abdala", "Affiliation": "Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Posner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

However, the factors that influence mitochondrial biogenesis and function in neurons remain poorly elucidated. Here, we identify an important role for serotonin (5-HT) as a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in rodent cortical neurons, via a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated recruitment of the SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1 axis, which is relevant to the neuroprotective action of 5-HT. We found that 5-HT increased mitochondrial biogenesis, reflected through enhanced mtDNA levels, mitotracker staining, and expression of mitochondrial components. This resulted in higher mitochondrial respiratory capacity, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency, and a consequential increase in cellular ATP levels. Mechanistically, the effects of 5-HT were mediated via the 5-HT2A receptor and master modulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, SIRT1 and PGC-1\u03b1. SIRT1 was required to mediate the effects of 5-HT on mitochondrial biogenesis and function in cortical neurons. In vivo studies revealed that 5-HT2A receptor stimulation increased cortical mtDNA and ATP levels in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Direct infusion of 5-HT into the neocortex and chemogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons also resulted in enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and function in vivo. In cortical neurons, 5-HT enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes, decreased cellular reactive oxygen species, and exhibited neuroprotection against excitotoxic and oxidative stress, an effect that required SIRT1. These findings identify 5-HT as an upstream regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in cortical neurons and implicate the mitochondrial effects of 5-HT in its neuroprotective action.", "Keywords": ["5-HT", "5-HT2A receptor", "mitochondria", "neuronal survival", "sirtuin 1"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "Male", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mitochondria", "Neurons", "Organelle Biogenesis", "Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A", "Serotonin", "Sirtuin 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sashaina E", "Last Name": "Fanibunda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India."}, {"First Name": "Sukrita", "Last Name": "Deb", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India."}, {"First Name": "Babukrishna", "Last Name": "Maniyadath", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India."}, {"First Name": "Praachi", "Last Name": "Tiwari", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India."}, {"First Name": "Utkarsha", "Last Name": "Ghai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India."}, {"First Name": "Samir", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India."}, {"First Name": "Dwight", "Last Name": "Figueiredo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India."}, {"First Name": "Noelia", "Last Name": "Weisstaub", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience (INCyT), CONICET-Favaloro University-Institute of Cognitive Neurology (INECO), C1078AAI Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Jay A", "Last Name": "Gingrich", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ashok D B", "Last Name": "Vaidya", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Centre, Kasturba Health Society, Mumbai 400056, India."}, {"First Name": "Ullas", "Last Name": "Kolthur-Seetharam", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India; ullas@tifr.res.in vvaidya@tifr.res.in."}, {"First Name": "Vidita A", "Last Name": "Vaidya", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai 400005, India; ullas@tifr.res.in vvaidya@tifr.res.in."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2019May28"}, {"PMID": "32714597", "Title": "5-HT2A receptor loss does not alter acute fluoxetine-induced anxiety and exhibit sex-dependent regulation of cortical immediate early gene expression.", "Abstract": "Background: Acute treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (Flx), induces anxiety-like behavioral effects. The serotonin2A receptor (5-HT2A) is implicated in the modulation of anxiety-like behavior, however its contribution to the anxiogenic effects of acute Flx remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of the 5-HT2A receptor in the effects of acute Flx on anxiety-like behavior, serum corticosterone levels, neural activation and immediate early gene (IEG) expression in stress-responsive brain regions, using 5-HT2A receptor knockout (5-HT2A -/-) mice of both sexes. Methods: 5-HT2A -/- and wild-type (WT) male and female mice received a single administration of Flx or vehicle, and were examined for anxiety-like behavior, serum corticosterone levels, FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog peptide (c-Fos) positive cell numbers in stress-responsive brain regions of the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), and PFC IEG expression. Results: The increased anxiety-like behavior and enhanced corticosterone levels evoked by acute Flx were unaltered in 5-HT2A -/- mice of both sexes. 5-HT2A -/- female mice exhibited a diminished neural activation in the hypothalamus in response to acute Flx. Further, 5-HT2A -/- male, but not female, mice displayed altered baseline expression of several IEGs (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), Egr2, Egr4, FBJ osteosarcoma gene (Fos), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (Fosb), Fos-like antigen 2 (Fosl2), Homer scaffolding protein (Homer) 1-3 (Homer1-3), Jun proto-oncogene (Jun)) in the PFC. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the increased anxiety and serum corticosterone levels evoked by acute Flx are not influenced by 5-HT2A receptor deficiency.

Side effect profiles suggest that SSRIs reduce dopaminergic (DAergic) activity, but specific mechanistic insight is missing. Here we show in mice that SSRIs impair motor function by acting on 5-HT2C receptors in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), which in turn inhibits nigra pars compacta (SNc) DAergic neurons. SSRI-induced motor deficits can be reversed by systemic or SNr-localized 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. SSRIs induce SNr hyperactivity and SNc hypoactivity that can also be reversed by systemic 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. Optogenetic inhibition of SNc DAergic neurons mimics the motor deficits due to chronic SSRI treatment, whereas local SNr 5-HT2C receptor antagonism or optogenetic activation of SNc DAergic neurons reverse SSRI-induced motor deficits. Lastly, we find that 5-HT2C receptor antagonism potentiates the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of SSRIs.

In the context of central nervous system (CNS) development, such sensitive periods shape the formation of neuro-circuits that mediate, regulate, and control behavior. This general mechanism allows for development to be guided by both the genetic blueprint, as well as the environmental context. While allowing for adaptation, such sensitive periods are also windows of vulnerability during which external and internal factors can confer risk to brain disorders by derailing adaptive developmental programs. Our group has been particularly interested in developmental periods that are sensitive to serotonin (5-HT) signaling, and impact behavior and cognition relevant to psychiatry. Specifically, we review a 5-HT-sensitive period that impacts fronto-limbic system development, resulting in cognitive, anxiety, and depression-related behaviors. We discuss preclinical data to establish biological plausibility and mechanistic insights. We also summarize epidemiological findings that underscore the potential public health implications resulting from the current practice of prescribing 5-HT reuptake inhibiting antidepressants during pregnancy. These medications enter the fetal circulation, likely perturb 5-HT signaling in the brain, and may be affecting circuit maturation in ways that parallel our findings in the developing rodent brain. More research is needed to better disambiguate the dual effects of maternal symptoms on fetal and child development from the effects of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors on clinical outcomes in the offspring.

We previously reported that the nonselective 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI [1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)propan-2-amine] induced MB in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs). The goal of this study was to determine the role of 5-HT2 receptors in the regulation of mitochondrial genes and oxidative metabolism in the kidney. The 5-HT2C receptor agonist CP-809,101 [2-[(3-chlorophenyl)methoxy]-6-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine] and antagonist SB-242,084 [6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-N-[6-[(2-methyl-3-pyridinyl)oxy]-3-pyridinyl]-1H-indole-1-carboxyamide dihydrochloride] were used to examine the induction of renal mitochondrial genes and oxidative metabolism in RPTCs and in mouse kidneys in the presence and absence of the 5-HT2C receptor. Unexpectedly, both CP-809,101 and SB-242,084 increased RPTC respiration and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) mRNA expression in RPTCs at 1-10 nM. In addition, CP-809,101 and SB-242,084 increased mRNA expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and the mitochondrial proteins NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) \u03b2 subcomplex 8 in mice. These compounds increased mitochondrial genes in RPTCs in which the 5-HT2C receptor was downregulated with small interfering RNA and in the renal cortex of mice lacking the 5-HT2C receptor. By contrast, the ability of these compounds to increase PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA and respiration was blocked in RPTCs treated with 5-HT2A receptor small interfering RNA or the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist eplivanserin. In addition, the 5-HT2A receptor agonist NBOH-2C-CN [4-[2-[[(2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]amino]ethyl]-2,5-dimethoxybenzonitrile] increased RPTC respiration at 1-100 nM. These results suggest that agonism of the 5-HT2A receptor induces MB and that the classic 5-HT2C receptor agonist CP-809,101 and antagonist SB-242,084 increase mitochondrial genes and oxidative metabolism through the 5-HT2A receptor.

The serotonergic system one of the main neuromodulatory systems in the brain appears to play a role in it. The serotonin 2a receptor (5-HT2aR) one of the principal post-synaptic receptors for 5-HT in the brain, is involved in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders associated with memory deficits. Recognition memory can be defined as the ability to recognize if a particular event or item was previously encountered and is thus considered, under certain conditions, a form of episodic memory. As human data suggest that a constitutively decrease of 5-HT2A signaling might affect episodic memory performance we decided to compare the performance of mice with disrupted 5-HT2aR signaling (htr2a (-/-)) with wild type (htr2a (+/+)) littermates in different recognition memory and working memory tasks that differed in the level of proactive interference. We found that ablation of 5-HT2aR signaling throughout development produces a deficit in tasks that cannot be solved by single item strategy suggesting that 5-HT2aR signaling is involved in interference resolution.

Cocaine inhibits the re-uptake of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, and noradrenaline, whereas caffeine blocks adenosine receptors and opens ryanodine receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum. We studied how 5-HT and adenosine affected spontaneous GABAergic transmission from thalamic reticular nucleus. We combined whole-cell patch clamp recordings of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in ventrobasal thalamic neurons during local (puff) application of 5-HT in wild type (WT) or knockout mice lacking 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2A -/-). Inhibition of mIPSCs frequency by low (10 \u03bcM) and high (100 \u03bcM) 5-HT concentrations was observed in ventrobasal neurons from 5-HT2A -/- mice. In WT mice, only 100 \u03bcM 5-HT significantly reduced mIPSCs frequency. In 5-HT2A -/- mice, NAN-190, a specific 5-HT1A antagonist, prevented the 100 \u03bcM 5-HT inhibition while blocking H-currents that prolonged inhibition during post-puff periods. The inhibitory effects of 100 \u03bcM 5-HT were enhanced in cocaine binge-treated 5-HT2A -/- mice. Caffeine binge treatment did not affect 5-HT-mediated inhibition. Our findings suggest that both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors are present in pre-synaptic thalamic reticular nucleus terminals. Serotonergic-mediated inhibition of GABA release could underlie aberrant thalamocortical physiology described after repetitive consumption of cocaine. Our findings suggest that both 5-HT1A , 5-HT2A and A1 receptors are present in pre-synaptic TRN terminals. 5-HT1A and A1 receptors would down-regulate adenylate cyclase, whereas 5-HT1A would also increase the probability of the opening of G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) channels (GIRK). Sustained opening of GIRK channels would hyperpolarize pre-synaptic terminals activating H-currents, resulting in less GABA release. 5-HT2A -would activate PLC and IP3 , increasing intracellular [Ca(2+) ] and thus facilitating GABA release.", "Keywords": ["GABA", "caffeine", "cocaine", "serotonin", "thalamic reticular nucleus"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cadmium Chloride", "Caffeine", "Cocaine", "Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "In Vitro Techniques", "Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A", "Serotonin", "Serotonin Agents", "Thalamic Nuclei", "Type C Phospholipases", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bel\u00e9n", "Last Name": "Goitia", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Celular \"Dr. H\u00e9ctor Maldonado\" (DFBMC) Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Neurociencias (IFIBYNE-CONICET-UBA), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad Universitaria, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Mar\u00eda Celeste", "Last Name": "Rivero-Echeto", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Celular \"Dr. H\u00e9ctor Maldonado\" (DFBMC) Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Neurociencias (IFIBYNE-CONICET-UBA), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad Universitaria, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Noelia V", "Last Name": "Weisstaub", "Affiliation": "Grupo de Neurociencia de Sistemas, Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda y Biof\u00edsica (IFIBIO), UBA, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Jay A", "Last Name": "Gingrich", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Neuroscience, Columbia University and the NYSPI, Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edgar", "Last Name": "Garcia-Rill", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Developmental Sciences, Center for Translational Neuroscience, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ver\u00f3nica", "Last Name": "Bisagno", "Affiliation": "Facultad de Farmacia y Bioqu\u00edmica, Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacol\u00f3gicas (ININFA-UBA-CONICET), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Francisco J", "Last Name": "Urbano", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Celular \"Dr. H\u00e9ctor Maldonado\" (DFBMC) Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Instituto de Fisiolog\u00eda, Biolog\u00eda Molecular y Neurociencias (IFIBYNE-CONICET-UBA), Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad Universitaria, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurochemistry", "PubDate": "2016Feb"}, {"PMID": "25920807", "Title": "Genetic variants within the serotonin transporter associated with familial risk for major depression.", "Abstract": "The role of the serotonin transporter promoter linked polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in depression, despite much research, remains unclear.

Here we identify the period ranging from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P11 as 5-HT sensitive, with 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) blockade increasing anxiety- and depression-like behavior, and impairing fear extinction learning and memory in adult mice. Concomitantly, P2-P11 5-HTT blockade causes dendritic hypotrophy and reduced excitability of infralimbic (IL) cortex pyramidal neurons that normally promote fear extinction. By contrast, the neighboring prelimbic (PL) pyramidal neurons, which normally inhibit fear extinction, become more excitable. Excitotoxic IL but not PL lesions in adult control mice reproduce the anxiety-related phenotypes. These findings suggest that increased 5-HT signaling during P2-P11 alters adult mPFC function to increase anxiety and impair fear extinction, and imply a differential role for IL and PL neurons in regulating affective behaviors. Together, our results support a developmental mechanism for the etiology and pathophysiology of affective disorders and fear-related behaviors.", "Keywords": ["SSRI", "anxiety", "development", "mouse", "prefrontal cortex", "serotonin"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Anxiety", "Behavior, Animal", "Depression", "Extinction, Psychological", "Fear", "Female", "Male", "Mice", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Serotonin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tahilia J", "Last Name": "Rebello", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Qinghui", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Nathalie M", "Last Name": "Goodfellow", "Affiliation": "University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario ON M5S 1A8, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Martha K", "Last Name": "Caffrey Cagliostro", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Teissier", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Emanuela", "Last Name": "Morelli", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Elena Y", "Last Name": "Demireva", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Alexei", "Last Name": "Chemiakine", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Gorazd B", "Last Name": "Rosoklija", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia."}, {"First Name": "Evelyn K", "Last Name": "Lambe", "Affiliation": "University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario ON M5S 1A8, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jay A", "Last Name": "Gingrich", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and jag46@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Mark S", "Last Name": "Ansorge", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014Sep10"}, {"PMID": "24760870", "Title": "Mice with compromised 5-HTT function lack phosphotyrosine-mediated inhibitory control over prefrontal 5-HT responses.", "Abstract": "The activity of the prefrontal cortex is essential for normal emotional processing and is strongly modulated by serotonin (5-HT). Yet, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control the activity of the prefrontal 5-HT receptors. Here, we found and characterized a deregulation of prefrontal 5-HT receptor electrophysiological signaling in mouse models of disrupted serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function, a risk factor for emotional and cognitive disturbances. We identified a novel tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism that regulates 5-HT-mediated inhibition of prefrontal pyramidal neurons. We report that mice with compromised 5-HTT, resulting from either genetic deletion or brief treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during development, have amplified 5-HT1A receptor-mediated currents in adulthood. These greater inhibitory effects of 5-HT are accompanied by enhanced downstream coupling to Kir3 channels. Notably, in normal wild-type mice, we found that these larger 5-HT1A responses can be mimicked through inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases. By comparison, in our 5-HTT mouse models, the larger 5-HT1A responses were rapidly reduced through inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Our findings implicate tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating the electrophysiological effects of prefrontal 5-HT1A receptors with implications for neuropsychiatric diseases associated with emotional dysfunction, such as anxiety and depressive disorders.", "Keywords": ["5-HT transporter", "5-HT1a receptor", "Kir3.1", "prefrontal cortex", "serotonin", "tyrosine phosphorylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Female", "Inhibition, Psychological", "Male", "Mice", "Phosphorylation", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Pyramidal Cells", "Serotonin", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nathalie M", "Last Name": "Goodfellow", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, and Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Derya", "Last Name": "Sargin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark S", "Last Name": "Ansorge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jay A", "Last Name": "Gingrich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Evelyn K", "Last Name": "Lambe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014Apr23"}]
