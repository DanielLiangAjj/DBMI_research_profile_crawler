Therefore, we sought to further validate and translate these findings into patient care by coupling the anti-TNF-\u03b1 drug certolizumab pegol with standard cisplatin doublet chemotherapy. Here we first validate the anti-metastatic effect of certolizumab in a liver-metastatic Lewis Lung Carcinoma model. We then evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamic effects of certolizumab with cisplatin and pemetrexed in an open label Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02120807) of eighteen adult patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas. The primary outcome is maximum tolerated dose. Secondary outcomes are response rate and progression-free survival (PFS); pharmacodynamic changes in blood and tumor are evaluated as a correlative outcome. There were nine partial responses among 16 patients evaluable (56%, 95% CI 30 to 80%). The median duration of response was 9.0 months (range 5.9 to 42.6 months) and median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI 6.3 to NR). The standard 400\u2009mg dose of certolizumab, added to cisplatin and pemetrexed, is well-tolerated and, as a correlative endpoint, demonstrates potent pharmacodynamic inhibition of peripheral cytokines associated with the paracrine inflammatory loop.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Adenocarcinoma of Lung", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Certolizumab Pegol", "Cisplatin", "Lung Neoplasms", "Pemetrexed", "Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul K", "Last Name": "Paik", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. paikp@mskcc.org."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ni", "Last Name": "Ai", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anup", "Last Name": "Biswas", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Coker", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wanchao", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phillip", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darren J", "Last Name": "Buonocore", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Victoria", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jamie E", "Last Name": "Chaft", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Swarnali", "Last Name": "Acharyya", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Massagu\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark G", "Last Name": "Kris", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2022Oct15"}, {"PMID": "35078784", "Title": "Targeting S100A9-ALDH1A1-Retinoic Acid Signaling to Suppress Brain Relapse in EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer.", "Abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib has significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, including those with brain metastases.

Although osimertinib-refractory brain relapse is a major clinical challenge, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using metastatic models of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we show that cancer cells expressing high intracellular S100A9 escape osimertinib and initiate brain relapses. Mechanistically, S100A9 upregulates ALDH1A1 expression and activates the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway in osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. We demonstrate that the genetic repression of S100A9, ALDH1A1, or RA receptors (RAR) in cancer cells, or treatment with a pan-RAR antagonist, dramatically reduces brain metastasis. Importantly, S100A9 expression in cancer cells correlates with poor PFS in osimertinib-treated patients.

Since there are no available treatments for cachexia, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms that drive cachexia in order to devise effective strategies to treat it. Although 25% of metastatic breast cancer patients develop symptoms of muscle wasting, mechanistic studies of breast cancer cachexia have been hampered by a lack of experimental models. Using tumor cells deficient for BARD1, a subunit of the BRCA1/BARD1 tumor suppressor complex, we have developed a new orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer that spontaneously metastasizes to the lung and leads to systemic muscle deterioration. We show that expression of the metal-ion transporter, Zip14, is markedly upregulated in cachectic muscles from these mice and is associated with elevated intramuscular zinc and iron levels.

However, the incidence of cachexia in breast cancer is now thought to be largely underestimated. In our case report of a breast cancer patient with bone metastasis monitored during the course of her treatment, we document the development of cachexia by image analysis in relation to her metastatic burden. Elucidation of the link between metastatic burden and cachexia could unveil a highly specific screening process for metastasis, by assessing true muscle mass loss. Our patient was a 49-year-old premenopausal woman, with metastatic invasive ductal breast carcinoma in the vertebral and iliac bones on presentation, which progressed with new metastases to her hips, thigh bones, and vertebrae. In the two-year period, that is between her diagnosis and death, she lost >10% of her baseline weight. During these two years, we retrospectively identified a decrease in paraspinal muscle (PM) at the third lumbar vertebra followed by a sharp decline in weight. The increased tumor burden over time in metastatic sites was accompanied by a decrease in abdominal muscle and visceral and subcutaneous fat and was followed by the patient's demise. The increasing tumor burden in the patient was correlated with the mass of other tissues to determine the tissue that could best serve as a surrogate marker to cachexia and tumor burden. We noted a strong negative correlation between PM area and metastatic tumor area at the third lumbar vertebral level, with PM loss correlating to increasing tumor burden. The monitoring of PM wasting may serve as a marker, and therefore a prognostic factor, for both cachexia and extent of metastatic disease, especially in breast cancer, where metastasis to bone is frequent. Based on our data and review of the literature in this case study, longitudinal monitoring of cachexia in the selected muscle groups can give clinicians early indications of the extent of cachexia in metastatic breast cancer patients.", "Keywords": ["bone metastasis", "breast cancer", "cachexia", "radiological quantification", "vertebral metastasis", "weight loss"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nikita", "Last Name": "Consul", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Xiaotao", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Coker", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Lopez-Pintado", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanina", "Last Name": "Hibshoosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Binsheng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Kalinsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Swarnali", "Last Name": "Acharyya", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Clinical Medicine Insights.

We retrospectively investigated the clinical association between cachexia, tumor characteristics (such as metastatic burden and mutational status), and treatment in lung cancer patients. The medical records of 394 lung cancer patients from two institutions (Columbia University, USA and Tohoku University, Japan) were reviewed. Information collected included the presence of cachexia, histologic subtype, tumor stage, number of metastases, mutation status, treatment, and survival. Descriptive statistics were performed. Only stage IV patients exhibited >5% weight loss (0.8%, 2.2%, 3.6%, and 5.1%, for stages I to IV; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). Patients with metastases developed cachexia more often than patients without metastases independent of treatment (6.0% and 7.1% weight loss in patients with metastases vs. 2.5% and 2.0% in patients without metastases, before [P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001] and after [P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001] treatment, respectively). The change in number of metastatic sites over time correlated with increasing weight loss (5.2%, 10.6%, 13.4%, and 13.4%, for an increase of 0, 1, 2, and \u22653 metastatic sites, from initial diagnosis to the endpoint; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Patients with cachexia had worse survival than patients without cachexia (hazard ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 2.08-4.16; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

Efforts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of muscle loss have predominantly focused on events intrinsic to the myofiber. In contrast, less regard has been given to potential contributory factors outside the fiber within the muscle microenvironment. In tumor-bearing mice and patients with pancreatic cancer, we found that cachexia was associated with a type of muscle damage resulting in activation of both satellite and nonsatellite muscle progenitor cells. These muscle progenitors committed to a myogenic program, but were inhibited from completing differentiation by an event linked with persistent expression of the self-renewing factor Pax7. Overexpression of Pax7 was sufficient to induce atrophy in normal muscle, while under tumor conditions, the reduction of Pax7 or exogenous addition of its downstream target, MyoD, reversed wasting by restoring cell differentiation and fusion with injured fibers. Furthermore, Pax7 was induced by serum factors from cachectic mice and patients, in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner, both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results suggest that Pax7 responds to NF-\u03baB by impairing the regenerative capacity of myogenic cells in the muscle microenvironment to drive muscle wasting in cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Animals", "Cachexia", "Case-Control Studies", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred mdx", "Mice, Nude", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Development", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Myoblasts, Skeletal", "NF-kappa B", "PAX7 Transcription Factor", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Satellite Cells, Skeletal Muscle", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei A", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emanuele", "Last Name": "Berardi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Veronica M", "Last Name": "Cardillo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Swarnali", "Last Name": "Acharyya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Aulino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Thomas-Ahner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jingxin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Bloomston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Muscarella", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Nau", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nilay", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew E R", "Last Name": "Butchbach", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Ladner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sergio", "Last Name": "Adamo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Rudnicki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Keller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dario", "Last Name": "Coletti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Federica", "Last Name": "Montanaro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Denis C", "Last Name": "Guttridge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2013Nov"}, {"PMID": "23634980", "Title": "Activating mutations and senescence secretome: new insights into HER2 activation, drug sensitivity and metastatic progression.", "Abstract": "HER2 amplification and overexpression is observed in approximately 20% of breast cancers and is strongly associated with poor prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness to HER2 targeted agents.
