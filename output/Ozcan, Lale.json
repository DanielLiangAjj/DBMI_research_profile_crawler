Specifically, we report that Rap1a activity is decreased in the livers of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and mouse models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH. Restoring hepatic Rap1a activity by overexpressing a constitutively active mutant form of Rap1a lowered the mature, processed form of lipogenic transcription factor, Srebp1, without an effect on the unprocessed Srebp1 and suppressed hepatic TG accumulation, whereas liver Rap1a deficiency increased Srebp1 processing and exacerbated steatosis.

In proof-of-principle studies, we found that treatment of obese mice with a small molecule activator of Rap1a (8-pCPT) or inhibiting Rap1a's endogenous inhibitor, Rap1Gap, recapitulated our hepatic gain-of-function model and resulted in improved hepatic steatosis and lowered lipogenic genes.

To understand tPA-PAI-1 regulation in obesity, we focused on hepatocytes, a functionally important source of tPA and PAI-1 that sense obesity-induced metabolic stress. We showed that obese mice, like humans, had reduced fibrinolysis and increased plasma PAI-1 and tPA, due largely to their increased hepatocyte expression. A decrease in the PAI-1 (SERPINE1) gene corepressor Rev-Erb\u03b1 increased PAI-1, which then increased the tPA gene PLAT via a PAI-1/LRP1/PKA/p-CREB1 pathway.

As a result, HDAC4-mediated SUMOylation of the corepressor DACH1 is decreased, which protects DACH1 from proteasomal degradation. DACH1, together with nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), represses Atf6 transcription, leading to activation of the PERK-TRB3 pathway and defective insulin signaling. DACH1 is increased in the livers of obese mice and humans, and treatment of obese mice with liver-targeted constitutively nuclear HDAC4 or DACH1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) increases ATF6, improves hepatocyte insulin signaling, and protects against hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

VAT CD11c+ cells from Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl vs. control Myd88fl/fl mice were defective in activating T cells in vitro, and VAT T and B cell activation was markedly reduced in Cd11cCre+Myd88fl/fl obese mice.

At the hub of this new pathway is a kinase cascade involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), p38\u03b1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPKAPK2/3 (MK2/3).

The balance of arachidonic acid-derived mediators in leukocytes is thought to be achieved through intracellular localization of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX): nuclear 5-LOX favors the biosynthesis of proinflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB4), whereas, in theory, cytoplasmic 5-LOX could favor the biosynthesis of proresolving lipoxin A4 (LXA4). This balance is shifted in favor of LXA4 by resolvin D1 (RvD1), a specialized proresolving mediator derived from docosahexaenoic acid, but the mechanism is not known. Here we report a new pathway through which RvD1 promotes nuclear exclusion of 5-LOX and thereby suppresses LTB4 and enhances LXA4 in macrophages. RvD1, by activating its receptor formyl peptide receptor2/lipoxin A4 receptor, suppresses cytosolic calcium and decreases activation of the calcium-sensitive kinase calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII inhibition suppresses activation P38 and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 kinases, which reduces Ser271 phosphorylation of 5-LOX and shifts 5-LOX from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As such, RvD1's ability to decrease nuclear 5-LOX and the LTB4:LXA4 ratio in vitro and in vivo was mimicked by macrophages lacking CaMKII or expressing S271A-5-LOX. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how a specialized proresolving mediator from the docosahexaenoic acid pathway shifts the balance toward resolution in the arachidonic acid pathway.

We now report a major role for hepatic CaMKII, a calcium-responsive kinase that is activated in obesity. Genetic targeting of hepatic CaMKII, its downstream mediator p38, or the p38 substrate and stabilizer MK2 enhances insulin-induced p-Akt in palmitate-treated hepatocytes and obese mouse liver, leading to metabolic improvement. The mechanism of improvement begins with induction of ATF6 and the ATF6 target p58(IPK), a chaperone that suppresses the PERK-p-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 branch of the UPR. The result is a decrease in the ATF4 target TRB3, an inhibitor of insulin-induced p-Akt, leading to enhanced activation of Akt and its\u00a0downstream metabolic mediators. These findings increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking obesity to selective insulin resistance and suggest new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Cells, Cultured", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Insulin", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Obese", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14", "Obesity", "Palmitates", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lale", "Last Name": "Ozcan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.
