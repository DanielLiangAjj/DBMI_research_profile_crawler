[{"PMID": "38876367", "Title": "Why partial heart transplantation could be regulated as organ transplantation.", "Abstract": "Partial heart transplant (PHT) is a recent clinical innovation involving the transplantation of a segment of the heart (valves) directly from the deceased donor into the recipient patient. This procedure holds out the possibility of significant benefit, especially for pediatric patients because these grafts show growth potential after transplant, reducing or eliminating the current need for repeat procedures. The clinical process for donation and transplant of partial heart (PH) grafts generally follows an organ clinical pathway; however, the Food and Drug Administration has recently stated its intent to regulate PH as tissues, raising a host of regulatory considerations. PHT requires donor testing and eligibility determinations within a short, clinically viable timeframe and, similar to organ transplant, involves donor-recipient matching. Waitlist allocation policies that are a regulatory focus of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network including equity and efficiency may become relevant. Oversight of PHT by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network could be accomplished through interpretation of the vascular composite allograft definition or through designation by the US Department of Health and Human Services of PH grafts as organs. While some clinical questions remain unanswered, it is important to carefully address these regulatory considerations to support the emergence of this innovation and ensure the continued trust of the donating public and the patients who may benefit from PHT.", "Keywords": ["FDA", "OPTN policy", "heart transplant", "organ donation", "partial heart transplant", "regulation", "tissue graft"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandra K", "Last Name": "Glazier", "Affiliation": "New England Donor Services, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA; Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.

Securing the inflow segment presents some difficulty owing to the lack of circumferential myocardium in the left ventricular outflow tract. This method addresses that issue by securing the inflow segment using the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and then suturing the left ventricular free wall around the inflow fixture. The outflow segment is secured simply by inserting the fixture into an incision in the superior aspect of the aortic arch. We found that specimens had significantly different hydrodynamic properties before and after tissue fixation. This finding induced us to use fresh specimens in our testing and should be considered when using this method. In our work, we used this method to test novel intracardiac patch materials for use in the valvular position by performing an aortic valve neocuspidization procedure (Ozaki procedure) on the mounted porcine aortic valves.

The valve leaflets are designed with an increased coaptation area to preserve valve competence at expanded diameters.

Compared to the commercialized materials, our BMMs exhibited an anisotropic behavior and a closer mechanical performance to the aortic leaflets.

However, its causes remain mainly unknown, with only up to 15% of CHD cases having a determined genetic cause. Exploring the complex relationship between genetics and environmental exposures is key in understanding the multifactorial nature of the development of CHD. Multiple population-level association studies have been conducted on maternal environmental exposures and their association with CHD, including evaluating the effect of maternal disease, medication exposure, environmental pollution, and tobacco and alcohol use on the incidence of CHD. However, these studies have been done in a siloed manner, with few examining the interplay between multiple environmental exposures. Here, we broadly and qualitatively review the current literature on maternal and paternal prenatal exposures and their association with CHD. We propose using the framework of the emerging field of the exposome, the environmental complement to the genome, to review all internal and external prenatal environmental exposures and identify potentiating or alleviating synergy between exposures.

The prosthetic valved conduit may be expanded to a larger permanent diameter in vivo via subsequent transcatheter balloon dilation procedures. While multiple expandable prosthetic heart valves are currently at different stages of development, this work is focused on one particular design in which a stent is situated inside of an expandable polymeric valved conduit. Since the valve and conduit must be joined with a robust manufacturing technique, a polymeric glue layer is inserted between the two, which results in radial retraction of the valved region after expansion. Design of an appropriate stent is proposed to counteract this phenomenon and maintain the desired permanent diameter throughout the device after a single non-compliant balloon dilation procedure. The finite element method is used to compute performance metrics related to the permanent expansion diameter and required radial force. Additionally, failure due not only to high cycle fatigue but also due to ductile fracture is incorporated into the design study through the use of an existing ductile fracture criterion for metals. Surrogate models are constructed with the results of the high fidelity simulations and are subsequently used to numerically obtain a set of Pareto-optimal stent designs.

We used a risk difference analysis in a retrospective cohort, 2006-2016. Neonates born\u2009\u2264\u20092.0\u00a0kg undergoing congenital heart surgery during initial postnatal admission were included. Data were standardized alternatingly for birth weight and cardiac surgical risk using national population data to estimate the number of deaths expected had they not required cardiac surgery or were they of normal weight. Of 105 neonates\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00a0kg, median birth weight was 1.6\u00a0kg (IQR 1.3-1.8\u00a0kg). Median gestational age was 33\u00a0weeks (IQR 31-35\u00a0weeks).

Here, we review the various experimental methods that have been employed to probe this intricate microstructure and which attempt to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the leaflet's mechanical properties. These methods include uniaxial, biaxial, and flexural tests, coupled with microstructural characterization techniques such as small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), small angle light scattering (SALS), and polarized light microscopy. These experiments have revealed complex elastic and viscoelastic mechanisms that are highly directional and dependent upon loading conditions and biochemistry. Of all engineering materials, polymers and polymer-based composites are best able to mimic the tissue-level mechanical behavior of the native leaflet. This similarity to native tissue permits the fabrication of polymeric valves with physiological flow patterns, reducing the risk of thrombosis compared to mechanical valves and in some cases surpassing the in vivo durability of bioprosthetic valves. Earlier work on polymeric valves simply assumed the mechanical properties of the polymer material to be linear elastic, while more recent studies have considered the full hyperelastic stress-strain response. These material models have been incorporated into computational models for the optimization of valve geometry, with the goal of minimizing internal stresses and improving durability. The latter portion of this review recounts these developments in polymeric heart valves, with a focus on mechanical testing of polymers, valve geometry, and manufacturing methods.", "Keywords": ["Mechanical testing", "Mechanobiology", "Native heart valves", "Polymeric heart valves", "Soft tissue mechanics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Heart Valves", "Humans", "Polymers", "Prosthesis Design", "Stress, Mechanical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Richard L", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Division of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Section of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery, New-York Presbyterian - Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Russ", "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Costas", "Last Name": "Paschalides", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haim", "Last Name": "Waisman", "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey W", "Last Name": "Kysar", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

The high survival rate of these patients into adulthood has exposed the alarming prevalence of long-term neuropsychological and psychiatric morbidities. Dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) is one of the most extensively studied cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD) with regard to neurodevelopmental outcomes. Landmark studies have described a common neurodevelopmental and behavioral phenotype associated with d-TGA. Children with d-TGA display impairments in key neurocognitive areas, including visual-spatial and fine motor abilities, executive functioning, processing speed, and social cognition. As they grow older, they may face additional challenges with a worsening of deficits in higher order cognitive skills, problems in psychosocial adjustment and a higher-than-expected rate of psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety. The aim of this review is to summarize the available recent data on neuropsychological and psychiatric outcomes in individuals with d-TGA after the arterial switch operation. We present findings within a life-span perspective, with a particular emphasis on the emerging literature on adolescent and young adult outcomes. Finally, we propose avenues for future research in the CHD adult neuropsychology field. Among these avenues, we explore the potential mechanisms by which pediatric neurodevelopmental impairments may have lifelong adverse effects as well as alternative interventions that could optimize outcomes.", "Keywords": ["cognitive", "dextro-transposition of the great arteries", "executive function", "neuropsychological outcomes", "open-heart surgery", "psychiatric disorders"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leila", "Last Name": "Kasmi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Psychopathology and Neuropsychology, Department of Psychology, University Paris 8, Paris Lumi\u00e8res - CNRS , Saint-Denis , France."}, {"First Name": "Damien", "Last Name": "Bonnet", "Affiliation": "Referral Center for Complex Congenital Cardiac Malformations, Department of Congenital and Pediatric Cardiology, Necker Hospital, University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 , Paris , France."}, {"First Name": "Mich\u00e8le", "Last Name": "Montreuil", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Psychopathology and Neuropsychology, Department of Psychology, University Paris 8, Paris Lumi\u00e8res - CNRS , Saint-Denis , France."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kalfa", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic, and Vascular Surgery, Section of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University , New York, NY , USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikoletta", "Last Name": "Geronikola", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Psychopathology and Neuropsychology, Department of Psychology, University Paris 8, Paris Lumi\u00e8res - CNRS , Saint-Denis , France."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Bellinger", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Johanna", "Last Name": "Calderon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School , Boston, MA , USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28164031", "Title": "Postoperative pulmonary artery stenosis: current options and future directions.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kalfa", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital - NewYork-Presbyterian, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Translational pediatrics", "PubDate": "2017Jan"}, {"PMID": "27938905", "Title": "The effects of postoperative hematocrit on shunt occlusion for neonates undergoing single ventricle palliation.", "Abstract": "Our primary objective was to test the effects of first postoperative hematocrit on early shunt occlusion for children undergoing systemic to pulmonary artery shunt placement.

By and large, the same results were found in pediatric cardiac surgery, for which a more thorough analysis has shown that this relationship depends on case complexity and type of surgical procedures. Lower-volume programs tend to underperform larger-volume programs as case complexity increases. High-volume pediatric cardiac surgeons also tend to have better results than low-volume surgeons, especially at the more complex end of the surgery spectrum (e.g., the Norwood procedure). Nevertheless, this trend for lower mortality rates at larger centers is not universal. All larger programs do not perform better than all smaller programs. Moreover, surgical volume seems to account for only a small proportion of the overall between-center variation in outcome. Intraoperative technical performance is one of the most important parts, if not the most important part, of the therapeutic process and a critical component of postoperative outcome. Thus, the use of center-specific, risk-adjusted outcome as a tool for quality assessment together with monitoring of technical performance using a specific score may be more reliable than relying on volume alone.
