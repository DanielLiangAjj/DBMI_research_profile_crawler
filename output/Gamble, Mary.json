Inorganic (AsIII, AsV) and organic (monomethylarsonous acid [MMAs], dimethylarsinous Acid [DMAs]) As species were measured in blood and urine collected at baseline and at 12 weeks.

Associations of blood and urinary As with 170 confirmed metabolites and >26,000 untargeted spectral features were modeled using a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) approach. Models were adjusted for age, sex, visit, and BMI and corrected for false discovery rate (FDR). In the MWAS screening of confirmed metabolites, 17 were associated with \u22651 blood As species (FDR<0.05), including fatty acids, neurotransmitter metabolites, and amino acids. These results were consistent across blood As species and between blood and urine As. Untargeted MWAS identified 423 spectral features associated with \u22651 blood As species. Unlike the confirmed metabolites, untargeted model results were not consistent across As species, with AsV and DMAs showing distinct association patterns. Mummichog pathway analysis revealed 12 enriched metabolic pathways that overlapped with the 17 identified metabolites, including one carbon metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and purine metabolism.

Methylation of iAs helps facilitate excretion of arsenic in urine, with DMA composing the majority of arsenic species excreted. Past studies have identified genetic variation in the AS3MT (10q24.32) and FTCD (21q22.3) regions associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME), measured as the proportion of each species present in urine (iAs%, MMA%, and DMA%), but their association with arsenic species present in blood has not been examined.

We confirm that the genetic variants in AS3MT and FTCD known to effect arsenic species composition in urine (an excreted byproduct of metabolism) have similar effects on arsenic species in blood (a tissue type that directly interacts with many organs, including those prone to arsenic toxicity).

For these populations, food, especially rice, is a major source of exposure. We investigated associations of rice intake, a marker of arsenic exposure, with subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) markers in a multiethnic population. Methods and Results Between 2000 and 2002, MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) enrolled 6814 adults without clinical CVD. We included 5050 participants with baseline data on rice intake and markers of 3 CVD domains: inflammation (hsCRP [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein], interleukin-6, and fibrinogen), vascular function (aortic distensibility, carotid distensibility, and brachial flow-mediated dilation), and subclinical atherosclerosis at 3 vascular sites (carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcification, and ankle-brachial index). We also evaluated endothelial-related biomarkers previously associated with arsenic. Rice intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Urinary arsenic was measured in 310 participants. A total of 13% of participants consumed \u22651\u00a0serving of rice/day. Compared with individuals consuming <1\u00a0serving of rice/week, \u22651\u00a0serving of rice/day was not associated with subclinical markers after demographic, lifestyle, and CVD risk factor adjustment (eg, geometric mean ratio [95% CI] for hsCRP, 0.98 [0.86-1.11]; aortic distensibility, 0.99 [0.91-1.07]; and carotid intima-media thickness, 0.98 [0.91-1.06]). Associations with urinary arsenic were similar to those for rice intake. Conclusions Rice intake was not associated with subclinical CVD markers in a multiethnic US population.

metabolism and toxicity phenotypes in Bangladesh.", "Abstract": "Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a carcinogen, and exposure to iAs via food and water is a global public health problem. iAs-contaminated drinking water alone affects >100 million people worldwide, including ~50 million in Bangladesh. Once absorbed into the blood stream, most iAs is converted to mono-methylated (MMA) and then di-methylated (DMA) forms, facilitating excretion in urine. Arsenic metabolism efficiency varies among individuals, in part due to genetic variation near AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32). To identify additional arsenic metabolism loci, we measured protein-coding variants across the human exome for 1,660 Bangladeshi individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Among the 19,992 coding variants analyzed exome-wide, the minor allele (A) of rs61735836 (p.Val101Met) in exon 3 of FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) was associated with increased urinary iAs% (P = 8x10-13), increased MMA% (P = 2x10-16) and decreased DMA% (P = 6x10-23). Among 2,401 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions (an indicator of arsenic toxicity and cancer risk) and 2,472 controls, carrying the low-efficiency A allele (frequency = 7%) was associated with increased skin lesion risk (odds ratio = 1.35; P = 1x10-5). rs61735836 is in weak linkage disequilibrium with all nearby variants. The high-efficiency/major allele (G/Valine) is human-specific and eliminates a start codon at the first 5\u00b4-proximal Kozak sequence in FTCD, suggesting selection against an alternative translation start site. FTCD is critical for catabolism of histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In our study population, FTCD and AS3MT SNPs together explain ~10% of the variation in DMA% and support a causal effect of arsenic metabolism efficiency on arsenic toxicity (i.e., skin lesions). In summary, this work identifies a coding variant in FTCD associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency, providing new evidence supporting the established link between one-carbon/folate metabolism and arsenic toxicity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alleles", "Ammonia-Lyases", "Arsenic", "Arsenic Poisoning", "Bangladesh", "Environmental Exposure", "Female", "Folic Acid", "Gene Frequency", "Glutamate Formimidoyltransferase", "Humans", "Male", "Methylation", "Methyltransferases", "Multifunctional Enzymes", "Mutation, Missense", "Odds Ratio", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Skin Diseases", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brandon L", "Last Name": "Pierce", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Dean", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Argos", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Farzana", "Last Name": "Jasmine", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Rakibuz-Zaman", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Golam", "Last Name": "Sarwar", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Md Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Hasan", "Last Name": "Shahriar", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Mahfuzar", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Md", "Last Name": "Yunus", "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Vincent J", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Devin", "Last Name": "Oglesbee", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad G", "Last Name": "Kibriya", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mary V", "Last Name": "Gamble", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Habibul", "Last Name": "Ahsan", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2019Mar"}, {"PMID": "30590411", "Title": "Folic acid supplementation enhances arsenic methylation: results from a folic acid and creatine supplementation randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh.", "Abstract": "Arsenic exposure through drinking water persists in many regions.

Thus, exploring preventive measures of environmental exposure and disease risk through new paradigms of environmental toxicology, optimal and/or healthful nutrition and health is essential. For example, folic acid supplementation can lower blood arsenic levels, and plant-derived bioactive nutrients can lower cardiovascular and cancer risks linked to pollutant exposure. Data also indicate that diets enriched with bioactive food components such as polyphenols and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can prevent or decrease toxicant-induced inflammation. Thus, consuming healthy diets that exhibit high levels of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, is a meaningful way to reduce the vulnerability to non-communicable diseases linked to environmental toxic insults. This nutritional paradigm in environmental toxicology requires further study in order to improve our understanding of the relationship between nutrition or other lifestyle modifications and toxicant-induced diseases. Understanding mechanistic relationships between nutritional modulation of environmental toxicants and susceptibility to disease development are important for both cumulative risk assessment and the design and implementation of future public health programs and behavioral interventions.", "Keywords": ["bioactive foods", "environmental pollutants", "inflammatory diseases"], "MeSH terms": ["Environmental Exposure", "Humans", "Noncommunicable Diseases", "Nutritional Status"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bernhard", "Last Name": "Hennig", "Affiliation": "University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Petriello", "Affiliation": "University of Kentucky Superfund Research Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary V", "Last Name": "Gamble", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Young-Joon", "Last Name": "Surh", "Affiliation": "Tumor Microenvironment Global Core Research Center, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742 08826, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Laura A", "Last Name": "Kresty", "Affiliation": "Section of Thoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norbert", "Last Name": "Frank", "Affiliation": "German Cancer Research Center, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nuchanart", "Last Name": "Rangkadilok", "Affiliation": "Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "Mathuros", "Last Name": "Ruchirawat", "Affiliation": "Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok 10210, Thailand."}, {"First Name": "William A", "Last Name": "Suk", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA."}], "Journal": "Reviews on environmental health", "PubDate": "2018Mar28"}, {"PMID": "28593503", "Title": "Global Level of Plasma DNA Methylation is Associated with Overall Survival in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.", "Abstract": "The impact of folate deficiency on global DNA methylation is uncertain.

Arsenic-induced epigenetic dysregulation may contribute to arsenic toxicity. Although there are several reviews on arsenic and epigenetics, these have largely focused on DNA methylation. Here, we review investigations of the effects of arsenic on global levels of histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Multiple studies have observed that arsenic induces higher levels of H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and also higher levels of H3 serine 10 phosphorylation (H3S10ph), which regulate chromosome segregation. In contrast, arsenic causes a global loss of H4K16ac, a histone PTM that is a hallmark of human cancers. Although the findings for other histone PTMs have not been entirely consistent across studies, we discuss biological factors which may contribute to these inconsistencies, including differences in the dose, duration, and type of arsenic species examined; the tissue or cell line evaluated; differences by sex; and exposure timing. We also discuss two important considerations for the measurement of histone PTMs: proteolytic cleavage of histones and arsenic-induced alterations in histone expression.", "Keywords": ["Arsenic", "Histone\u00a0posttranslational\u00a0modifications"], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Animals", "Arsenic", "Environmental Exposure", "Environmental Pollutants", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase", "Histones", "Humans", "Methylation", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caitlin G", "Last Name": "Howe", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 11th Floor, 722 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary V", "Last Name": "Gamble", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 11th Floor, 722 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. mvg7@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Current environmental health reports", "PubDate": "2016Sep"}, {"PMID": "27135575", "Title": "Provision of well-water treatment units to 600 households in Bangladesh: A longitudinal analysis of urinary arsenic indicates fading utility.", "Abstract": "Millions of villagers in Bangladesh remain exposed to high levels of arsenic (As) from drinking untreated well-water even though the scale of the problem was recognized 15years ago.

Our first objective for this paper was to examine the potential renal toxicity of As exposure in Bangladesh. Our second objective relates to examining whether the previously reported positive association between urinary creatinine (uCrn) and As methylation may be explained by renal function. We had hypothesized that these associations relate to supply and demand for s-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor for both creatine synthesis and As methylation. Alternatively, renal function could influence both As and creatinine excretion, or the As metabolites may influence renal function, which in turn influences uCrn. We conducted a cross-sectional study (N\u200a=\u200a478) of adults, composed of a sample recruited in 2001 and a sample recruited in 2003. We assessed renal function using plasma cystatin C, and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Consistent with renal toxicity of As, log-uAs had a marginal inverse association with eGFR in the 2003 sample (b\u200a=\u200a-5.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.07), however this association was not significant in the 2001 sample (b\u200a=\u200a-1.9, p\u200a=\u200a0.24). Adjustment for eGFR did not alter the associations between uCrn and the %uAs metabolites, indicating that GFR does not explain these associations. Increased eGFR was associated with increased odds of having %uInAs >12.2% (2001: OR\u200a=\u200a1.01, 95%CI (1.00,1.03); 2003: OR\u200a=\u200a1.04, 95%CI (1.01,1.07)). In the 2003 sample only, there was a negative association between eGFR and %uDMA (b\u200a=\u200a-0.08, p\u200a=\u200a0.02). These results may indicate differential effects of renal function on excretion of InAs and DMA. Alternatively, a certain methylation pattern, involving decreased %InAs and increased %DMA, may reduce renal function. Given that these studies were cross-sectional, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.

Although glutathione (GSH), the primary endogenous antioxidant, is not required for As methylation, GSH stimulates As methylation rates in vitro. However, the relationship between GSH redox and As methylation capacity in humans is unknown. We wished to test the hypothesis that a more oxidized plasma GSH redox status is associated with decreased As methylation capacity and examine whether these associations are modified by folate nutritional status. Concentrations of plasma GSH and GSSG, plasma folate, total blood As (bAs), total urinary As (uAs), and uAs metabolites were assessed in a cross-sectional study of n=376 Bangladeshi adults who were chronically exposed to As in drinking water.

InAs undergoes hepatic methylation to form mono- and dimethyl arsenical species (MMA and DMA, respectively), facilitating arsenic elimination. Both reactions are catalyzed by arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor, yielding the methylated product and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a potent product-inhibitor of AS3MT. SAM biosynthesis depends on folate- and cobalamin-dependent one-carbon metabolism. With the use of samples from 353 participants in the Folate and Oxidative Stress Study, our objective was to test the hypotheses that blood SAM and SAH concentrations are associated with arsenic methylation and that these associations differ by folate and cobalamin nutritional status. Blood SAM and SAH were measured by HPLC. Arsenic metabolites in blood and urine were measured by HPLC coupled to dynamic reaction cell inductively coupled plasma MS. In linear regression analyses, SAH was not associated with any of the arsenic metabolites. However, log(SAM) was negatively associated with log(% urinary InAs) (\u03b2: -0.11; 95% CI: -0.19, -0.02; P = 0.01), and folate and cobalamin nutritional status significantly modified associations between SAM and percentage of blood MMA (%bMMA) and percentage of blood DMA (%bDMA) (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). In folate- and cobalamin-deficient individuals, log(SAM) was positively associated with %bMMA (\u03b2: 6.96; 95% CI: 1.86, 12.05; P < 0.01) and negatively associated with %bDMA (\u03b2: -6.19; 95% CI: -12.71, 0.32; P = 0.06). These findings suggest that when exposure to InAs is high, and methyl groups are limiting, SAM is used primarily for MMA synthesis rather than for DMA synthesis, contributing additional evidence that nutritional status may explain some of the interindividual differences in arsenic metabolism and, consequently, susceptibility to arsenic toxicity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arsenic", "Arsenic Poisoning", "Arsenicals", "Bangladesh", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drinking Water", "Environmental Exposure", "Female", "Folic Acid", "Homocysteine", "Humans", "Male", "Methylation", "Middle Aged", "Oxidative Stress", "S-Adenosylhomocysteine", "S-Adenosylmethionine", "Vitamin B 12"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caitlin G", "Last Name": "Howe", "Affiliation": "Departments of Environmental Health Sciences."}, {"First Name": "Megan M", "Last Name": "Niedzwiecki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan N", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xinhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vesna", "Last Name": "Ilievski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vesna", "Last Name": "Slavkovich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shafiul", "Last Name": "Alam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abu B", "Last Name": "Siddique", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary V", "Last Name": "Gamble", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of nutrition", "PubDate": "2014May"}, {"PMID": "24536095", "Title": "Arsenic metabolism efficiency has a causal role in arsenic toxicity: Mendelian randomization and gene-environment interaction.", "Abstract": "Arsenic exposure through drinking water is a serious global health issue.

Enzymes involved in DNA methylation, including DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, may show altered activity under oxidized cellular conditions. Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that glutathione (GSH) depletion leads to global DNA hypomethylation, possibly through the depletion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). We tested the hypothesis that a more oxidized blood GSH redox status is associated with decreased global peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA methylation in a sample of Bangladeshi adults. Global PBMC DNA methylation and whole blood GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and SAM concentrations were measured in 320 adults. DNA methylation was measured by using the [ (3)H]-methyl incorporation assay; values are inversely related to global DNA methylation. Whole blood GSH redox status (Eh) was calculated using the Nernst equation. We found that a more oxidized blood GSH Eh was associated with decreased global DNA methylation (B \u00b1 SE, 271 \u00b1 103, p = 0.009). Blood SAM and blood GSH were associated with global DNA methylation, but these relationships did not achieve statistical significance.
