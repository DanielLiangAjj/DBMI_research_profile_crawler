Although effective in many cases, the supervised approach requires extensive labeling and often produces outputs that are unreliable for downstream analyses. Here, we introduce 'Lightning Pose', an efficient pose estimation package with three algorithmic contributions. First, in addition to training on a few labeled video frames, we use many unlabeled videos and penalize the network whenever its predictions violate motion continuity, multiple-view geometry and posture plausibility (semi-supervised learning). Second, we introduce a network architecture that resolves occlusions by predicting pose on any given frame using surrounding unlabeled frames. Third, we refine the pose predictions post hoc by combining ensembling and Kalman smoothing. Together, these components render pose trajectories more accurate and scientifically usable. We released a cloud application that allows users to label data, train networks and process new videos directly from the browser.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Biderman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. db3236@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Whiteway", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. m.whiteway@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Cole", "Last Name": "Hurwitz", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Greenspan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Lightning.ai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ankit", "Last Name": "Vishnubhotla", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Warren", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Federico", "Last Name": "Pedraja", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dillon", "Last Name": "Noone", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Schartner", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Julia M", "Last Name": "Huntenburg", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anup", "Last Name": "Khanal", "Affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guido T", "Last Name": "Meijer", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Paul", "Last Name": "Noel", "Affiliation": "New York University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Pan-Vazquez", "Affiliation": "Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karolina Z", "Last Name": "Socha", "Affiliation": "University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Anne E", "Last Name": "Urai", "Affiliation": "Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "International Brain Laboratory", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel B", "Last Name": "Sawtell", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liam", "Last Name": "Paninski", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature methods", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38768230", "Title": "Versatile multiple object tracking in sparse 2D/3D videos via deformable image registration.", "Abstract": "Tracking body parts in behaving animals, extracting fluorescence signals from cells embedded in deforming tissue, and analyzing cell migration patterns during development all require tracking objects with partially correlated motion. As dataset sizes increase, manual tracking of objects becomes prohibitively inefficient and slow, necessitating automated and semi-automated computational tools. Unfortunately, existing methods for multiple object tracking (MOT) are either developed for specific datasets and hence do not generalize well to other datasets, or require large amounts of training data that are not readily available. This is further exacerbated when tracking fluorescent sources in moving and deforming tissues, where the lack of unique features and sparsely populated images create a challenging environment, especially for modern deep learning techniques. By leveraging technology recently developed for spatial transformer networks, we propose ZephIR, an image registration framework for semi-supervised MOT in 2D and 3D videos. ZephIR can generalize to a wide range of biological systems by incorporating adjustable parameters that encode spatial (sparsity, texture, rigidity) and temporal priors of a given data class. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach in a variety of applications, including tracking the body parts of a behaving mouse and neurons in the brain of a freely moving C. elegans.

Such coordination often adopts the form of \"turn taking\", in which the interactive partners alternate the performance of a behavior. Apart from acoustic communication, how turn taking between animals is coordinated is not well understood. Furthermore, the neural substrates that regulate persistence in engaging in social interactions are poorly studied. Here, we use Siamese fighting fish ( Betta splendens ), to study visually-driven turn-taking aggressive behavior. Using encounters with conspecifics and with animations, we characterize the dynamic visual features of an opponent and the behavioral sequences that drive turn taking. Through a brain-wide screen of neuronal activity during coordinated and persistent aggressive behavior, followed by targeted brain lesions, we find that the caudal portion of the dorsomedial telencephalon, an amygdala-like region, promotes persistent participation in aggressive interactions, yet is not necessary for coordination. Our work highlights how dynamic visual cues shape the rhythm of social interactions at multiple timescales, and points to the pallial amygdala as a region controlling engagement in such interactions.

Two-photon optogenetic stimulation, when combined with whole-cell recording, enables large-scale mapping of physiological circuit parameters. In this experimental setup, recorded postsynaptic currents are used to infer the presence and strength of connections. For many cell types, nearby connections are those we expect to be strongest. However, when the postsynaptic cell expresses opsin, optical excitation of nearby cells can induce direct photocurrents in the postsynaptic cell. These photocurrent artifacts contaminate synaptic currents, making it difficult or impossible to probe connectivity for nearby cells. To overcome this problem, we developed a computational tool, Photocurrent Removal with Constraints (PhoRC). Our method is based on a constrained matrix factorization model which leverages the fact that photocurrent kinetics are less variable than those of synaptic currents. We demonstrate on real and simulated data that PhoRC consistently removes photocurrents while preserving synaptic currents, despite variations in photocurrent kinetics across datasets. Our method allows the discovery of synaptic connections which would have been otherwise obscured by photocurrent artifacts, and may thus reveal a more complete picture of synaptic connectivity.

We introduce DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data), a robust algorithm which is well suited for the registration of noisy, nonstationary extracellular electrophysiology recordings. In addition to estimating motion from spikes in the action potential (AP) frequency band, DREDge enables automated tracking of motion at high temporal resolution in the local field potential (LFP) frequency band. In human intraoperative recordings, which often feature fast (period <1s) motion, DREDge correction in the LFP band enabled reliable recovery of evoked potentials, and significantly reduced single-unit spike shape variability and spike sorting error. Applying DREDge to recordings made during deep probe insertions in nonhuman primates demonstrated the possibility of tracking probe motion of centimeters across several brain regions while simultaneously mapping single unit electrophysiological features. DREDge reliably delivered improved motion correction in acute mouse recordings, especially in those made with an recent ultra-high density probe. We also implemented a procedure for applying DREDge to recordings made across tens of days in chronic implantations in mice, reliably yielding stable motion tracking despite changes in neural activity across experimental sessions.

behavior. A prerequisite for many decoding approaches is spike sorting, the assignment of action potentials (spikes) to individual neurons. Current spike sorting algorithms, however, can be inaccurate and do not properly model uncertainty of spike assignments, therefore discarding information that could potentially improve decoding performance. Recent advances in high-density probes (e.g., Neuropixels) and computational methods now allow for extracting a rich set of spike features from unsorted data; these features can in turn be used to directly decode behavioral correlates. To this end, we propose a spike sorting-free decoding method that directly models the distribution of extracted spike features using a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) encoding the uncertainty of spike assignments, without aiming to solve the spike clustering problem explicitly. We allow the mixing proportion of the MoG to change over time in response to the behavior and develop variational inference methods to fit the resulting model and to perform decoding. We benchmark our method with an extensive suite of recordings from different animals and probe geometries, demonstrating that our proposed decoder can consistently outperform current methods based on thresholding (i.e. multi-unit activity) and spike sorting.

One particularly promising approach, Bessel imaging, captures neural activity from a volume by projecting within the imaged volume onto a single imaging plane, therefore effectively mixing signals and increasing the number of neurons imaged per pixel. These signals must then be computationally demixed to recover the desired neural activity. Unfortunately, currently-available demixing methods can perform poorly in the regime of high imaging density (i.e., many neurons per pixel). In this work we introduce a new pipeline (maskNMF) for demixing dense calcium imaging data. The main idea is to first denoise and temporally sparsen the observed video; this enhances signal strength and reduces spatial overlap significantly. Next we detect neurons in the sparsened video using a neural network trained on a library of neural shapes. These shapes are derived from segmented electron microscopy images input into a Bessel imaging model; therefore no manual selection of \"good\" neural shapes from the functional data is required here. After cells are detected, we use a constrained non-negative matrix factorization approach to demix the activity, using the detected cells' shapes to initialize the factorization. We test the resulting pipeline on both simulated and real datasets and find that it is able to achieve accurate demixing on denser data than was previously feasible, therefore enabling faithful imaging of larger neural populations. The method also provides good results on more \"standard\" two-photon imaging data.

Extracellular electrophysiology delivers this, but it has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action potentials. To minimize these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with much smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device samples neuronal activity at ultra-high spatial density (~10 times higher than previous probes) with low noise levels, while trading off recording span. NP Ultra is effectively an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a neuron's electrical field. We use a spike sorting algorithm optimized for these probes to demonstrate that the yield of visually-responsive neurons in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves up to ~3-fold. We show that NP Ultra can record from small neuronal structures including axons and dendrites. Recordings across multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of extracellular action potentials with unexpectedly small spatial spread and axon-like features. We share a large-scale dataset of these brain-wide recordings in mice as a resource for studies of neuronal biophysics. Finally, using ground-truth identification of three major inhibitory cortical cell types, we found that these cell types were discriminable with approximately 75% success, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings.

We cast multimodal microscopy alignment as a cell subset matching problem. To solve this non-convex problem, we introduce an efficient and globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithm to find subsets of point clouds that are in rotational alignment with each other. In addition, we use complementary information about cell shape and location to compute the matching likelihood of cell pairs in two imaging modalities to further prune the optimization search tree. Finally, we use the maximal set of cells in rigid rotational alignment to seed image deformation fields to obtain a final registration result.

Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Calcium", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mice", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shreya", "Last Name": "Saxena", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

Genetically encoded voltage indicators are a promising tool for these purposes; however, these have so far been limited to single-cell recordings with a marginal signal-to-noise ratio in vivo3-5. Here we developed improved near-infrared voltage indicators, high-speed microscopes and targeted gene expression schemes that enabled simultaneous in vivo recordings of supra- and subthreshold voltage dynamics in multiple neurons in the hippocampus of behaving mice. The reporters revealed subcellular details of back-propagating action potentials and correlations in subthreshold voltage between multiple cells. In combination with stimulation using optogenetics, the reporters revealed changes in neuronal excitability that were dependent on the behavioural\u00a0state, reflecting the interplay of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. These tools open the possibility for detailed explorations of network dynamics in the context of behaviour.

imaging of previously inaccessible neuronal populations deep within the brains of freely moving animals. However, it is computationally challenging to extract single-neuronal activity from microendoscopic data, because of the very large background fluctuations and high spatial overlaps intrinsic to this recording modality. Here, we describe a new constrained matrix factorization approach to accurately separate the background and then demix and denoise the neuronal signals of interest.

Second, there is an explicit tradeoff between imaging speed, signal-to-noise, and field of view: with current recording technology we cannot image very large neuronal populations with simultaneously high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we describe multi-scale approaches for alleviating both of these bottlenecks. First, we show that spatial and temporal decimation techniques based on simple local averaging provide order-of-magnitude speedups in spatiotemporally demixing calcium video data into estimates of single-cell neural activity. Second, once the shapes of individual neurons have been identified at fine scale (e.g., after an initial phase of conventional imaging with standard temporal and spatial resolution), we find that the spatial/temporal resolution tradeoff shifts dramatically: after demixing we can accurately recover denoised fluorescence traces and deconvolved neural activity of each individual neuron from coarse scale data that has been spatially decimated by an order of magnitude.

One of these regions, a critical forebrain structure called HVC, contains premotor neurons that are active at precise time points during song production. However, the neural representation of this behavior at a population level remains elusive. We used two-photon microscopy to monitor ensemble activity during singing, integrating across multiple trials by adopting a Bayesian inference approach to more precisely estimate burst timing. Additionally, we examined spiking and motor-related synaptic inputs using intracellular recordings during singing. With both experimental approaches, we find that premotor events do not occur preferentially at the onsets or offsets of song syllables or at specific subsyllabic motor landmarks.

In practice, the decoder is often learned by updating its parameters while the user performs a task. When the user's intention is not directly observable, recent methods have demonstrated value in training the decoder against a surrogate for the user's intended movement. Here we show that training a decoder in this way is a novel variant of an imitation learning problem, where an oracle or expert is employed for supervised training in lieu of direct observations, which are not available. Specifically, we describe how a generic imitation learning meta-algorithm, dataset aggregation (DAgger), can be adapted to train a generic brain-computer interface. By deriving existing learning algorithms for brain-computer interfaces in this framework, we provide a novel analysis of regret (an important metric of learning efficacy) for brain-computer interfaces. This analysis allows us to characterize the space of algorithmic variants and bounds on their regret rates. Existing approaches for decoder learning have been performed in the cursor control setting, but the available design principles for these decoders are such that it has been impossible to scale them to naturalistic settings. Leveraging our findings, we then offer an algorithm that combines imitation learning with optimal control, which should allow for training of arbitrary effectors for which optimal control can generate goal-oriented control. We demonstrate this novel and general BCI algorithm with simulated neuroprosthetic control of a 26 degree-of-freedom model of an arm, a sophisticated and realistic end effector.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Arm", "Brain-Computer Interfaces", "Computational Biology", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Learning", "Robotics", "Supervised Machine Learning", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Josh", "Last Name": "Merel", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology and Behavior program, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Carlson", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Liam", "Last Name": "Paninski", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology and Behavior program, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Neurobiology and Behavior program, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "26949187", "Title": "Bayesian Sparse Regression Analysis Documents the Diversity of Spinal Inhibitory Interneurons.", "Abstract": "Documenting the extent of cellular diversity is a critical step in defining the functional organization of tissues and organs.

The \"common input\" problem presents a major roadblock: it is difficult to reliably distinguish causal connections between pairs of observed neurons versus correlations induced by common input from unobserved neurons. Available techniques allow us to simultaneously record, with sufficient temporal resolution, only a small fraction of the network. Consequently, naive connectivity estimators that neglect these common input effects are highly biased. This work proposes a \"shotgun\" experimental design, in which we observe multiple sub-networks briefly, in a serial manner. Thus, while the full network cannot be observed simultaneously at any given time, we may be able to observe much larger subsets of the network over the course of the entire experiment, thus ameliorating the common input problem. Using a generalized linear model for a spiking recurrent neural network, we develop a scalable approximate expected loglikelihood-based Bayesian method to perform network inference given this type of data, in which only a small fraction of the network is observed in each time bin. We demonstrate in simulation that the shotgun experimental design can eliminate the biases induced by common input effects. Networks with thousands of neurons, in which only a small fraction of the neurons is observed in each time bin, can be quickly and accurately estimated, achieving orders of magnitude speed up over previous approaches.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Computer Simulation", "Connectome", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Models, Statistical", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Sample Size", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Soudry", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Department of Neuroscience, the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, the Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind, the Kavli Institute for Brain Science, and the NeuroTechnology Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Suraj", "Last Name": "Keshri", "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Stinson", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Department of Neuroscience, the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, the Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind, the Kavli Institute for Brain Science, and the NeuroTechnology Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Min-Hwan", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Garud", "Last Name": "Iyengar", "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Liam", "Last Name": "Paninski", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Department of Neuroscience, the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, the Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind, the Kavli Institute for Brain Science, and the NeuroTechnology Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "26186188", "Title": "Primacy of Flexor Locomotor Pattern Revealed by Ancestral Reversion of Motor Neuron Identity.", "Abstract": "Spinal circuits can generate locomotor output in the absence of sensory or descending input, but the principles of locomotor circuit organization remain unclear.

Two-photon imaging was coupled with spike inference to measure locomotor firing in hundreds of motor neurons in isolated mouse spinal cords. In wild-type preparations, we observed sequential recruitment of motor neurons innervating flexor muscles controlling progressively more distal joints.

This paper discusses an approximation of the likelihood in these models that can greatly facilitate computation. The basic idea is to replace a sum that appears in the exact log-likelihood by an expectation over the model covariates; the resulting \"expected log-likelihood\" can in many cases be computed significantly faster than the exact log-likelihood. In many neuroscience experiments the distribution over model covariates is controlled by the experimenter and the expected log-likelihood approximation becomes particularly useful; for example, estimators based on maximizing this expected log-likelihood (or a penalized version thereof) can often be obtained with orders of magnitude computational savings compared to the exact maximum likelihood estimators. A risk analysis establishes that these maximum EL estimators often come with little cost in accuracy (and in some cases even improved accuracy) compared to standard maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, we find that these methods can significantly decrease the computation time of marginal likelihood calculations for model selection and of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for sampling from the posterior parameter distribution.
