[{"PMID": "38950288", "Title": "Frameshift variants in C10orf71 cause dilated cardiomyopathy in human, mouse, and organoid models.", "Abstract": "Research advances over the past 30 years have confirmed a critical role for genetics in the etiology of dilated cardiomyopathies (DCMs). However, full knowledge of the genetic architecture of DCM remains incomplete. We identified candidate DCM causal gene, C10orf71, in a large family with 8 patients with DCM by whole-exome sequencing. Four loss-of-function variants of C10orf71 were subsequently identified in an additional group of492 patients with sporadic DCM from 2 independent cohorts. C10orf71 was found to be an intrinsically disordered protein specifically expressed in cardiomyocytes. C10orf71-KO mice had abnormal heart morphogenesis during embryonic development and cardiac dysfunction as adults with altered expression and splicing of contractile cardiac genes. C10orf71-null cardiomyocytes exhibited impaired contractile function with unaffected sarcomere structure. Cardiomyocytes and heart organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells with C10orf71 frameshift variants also had contractile defects with normal electrophysiological activity. A rescue study using a cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, restored contractile function in C10orf71-KO mice. These data support C10orf71 as a causal gene for DCM by contributing to the contractile function of cardiomyocytes. Mutation-specific pathophysiology may suggest therapeutic targets and more individualized therapy.", "Keywords": ["Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Genetic diseases", "Genetic variation", "Genetics"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Animals", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Mice", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Mice, Knockout", "Frameshift Mutation", "Organoids", "Male", "Female", "Myocardial Contraction", "Adult", "Disease Models, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ke", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhujun", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shijuan", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Guangming", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yujie", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Novogene Co.

But the development in 2019 of Milasen, the first genetic intervention developed for and administered to a single patient suffering from an ultrarare genetic disorder, has offered hope to patients and families. In addition, Milasen raised a series of conceptual and ethical questions about how individualised genetic interventions should be developed, assessed for safety and efficacy and financially supported. The answers to these questions depend in large part on whether individualised therapies are understood as human subjects research or clinical innovation, different domains of biomedicine that are regulated by different modes of oversight, funding and professional norms. In this article, with development and administration of the drug Milasen as our case study, we argue that at least some individualised genetic therapies are not, as some have argued, either research or treatment. Instead, they are research-treatment hybrids, a category that has both epistemological and pragmatic repercussions for funding, ethics oversight and regulation.", "Keywords": ["Child", "Ethics- Medical", "Ethics- Research", "Genetic Therapy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Josephine", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Hastings Center, Garrison, New York, USA johnstonj@thehastingscenter.org."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "Tabb", "Affiliation": "Department of Philosophy, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Pacia", "Affiliation": "Hastings Center, Garrison, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra Soo-Jin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of medical ethics", "PubDate": "2024Jun26"}, {"PMID": "38923504", "Title": "SETBP1 haploinsufficiency and related disorders clinical and neurobehavioral phenotype study.", "Abstract": "To comprehensively investigate the neurodevelopmental profile and clinical characteristics associated with SETBP1 haploinsufficiency disorder (SETBP1-HD) and SETBP1-related disorders (SETBP1-RD).

RBL2 dysfunction has been linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. However, to date, clinical features have only been described in six individuals carrying five biallelic predicted loss of function (pLOF) variants. To define the phenotypic effects of RBL2 mutations in detail, we identified and clinically characterized a cohort of 28 patients from 18 families carrying LOF variants in RBL2 , including fourteen new variants that substantially broaden the molecular spectrum. The clinical presentation of affected individuals is characterized by a range of neurological and developmental abnormalities. Global developmental delay and intellectual disability were uniformly observed, ranging from moderate to profound and involving lack of acquisition of key motor and speech milestones in most patients. Frequent features included postnatal microcephaly, infantile hypotonia, aggressive behaviour, stereotypic movements and non-specific dysmorphic features. Common neuroimaging features were cerebral atrophy, white matter volume loss, corpus callosum hypoplasia and cerebellar atrophy. In parallel, we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , to investigate how disruption of the conserved RBL2 orthologueue Rbf impacts nervous system function and development. We found that Drosophila Rbf LOF mutants recapitulate several features of patients harboring RBL2 variants, including alterations in the head and brain morphology reminiscent of microcephaly, and perturbed locomotor behaviour. Surprisingly, in addition to its known role in controlling tissue growth during development, we find that continued Rbf expression is also required in fully differentiated post-mitotic neurons for normal locomotion in Drosophila , and that adult-stage neuronal re-expression of Rbf is sufficient to rescue Rbf mutant locomotor defects. Taken together, this study provides a clinical and experimental basis to understand genotype-phenotype correlations in an RBL2 -linked neurodevelopmental disorder and suggests that restoring RBL2 expression through gene therapy approaches may ameliorate aspects of RBL2 LOF patient symptoms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Aughey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Cali", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Reza", "Last Name": "Maroofian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maha S", "Last Name": "Zaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alistair T", "Last Name": "Pagnamenta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fatima", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lara", "Last Name": "Menzies", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anum", "Last Name": "Shafique", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohnish", "Last Name": "Suri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emmanuel", "Last Name": "Roze", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohammed", "Last Name": "Aguennouz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zouiri", "Last Name": "Ghizlane", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saadia Maryam", "Last Name": "Saadi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zafar", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Uzma", "Last Name": "Abdulllah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Huma Arshad", "Last Name": "Cheema", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Muhammad Nadeem", "Last Name": "Anjum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Godelieve", "Last Name": "Morel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "McFarland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Umut", "Last Name": "Altunoglu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Verena", "Last Name": "Kraus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Moneef", "Last Name": "Shoukier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristina", "Last Name": "Flemming", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hilde", "Last Name": "Yttervik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hajar", "Last Name": "Rhouda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gaetan", "Last Name": "Lesca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bibi Nazia", "Last Name": "Murtaza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mujaddad Ur", "Last Name": "Rehman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "SYNAPS Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Genomics England", "Last Name": "Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Go Hun", "Last Name": "Seo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Beetz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Kayserili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yamna", "Last Name": "Krioulie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sadaf", "Last Name": "Naz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shazia", "Last Name": "Maqbool", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Gleeson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shahid Mahmood", "Last Name": "Baig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Efthymiou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jenny C", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mariasavina", "Last Name": "Severino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James Ec", "Last Name": "Jepson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Houlden", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024May05"}, {"PMID": "38746151", "Title": "Genome Sequencing is Critical for Forecasting Outcomes following Congenital Cardiac Surgery.", "Abstract": "While genome sequencing has transformed medicine by elucidating the genetic underpinnings of both rare and common complex disorders, its utility to predict clinical outcomes remains understudied.

Pathogenic missense variants in the same gene may act through different modes of action (i.e., gain/loss-of-function) by affecting different aspects of protein function. They may result in distinct clinical conditions that require different treatments. We developed a new method, PreMode, to perform gene-specific mode-of-action predictions. PreMode models effects of coding sequence variants using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks on protein sequences and structures. Using the largest-to-date set of missense variants with known modes of action, we showed that PreMode reached state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of mode-of-action predictions by efficient transfer-learning. Additionally, PreMode's prediction of G/LoF variants in a kinase is consistent with inactive-active conformation transition energy changes.

Addressing this \"diagnostic odyssey\" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.", "Keywords": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Facial phenotyping", "Human Phenotype Ontology", "Large Language Models", "Multimodal Machine Learning", "Rare Genetic Disorders"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Da", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Raymond G.

This syndrome is characterized by developmental delay/intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, hyper/hypotonia, and abnormal neuroimaging [1, 5]. BLBS was initially categorized as a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous variants in either H3-3A or H3-3B [1-4]. Here, we analyze the data of the 58 previously published individuals along 38 unpublished, unrelated individuals. In this larger cohort of 96 people, we identify causative missense, synonymous, and stop-loss variants. We also expand upon the phenotypic characterization by elaborating on the neurodevelopmental component of BLBS. Notably, phenotypic heterogeneity was present even amongst individuals harboring the same variant. To explore the complex phenotypic variation in this expanded cohort, the relationships between syndromic phenotypes with three variables of interest were interrogated: sex, gene containing the causative variant, and variant location in the H3.3 protein. While specific genotype-phenotype correlations have not been conclusively delineated, the results presented here suggest that the location of the variants within the H3.3 protein and the affected gene (H3-3A or H3-3B) contribute more to the severity of distinct phenotypes than sex. Since these variables do not account for all BLBS phenotypic variability, these findings suggest that additional factors may play a role in modifying the phenotypes of affected individuals.

SLC1A4 catalyzes obligatory amino acid exchange between neutral amino acids, but the physiopathology of SLC1A4 disease mutations and progressive microcephaly remain unclear. Here, we examined the phenotype and metabolic profile of three Slc1a4 mouse models, including a constitutive Slc1a4-KO mouse, a knock-in mouse with the major human Slc1a4 mutation (Slc1a4-K256E), and a selective knockout of Slc1a4 in brain endothelial cells (Slc1a4tie2-cre). We show that Slc1a4 is a bona fide L-serine transporter at the BBB and that acute inhibition or deletion of Slc1a4 leads to a decrease in serine influx into the brain. This results in microcephaly associated with decreased L-serine content in the brain, accumulation of atypical and cytotoxic 1-deoxysphingolipids in the brain, neurodegeneration, synaptic and mitochondrial abnormalities, and behavioral impairments. Prenatal and early postnatal oral administration of L-serine at levels that replenish the serine pool in the brain rescued the observed biochemical and behavioral changes. Administration of L-serine till the second postnatal week also normalized brain weight in Slc1a4-E256\u2005K mice. Our observations suggest that the transport of \"non-essential\" amino acids from the blood through the BBB is at least as important as that of essential amino acids for brain metabolism and development. We proposed that SLC1A4 mutations cause a BBB aminoacidopathy with deficits in serine import across the BBB required for optimal brain growth and leads to a metabolic microcephaly, which may be amenable to treatment with L-serine.", "Keywords": ["d-serine", "mitochondria", "mitophagy", "serine metabolism", "synaptopathy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maali", "Last Name": "Odeh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and Research Institute, Technion-Israel Inst of Technology, Haifa 3109601, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Clara", "Last Name": "Sajrawi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and Research Institute, Technion-Israel Inst of Technology, Haifa 3109601, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Majcher", "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University of Zurich and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich 8091, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Salman", "Last Name": "Zubedat", "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences, University of Haifa, Haifa 3498838, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Lihi", "Last Name": "Shaulov", "Affiliation": "Electron Microscopy Unit, B.

In recent years, studies have identified subtle distinctions between the phenotypic effects of 16p11.2 duplication and 16p11.2 deletion with respect to patterns of autism, intellectual impairment, and psychiatric illness. However, although divergent phenotypic findings in some motor domains have been reported, no study has yet made a comprehensive comparison of motor difficulties between 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication carriers to elucidate points of convergence and divergence. We sought to make such a comparison in a group of 133 16p11.2 deletion carriers, 122 duplication carriers, and 388 familial controls, hypothesizing that motor impairment would overall be greater in deletion than duplication carriers. In a series of regression models, we found that 16p11.2 deletion status tended to predict greater impairment along indices of gross motor function, but less impairment along indices of fine motor function. These findings point to a potential pattern of performance difficulties that could be investigated in future studies.

We analyzed effects of covariate stratification and interaction on body mass index (BMI) PGS (PGSBMI) across four cohorts of European (N=491,111) and African (N=21,612) ancestry. Stratifying on binary covariates and quintiles for continuous covariates, 18/62 covariates had significant and replicable R2 differences among strata. Covariates with the largest differences included age, sex, blood lipids, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, with R2 being nearly double between best and worst performing quintiles for certain covariates. 28 covariates had significant PGSBMI-covariate interaction effects, modifying PGSBMI effects by nearly 20% per standard deviation change. We observed overlap between covariates that had significant R2 differences among strata and interaction effects - across all covariates, their main effects on BMI were correlated with their maximum R2 differences and interaction effects (0.56 and 0.58, respectively), suggesting high-PGSBMI individuals have highest R2 and increase in PGS effect. Using quantile regression, we show the effect of PGSBMI increases as BMI itself increases, and that these differences in effects are directly related to differences in R2 when stratifying by different covariates. Given significant and replicable evidence for context-specific PGSBMI performance and effects, we investigated ways to increase model performance taking into account non-linear effects. Machine learning models (neural networks) increased relative model R2 (mean 23%) across datasets. Finally, creating PGSBMI directly from GxAge GWAS effects increased relative R2 by 7.8%. These results demonstrate that certain covariates, especially those most associated with BMI, significantly affect both PGSBMI performance and effects across diverse cohorts and ancestries, and we provide avenues to improve model performance that consider these effects.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Hui", "Affiliation": "Department of

However, the impact on parents of receiving a monogenetic/ copy number variant diagnosis for autism in their child is not well understood. To explore this, we surveyed and interviewed parents of children in the SPARK study, a study of autism that includes genetic testing. Surveys were administered one month before and one and 12\u00a0months after parents received their child's genetic result. Interviews were conducted approximately one month after results disclosure. A genetic diagnosis (GD) for their child appeared to reduce parents' sense of self-blame and feelings of guilt, and this impact was relatively stable. The data also indicate a modest impact on parents' actions related to the condition, perceptions of themselves, and some aspects of life planning for their child, as measured by quantitative instruments at one month and 12\u00a0months after receipt of results. Other measures of parental identity and expectations for their child, in contrast, showed little change following receipt of genetic findings. Overall, parents who were told that no GD was identified showed minimal changes in their responses over\u00a0time. These results suggest a discernable but relatively limited impact of genetic test results on parents of children with autism.

Haploinsufficiency of FOXP1 is associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder: autosomal dominant mental retardation with language impairment with or without autistic features. More recently, heterozygous FOXP1 variants have also been shown to cause a variety of structural birth defects including central nervous system (CNS) anomalies, congenital heart defects, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias. In this report, we present a previously unpublished case of an individual with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) who carries an approximately 3.8\u2009Mb deletion. Based on this deletion, and deletions previously reported in two other individuals with CDH, we define a CDH critical region on chromosome 3p13 that includes FOXP1 and four other protein-coding genes. We also provide detailed clinical descriptions of two previously reported individuals with CDH who carry de novo, pathogenic variants in FOXP1 that are predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. A subset of individuals with putatively deleterious FOXP4 variants has also been shown to develop CDH. Since FOXP proteins function as homo- or heterodimers and the homologs of FOXP1 and FOXP4 are expressed at the same time points in the embryonic mouse diaphragm, they may function together as a dimer, or in parallel as homodimers, to regulate gene expression during diaphragm development. Not all individuals with heterozygous, loss-of-function changes in FOXP1 develop CDH. Hence, we conclude that FOXP1 acts as a susceptibility factor that contributes to the development of CDH in conjunction with other genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and/or stochastic factors.", "Keywords": ["CDH", "FOXP1", "FOXP2", "FOXP3", "FOXP4"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katherine E", "Last Name": "Pendleton", "Affiliation": "Genetics and Genomics Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andres", "Last Name": "Hernandez-Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer M", "Last Name": "Lyu", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chad A", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Vogt", "Affiliation": "West Midlands Regional Genetics Service, Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Frances A", "Last Name": "High", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patricia K", "Last Name": "Donahoe", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Surgical Research Laboratories, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daryl A", "Last Name": "Scott", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of pediatric genetics", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "38559260", "Title": "Automated Identification of Germline de novo Mutations in Family Trios: A Consensus-Based Informatic Approach.", "Abstract": "Accurate identification of germline de novo variants (DNVs) remains a challenging problem despite rapid advances in sequencing technologies as well as methods for the analysis of the data they generate, with putative solutions often involving ad hoc filters and visual inspection of identified variants.

Our method evaluates variant calls generated by three genome sequence analysis pipelines utilizing different algorithms-GATK HaplotypeCaller, DeepTrio and Velsera GRAF-exploring the assumption that a requirement of consensus can serve as an effective filter for high-quality DNVs. We assessed the efficacy of our method by testing DNVs identified using a previously established, highly accurate classification procedure that partially relied on manual inspection and used Sanger sequencing to validate a DNV subset comprising less confident calls. The results show that our method is highly precise and that applying a force-calling procedure to putative variants further removes false-positive calls, increasing precision of the workflow to 99.6%.

Here, we report fourteen individuals with heterozygous variants in FRYL who present with developmental delay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and other congenital anomalies in multiple systems. The variants are confirmed de novo in all individuals except one. Human genetic data suggest that FRYL is intolerant to loss of function (LoF). We find that the fly FRYL ortholog, furry (fry), is expressed in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system where it is present in neurons but not in glia. Homozygous fry LoF mutation is lethal at various developmental stages, and loss of fry in mutant clones causes defects in wings and compound eyes. We next modeled four out of the five missense variants found in affected individuals using fry knockin alleles. One variant behaves as a severe LoF variant, whereas two others behave as partial LoF variants. One variant does not cause any observable defect in flies, and the corresponding human variant is not confirmed to be de novo, suggesting that this is a variant of uncertain significance. In summary, our findings support that fry is required for proper development in flies and that the LoF variants in FRYL cause a dominant disorder with developmental and neurological symptoms due to haploinsufficiency.", "Keywords": ["Drosophila", "FRYL", "developmental delay", "furry", "intellectual disability", "rare disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Child", "Humans", "Developmental Disabilities", "Intellectual Disability", "Mammals", "Musculoskeletal Abnormalities", "Mutation, Missense", "Transcription Factors", "Drosophila"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xueyang", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA;

Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods.

To address these challenges, the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has developed a framework and pipeline for return of a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children as part of a clinical study. From an initial list of 23 conditions, ten were selected for implementation based on PRS performance, medical actionability and potential clinical utility, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process, with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. We then developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation (score transfer to a clinical laboratory, validation and verification of score performance), and used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, utilizing genetically diverse data from 13,475 participants of the All of Us Research Program cohort to train and test model parameters. Finally, we created a framework for regulatory compliance and developed a PRS clinical report for return to providers and for inclusion in an additional genome-informed risk assessment. The initial experience from eMERGE can inform the approach needed to implement PRS-based testing in diverse clinical settings.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Child", "Humans", "Chronic

We identified loss-of-function sequence variants in the epigenomic regulator gene SIN3A in two patients with complex CDH. Tissue-specific deletion of Sin3a in mice resulted in defects in diaphragm development, lung hypoplasia, and pulmonary hypertension, the cardinal features of CDH and major causes of CDH-associated mortality. Loss of SIN3A in the lung mesenchyme resulted in reduced cellular differentiation, impaired cell proliferation, and increased DNA damage. Treatment of embryonic Sin3a mutant mice with anacardic acid, an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase, reduced DNA damage, increased cell proliferation and differentiation, improved lung and pulmonary vascular development, and reduced pulmonary hypertension.

We developed MisFit to estimate missense fitness effect using biobank-scale human population genome data. MisFit jointly models the effect at molecular level (d) and population level (selection coefficient, s), assuming that in the same gene, missense variants with similar d have similar s. MisFit is a probabilistic graphical model that integrates deep neural network components and population genetics models efficiently with inductive bias based on biological causality of variant effect.

Diagnosis of a de novo genetic variant can alter parental perceptions of offspring with autism and other NDDs. Parents often blamed their child less, saw their child as less in control of symptoms, and developed more patience, framing expectations accordingly. Parents had mixed feelings about receiving genetic diagnoses, with sadness sometimes accompanying reframed expectations. Genetic diagnoses could change views of the child among extended family members, teachers, social service agencies, insurers, and broader communities and society. Genetic testing might also reduce delays in diagnoses of autism among African American, Latino and other children. These data, the first to examine several critical aspects of how parents and others view children with autism and other NDDs after receiving genetic diagnoses, highlight vital needs for education of multiple stakeholders (including geneticists, other physicians, genetic counselors, parents, individuals with autism, social service agencies, insurers, policymakers, and the broader public), research (to include perspectives of extended family members, insurers, social service agencies and teachers) and practice (to increase recognition and awareness of the potential benefits and effects of genetic testing for such children).", "Keywords": ["Autism", "Genetic diagnosis", "Identity", "Intellectual disability (ID)", "Parental attitudes", "Perceptions of illness", "Stigma"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Klitzman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Joseph L.

B56\u03b4 (encoded by PPP2R5D) is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) with long IDRs that harbor a substrate-mimicking SLiM and multiple phosphorylation sites. De novo missense mutations in PPP2R5D cause intellectual disabilities (ID), macrocephaly, Parkinsonism, and a broad range of neurological symptoms. Our single-particle cryo-EM structures of the PP2A-B56\u03b4 holoenzyme reveal that the long, disordered arms at the B56\u03b4 termini fold against each other and the holoenzyme core. This architecture suppresses both the phosphatase active site and the substrate-binding protein groove, thereby stabilizing the enzyme in a closed latent form with dual autoinhibition. The resulting interface spans over 190 \u00c5 and harbors unfavorable contacts, activation phosphorylation sites, and nearly all residues with ID-associated mutations. Our studies suggest that this dynamic interface is coupled to an allosteric network responsive to phosphorylation and altered globally by mutations.

Pathogenic variants in GTPBP2 were recently shown to be an ultra-rare cause of neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Until now, no human phenotype has been linked to GTPBP1. Here, we describe individuals carrying bi-allelic GTPBP1 variants that display an identical phenotype with GTPBP2 and characterize the overall spectrum of GTP-binding protein (1/2)-related disorders. In this study, 20 individuals from 16 families with distinct NDDs and syndromic facial features were investigated by whole-exome (WES) or whole-genome (WGS) sequencing. To assess the functional impact of the identified genetic variants, semi-quantitative PCR, western blot, and ribosome profiling assays were performed in fibroblasts from affected individuals. We also investigated the effect of reducing expression of CG2017, an ortholog of human GTPBP1/2, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Individuals with bi-allelic GTPBP1 or GTPBP2 variants presented with microcephaly, profound neurodevelopmental impairment, pathognomonic craniofacial features, and ectodermal defects. Abnormal vision and/or hearing, progressive spasticity, choreoathetoid movements, refractory epilepsy, and brain atrophy were part of the core phenotype of this syndrome. Cell line studies identified a loss-of-function (LoF) impact of the disease-associated variants but no significant abnormalities on ribosome profiling. Reduced expression of CG2017 isoforms was associated with locomotor impairment in Drosophila. In conclusion, bi-allelic GTPBP1 and GTPBP2 LoF variants cause an identical, distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome.

Selecting the appropriate genetic tests is crucial to lead to timely diagnosis. Phenotypic features offer great potential for aiding genomic diagnosis in rare disease cases. We see great promise in effective integration of phenotypic information into genetic test selection workflow. In this study, we present a phenotype-driven molecular genetic test recommendation (Phen2Test) for pediatric rare disease diagnosis. Phen2Test was constructed using frequency matrix of phecodes and demographic data from the EHR before ordering genetic tests, with the objective to streamline the selection of molecular genetic tests (whole-exome / whole-genome sequencing, or gene panels) for clinicians with minimum genetic training expertise. We developed and evaluated binary classifiers based on 1,005 individuals referred to genetic counselors for potential genetic evaluation. In the evaluation using the gold standard cohort, the model achieved strong performance with an AUROC of 0.82 and an AUPRC of 0.92. Furthermore, we tested the model on another silver standard cohort (n=6,458), achieving an overall AUROC of 0.72 and an AUPRC of 0.671. Phen2Test was adjusted to align with current clinical guidelines, showing superior performance with more recent data, demonstrating its potential for use within a learning healthcare system as a genomic medicine intervention that adapts to guideline updates. This study showcases the practical utility of phenotypic features in recommending molecular genetic tests with performance comparable to clinical geneticists. Phen2Test could assist clinicians with limited genetic training and knowledge to order appropriate genetic tests.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fangyi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Priyanka", "Last Name": "Ahimaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Raymond G.

Two coding variants (G1 and G2) in the APOL1 gene play a major role in this disparity. While 13% of African Americans carry the high-risk recessive genotypes, only a fraction of these individuals develops FSGS or kidney failure, indicating the involvement of additional disease modifiers. Here, we show that the presence of the APOL1 p.N264K missense variant, when co-inherited with the G2 APOL1 risk allele, substantially reduces the penetrance of the G1G2 and G2G2 high-risk genotypes by rendering these genotypes low-risk. These results align with prior functional evidence showing that the p.N264K variant reduces the toxicity of the APOL1 high-risk alleles.

The activity of RIG-I is tightly controlled, and once bound to viral dsRNA, addition of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains activates signalling. Meanwhile, the addition of lysine 48-linked ubiquitin chains to RIG-I is required to terminate signalling when the infection has been resolved. Really interesting new gene (RING) finger protein 125 (RNF125) is the E3 ligase responsible for addition of the ubiquitin chains that terminate signalling, with disruption of its function associated with Tenorio syndrome. Here we describe a novel RNF125 gene variant in an individual with clinical symptoms including intellectual disability, macrocephaly and congenital heart disease, consistent with Tenorio syndrome. The newly identified Tenorio syndrome-associated variant [(NM_017831.4):c.670G>C p.Glu224Gln] is the first to be found in the ubiquitin interaction motif (UIM) of RNF125. While the E3 ligase activity of this RNF125 variant is retained, it has an impaired ability to interact with lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains. The function of the UIM in RNF125 is uncertain; however, this study suggests that the UIM binds lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains, and that this interaction is required for the normal function of RNF125.", "Keywords": ["RIG-I", "RNF125", "Tenorio syndrome", "overgrowth", "ubiquitin binding", "ubiquitin interacting-motif", "ubiquitin ligase"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Lysine", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases", "Protein Binding", "Ubiquitin", "Carrier Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fareeda M", "Last Name": "Barzak", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Anita", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Alexa R", "Last Name": "Geltzeiler", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital Harvard Medical School Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Ledgerwood", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital Harvard Medical School Boston, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine L", "Last Name": "Day", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}], "Journal": "Clinical genetics", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "37961033", "Title": "Clinical phenotypes of individuals with Chung-Jansen syndrome across age groups.", "Abstract": "Pathogenic variants in pleckstrin homology domain interacting protein (PHIP) are associated with Chung-Jansen syndrome characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral challenges, hypotonia, obesity, and dysmorphic features.

However, its precise function in cells is still unclear, as is the consequence of ACBD6 defects on human pathophysiology. Using exome sequencing and extensive international data sharing efforts, we identified 45 affected individuals from 28 unrelated families (consanguinity 93%) with bi-allelic pathogenic, predominantly loss-of-function (18/20) variants in ACBD6. We generated zebrafish and Xenopus tropicalis acbd6 knockouts by CRISPR/Cas9 and characterized the role of ACBD6 on protein N-myristoylation with myristic acid alkyne (YnMyr) chemical proteomics in the model organisms and human cells, with the latter also being subjected further to ACBD6 peroxisomal localization studies. The affected individuals (23 males and 22 females), aged 1-50\u2005years, typically present with a complex and progressive disease involving moderate-to-severe global developmental delay/intellectual disability (100%) with significant expressive language impairment (98%), movement disorders (97%), facial dysmorphism (95%) and mild cerebellar ataxia (85%) associated with gait impairment (94%), limb spasticity/hypertonia (76%), oculomotor (71%) and behavioural abnormalities (65%), overweight (59%), microcephaly (39%) and epilepsy (33%). The most conspicuous and common movement disorder was dystonia (94%), frequently leading to early-onset progressive postural deformities (97%), limb dystonia (55%) and cervical dystonia (31%). A jerky tremor in the upper limbs (63%), a mild head tremor (59%), parkinsonism/hypokinesia developing with advancing age (32%) and simple motor and vocal tics were among other frequent movement disorders. Midline brain malformations including corpus callosum abnormalities (70%), hypoplasia/agenesis of the anterior commissure (66%), short midbrain and small inferior cerebellar vermis (38% each) as well as hypertrophy of the clava (24%) were common neuroimaging findings. Acbd6-deficient zebrafish and Xenopus models effectively recapitulated many clinical phenotypes reported in patients including movement disorders, progressive neuromotor impairment, seizures, microcephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism and midbrain defects accompanied by developmental delay with increased mortality over time. Unlike ACBD5, ACBD6 did not show a peroxisomal localization and ACBD6-deficiency was not associated with altered peroxisomal parameters in patient fibroblasts. Significant differences in YnMyr-labelling were observed for 68 co- and 18 post-translationally N-myristoylated proteins in patient-derived fibroblasts. N-myristoylation was similarly affected in acbd6-deficient zebrafish and X. tropicalis models, including Fus, Marcks and Chchd-related proteins implicated in neurological diseases. The present study provides evidence that bi-allelic pathogenic variants in ACBD6 lead to a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome accompanied by complex and progressive cognitive and movement

The developmental basis of these congenital anomalies is poorly understood, but recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation similar to EA/TEF patients. We show that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the cell surface where opposite sides of the common foregut tube fuse. Partial loss of endosome trafficking or the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts epithelial polarity and cell division orientation. Mutant cells accumulate at the fusion point, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus.

decision-making. We interviewed 28 parents who received de novo genetic diagnoses for their child's autism and intellectual disability (ID). These genetic variants proved to have reproductive implications for not only the child's parents, but the child and his/her neurotypical siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Parents had often already finished building their families but varied, overall, in whether the results had affected, or might have influenced, their reproductive decisions. Parents' views were shaped by factors related to not only genetics, but also parental age, financial considerations, competing hopes and visions for their family's future, perceived abilities to care for an additional child with similar symptoms, and the extent of the child's symptoms. Members of a couple sometimes disagreed about whether to have more children. Parents pondered, too, the possibility of preimplantation genetic testing, though misunderstandings about it arose. Children with autism vary widely in their abilities to understand the reproductive implications of genetic diagnoses for themselves. Neurotypical offspring were much relieved to understand that their own children would not be affected. While some autism self-advocates have been concerned that genetic testing related to autism could lead to eugenics, the present data, concerning de novo genetic findings, raise other perspectives.

Using American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines, we excluded the 0.1% of benign/likely benign variants and the resulting dataset consisted of 83% predicted loss of function variants and 17% missense variants. Seventeen percent were de novo variants. A stepwise analysis identified 90 variant-enriched CHD genes, of which six (GPATCH1, NYNRIN, TCLD2, CEP95, MAP3K19, and TTC36) were novel candidate CHD genes. Single-cell transcriptome cluster reconstruction analysis on six CHD tissues and four controls revealed upregulation of the top 10 frequently mutated genes primarily in cardiomyocytes. NOTCH1 (highest number of variants) and MYH6 (highest number of recurrent variants) expression was elevated in endocardial cells and cardiomyocytes, respectively, and 60% of these gene variants were associated with tetralogy of Fallot and coarctation of the aorta, respectively. Pseudobulk analysis using the single-cell transcriptome revealed significant (P < 0.05) upregulation of both NOTCH1 (endocardial cells) and MYH6 (cardiomyocytes) in the control heart data.

We describe eight unrelated families with an X-linked condition characterized by diaphragm defects, variable anterior body-wall anomalies, and/or facial dysmorphism. Using linkage analysis and exome or genome sequencing, we found that missense variants in plastin 3 (PLS3), a gene encoding an actin bundling protein, co-segregate with disease in all families. Loss-of-function variants in PLS3 have been previously associated with X-linked osteoporosis (MIM: 300910), so we used in silico protein modeling and a mouse model to address these seemingly disparate clinical phenotypes. The missense variants in individuals with CDH are located within the actin-binding domains of the protein but are not predicted to affect protein structure, whereas the variants in individuals with osteoporosis are predicted to result in loss of function. A mouse knockin model of a variant identified in one of the CDH-affected families, c.1497G>C (p.Trp499Cys), shows partial perinatal lethality and recapitulates the key findings of the human phenotype, including diaphragm and abdominal-wall defects. Both the mouse model and one adult human male with a CDH-associated PLS3 variant were observed to have increased rather than decreased bone mineral density. Together, these clinical and functional data in humans and mice reveal that specific missense variants affecting the actin-binding domains of PLS3 might have a gain-of-function effect and cause a Mendelian congenital disorder.", "Keywords": ["PLS3, plastin", "X-linked", "abdominal hernia", "actin-binding protein", "congenital diaphragmatic hernia", "fimbrin", "omphalocele", "umbilical hernia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Male", "Animals", "Mice", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Actins", "Mutation, Missense", "Osteoporosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Florence", "Last Name": "Petit", "Affiliation": "Clinique de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique, CHU de Lille, Lille, France;

developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), than European Americans. Two coding variants (G1 and G2) in the APOL1 gene play a major role in this disparity. While 13% of Black Americans carry the high-risk recessive genotypes, only a fraction of these individuals develops FSGS or kidney failure, indicating the involvement of additional disease modifiers. Here, we show that the presence of the APOL1 p.N264K missense variant, when co-inherited with the G2 APOL1 risk allele, substantially reduces the penetrance of the G1G2 and G2G2 high-risk genotypes by rendering these genotypes low-risk. These results align with prior functional evidence showing that the p.N264K variant reduces the toxicity of the APOL1 high-risk alleles. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of APOL1 -associated nephropathy, as well as for the clinical management of individuals with high-risk genotypes that

In addition to splice site variants, a number of synonymous and missense DLG4 variants are predicted to exert their effect through altered RNA splicing, although the pathogenicity of these variants is uncertain without functional RNA studies. Here, we describe a young boy with a deep intronic DLG4 variant (c.2105+235C>T) identified using whole genome sequencing. By using reverse-transcription PCR on RNA derived from peripheral blood, we demonstrate that DLG4 mRNA expression is detectable in blood and the deep intronic variant gives rise to two alternative DLG4 transcripts, one of which includes a pseudoexon. Both alternative transcripts are out-of-frame and predicted to result in protein-truncation, thereby establishing the genetic diagnosis for the proband. This adds to the evidence concerning the pathogenic potential of deep intronic variants and underlines the importance of functional studies, even in cases where reported tissue-specific gene expression might suggest otherwise.", "Keywords": ["DLG4", "DLG4-related synaptopathy", "PSD-95", "alternative splicing", "deep intronic variant", "epilepsy", "intellectual disability", "neurodevelopmental disorder", "pseudoexon"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Humans", "Introns", "Mutation", "RNA Splicing", "Mutation, Missense", "RNA", "Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda M", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Kennedy Center, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Mythily", "Last Name": "Ganapathi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeynep", "Last Name": "T\u00fcmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Kennedy Center, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark."}], "Journal": "Clinical genetics", "PubDate": "2024Jan"}, {"PMID": "37517035", "Title": "Biallelic MED27 variants lead to variable ponto-cerebello-lental degeneration with movement disorders.", "Abstract": "MED27 is a subunit of the Mediator multiprotein complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. Biallelic MED27 variants have recently been suggested to be responsible for an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with spasticity, cataracts and cerebellar hypoplasia. We further delineate the clinical phenotype of MED27-related disease by characterizing the clinical and radiological features of 57 affected individuals from 30 unrelated families with biallelic MED27 variants. Using exome sequencing and extensive international genetic data sharing, 39 unpublished affected individuals from 18 independent families with biallelic missense variants in MED27 have been identified (29 females, mean age at last follow-up 17 \u00b1 12.4 years, range 0.1-45). Follow-up and hitherto unreported clinical features were obtained from the published 12 families. Brain MRI scans from 34 cases were reviewed. MED27-related disease manifests as a broad phenotypic continuum ranging from developmental and epileptic-dyskinetic encephalopathy to variable neurodevelopmental disorder with movement abnormalities. It is characterized by mild to profound global developmental delay/intellectual disability (100%), bilateral cataracts (89%), infantile hypotonia (74%), microcephaly (62%), gait ataxia (63%), dystonia (61%), variably combined with epilepsy (50%), limb spasticity (51%), facial dysmorphism (38%) and death before reaching adulthood (16%). Brain MRI revealed cerebellar atrophy (100%), white matter volume loss (76.4%), pontine hypoplasia (47.2%) and basal ganglia atrophy with signal alterations (44.4%). Previously unreported 39 affected individuals had seven homozygous pathogenic missense MED27 variants, five of which were recurrent. An emerging genotype-phenotype correlation was observed. This study provides a comprehensive clinical-radiological description of MED27-related disease, establishes genotype-phenotype and clinical-radiological correlations and suggests a differential diagnosis with syndromes of cerebello-lental neurodegeneration and other subtypes of 'neuro-MEDopathies'.", "Keywords": ["cerebellar atrophy", "cerebello-lental degeneration", "dystonia", "gene

subfamily 2 group F member 2 (NR2F2 or COUP-TF2) encodes a transcription factor which is expressed at high levels during mammalian development. Rare heterozygous Mendelian variants in NR2F2 were initially identified in individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD), then subsequently in cohorts of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and 46,XX ovotesticular disorders/differences of sexual development (DSD); however, the phenotypic spectrum associated with pathogenic variants in NR2F2 remains poorly characterized. Currently, less than 40 individuals with heterozygous pathogenic variants in NR2F2 have been reported. Here, we review the clinical and molecular details of 17 previously unreported individuals with rare heterozygous NR2F2 variants, the majority of which were de novo. Clinical features were variable, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), CHD, CDH, genital anomalies, DSD, developmental delays, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, congenital and acquired microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, renal failure, hearing loss, strabismus, asplenia, and vascular malformations, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with NR2F2 variants. The variants seen were predicted loss of function, including a nonsense variant inherited from a mildly affected mosaic mother, missense and a large deletion including the NR2F2 gene. Our study presents evidence for rare, heterozygous NR2F2 variants causing a highly variable syndrome of congenital anomalies, commonly associated with heart defects, developmental delays/intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and genital anomalies.

attention neural networks.", "Abstract": "Accurate prediction of damaging missense variants is critically important for interpreting a genome sequence. Although many methods have been developed, their performance has been limited. Recent advances in machine learning and the availability of large-scale population genomic sequencing data provide new opportunities to considerably improve computational predictions. Here we describe the graphical missense variant pathogenicity predictor (gMVP), a new method based on graph attention neural networks. Its main component is a graph with nodes that capture predictive features of amino acids and edges weighted by co-evolution strength, enabling effective pooling of information from the local protein context and functionally correlated distal positions. Evaluation of deep mutational scan data shows that gMVP outperforms other published methods in identifying damaging variants in TP53, PTEN, BRCA1 and MSH2. Furthermore, it achieves the best separation of de novo missense variants in neuro developmental disorder cases from those in controls. Finally, the model supports transfer learning to optimize gain- and loss-of-function predictions in sodium and calcium channels. In summary, we demonstrate that gMVP can improve interpretation of missense variants in clinical testing and genetic studies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haicang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle S", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Columbia College, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature machine intelligence", "PubDate": "2022Nov"}, {"PMID": "37479106", "Title": "Factors influencing creatine kinase-MM concentrations in newborns and implications for newborn screening for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.", "Abstract": "Newborn screening for Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be performed via a first-tier creatine kinase-MM measurement followed by reflex testing to second-tier molecular analysis of the DMD gene.

Nor do we fully appreciate the phenotypic diversity beyond the formal autism diagnosis. Based on data from more than 13,000 individuals with autism and 210,000 undiagnosed individuals, we estimated the odds ratios for autism associated to rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants in 185 genes associated with autism, alongside 2,492 genes displaying intolerance to LoF variants. In contrast to autism-centric approaches, we investigated the correlates of these variants in individuals without a diagnosis of autism. We show that these variants are associated with a small but significant decrease in fluid intelligence, qualification level and income and an increase in metrics related to material deprivation. These effects were larger for autism-associated genes than in other LoF-intolerant genes. Using brain imaging data from 21,040 individuals from the UK Biobank, we could not detect significant differences in the overall brain anatomy between LoF carriers and non-carriers. Our results highlight the importance of studying the effect of the genetic variants beyond categorical diagnosis and the need for more research to understand the association between these variants and

The DHPS enzyme functions in mRNA translation by catalyzing the post-translational modification, and therefore activation, of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). The observed clinical outcomes associated with human mutations in DHPS include developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. Therefore, to increase our understanding of this rare disease, it is critical to determine the mechanisms by which mutations in DHPS alter neurodevelopment. In this study, we have generated patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines and demonstrated that human DHPS variants alter DHPS protein abundance and impair enzyme function. Moreover, we observe a shift in the abundance of the post-translationally modified forms of eIF5A; specifically, an increase in the nuclear localized acetylated form (eIF5AAcK47) and concomitant decrease in the cytoplasmic localized hypusinated form (eIF5AHYP). Generation and characterization of a mouse model with a genetic deletion of Dhps in the brain at birth shows that loss of hypusine biosynthesis impacts neuronal function due to impaired eIF5AHYP-dependent mRNA translation; this translation defect results in altered expression of proteins required for proper neuronal development and function. This study reveals new insight into the biological consequences and molecular impact of human DHPS deficiency and provides valuable information toward the goal of developing treatment strategies for this rare disease.", "Keywords": ["DHPS", "DHPS deficiency", "eIF5A", "hypusination", "hypusine", "mRNA translation", "neurodevelopment", "rare disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Mice", "Homeostasis", "Mutation", "Peptide Initiation Factors", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Rare Diseases", "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors", "Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leah R", "Last Name": "Padgett", "Affiliation": "Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mollie R", "Last Name": "Shinkle", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Spencer", "Last Name": "Rosario", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY 14203, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy Murray", "Last Name": "Stewart", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jackson R", "Last Name": "Foley", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Casero", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA."}, {"First Name": "Myung Hee", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4340, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teresa L", "Last Name": "Mastracci", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA."}], "Journal": "HGG advances", "PubDate": "2023Jul13"}, {"PMID": "37333246", "Title": "Selection, optimization, and validation of ten chronic disease polygenic risk scores for clinical implementation in diverse populations.", "Abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have improved in predictive performance supporting their use in clinical practice.

We assessed PRS performance, medical actionability, and potential clinical utility for 23 conditions. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. Ten conditions were selected with a range of high-risk thresholds: atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer, asthma, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. We developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation, used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, created a framework for regulatory compliance, and developed a PRS clinical report.

Using exome sequencing and targeted segregation analysis, we investigated the genetic etiology of peripheral neuropathy and hearing loss in a large Ashkenazi Jewish family. Moreover, we assessed the production of the candidate protein via western blotting of lysates from fibroblasts from an affected individual and an unaffected control. Pathogenic variants in known disease genes associated with hearing loss and peripheral neuropathy were excluded. A homozygous frameshift variant in the BICD1 gene, c.1683dup (p.(Arg562Thrfs*18)), was identified in the proband and segregated with hearing loss and peripheral neuropathy in the family. The BIDC1 RNA analysis from patient fibroblasts showed a modest reduction in gene transcripts compared to the controls. In contrast, protein could not be detected in fibroblasts from a homozygous c.1683dup individual, whereas BICD1 was detected in an unaffected individual. Our findings indicate that bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in BICD1 are associated with hearing loss and peripheral neuropathy.

This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60\u2009min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.", "Keywords": ["electronic health records", "metadata", "phenotype"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First

Misfolding and deposition of transthyretin or prealbumin protein causes ATTR-CM in the context of a normal (wild-type) or variant TTR sequence. Variant ATTR-CM is most commonly caused by the substitution of valine for isoleucine at position 122 in transthyretin (Val122Ile or pV142I, almost exclusively observed in individuals of West African ancestry), demonstrated in 3.4% of self-identified Black individuals in the United States with an estimated 1.5\u2009million carriers. Despite the large number of known pV142I carriers, the proportion of older Black patients with heart failure attributable to ATTR-CM remains unknown. Methods To address this knowledge gap, the SCAN-MP (Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis with Nuclear Imaging in Minority Populations) study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01HL139671) to enroll a targeted population of self-identified, community-dwelling Black or Caribbean Hispanic patients (many of whom are of West African ancestry) >60\u2009years of age with heart failure and identify ATTR-CM by noninvasive nuclear imaging. The principal objective of SCAN-MP is to determine the prevalence of ATTR-CM in this population. Secondary objectives will explore TTR genotype, demographics, progression of variant versus wild-type ATTR-CM, and biochemical mechanisms of transthyretin amyloid fibril formation. Conclusions The SCAN-MP study is the largest, prospective study of cardiac amyloidosis in Black and Hispanic individuals. Both wild-type and variant ATTR-CM are now treatable with the US Food and Drug-approved drug tafamidis. The insights gained from SCAN-MP are likely to improve those at risk for or afflicted with ATTR-CM.

Recurrent de novo missense mutations have been discovered in B56\u03b4 (encoded by PPP2R5D), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), that cause intellectual disabilities (ID), macrocephaly, Parkinsonism, and a broad range of neurological symptoms. Single-particle cryo-EM structures show that the PP2A-B56\u03b4 holoenzyme possesses closed latent and open active forms. In the closed form, the long, disordered arms of B56\u03b4 termini fold against each other and the holoenzyme core, establishing dual autoinhibition of the phosphatase active site and the substrate-binding protein groove. The resulting interface spans over 190 \u00c5 and harbors unfavorable contacts, activation phosphorylation sites, and nearly all residues with ID-associated mutations. Our studies suggest that this dynamic interface is close to an allosteric network responsive to activation phosphorylation and altered globally by mutations. Furthermore, we found that ID mutations perturb the activation phosphorylation rates, and the severe variants significantly increase the mitotic duration and error rates compared to the wild variant.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cheng-Guo", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vijaya K", "Last Name": "Balakrishnan", "Affiliation": "McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pankaj S", "Last Name": "Parihar", "Affiliation": "McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kirill", "Last Name": "Konovolov", "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu-Chia", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Merrill", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "New York Structural biology Center, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Carragher", "Affiliation": "New York Structural biology Center, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ramya", "Last Name": "Sundaresan", "Affiliation": "McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Metcalf Center for Science & Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian E", "Last Name": "Wadzinski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark R", "Last Name": "Swingle", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alla", "Last Name": "Musiyenko", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Honkanen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aussie", "Last Name": "Suzuki", "Affiliation": "McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Strack", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuhui", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Biophysics program, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yongna", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Oncology, University of Wisconsin at Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Apr05"}, {"PMID": "37057675", "Title": "LHX2 haploinsufficiency causes a variable neurodevelopmental disorder.", "Abstract": "LHX2 encodes the LIM homeobox 2 transcription factor (LHX2), which is highly expressed in brain and well conserved across species, but it has not been clearly linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) to date.", "Keywords": ["ASD", "Intellectual disability", "LHX2", "Microcephaly", "NDD", "Neurodevelopmental disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "LIM-Homeodomain Proteins", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Haploinsufficiency", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Transcription Factors", "Intellectual Disability"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cosima M", "Last Name": "Schmid", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Inselspital Bern, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland;

Heterozygous missense variants in BSN have previously been associated with neurodegenerative disorders in humans. We performed an exome-wide association analysis of ultra-rare variants in about 140,000 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank to search for new genes associated with obesity. We found that rare heterozygous predicted loss of function (pLoF) variants in BSN are associated with higher BMI with log10-p value of 11.78 in the UK biobank cohort. The association was replicated in the All of Us whole genome sequencing data. Additionally, we have identified two individuals (one of whom has a de novo variant) with a heterozygous pLoF variant in a cohort of early onset or extreme obesity at Columbia University. Like the individuals identified in the UKBB and All of us Cohorts, these individuals have no history of neurobehavioral or cognitive disability.

We aimed to assess the associations of CHEK2 c.1100delC, radiotherapy, and systemic treatment with CBC risk and BCSS. Analyses were based on 82,701 women diagnosed with invasive BC including 963 CHEK2 c.1100delC carriers; median follow-up was 9.1 years. Differential associations of treatment by CHEK2 c.1100delC status were tested by including interaction terms in a multivariable Cox regression model. A multi-state model was used for further insight into the relation between CHEK2 c.1100delC status, treatment, CBC risk and death. There was no evidence for differential associations of therapy with CBC risk by CHEK2 c.1100delC status The strongest association with reduced CBC risk was observed for the combination of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy [HR(95%CI): 0.66 (0.55-0.78)]. No association was observed with radiotherapy. Results from the multi-state model showed shorter BCSS for CHEK2 c.1100delC carriers versus non-carriers also after accounting for CBC occurrence [HR(95%CI) :1.30 (1.09-1.56)]. In conclusion, systemic therapy was associated with reduced CBC risk irrespective of CHEK2 c.1100delC status. Moreover, CHEK2 c.1100delC carriers had shorter BCSS, which appears not to be fully explained by their CBC risk.

"36757831", "Title": "The clinical and genetic spectrum of autosomal-recessive TOR1A-related disorders.", "Abstract": "In the field of rare diseases, progress in molecular diagnostics led to the recognition that variants linked to autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative diseases of later onset can, in the context of biallelic inheritance, cause devastating neurodevelopmental disorders and infantile or childhood-onset neurodegeneration. TOR1A-associated arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5 (AMC5) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder arising from biallelic variants in TOR1A, a gene that in the heterozygous state is associated with torsion dystonia-1 (DYT1 or DYT-TOR1A), an early-onset dystonia with reduced penetrance. While 15 individuals with AMC5-TOR1A have been reported (less than 10 in detail), a systematic investigation of the full disease-associated spectrum has not been conducted. Here, we assess the clinical, radiological and molecular characteristics of 57 individuals from 40 families with biallelic variants in TOR1A. Median age at last follow-up was 3 years (0-24 years). Most individuals presented with severe congenital flexion contractures (95%) and variable developmental delay (79%). Motor symptoms were reported in 79% and included lower limb spasticity and pyramidal signs, as well as gait disturbances. Facial dysmorphism was an integral part of the phenotype, with key features being a broad/full nasal tip, narrowing of the forehead and full cheeks. Analysis of disease-associated manifestations delineated a phenotypic spectrum ranging from normal cognition and mild gait disturbance to congenital arthrogryposis, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, absent speech and inability to walk. In a subset, the presentation was consistent with foetal akinesia deformation sequence with severe intrauterine abnormalities. Survival was 71%, with higher mortality in males. Death occurred at a median age of 1.2 months (1 week-9 years), due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest or sepsis. Analysis of brain MRI studies identified non-specific neuroimaging features, including a hypoplastic corpus callosum (72%), foci of signal abnormality in the subcortical and periventricular white matter (55%), diffuse white matter volume loss (45%), mega cisterna magna (36%) and arachnoid cysts (27%). The molecular spectrum included 22 distinct variants, defining a mutational hotspot in the C-terminal domain of the Torsin-1A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed an association of missense variants in the 3-helix bundle domain to an attenuated phenotype, while missense variants near the Walker A/B motif as well as biallelic truncating variants were linked to early death. In summary, this systematic cross-sectional analysis of a large cohort of individuals with biallelic TOR1A variants across a wide age-range delineates the clinical and genetic spectrum of TOR1A-related autosomal-recessive disease and highlights potential predictors for disease severity and survival.", "Keywords": ["AMC5", "NDD", "Torsin-1A", "arthrogryposis multiplex congenita 5", "biallelic variation"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Humans", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Dystonia", "Dystonic Disorders", "Nervous System Malformations", "Molecular Chaperones"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Afshin", "Last Name": "Saffari", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy", "Last Name": "Lau", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Homa", "Last Name": "Tajsharghi", "Affiliation": "School of Health Sciences, Division of Biomedicine, University of Skovde, Skovde, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Ehsan Ghayoor", "Last Name": "Karimiani", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Clinical Sciences Institute, St. George's, University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ariana", "Last Name": "Kariminejad", "Affiliation": "Kariminejad-Najmabadi Pathology & Genetics Center, Tehran, Iran."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Efthymiou", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Zifarelli", "Affiliation": "CENTOGENE GmbH, Am Strande 7, 18055 Rostock, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tipu", "Last Name": "Sultan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mehran Beiraghi", "Last Name": "Toosi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"First Name": "Sahar", "Last Name": "Sedighzadeh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"First Name": "Victoria Mok", "Last Name": "Siu", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Juan Dar\u00edo", "Last Name": "Ortigoza-Escobar", "Affiliation": "Movement Disorders Unit, Pediatric Neurology Department, Institut de Recerca, Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Aisha M", "Last Name": "AlShamsi", "Affiliation": "Genetic Division, Pediatrics Department, Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, UAE."}, {"First Name": "Shahnaz", "Last Name": "Ibrahim", "Affiliation": "Department of pediatrics and child Health, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Nouriya Abbas", "Last Name": "Al-Sannaa", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Services, John Hopkins Aramco Health Care, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Walla", "Last Name": "Al-Hertani", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Genetics and Genomics, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Whalen", "Last Name": "Sandra", "Affiliation": "APHP UF de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Clinique, Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Anomalies du D\u00e9veloppement et Syndromes Malformatifs, APHP, H\u00f4pital Armand Trousseau, ERN ITHACA, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Tarnopolsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics (MT -

The generation of population and disease-specific data, development of computational tools, and new understandings of the relationship of specific genes to disorders can all trigger changes in variant classification that may have important implications for patients and the clinicians caring for them. This is a particular concern for patients from groups underrepresented in current reference datasets, since they have higher rates of uncertain findings. Here we identify the challenges to implementing a systematic approach to variant reinterpretation and propose solutions. In particular, we address (a) the infrastructure needed to support implementation of systematic variant reinterpretation, (b) the issues around obtaining consent from patients for reinterpretation, (c) the process for triggering reinterpretation, (d) pathways for the flow of reinterpreted data, (e) considerations for how to cover the costs of reinterpretation, and (f) practical issues related to implementation of processes and policies that address these issues, including the importance of a fixed duration during which there is an expectation that variants will be reinterpreted.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Genetic Testing", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sara M", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Elly", "Last Name": "Brokamp", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genomics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Henry Shelton", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Management, Policy and Community Health, UT Health School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Austin Regional Campus, Austin, TX."}, {"First Name": "Wylie", "Last Name": "Burke", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioethics and Humanities, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Ellen Wright", "Last Name": "Clayton", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society, School of Law, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Barbara J", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Levin College of Law, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; Wertheim College of Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL."}, {"First Name": "Rizwan", "Last Name": "Hamid", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Gary E", "Last Name": "Marchant", "Affiliation": "Center for Law, Science & Innovation, Sandra Day O'Connor School of Law, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ."}, {"First Name": "Donna M", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Bridget C", "Last Name": "O'Connor", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 A", "Last Name": "Pag\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Policy and Management, School of Global Public Health, New York University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Parens", "Affiliation": "Hastings Center Initiative in Bioethics, The Hastings Center, Garrison, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jessica L", "Last Name": "Roberts", "Affiliation": "Health Law & Policy Institute Humanities, University of Houston Law Center, Houston, TX; College of Medicine, University of Houston, Houston, TX."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Rowe", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Avalon Health Economics LLC, Morristown, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Karolynn", "Last Name": "Siegel", "Affiliation": "Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Veenstra", "Affiliation": "The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy and Economics (CHOICE) Institute, School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY.

Inframe insertion and deletion variants (indels) alter protein sequence and length, but not as deleterious as frameshift indels. Inframe indel Interpretation is challenging due to limitations in the available number of known pathogenic variants for training. Existing prediction methods largely use manually encoded features including conservation, protein structure and function, and allele frequency to infer variant pathogenicity. Recent advances in deep learning modeling of protein sequences and structures provide an opportunity to improve the representation of salient features based on large numbers of protein sequences. We developed a new pathogenicity predictor for SHort Inframe iNsertion and dEletion (SHINE). SHINE uses pretrained protein language models to construct a latent representation of an indel and its protein context from protein sequences and multiple protein sequence alignments, and feeds the latent representation into supervised machine learning models for pathogenicity prediction. We curated training data from ClinVar and gnomAD, and created two test datasets from different sources. SHINE achieved better prediction performance than existing methods for both deletion and insertion variants in these two test datasets.

In addition to the most prevalent disease gene, BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2), several genes, some belonging to distinct functional classes, are also now known to predispose to the development of PAH. As a consequence, specialist and non-specialist clinicians and healthcare professionals are increasingly faced with a range of questions regarding the need for, approaches to and benefits/risks of genetic testing for PAH patients and/or related family members. We provide a consensus-based approach to recommendations for genetic counselling and assessment of current best practice for disease gene testing. We provide a framework and the type of information to be provided to patients and relatives through the process of genetic counselling, and describe the presently known disease causal genes to be analysed. Benefits of including molecular genetic testing within the management protocol of patients with PAH include the identification of individuals misclassified by other diagnostic approaches, the optimisation of phenotypic characterisation for aggregation of outcome data, including in clinical trials, and importantly through cascade screening, the detection of healthy causal variant carriers, to whom regular assessment should be offered.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension", "Genetic Counseling", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Mutation", "Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension", "Genetic Testing", "Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type II", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christina A", "Last Name": "Eichstaedt", "Affiliation": "Center for Pulmonary Hypertension, Thoraxklinik Heidelberg gGmbH at Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Catharina", "Last Name": "Belge", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and Thoracic Surgery (BREATHE), Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism (CHROMETA), Clinical Department of Respiratory Diseases, University Hospitals, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Gr\u00e4f", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Heart and Lung Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ekkehard", "Last Name": "Gr\u00fcnig", "Affiliation": "Center for Pulmonary Hypertension, Thoraxklinik Heidelberg gGmbH at Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Montani", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, AP-HP, French Referral Center for Pulmonary Hypertension, Pulmonary Department, H\u00f4pital de Bic\u00eatre, Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre, France."}, {"First Name": "Rozenn", "Last Name": "Quarck", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and Thoracic Surgery (BREATHE), Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism (CHROMETA), Clinical Department of Respiratory Diseases, University Hospitals, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Jair A", "Last Name": "Tenorio-Castano", "Affiliation": "INGEMM, Instituto de Gen\u00e9tica M\u00e9dica y Molecular, IdiPAZ, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Florent", "Last Name": "Soubrier", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, AP-HP, D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique, INSERM UMR_S1166, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Institute for Cardiometabolism and Nutrition (ICAN), H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Richard C", "Last Name": "Trembath", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas W", "Last Name": "Morrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Heart and Lung Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK nwm23@cam.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "for PAH-ICON associated with the PVRI", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The European respiratory journal", "PubDate": "2023Feb"}, {"PMID": "36278620", "Title": "Newborn Screening for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: First Year Results of a Population-Based Pilot.", "Abstract": "Advancements in therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have made diagnosis within the newborn period a high priority.

This manuscript describes the formation of the Duchenne Newborn Screening Consortium, the development of the pilot protocols, data collection tools including parent surveys, and findings from the first year of a two-year pilot. The DMD pilot design is population-based recruitment of infants born in New York State. Data tools were developed to document the analytical and clinical validity of DMD NBS, capture parental attitudes, and collect longitudinal health information for diagnosed newborns. Data visualizations were updated monthly to inform the consortium on enrollment. After 12 months, 15,754 newborns were screened for DMD by the New York State Newborn Screening (NYS NBS) Program. One hundred and forty screened infants had borderline screening results, and sixteen infants were referred for molecular testing. Three male infants were diagnosed with dystrophinopathy. Data from the first year of a two-year NBS pilot for DMD demonstrate the feasibility of NBS for DMD. The consortia approach was found to be a useful model, and the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network's data tools played a key role in describing the NBS pilot findings and engaging stakeholders.", "Keywords": ["Duchenne muscular dystrophy", "dystrophinopathy", "newborn screening", "pilot", "recommended uniform screening panel", "therapy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Hartnett", "Affiliation": "American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), Bethesda, MD 20814, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michele A", "Last Name": "Lloyd-Puryear", "Affiliation": "American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), Bethesda, MD 20814, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norma P", "Last Name": "Tavakoli", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY 12208, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Wynn", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie L", "Last Name": "Koval-Burt", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dorota", "Last Name": "Gruber", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Cohen Children's Medical Center, Northwell Health, New Hyde Park, NY 11040, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy", "Last Name": "Trotter", "Affiliation": "American Academy of Pediatrics, Itasca, IL 60143, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Caggana", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY 12208, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Niki", "Last Name": "Armstrong", "Affiliation": "Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Washington, DC 20005, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy M", "Last Name": "Brower", "Affiliation": "American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), Bethesda, MD 20814, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of neonatal screening", "PubDate": "2022Sep22"}, {"PMID": "36257857", "Title": "RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics for treatment of rare neurologic diseases.", "Abstract": "Advances in genome sequencing have greatly facilitated the identification of genomic variants underlying rare neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

DMD is a multi-system disease resulting in muscle weakness with progressive deterioration of skeletal, heart, and smooth muscle, and learning disabilities. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin protein, cause dystrophinopathy. All males with a P/LP variant in the X-linked DMD gene are expected to be affected. Two to 20% of female heterozygotes with a P/LP variant develop symptoms of dystrophinopathy ranging from mild muscle weakness to significant disability similar to Becker muscular dystrophy. Recently, with improvements in therapies and testing methodology, there is stronger evidence supporting newborn screening (NBS) for DMD for males and females because females may also develop symptoms. A consented pilot study to screen newborns for DMD was initiated in New York State (NYS) and conducted from 2019 to 2021. The identification of female carriers and the realization of the subsequent uncertainty of providers concerning follow-up during the pilot led to the development of algorithms for screening and diagnosis of carrier females, including both NBS and cascade molecular testing of family members.", "Keywords": ["duchenne muscular dystrophy", "dystrophinopathy", "female carrier", "newborn screening"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Male", "Infant, Newborn", "Female", "Humans", "Dystrophin", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Neonatal Screening", "Muscle Weakness", "Pilot Projects", "Algorithms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dorota", "Last Name": "Gruber", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Cohen Children's Medical Center, Northwell Health, New Hyde Park, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Lloyd-Puryear", "Affiliation": "Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (Retired), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Niki", "Last Name": "Armstrong", "Affiliation": "Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Washington, District of Columbia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mena", "Last Name": "Scavina", "Affiliation": "Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Washington, District of Columbia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norma P", "Last Name": "Tavakoli", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy M", "Last Name": "Brower", "Affiliation": "American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Caggana", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

They contribute to key cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, organelle dynamics and cell division. Pathogenic variants in kinesin-encoding genes underlie several human diseases characterized by an extremely variable clinical phenotype, ranging from isolated neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorders to syndromic phenotypes belonging to a family of conditions collectively termed as 'ciliopathies.' Among kinesins, kinesin-1 is the most abundant MT motor for transport of cargoes towards the plus end of MTs. Three kinesin-1 heavy chain isoforms exist in mammals. Different from KIF5A and KIF5C, which are specifically expressed in neurons and established to cause neurological diseases when mutated, KIF5B is an ubiquitous protein. Three de novo missense KIF5B variants were recently described in four subjects with a syndromic skeletal disorder characterized by kyphomelic dysplasia, hypotonia and DD/ID. Here, we report three dominantly acting KIF5B variants (p.Asn255del, p.Leu498Pro and p.Leu537Pro) resulting in a clinically wide phenotypic spectrum, ranging from dilated cardiomyopathy with adult-onset ophthalmoplegia and progressive skeletal myopathy to a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by severe hypotonia with or without seizures. In vitro and in vivo analyses provide evidence that the identified disease-associated KIF5B variants disrupt lysosomal, autophagosome and mitochondrial organization, and impact cilium biogenesis. All variants, and one of the previously reported missense changes, were shown to affect multiple developmental processes in zebrafish. These findings document pleiotropic consequences of aberrant KIF5B function on development and cell homeostasis, and expand the phenotypic spectrum resulting from altered kinesin-mediated processes.",

and completeness of the rare disease phenotypes in the underlying annotation knowledgebase. Existing knowledgebases are often manually curated with additional annotations found in published case reports. Despite their potential, real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) have not been fully exploited to derive rare disease annotations. Here, we present open annotation for rare diseases (OARD), a real-world-data-derived resource with annotation for rare-disease-related phenotypes. This resource is derived from the EHRs of two academic health institutions containing more than 10 million individuals spanning wide age ranges and different disease subgroups. By leveraging ontology mapping and advanced natural-language-processing (NLP) methods, OARD automatically and efficiently extracts concepts for both rare diseases and their phenotypic traits from billing codes and lab tests as well as over 100 million clinical narratives. The rare disease prevalence derived by OARD is highly correlated with those annotated in the original rare disease knowledgebase. By performing association analysis, we identified more than 1 million novel disease-phenotype association pairs that were previously missed by human annotation, and >60% were confirmed true associations via manual review of a list of sampled pairs. Compared to the manual curated annotation, OARD is 100% data driven and its pipeline can be shared across different institutions. By supporting privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated summary statistics, such as term frequencies and disease-phenotype associations, it fills an important gap to facilitate data-driven research in the rare disease community.", "Keywords": ["electronic health records", "human phenotype ontology", "knowledge graph", "natural language processing", "open data sharing", "phenotype association", "rare disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Electronic Health Records", "Humans", "Natural Language Processing", "Phenotype", "Rare Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Casey N", "Last Name": "Ta", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jim M", "Last Name": "Havrilla", "Affiliation": "Raymond G.

More recently, bi-allelic variants in COLEC10 have been described to be associated with 3MC syndrome. Syndromic features seen in 3MC syndrome are thought to be due to disruption of the chemoattractant properties that influence neural crest cell migration. We identified nine individuals from five families of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with homozygosity of the c.311G\u2009>\u2009T (p.Gly104Val) variant in COLEC10 and phenotype consistent with 3MC syndrome. Carrier frequency was calculated among 52,278 individuals of Jewish descent. Testing revealed 400 carriers out of 39,750 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, giving a carrier frequency of 1 in 99 or 1.01%. Molecular protein modeling suggested that the p.Gly104Val substitution alters local conformation. The c.311G\u2009>\u2009T (p.Gly104Val) variant likely represents a founder variant, and homozygosity is associated with features of 3MC syndrome. 3MC syndrome should be in the differential diagnosis for individuals with short stature, radioulnar synostosis, cleft lip and cleft palate.", "Keywords": ["3MC syndrome", "Ashkenazi Jewish", "COLEC10", "carrier screening", "clinical genetics"], "MeSH terms": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Cleft Lip", "Cleft Palate", "Collectins", "Humans", "Jews", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Radius", "Synostosis", "Ulna"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Rabin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoel", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Dor Yeshorim, Committee for Prevention Jewish Genetic Diseases, Brooklyn, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Josef", "Last Name": "Ekstein", "Affiliation": "Dor Yeshorim, Committee for Prevention Jewish Genetic Diseases, Brooklyn, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ephrat", "Last Name": "Levy-Lahad", "Affiliation": "Medical Genetics Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Shachar", "Last Name": "Zuckerman", "Affiliation": "Medical Genetics Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Hagar", "Last Name": "Mor-Shaked", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Vardiella", "Last Name": "Meiner", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Kevin T", "Last Name": "Booth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Pappas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

CJS is associated with heterozygous variants in PHIP (Pleckstrin-Homology Interacting Protein), a gene that encodes one of several substrate receptors for Cullin4-RING (CRL4) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Full length PHIP, also called DCAF14, was recently identified to function as a replication stress response protein. Herein, we report the identification of two PHIP missense variants identified by exome sequencing in unrelated individuals with CJS. The variants p.D488V and p.E963G occur in different functional elements of DCAF14- WD40 repeat domain and pleckstrin homology-binding region (PBR), respectively. Using DNA fiber assays, we reveal that cells expressing either variant exhibit defective replication fork progression in conditions of replication stress. Furthermore, unlike wild type DCAF14, both variants fail to accomplish DNA replication after exposure to genotoxic stress indicating a critical role of DCAF14 in protecting stalled replication forks.

Using trio exome sequencing, we identified rare bi-allelic pathogenic missense and truncating DOHH variants segregating with disease in five affected individuals from four unrelated families.

Objectives: To compile and functionally characterize all TBX4 variants reported to date and undertake a comprehensive genotype-phenotype analysis. Methods: We assembled a multicenter cohort of 137 patients harboring monoallelic TBX4 variants and assessed the pathogenicity of missense variation (n\u2009=\u200942) using a novel luciferase reporter assay containing T-BOX binding motifs. We sought genotype-phenotype correlations and undertook a comparative analysis with patients with PAH with BMPR2 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor type 2) causal variants (n\u2009=\u2009162) or no identified variants in PAH-associated genes (n\u2009=\u2009741) genotyped via the National Institute for Health Research BioResource-Rare Diseases. Measurements and Main Results: Functional assessment of TBX4 missense variants led to the novel finding of gain-of-function effects associated with older age at diagnosis of lung disease compared with loss-of-function effects (P\u2009=\u20090.038). Variants located in the T-BOX and nuclear localization domains were associated with earlier presentation (P\u2009=\u20090.005) and increased incidence of interstitial lung disease (P\u2009=\u20090.003). Event-free survival (death or transplantation) was shorter in the T-BOX group (P\u2009=\u20090.022), although age had a significant effect in the hazard model (P\u2009=\u20090.0461). Carriers of TBX4 variants were diagnosed at a younger age (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and had worse baseline lung function (FEV1, FVC) (P\u2009=\u20090.009) than the BMPR2 and no identified causal variant groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that TBX4 syndrome is not strictly the result of haploinsufficiency but can also be caused by gain of function. The pleiotropic effects of TBX4 in lung disease may be in part explained by the differential effect of pathogenic mutations located in critical protein domains.", "Keywords": ["TBX4",

Functional studies showed that some variants displayed impaired membrane transport and impaired excitatory synapse-promoting effects. Strikingly, these variations abolished the ability of SLITRK2 wild-type to reduce the levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in neurons. Moreover, Slitrk2 conditional knockout mice exhibited impaired long-term memory and abnormal gait, recapitulating a subset of clinical features of patients with SLITRK2 variants. Furthermore, impaired excitatory synapse maintenance induced by hippocampal CA1-specific cKO of Slitrk2 caused abnormalities in spatial reference memory.

With the decreasing cost of sequencing and the improving methods to interpret genetic data, there is an opportunity to add DNA sequencing as a screening method to facilitate the identification of babies with treatable conditions that cannot be identified in any other scalable way, including highly penetrant genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). However, the lack of effective dietary or drug-based treatments has made it nearly impossible to consider NDDs in the current NBS framework, yet it is anticipated that any treatment will be maximally effective if started early. Hence there is a critical need for large scale pilot studies to assess if and how NDDs can be effectively screened at birth, if parents desire that information, and what impact early diagnosis may have. Here we attempt to provide an overview of the recent advances in NDD treatments, explore the possible framework of setting up a pilot study to genetically screen for NDDs, highlight key technical, practical, and ethical considerations and challenges, and examine the policy and health system implications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Humans", "Neonatal Screening", "Pilot Projects", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Parents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan S", "Last Name": "Berg", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey R", "Last Name": "Botkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven E", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey P", "Last Name": "Brosco", "Affiliation": "Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyle B", "Last Name": "Brothers", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Currier", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Gaviglio", "Affiliation": "Connetics Consulting, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walter E", "Last Name": "Kowtoniuk", "Affiliation": "Third Rock Ventures, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Steinhardt Graduate School of Education, New York University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Lloyd-Puryear", "Affiliation": "American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annamarie", "Last Name": "Saarinen", "Affiliation": "Newborn Foundation, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mustafa", "Last Name": "Sahin", "Affiliation": "Rosamund Stone Zander Translational Neuroscience Center, Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elliott H", "Last Name": "Sherr", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Institute of Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Washington University (Adjunct), St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhanzhi", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

However, only a fraction of individuals who are candidates for testing pursue this option. Therefore, it is important to understand those factors that impact the uptake of genetic testing in individuals affected and unaffected with cancer. A successful translation of genomic risk stratification into clinical care will require that providers of this information are aware of the attitudes, perceived risks and benefits, and concerns of individuals who will be considering testing. The purpose of this study was to assess beliefs, attitudes and preferences for genetic risk information, by personal characteristics of women affected and unaffected by breast cancer enrolled in the Breast Cancer Family Registry Cohort. Data for this analysis came from eight survey questions, which asked participants (N\u00a0=\u00a09,048, 100% female) about their opinions regarding genetic information. Women reported that conveying the accuracy of the test was important and were interested in information related to personal level of risk, finding out about diseases that could be treated, and information that could be helpful to their families. Young women were most interested in how their own health needs might be impacted by genetic test results, while older women were more interested in how genetic information would benefit other members of the family. Interest in how the genetic test was performed was highest among Asian and Hispanic women. Women affected with breast cancer were more likely to report feeling sad about possibly passing down a breast cancer gene, while unaffected women were more uncertain about their future risk of cancer.

However, genetic susceptibility factors shared between these disease categories remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized pleiotropy across 107 circulatory system and 40 nervous system traits using an ensemble of methods in the eMERGE Network and UK Biobank. Using a formal test of pleiotropy, five genomic loci demonstrated statistically significant evidence of pleiotropy. We observed region-specific patterns of direction of genetic effects for the two disease categories, suggesting potential antagonistic and synergistic pleiotropy.

Such VUS findings can frustrate the goals of genetic testing, create anxiety in patients, and lead to unnecessary medical interventions. Approaches to addressing underrepresentation of people with genetic ancestries other than European are being undertaken by broad-based recruitment efforts. However, some underrepresented groups have concerns that might preclude participation in such efforts. We describe here two initiatives aimed at meeting the needs of underrepresented ancestry groups in genomic datasets. The two communities, the Sephardi Jewish community in New York and First Peoples of Canada, have very different concerns about contributing to genomic research and datasets. Sephardi concerns focus on the possible negative effects of genetic findings on the marriage prospects of family members. Canadian Indigenous populations seek control over the research uses to which their genetic data would be put. Both cases involve targeted efforts to respond to the groups' concerns; these efforts include governance models aimed at ensuring that the data are used primarily to inform clinical test analyses and at achieving successful engagement and participation of community members. We suggest that these initiatives could provide models for other ancestral groups seeking to improve the accuracy and utility of clinical genetic testing while respecting the underlying preferences and values of community members with regard to the use of their genetic data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Canada", "Ethnicity", "Family", "Genetic Testing", "Genomics", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Although the aetiology remains unknown, CDH has a polygenic origin in approximately one-third of cases. CDH is typically diagnosed with antenatal ultrasonography, which also aids in risk stratification, alongside fetal MRI and echocardiography. At specialized centres, prenatal management includes fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion, which is a surgical intervention aimed at promoting lung growth in utero. Postnatal management focuses on cardiopulmonary stabilization and, in severe cases, can involve extracorporeal life support. Clinical practice guidelines continue to evolve owing to the rapidly changing landscape of therapeutic options, which include pulmonary hypertension management, ventilation strategies and surgical approaches.

Most complex V subunits are nuclear encoded and not yet associated with recognized Mendelian disorders. Using exome sequencing, we identified a rare homozygous splice variant (c.87+3A>G) in ATP5PO, the complex V subunit which encodes the oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein, in three individuals from two unrelated families, with clinical suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. These individuals had a similar, severe infantile and often lethal multi-systemic disorder that included hypotonia, developmental delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, progressive epileptic encephalopathy, progressive cerebral atrophy, and white matter abnormalities on brain MRI consistent with Leigh syndrome. cDNA studies showed a predominant shortened transcript with skipping of exon 2 and low levels of the normal full-length transcript. Fibroblasts from the affected individuals demonstrated decreased ATP5PO protein, defective assembly of complex V with markedly reduced amounts of peripheral stalk proteins, and complex V hydrolytic activity. Further, expression of human ATP5PO cDNA without exon 2 (hATP5PO-\u2206ex2) in yeast cells deleted for yATP5 (ATP5PO homolog) was unable to rescue growth on media which requires oxidative phosphorylation when compared to the wild type construct (hATP5PO-WT), indicating that exon 2 deletion leads to a non-functional protein. Collectively, our findings support the pathogenicity of the ATP5PO c.87+3A>G variant, which significantly reduces but does not eliminate complex V activity. These data along with the recent report of an affected individual with ATP5PO variants, add to the evidence that rare biallelic variants in ATP5PO result in defective complex V assembly, function and

Previous studies indicate that rare or de novo genetic variants significantly contribute to EA/TEF risk, and most individuals with EA/TEF do not have pathogenic genetic variants in established risk genes. To identify the genetic contributions to EA/TEF, we performed whole genome sequencing of 185 trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF, including 59 isolated and 126 complex cases with additional congenital anomalies and/or neurodevelopmental disorders. There was a significant burden of protein-altering de novo coding variants in complex cases (p\u00a0= 3.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-4), especially in genes that are intolerant of loss-of-function variants in the population. We performed simulation analysis of pathway enrichment based on background mutation rate and identified a number of pathways related to endocytosis and intracellular trafficking that as a group have a significant burden of protein-altering de novo variants.

A case report suggesting we are getting closer.", "Abstract": "Despite therapeutic advances over the past decades, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and related pulmonary vascular diseases continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonates, infants, and children. Unfortunately, an adequate understanding of underlying biology is lacking. There has been a growing interest in the role that genetic factors influence pulmonary vascular disease, with the hope that genetic information may aid in identifying disease etiologies, guide therapeutic decisions, and ultimately identify novel therapeutic targets. In fact, current data suggest that genetic factors contribute to ~42% of pediatric-onset PH compared to ~12.5% of adult-onset PAH. We report a case in which the knowledge that biallelic ATP13A3 mutations are associated with malignant progression of PAH in young childhood, led us to alter our traditional treatment plan for a 21-month-old PAH patient. In this case, we elected to perform a historically high-risk Potts shunt before expected rapid deterioration. Short-term follow-up is encouraging, and the patient remains the only known surviving pediatric PAH patient with an associated biallelic ATP13A3 mutation in the literature. We speculate that an increased use of comprehensive genetic testing can aid in identifying the underlying pathobiology and the expected natural history, and guide treatment plans among PAH patients.",

Pre-pandemic, all recruitment was in-person with research staff visiting the postpartum patients 1-2 days after delivery to obtain consent. With the onset of pandemic, the multilingual research staff shifted to calling new mothers while they were in the hospital or shortly after discharge, and consent was collected via emailed e-consent links. With return of study staff to the hospitals, a hybrid approach was implemented with in-person recruitment for babies delivered during the weekdays and remote recruitment for babies delivered on weekends and holidays, a cohort not recruited pre-pandemic. There was a drop in the proportion of eligible babies enrolled with the transition to fully remote recruitment from 64% to 38%. In addition, the proportion of babies enrolled after being approached dropped from 91% to 55%. With hybrid recruitment, the proportion of eligible babies enrolled (70%) and approached babies enrolled (84%) returned to pre-pandemic levels.

also identify genetic variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUSs). Only a minority of VUSs are likely to prove pathogenic when later reassessed, but resolution of the uncertainty is rarely timely. That uncertainty adds complexity to clinical decision making and can result in harms and costs to patients and the health care system, including the time-consuming analysis required to interpret a VUS and the potential for unnecessary treatment and adverse psychological effects. Current efforts to improve variant interpretation will help reduce the scope of the problem, but the high prevalence of rare and novel variants in the human genome points to VUSs as an ongoing challenge. Additional strategies can help mitigate the potential harms of VUSs, including testing protocols that limit identification or reporting of VUSs, subclassification of VUSs according to the likelihood of pathogenicity, routine family-based evaluation of variants, and enhanced counseling efforts. All involve tradeoffs, and the appropriate balance of measures is likely to vary for different test uses and clinical settings. Cross-specialty deliberation and public input could contribute to systematic and broadly supported policies for managing VUSs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Probability", "Uncertainty"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wylie", "Last Name": "Burke", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioethics and Humanities, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington (W.B.)."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Parens", "Affiliation": "The Hastings Center, Garrison, New York (E.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York (W.K.C.)."}, {"First Name": "Sara M", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York (S.M.B.)."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York (P.S.A.)."}], "Journal": "Annals of internal medicine", "PubDate": "2022Jul"}, {"PMID": "35421074", "Title": "Notes from the Field: Wound Botulism Outbreak Among a Group of Persons Who Inject Drugs - Dallas, Texas, 2020.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Botulism", "Clostridium botulinum", "Disease Outbreaks", "Drug Users", "Humans", "Substance Abuse, Intravenous", "Texas"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leslie D", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivorry", "Last Name": "Gomez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Wada", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erin M", "Last Name": "Swaney", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michelle B", "Last Name": "Caruthers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Irina", "Last Name": "Cody", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Farrell A", "Last Name": "Tobolowsky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janet", "Last Name": "Dykes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Ford", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth R", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chelsey T", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "MMWR.

MtDNAcns were calculated and rare, non-synonymous mtDNA mutations were identified in 1,837 CHD-affected proband-parent trios, 116 CHD-affected singletons, and 114 paired cardiovascular tissue/blood samples. The variant allele fraction (VAF) of heteroplasmic variants in mitochondrial RNA from 257 CHD cardiovascular tissue samples was also calculated. On average, mtDNA from blood had 0.14 rare variants and 52.9 mtDNA copies per nuclear genome per proband. No variation with parental age at proband birth or CHD-affected proband age was seen. mtDNAcns in valve/vessel tissue (320 \u00b1 70) were lower than in atrial tissue (1,080 \u00b1 320, p\u00a0= 6.8E-21), which were lower than in ventricle tissue (1,340 \u00b1 280, p\u00a0= 1.4E-4). The frequency of rare variants in CHD-affected individual DNA was indistinguishable from the frequency in an unaffected cohort, and proband mtDNAcns did not vary from those of CHD cohort parents. In both the CHD and the comparison cohorts, mtDNAcns were significantly correlated between mother-child, father-child, and mother-father. mtDNAcns among people with European (mean\u00a0= 52.0), African (53.0), and Asian haplogroups (53.5) were calculated and were significantly different for European and Asian haplogroups (p\u00a0= 2.6E-3). Variant heteroplasmic fraction (HF) in blood correlated well with paired cardiovascular tissue HF (r\u00a0= 0.975) and RNA VAF (r\u00a0= 0.953), which suggests blood HF is a reasonable proxy for HF in heart tissue. We conclude that mtDNA mutations and mtDNAcns are unlikely to contribute significantly to CHD risk.", "Keywords": ["congenital heart disease", "genome sequencing", "mitochondrial copy number", "mitochondrial genome"], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Copy Number Variations", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jon A L", "Last Name": "Willcox", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua T", "Last Name": "Geiger", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah U", "Last Name": "Morton", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Division of Newborn Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "McKean", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Quiat", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Cardiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua M", "Last Name": "Gorham", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela C", "Last Name": "Tai", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "DePalma", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Bernstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina", "Last Name": "Brueckner", "Affiliation": "Departments of Genetics and Pediatric Cardiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10019, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Giardini", "Affiliation": "Cardiorespiratory Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Goldmuntz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan R", "Last Name": "Kaltman", "Affiliation": "Heart Development and Structural Diseases Branch, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, NHLBI/NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Cardiothoracic Surgery, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jane W", "Last Name": "Newburger", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10019, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deepak", "Last Name": "Srivastava", "Affiliation": "Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Tristani-Firouzi", "Affiliation": "Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Gelb", "Affiliation": "Mindich Child Health and Development Institute and Departments of Pediatrics, Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "George A", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "J G", "Last Name": "Seidman", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

FBXW7 (F-box and WD-repeat-domain-containing 7), a recognized developmental regulator and tumor suppressor, has been shown to regulate cell-cycle progression and cell growth and survival by targeting substrates including CYCLIN E1/2 and NOTCH for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system. We used a genotype-first approach and global data-sharing platforms to identify 35 individuals harboring de novo and inherited FBXW7 germline monoallelic chromosomal deletions and nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and missense variants associated with a neurodevelopmental syndrome. The FBXW7 neurodevelopmental syndrome is distinguished by global developmental delay, borderline to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and gastrointestinal issues. Brain imaging detailed variable underlying structural abnormalities affecting the cerebellum, corpus collosum, and white matter. A crystal-structure model of FBXW7 predicted that missense variants were clustered at the substrate-binding surface of the WD40 domain and that these might reduce FBXW7 substrate binding affinity. Expression of recombinant FBXW7 missense variants in cultured cells demonstrated impaired CYCLIN E1 and CYCLIN E2 turnover. Pan-neuronal knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog, archipelago, impaired learning and neuronal function.

pathogenic variants: Further delineation of the phenotype and genotype.", "Abstract": "Homozygous pathogenic variants in WDR45B were first identified in six subjects from three unrelated families with global development delay, refractory seizures, spastic quadriplegia, and brain malformations. Since the initial report in 2018, no further cases have been described. In this report, we present 12 additional individuals from seven unrelated families and their clinical, radiological, and molecular findings. Six different variants in WDR45B were identified, five of which are novel. Microcephaly and global developmental delay were observed in all subjects, and seizures and spastic quadriplegia in most. Common findings on brain imaging include cerebral atrophy, ex vacuo ventricular dilatation, brainstem volume loss, and symmetric under-opercularization. El-Hattab-Alkuraya syndrome is associated with a consistent phenotype characterized by early onset cerebral atrophy resulting in microcephaly, developmental delay, spastic quadriplegia, and seizures. The phenotype appears to be more severe among individuals with loss-of-function variants whereas those with missense variants were less severely affected suggesting a potential genotype-phenotype correlation in this disorder. A brain imaging pattern emerges which is consistent among individuals with loss-of-function variants and could potentially alert the neuroradiologists or clinician to consider WDR45B-related El-Hattab-Alkuraya syndrome.", "Keywords": ["WDR45B", "autophagy", "autosomal recessive (AR) trait", "brain atrophy", "neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD)"], "MeSH terms": ["Atrophy", "Bone Diseases, Metabolic", "Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Microcephaly", "Nervous System Malformations", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Quadriplegia", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mohammed", "Last Name": "Almannai", "Affiliation": "Genetics and Precision Medicine Department (GPM), King Abdullah Specialized Children's Hospital (KASCH), King Abdulaziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNG-HA), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Dana", "Last Name": "Marafi", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ghada M H", "Last Name": "Abdel-Salam", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Department, Human Genetics and Genome Research Institute National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Maha S", "Last Name": "Zaki", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Department, Human Genetics and Genome Research Institute National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Ruizhi", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Calame", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isabella", "Last Name": "Herman", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Felix", "Last Name": "Levesque", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics and Metabolic, Department of Paediatrics, Jim Pattison Children's Hospital, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hasnaa M", "Last Name": "Elbendary", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Department, Human Genetics and Genome Research Institute National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Ibrahim", "Last Name": "Hegazy", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Department, Human Genetics and Genome Research Institute National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haluk", "Last Name": "Kavus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kolsoum", "Last Name": "Saeidi", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Institute of Neuropharmacology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}, {"First Name": "Reza", "Last Name": "Maroofian", "Affiliation": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Aqeela", "Last Name": "AlHashim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, National Neuroscience Institute, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Al-Otaibi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, National Neuroscience Institute, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Asma", "Last Name": "Al Madhi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, National Neuroscience Institute, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Hager M", "Last Name": "Abou Al-Seood", "Affiliation": "Section of Medical Genetics, Children's Hospital, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Alasmari", "Affiliation": "Section of Medical Genetics, Children's Hospital, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Houlden", "Affiliation": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Joseph G", "Last Name": "Gleeson", "Affiliation": "Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jill V", "Last Name": "Hunter", "Affiliation": "E.B.

To date, TIAM1 has not been associated with a Mendelian disorder. Here, we describe five individuals with bi-allelic TIAM1 missense variants who have developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, and seizures. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that these variants are rare and likely pathogenic. We found that the Drosophila ortholog of TIAM1, still life (sif), is expressed in larval and adult central nervous system (CNS) and is mainly expressed in a subset of neurons, but not in glia. Loss of sif reduces the survival rate, and the surviving adults exhibit climbing defects, are prone to severe seizures, and have a short lifespan. The TIAM1 reference (Ref) cDNA partially rescues the sif loss-of-function (LoF) phenotypes. We also assessed the function associated with three TIAM1 variants carried by two of the probands and compared them to the TIAM1 Ref cDNA function in\u00a0vivo. TIAM1 p.Arg23Cys has reduced rescue ability when compared to TIAM1 Ref, suggesting that it is a partial LoF variant. In ectopic expression studies, both wild-type sif and TIAM1 Ref are toxic, whereas the three variants (p.Leu862Phe, p.Arg23Cys, and p.Gly328Val) show reduced toxicity, suggesting that they are partial LoF variants. In summary, we provide evidence that sif is important for appropriate neural function and that TIAM1 variants observed in the probands are disruptive, thus implicating loss of TIAM1 in neurological phenotypes in humans.", "Keywords": ["Drosophila", "Sif", "TIAM1", "developmental delay", "intellectual disability", "seizures", "speech delay", "still life"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Child", "DNA, Complementary", "Developmental Disabilities", "Drosophila", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Phenotype", "Seizures", "T-Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis-inducing Protein 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shenzhao", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Hernan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul C", "Last Name": "Marcogliese", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy S", "Last Name": "Gertler", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Ann & Robert H.

ABCC8 encodes SUR1, a regulatory subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel Kir6.2. However, the pathophysiological role of the SUR1/Kir6.2 channel in PAH is unknown. We hypothesized that activation of SUR1 could be a novel potential target for PAH. We analyzed the expression of SUR1/Kir6.2 in the lungs and pulmonary artery (PA) in human PAH or experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH). The contribution of SUR1 in human or rat PA tone was evaluated, and we measured the consequences of in\u00a0vivo activation of SUR1 in control and PH rats. SUR1 and Kir6.2 protein expression was not reduced in the lungs or human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells from PAH or experimentally induced PH. We showed that pharmacological activation of SUR1 by three different SUR1 activators (diazoxide, VU0071063, and NN414) leads to PA relaxation. Conversely, the inhibition of SUR1/Kir6.2 channels causes PA constriction. In vivo, long- and short-term activation of SUR1 with diazoxide reversed monocrotaline-induced PH in rats. In addition, in\u00a0vivo diazoxide application (short protocol) reduced the severity of PH in chronic-hypoxia rats. Moreover, 3 weeks of diazoxide exposure in control rats had no cardiovascular effects. Finally, in\u00a0vivo, activation of SUR1 with NN414 reduced monocrotaline-induced PH in rats.

Disease severity varies widely among POGZ patients and studies investigating genotype-phenotype association are scarce. Therefore, our aim was to collect data on previously unreported POGZ patients and perform a large-scale phenotype-genotype comparison from published data. Overall, 117 POGZ patients' genotype and phenotype data were included in the analysis, including 12 novel patients. A severity scoring system was developed for the comparison. Mild and severe phenotypes were compared with the types and location of the variants and the predicted presence or absence of nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD). Missense variants were more often associated with mild phenotypes (p = 0.0421) and truncating variants predicted to escape NMD presented with more severe phenotypes (p < 0.0001). Within this group, variants in the prolin-rich region of the POGZ protein were associated with the most severe phenotypes (p = 0.0004). Our study suggests that gain-of-function or dominant negative effect through escaping NMD and the location of the variants in the prolin-rich domain of the protein may play an important role in the severity of manifestations of POGZ-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Keywords": ["POGZ gene", "White-Sutton syndrome", "clinical scoring", "deep facial gestalt analysis", "genotype-phenotype

analyses of Robinow syndrome: WNT signaling perturbation and phenotypic variability.", "Abstract": "Robinow syndrome (RS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with six genes that converge on the WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway implicated (DVL1, DVL3, FZD2, NXN, ROR2, and WNT5A). RS is characterized by skeletal dysplasia and distinctive facial and physical characteristics. To further explore the genetic heterogeneity, paralog contribution, and phenotypic variability of RS, we investigated a cohort of 22 individuals clinically diagnosed with RS from 18 unrelated families. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes associated with RS or RS phenocopies were identified in all 22 individuals, including the first variant to be reported in DVL2. We retrospectively collected medical records of 16 individuals from this cohort and extracted clinical descriptions from 52 previously published cases. We performed Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) based quantitative phenotypic analyses to dissect allele-specific phenotypic differences. Individuals with FZD2 variants clustered into two groups with demonstrable phenotypic differences between those with missense and truncating alleles. Probands with biallelic NXN variants clustered together with the majority of probands carrying DVL1, DVL2, and DVL3 variants, demonstrating no phenotypic distinction between the NXN-autosomal recessive and dominant forms of RS. While phenotypically similar diseases on the RS differential matched through HPO analysis, clustering using phenotype similarity score placed RS-associated phenotypes in a unique cluster containing WNT5A, FZD2, and ROR2 apart from non-RS-associated paralogs. Through human phenotype analyses of this RS cohort and OMIM clinical synopses of Mendelian disease, this study begins to tease apart specific biologic roles for non-canonical WNT-pathway proteins.",

ovarian cancer (EOC) have the potential to improve risk stratification. Joint estimation of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) effects in models could improve predictive performance over standard approaches of PRS construction. Here, we implemented computationally efficient, penalized, logistic regression models (lasso, elastic net, stepwise) to individual level genotype data and a Bayesian framework with continuous shrinkage, \"select and shrink for summary statistics\" (S4), to summary level data for epithelial non-mucinous ovarian cancer risk prediction. We developed the models in a dataset consisting of 23,564 non-mucinous EOC cases and 40,138 controls participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC) and validated the best models in three populations of different ancestries: prospective data from 198,101 women of European ancestries; 7,669 women of East Asian ancestries; 1,072 women of African ancestries, and in 18,915 BRCA1 and 12,337 BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers of European ancestries. In the external validation data, the model with the strongest association for non-mucinous EOC risk derived from the OCAC model development data was the S4 model (27,240 SNPs) with odds ratios (OR) of 1.38 (95% CI: 1.28-1.48, AUC: 0.588) per unit standard deviation, in women of European ancestries; 1.14 (95% CI: 1.08-1.19, AUC: 0.538) in women of East Asian ancestries; 1.38 (95% CI: 1.21-1.58, AUC: 0.593) in women of African ancestries; hazard ratios of 1.36 (95% CI: 1.29-1.43, AUC: 0.592) in BRCA1 pathogenic variant carriers and 1.49 (95% CI: 1.35-1.64, AUC: 0.624) in BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers.

"Abstract": "To understand the genetic contribution to primary pediatric cardiomyopathy, we performed exome sequencing in a large cohort of 528 children with cardiomyopathy. Using clinical interpretation guidelines and targeting genes implicated in cardiomyopathy, we identified a genetic cause in 32% of affected individuals. Cardiomyopathy sub-phenotypes differed by ancestry, age at diagnosis, and family history. Infants < 1 year were less likely to have a molecular diagnosis (p < 0.001). Using a discovery set of 1,703 candidate genes and informatic tools, we identified rare and damaging variants in 56% of affected individuals. We see an excess burden of damaging variants in affected individuals as compared to two independent control sets, 1000 Genomes Project (p < 0.001) and SPARK parental controls (p < 1\u00a0\u00d7 10-16). Cardiomyopathy variant burden remained enriched when stratified by ancestry, variant type, and sub-phenotype, emphasizing the importance of understanding the contribution of these factors to genetic architecture. Enrichment in this discovery candidate gene set suggests multigenic mechanisms underlie sub-phenotype-specific causes and presentations of cardiomyopathy. These results identify important information about the genetic architecture of pediatric cardiomyopathy and support recommendations for clinical genetic testing in children while illustrating differences in genetic architecture by age, ancestry, and sub-phenotype and providing rationale for larger studies to investigate multigenic contributions.", "Keywords": ["ancestry", "bioinformatics", "clinical interpretation", "exome", "heart", "infant", "molecular diagnosis", "variant"], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Exome", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Humans", "Inheritance Patterns", "Male", "Phenotype", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie M", "Last Name": "Ware", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.

For neurogenetic conditions associated with intellectual disability and ASD, data on natural history in adults are scarce; however, as older adults with these disorders are identified, it is becoming clear that some conditions are associated with both neurodevelopmental problems and neurodegeneration. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that some neurogenetic conditions associated primarily with neurodegeneration also affect neurodevelopment.

We studied 6,761 women postmenopausal at baseline with a wide range of familial risk from 2,364 families in the Prospective Family Study Cohort. Participants were followed for on average 11.45 years and there were 416 incident breast cancers. We used Cox regression to estimate risk associations with log-transformed weight and BMI after adjusting for underlying familial risk. We compared model fits using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and nested models using the likelihood ratio test. The AIC for the weight-only model was 6.22 units lower than for the BMI-only model, and the log risk gradient was 23% greater. Adding BMI or height to weight did not improve fit (\u0394AIC = 0.90 and 0.83, respectively; both P = 0.3). Conversely, adding weight to BMI or height gave better fits (\u0394AIC = 5.32 and 11.64; P = 0.007 and 0.0002, respectively). Adding height improved only the BMI model (\u0394AIC = 5.47; P = 0.006). There was no evidence that the BMI or weight associations differed by underlying familial risk (P > 0.2). Weight is more informative than BMI for predicting breast cancer risk, consistent with nonadipose as well as adipose tissue being etiologically relevant. The independent but multiplicative associations of weight and familial risk suggest that, in terms of absolute breast cancer risk, the association with weight is more important the greater a woman's

malformations in up to 60% of patients. Mortality and morbidity remain high despite advances in pre-, intra-, and postnatal management. We review the current literature and give an overview about the genetics of CDH to provide guidelines for clinicians with respect to genetic diagnostics and counseling for families. Until recently, the common practice was (molecular) karyotyping or chromosome microarray if the CDH diagnosis is made prenatally with a 10% diagnostic yield. Undiagnosed patients can be reflexed to trio exome/genome sequencing with an additional diagnostic yield of 10 to 20%. Even with a genetic diagnosis, there can be a range of clinical outcomes. All families with a child with CDH with or without additional malformations should be offered genetic counseling and testing in a family-based trio approach.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Counseling", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Humans", "Karyotyping"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Charlotte", "Last Name": "Bendixen", "Affiliation": "Department of General, Visceral, Vascular and Thoracic Surgery, Unit of Pediatric Surgery, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Erwin", "Last Name": "Brosens", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Wendy Kay", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

The function of QRICH1 is largely unknown but it is likely to play a key role in the unfolded response of endoplasmic reticulum stress through transcriptional control of proteostasis. In this study, we present 27 additional individuals and delineate the clinical and molecular spectrum of the individuals (n\u2009=\u200938) with QRICH1 variants. The main clinical features were mild to moderate developmental delay/ID (71%), nonspecific facial dysmorphism (92%) and hypotonia (39%). Additional findings included poor weight gain (29%), short stature (29%), autism spectrum disorder (29%), seizures (24%) and scoliosis (18%). Minor structural brain abnormalities were reported in 52% of the individuals with brain imaging. Truncating or splice variants were found in 28 individuals and 10 had missense variants. Four variants were inherited from mildly affected parents. This study confirms that heterozygous QRICH1 variants cause a neurodevelopmental disorder including short stature and expands the phenotypic spectrum to include poor weight gain, scoliosis, hypotonia, minor structural brain anomalies, and seizures.

Through simulations and applications to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing data for multiple diseases and traits, we show that the proposed test increases the power over state-of-the-art gene-based tests in the literature, identifies genes that replicate in larger studies, and can provide a more narrow focus on the possible causal genes at a locus by reducing the confounding effect of linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, our results show that incorporating genetic variation in distal regulatory elements tends to improve power over conventional tests.

However, cascade testing depends on communication of results to family members. While the barriers and facilitators of family communication have been researched following clinical genetic testing, the factors impacting the dissemination of genomic screening results are unknown. Using the pragmatic Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network-3 (eMERGE-3) study, we explored the reported sharing practices of participants who underwent genomic screening across the United States. Six eMERGE-3 sites returned genomic screening results for mostly dominant medically actionable disorders and surveyed adult participants regarding communication of results with first-degree relatives. Across the sites, 279 participants completed a 1-month and/or 6-month post-results survey. By 6\u00a0months, only 34% of the 156 respondents shared their results with all first-degree relatives and 4% did not share with any. Over a third (39%) first-degree relatives were not notified of the results. Half (53%) of participants who received their results from a genetics provider shared them with all first-degree relatives compared with 11% of participants who received their results from a non-genetics provider. The most frequent reasons for sharing were a feeling of obligation (72%) and that the information could help family members make medical decisions (72%). The most common reasons indicated for not sharing were that the family members were too young (38%), or they were not in contact (25%) or not close to them (25%). These data indicate that the professional returning the results may impact sharing patterns, suggesting that there is a need to continue to educate healthcare providers regarding approaches to facilitate sharing of genetic results within families. Finally, these data suggest that interventions to increase sharing may be universally effective regardless of the origin of the genetic result.", "Keywords": ["cascade testing", "communication",

large cohorts are necessary for dissecting subtypes of autism, and intellectual disability is one of the most robust endophenotypes for analysis. However, current cognitive assessment methods are not feasible at scale. We developed five commonly used machine learning models to predict cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80 and FSIQ<70) and FSIQ scores among 521 children with autism using parent-reported online surveys in SPARK, and evaluated them in an independent set (n\u00a0=\u00a01346) with a missing data rate up to 70%. We assessed accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity by comparing predicted cognitive levels against clinical IQ data. The elastic-net model has good performance (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.876, sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.772, specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.803) using 129 predictive features to impute cognitive impairment (FSIQ<80). Top-ranked predictive features included parent-reported language and cognitive levels, age at autism diagnosis, and history of services. Prediction of FSIQ<70 and FSIQ scores also showed good performance. We show cognitive levels can be imputed with high accuracy for children with autism, using commonly collected parent-reported data and standardized surveys. The current model offers a method for large-scale autism studies seeking estimates of cognitive ability when standardized psychometric testing is not feasible. LAY SUMMARY: Children with autism who have more severe learning challenges or cognitive impairment have different needs that are important to consider in research studies. When children in our study were missing standardized cognitive testing scores, we were able to use machine learning with other information to correctly \"guess\" when they have cognitive impairment about 80% of the time. We can use this information in research in the future to develop more appropriate treatments for children with autism and cognitive impairment.", "Keywords": ["autism", "cognitive impairment", "imputation", "intelligence quotient", "machine learning"], "MeSH terms": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Intelligence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "LeeAnne", "Last Name": "Green Snyder", "Affiliation": "Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, Simons Foundation, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "SPARK Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "PubDate": "2022Jan"}, {"PMID": "34626583", "Title": "Bi-allelic variants in SPATA5L1 lead to intellectual disability, spastic-dystonic cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and hearing loss.", "Abstract": "Spermatogenesis-associated 5 like 1 (SPATA5L1) represents an orphan gene encoding a protein of unknown function. We report 28 bi-allelic variants in SPATA5L1 associated with sensorineural hearing loss in 47 individuals from 28 (26 unrelated) families. In addition, 25/47 affected individuals (53%) presented with microcephaly, developmental delay/intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and/or epilepsy. Modeling indicated damaging effect of variants on the protein, largely via destabilizing effects on protein domains. Brain imaging revealed diminished cerebral volume, thin corpus callosum, and periventricular leukomalacia, and quantitative volumetry demonstrated significantly diminished white matter volumes in several individuals. Immunofluorescent imaging in rat hippocampal neurons revealed localization of Spata5l1 in neuronal and glial cell nuclei and more prominent expression in neurons. In the rodent inner ear, Spata5l1 is expressed in the neurosensory hair cells and inner ear supporting cells. Transcriptomic analysis performed with fibroblasts from affected individuals was able to distinguish affected from controls by principal components. Analysis of differentially expressed genes and networks suggested a role for SPATA5L1 in cell surface adhesion receptor function, intracellular focal adhesions, and DNA replication and mitosis. Collectively, our results indicate that bi-allelic SPATA5L1 variants lead to a human disease characterized by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with or without a nonprogressive mixed neurodevelopmental phenotype.", "Keywords": ["AAA+ superfamily", "ATPase", "SPATA5L1", "cerebral palsy", "epilepsy", "intellectual disability", "movement disorder", "neurodevelopmental disorder", "sensorineural hearing loss"], "MeSH terms": ["ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Alleles", "Animals", "Cerebral Palsy", "Child, Preschool", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Muscle Spasticity", "Rats", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elodie M", "Last Name": "Richard", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Somayeh", "Last Name": "Bakhtiari", "Affiliation": "Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ 85016, USA;

Onasemnogene abeparvovec (formerly AVXS-101) is a gene therapy that restores SMN production via one-time systemic administration. The present study demonstrates widespread biodistribution of vector genomes and transgenes throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs, after intravenous administration of an AAV9-mediated gene therapy. Two symptomatic infants with SMA1 enrolled in phase III studies received onasemnogene abeparvovec. Both patients died of respiratory complications unrelated to onasemnogene abeparvovec. One patient had improved motor function and the other died shortly after administration before appreciable clinical benefit could be observed. In both patients, onasemnogene abeparvovec DNA and messenger RNA distribution were widespread among peripheral organs and in the CNS. The greatest concentration of vector genomes was detected in the liver, with an increase over that detected in CNS tissues of 300-1,000-fold. SMN protein, which was low in an untreated SMA1 control, was clearly detectable in motor neurons, brain, skeletal muscle and multiple peripheral organs in treated patients.

The clinical findings included a prenatal presentation of microcephaly, polyhydramnios and clenched hands while postnatal findings included microcephaly, severe developmental delay, dysmorphism, neurologic deficits, and death in infancy. A shared rare homozygous, missense variant (c.274A\u2009>\u2009G; p.Ser92Gly, NM_024516.4) was identified in PAGR1, a gene currently not associated with a Mendelian disease. PAGR1 encodes a component of the histone methyltransferase MLL2/MLL3 complex and may function in the DNA damage response pathway. Complete knockout of the murine Pagr1a is embryonic-lethal. Given the available evidence, PAGR1 is a strong candidate gene for a novel autosomal recessive severe syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder.", "Keywords": ["Ashkenazi Jews", "PAGR1", "infantile-lethal disorder", "microcephaly", "neurodevelopmental disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Exome", "Humans", "Mice", "Microcephaly", "Nervous System Malformations", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Pedigree"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hagit", "Last Name": "Daum", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Hadassah Medical Organization and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Mythily", "Last Name": "Ganapathi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoel", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Dor Yeshorim, Committee for Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases, Brooklyn, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily L", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles A", "Last Name": "LeDuc", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Hagen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simcha", "Last Name": "Yagel", "Affiliation": "Obstetrics and gynecology, Hadassah Medical Organization and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Vardiella", "Last Name": "Meiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Hadassah Medical Organization and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hagar", "Last Name": "Mor-Shaked", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Hadassah Medical Organization and Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

Although the role of genetics in the pathogenesis of CDH has been established, only a small number of disease-associated genes have been identified. To further investigate the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 827 proband-parent trios and confirmed an overall significant enrichment of damaging de novo variants, especially in constrained genes. We identified LONP1 (lon peptidase 1, mitochondrial) and ALYREF (Aly/REF export factor) as candidate CDH-associated genes on the basis of de novo variants at a false discovery rate below 0.05. We also performed ultra-rare variant association analyses in 748 affected individuals and 11,220 ancestry-matched population control individuals and identified LONP1 as a risk gene contributing to CDH through both de novo and ultra-rare inherited largely heterozygous variants clustered in the core of the domains and segregating with CDH in affected familial individuals. Approximately 3% of our CDH cohort who are heterozygous with ultra-rare predicted damaging variants in LONP1 have a range of clinical phenotypes, including other anomalies in some individuals and higher mortality and requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mice with lung epithelium-specific deletion of Lonp1 die immediately after birth, most likely because of the observed severe reduction of lung growth, a known contributor to the high mortality in humans. Our findings of both de novo and inherited rare variants in the same gene may have implications in the design and analysis for other genetic studies of congenital anomalies.", "Keywords": ["ALYREF", "LONP1", "congenital diaphragmatic hernia", "de novo variants"], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Dependent Proteases", "Animals", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Craniofacial Abnormalities", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Eye Abnormalities", "Female", "Growth Disorders", "Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital", "Hip Dislocation, Congenital", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Mutation, Missense", "Osteochondrodysplasias", "Pedigree", "Tooth Abnormalities"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA;

The first discovered EH was EPHX1, also known as mEH. EH functions remain partly unknown, and no pathogenic variants have been reported in humans. We identified two de novo variants located in EPHX1 catalytic site in patients with a lipoatrophic diabetes characterized by loss of adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and multiple organ dysfunction. Functional analyses revealed that these variants led to the protein aggregation within the endoplasmic reticulum and to a loss of its hydrolysis activity. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated EPHX1 knockout (KO) abolished adipocyte differentiation and decreased insulin response. This KO also promoted oxidative stress and cellular senescence, an observation confirmed in patient-derived fibroblasts. Metreleptin therapy had a beneficial effect in one patient.

Its occurrence at a single site in one cellular protein defines hypusine synthesis as one of the most specific post-translational modifications. Synthesis of hypusine involves two enzymatic steps: first, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) cleaves the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine and transfers it to the \u03b5-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the eIF5A precursor protein to form an intermediate, deoxyhypusine [N\u03b5-(4-aminobutyl)lysine]. This intermediate is subsequently hydroxylated by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) to form hypusine in eIF5A. eIF5A, DHPS, and DOHH are highly conserved in all eukaryotes, and both enzymes exhibit a strict specificity toward eIF5A substrates. eIF5A promotes translation elongation globally by alleviating ribosome stalling and it also facilitates translation termination. Hypusine is required for the activity of eIF5A, mammalian cell proliferation, and animal development. Homozygous knockout of any of the three genes, Eif5a, Dhps, or Dohh, leads to embryonic lethality in mice. eIF5A has been implicated in various human pathological conditions. A recent genetic study reveals that heterozygous germline EIF5A variants cause Faundes-Banka syndrome, a craniofacial-neurodevelopmental malformations in humans. Biallelic variants of DHPS were identified as the genetic basis underlying a rare inherited neurodevelopmental disorder. Furthermore, biallelic DOHH variants also appear to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorder. The clinical phenotypes of these patients include intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, microcephaly, growth impairment, and/or facial dysmorphisms. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of eIF5A and the hypusine modification pathway in neurodevelopment in humans.", "Keywords": ["Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase", "Deoxyhypusine synthase", "Hypusine", "Neurodevelopment", "Post-translational modification", "Translation", "eIF5A"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Lysine", "Mice", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors", "Peptide Initiation Factors", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Myung Hee", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry Section, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. mhpark@nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh Kumar", "Last Name": "Kar", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry Section, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Siddharth", "Last Name": "Banka", "Affiliation": "Division of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Alban", "Last Name": "Ziegler", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of Angers, Angers, France."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Amino acids", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "34257418", "Title": "Neptune: an environment for the delivery of genomic medicine.", "Abstract": "Genomic medicine holds great promise for improving health care, but integrating searchable and actionable genetic data into electronic health records (EHRs) remains a challenge.

disorder with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy.", "Abstract": "Adaptor protein (AP) complexes mediate selective intracellular vesicular trafficking and polarized localization of somatodendritic proteins in neurons. Disease-causing alleles of various subunits of AP complexes have been implicated in several heritable human disorders, including intellectual disabilities (IDs). Here, we report two bi-allelic (c.737C>A [p.Pro246His] and c.1105A>G [p.Met369Val]) and eight de novo heterozygous variants (c.44G>A [p.Arg15Gln], c.103C>T [p.Arg35Trp], c.104G>A [p.Arg35Gln], c.229delC [p.Gln77Lys\u221711], c.399_400del [p.Glu133Aspfs\u221737], c.747G>T [p.Gln249His], c.928-2A>C [p.?], and c.2459C>G [p.Pro820Arg]) in AP1G1, encoding gamma-1 subunit of adaptor-related protein complex 1 (AP1\u03b31), associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) characterized by mild to severe ID, epilepsy, and developmental delay in eleven families from different ethnicities. The AP1\u03b31-mediated adaptor complex is essential for the formation of clathrin-coated intracellular vesicles. In silico analysis and 3D protein modeling simulation predicted alteration of AP1\u03b31 protein folding for missense variants, which was consistent with the observed altered AP1\u03b31 levels in heterologous cells. Functional studies of the recessively inherited missense variants revealed no apparent impact on the interaction of AP1\u03b31 with other subunits of the AP-1 complex but rather showed to affect the endosome recycling pathway. Knocking out ap1g1 in zebrafish leads to severe morphological defect and lethality, which was significantly rescued by injection of wild-type AP1G1 mRNA and not by transcripts encoding the missense variants. Furthermore, microinjection of mRNAs with de novo missense variants in wild-type zebrafish resulted in severe developmental abnormalities and increased lethality. We conclude that de novo and bi-allelic variants in AP1G1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorder in diverse populations.", "Keywords": ["AP-1 complex", "AP1G1", "Pakistani families", "developmental delay", "epilepsy", "exome sequencing", "genetic heterogeneity", "intellectual disabilities", "neurodevelopment disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Protein Complex 1", "Alleles", "Animals", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Developmental Disabilities", "Epilepsy", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Pedigree", "Rats", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Muhammad A", "Last Name": "Usmani", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA; Department of Molecular Biology, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Zubair M", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA; Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pamela", "Last Name": "Magini", "Affiliation": "U.O.

laryngeal-tracheoesophageal clefts (LTEC), are a spectrum of life-threatening congenital anomalies in which the trachea and esophagus do not form properly. Up until recently, the developmental basis of these conditions and how the trachea and esophagus arise from a common fetal foregut was poorly understood. However, with significant advances in human genetics, organoids, and animal models, and integrating single cell genomics with high resolution imaging, we are revealing the molecular and cellular mechanisms that orchestrate tracheoesophageal morphogenesis and how disruption in these processes leads to birth defects. Here we review the current understanding of the genetic and developmental basis of TEDs. We suggest future opportunities for integrating developmental mechanisms elucidated from animals and organoids with human genetics and clinical data to gain insight into the genotype-phenotype basis of these heterogeneous birth defects. Finally, we envision how this will enhance diagnosis, improve treatment, and perhaps one day, lead to new tissue replacement therapy.", "Keywords": ["Congenital anomalies", "Development", "EA/TEF", "Esophageal atresia", "Esophagus", "Foregut", "Laryngotracheoesophageal cleft", "Trachea", "Tracheoesophageal fistula"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Digestive System Abnormalities", "Disease Models, Animal", "Esophagus", "Humans", "Organoids", "Trachea"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole A", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Center for Stem Cell & Organoid Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vered", "Last Name": "Shacham-Silverberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Center for Stem Cell & Organoid Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leelah", "Last Name": "Weitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Kingma", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology and Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Center for Stem Cell & Organoid Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aaron M", "Last Name": "Zorn", "Affiliation": "Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Center for Stem Cell & Organoid Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

The sixteen affected individuals we identified, along with two previously reported individuals, present with a recognizable pattern of anomalies, which we named KINSSHIP syndrome (KI for horseshoe kidney, NS for Nievergelt/Savarirayan type of mesomelic dysplasia, S for seizures, H for hypertrichosis, I for intellectual disability, and P for pulmonary involvement), partially overlapping the AFF4-associated CHOPS syndrome. Whereas homozygous Aff3 knockout mice display skeletal anomalies, kidney defects, brain malformations, and neurological anomalies, knockin animals modeling one of the microdeletions and the most common of the missense variants identified in affected individuals presented with lower mesomelic limb deformities like KINSSHIP-affected individuals and early lethality, respectively.

Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in children with hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, but practice variations exist. Robust data on clinical testing practices and diagnostic yield in children are lacking. This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children and to investigate clinical genetic testing practices. Methods and Results Children with familial or idiopathic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from 14 institutions in North America. Probands underwent exome sequencing. Rare sequence variants in 37 known cardiomyopathy genes were assessed for pathogenicity using consensus clinical interpretation guidelines. Of the 152 enrolled probands, 41% had a family history of cardiomyopathy. Of 81 (53%) who had undergone clinical genetic testing for cardiomyopathy before enrollment, 39 (48%) had a positive result. Genetic testing rates varied from 0% to 97% between sites. A positive family history and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype were associated with increased likelihood of genetic testing (P=0.005 and P=0.03, respectively). A molecular cause was identified in an additional 21% of the 63 children who did not undergo clinical testing, with positive results identified in both familial and idiopathic cases and across all phenotypic subtypes. Conclusions A definitive molecular genetic diagnosis can be made in a substantial proportion of children for whom the cause and heritable nature of their cardiomyopathy was previously unknown. Practice variations in genetic testing are great and should be reduced. Improvements can be made in comprehensive cardiac screening and predictive genetic testing in first-degree relatives. Overall, our results support use of routine genetic testing in cases of both familial and idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

a group of rare neurodegenerative conditions caused by variants in KIF1A,a gene that encodes an anterograde neuronal microtubule (MT) motor protein. Here we characterize the natural history of KAND in 117 individuals using a combination of caregiver or self-reported medical history, a standardized measure of adaptive behavior, clinical records, and neuropathology. We developed a heuristic severity score using a weighted sum of common symptoms to assess disease severity. Focusing on 100 individuals, we compared the average clinical severity score for each variant with in silico predictions of deleteriousness and location in the protein. We found increased severity is strongly associated with variants occurring in protein regions involved with ATP and MT binding: the P loop, switch I, and switch II. For a subset of variants, we generated recombinant proteins, which we used to assess transport in vivo by assessing neurite tip accumulation and to assess MT binding, motor velocity, and processivity using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We find all modeled variants result in defects in protein transport, and we describe three classes of protein dysfunction: reduced MT binding, reduced velocity and processivity, and increased non-motile rigor MT binding. The rigor phenotype is consistently associated with the most severe clinical phenotype, while reduced MT binding is associated with milder clinical phenotypes. Our findings suggest the clinical phenotypic heterogeneity in KAND likely reflects and parallels diverse molecular phenotypes. We propose a different way to describe KAND subtypes to better capture the breadth of disease severity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lia", "Last Name": "Boyle", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology and Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simranpreet", "Last Name": "Kaur", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Department of Pediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Mebane", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Hamm", "Affiliation": "Genetic & Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Thornton", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared T", "Last Name": "Ahrendsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew P", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Christodoulou", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Department of Pediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3052, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Arne", "Last Name": "Gennerich", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology and Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "HGG advances", "PubDate": "2021Apr08"}, {"PMID": "33852230", "Title": "Frequency and characterization of mutations in genes in a large cohort of patients referred to MODY registry.", "Abstract": "There have been few large-scale studies utilizing exome sequencing for genetically undiagnosed maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a monogenic form of diabetes that is under-recognized.

Participating sites of the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network have invested resources into EHR integration efforts to enable the display of genetic testing data across heterogeneous EHR systems. To assess clinicians' engagement with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants within a large tertiary care academic medical center, we analyzed automatically generated EHR access log data. We found that clinicians viewed only 1% of all the eMERGE genetic test results integrated in the EHR. Using a cluster analysis, we also identified different user traits associated with varying degrees of engagement with the EHR-integrated genomic data. These data contribute important empirical knowledge about clinicians limited and brief engagements with unsolicited EHR-integrated genetic test results of eMERGE participants. Appreciation for user-specific roles provide additional context for why certain users were more or less engaged with the unsolicited results. This study highlights opportunities to use EHR log data as a performance metric to more precisely inform ongoing EHR-integration efforts and decisions about the allocation of informatics resources in genomic research.", "Keywords": ["clinical engagement with genomic results", "electronic health records", "log analysis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jordan G", "Last Name":

Deletion carriers have delays in early neurodevelopment that most specifically impair speech, phonology and language in 70%. Intelligence quotient is shifted 1.8 standard deviations lower than family controls without the deletion. Other common neurobehavioral conditions include motor coordination difficulties (60%) and autism (20-25%). Unprovoked seizures are common (24%) and readily treated and resolve with age in many. Obesity evolves throughout childhood and by adulthood 75% are obese. Congenital anomalies are more common than the general population.

About 50 common variants have been shown to modify BC risk for mutation carriers. All but three, were identified in general population studies.

We conduct a novel case-only genome-wide association study comparing genotype frequencies between 60,212 general population BC cases and 13,007 cases with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. We identify robust novel associations for 2 variants with BC for BRCA1 and 3 for BRCA2 mutation carriers, P\u2009<\u200910-8, at 5 loci, which are not associated with risk in the general population. They include rs60882887 at 11p11.2 where MADD, SP11 and EIF1, genes previously implicated in BC biology, are predicted as potential targets.

Predictors of Psychological Distress.", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives around the world. Autistic adults are at higher risk for co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions and may be more prone to difficulties adapting to pandemic-related changes and social distancing mandates and coping with ongoing uncertainties. On the other hand, the pandemic may lead to greater understanding and acceptance of accommodations in the broader community that may facilitate supports for autistic adults beyond the pandemic. To learn more about their early pandemic experiences, online surveys were sent to independent adults enrolled in the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK). The first survey was open from March 30 to April 19, 2020; a follow-up survey sent to original responders was open from May 27 to June 6, yielding 396 participants with data for both surveys. We found that adults who were female, younger, had prior diagnoses of a mental health condition, personal COVID-19 experience (i.e., knowing someone who had symptoms or tested positive) or less frequent hope for the future reported the greatest negative impacts. Decrease in feelings of hopefulness over time predicted greater psychological distress at T2, accounting for T1 impact and distress levels and increases in total COVID-19 impact. Less perceived benefit of online services also predicted later distress. Although there tends to be a focus on coping with negative effects of the pandemic, mental health providers may consider approaches that focus on positives, such as fostering hope and understanding factors that facilitate benefit from online services. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic adults may be at risk for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study suggests that autistic adults who were younger, female, had a mental health diagnosis before the pandemic and knew someone who showed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19 reported more areas negatively impacted by COVID-19 and greater difficulty coping with those effects. Decreases in hope over time were associated with greater psychological distress. Less perceived benefit from online services also predicted distress 2\u2009months later. These results suggest important areas to further explore as we develop supports for autistic adults during the pandemic.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19 pandemic", "adults", "co-morbid conditions",

We present the largest study of the microdeletion and -duplication at the distal 1q21 locus, which has been associated with schizophrenia and intellectual disability, in order to investigate the range of psychiatric phenotypes. Clinical and cognitive data from 68 deletion and 55 duplication carriers were analysed with logistic regression analysis to compare frequencies of mental disorders between carrier groups and controls, and linear mixed models to compare quantitative phenotypes. Both children and adults with copy number variants at 1q21 had high frequencies of psychopathology. In the children, neurodevelopmental disorders were most prominent (56% for deletion, 68% for duplication carriers). Adults had increased prevalence of mood (35% for deletion [OR\u2009=\u20096.6 (95% CI: 1.4-40.1)], 55% for duplication carriers [8.3 (1.4-55.5)]) and anxiety disorders (24% [1.8 (0.4-8.4)] and 55% [10.0 (1.9-71.2)]). The adult group, which included mainly genetically affected parents of probands, had an IQ in the normal range. These results confirm high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with CNVs at 1q21 but also reveal high prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in a high-functioning adult group with these CNVs.

PPP2R5D-related disorder is an early childhood onset condition characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, autism-spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic features. The disorder is caused by de novo single nucleotide changes in PPP2R5D, which generate heterozygous dominant missense variants. PPP2R5D is known to encode a B'-type (B'56\u03b4) regulatory subunit of a PP2A-serine/threonine phosphatase. To help elucidate the molecular mechanisms altered in PPP2R5D-related disorder, we used a CRISPR-single-base editor to generate HEK-293 cells in which a single transition (c.1258G>A) was introduced into one allele, precisely recapitulating a clinically relevant E420K variant. Unbiased quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of endogenously expressed proteins revealed heterozygous-dominant changes in kinase/phosphatase signaling. These data combined with orthogonal validation studies revealed a previously unrecognized interaction of PPP2R5D with AKT in human cells, leading to constitutively active AKT-mTOR signaling, increased cell size, and uncoordinated cellular growth in E420K-variant cells. Rapamycin reduced cell size and dose-dependently reduced RPS6 phosphorylation in E420K-variant cells, suggesting that inhibition of mTOR1 can suppress both the observed RPS6 hyperphosphorylation and increased cell size. Together, our findings provide a deeper understanding of PPP2R5D and insight into how the E420K-variant alters signaling networks influenced by PPP2R5D. Our comprehensive approach, which combines precise genome editing, isobaric tandem mass tag labeling of peptides generated from endogenously expressed proteins, and concurrent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS3), also provides a roadmap that can be used to rapidly explore the etiologies of additional genetic disorders.", "Keywords": ["AKT-mTOR", "Jordan\u2019s syndrome", "PP2A", "PPP2R5D", "PPP2R5D-intellectual disability", "PPP2R5D-related neurodevelopmental disorder", "phosphatase"], "MeSH terms": ["Autistic Disorder", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Megalencephaly", "Mutation", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Phosphatase 2", "Proteomics", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cinta M", "Last Name": "Papke", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kali A", "Last Name": "Smolen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark R", "Last Name": "Swingle", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Cressey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Heng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mourad", "Last Name": "Toporsian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liyong", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Hagen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arminja N", "Last Name": "Kettenbach", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA; Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.

Previously published prediction methods have facilitated the interpretation of missense variants but have limited performance. Here, we describe MVP (Missense Variant Pathogenicity prediction), a new prediction method that uses deep residual network to leverage large training data sets and many correlated predictors. We train the model separately in genes that are intolerant of loss of function variants and the ones that are tolerant in order to take account of potentially different genetic effect size and mode of action. We compile cancer mutation hotspots and de novo variants from developmental disorders for benchmarking. Overall, MVP achieves better performance in prioritizing pathogenic missense variants than previous methods, especially in genes tolerant of loss of function variants. Finally, using MVP, we estimate that de novo coding variants contribute to 7.8% of isolated congenital heart disease, nearly doubling previous estimates.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Computational Biology", "Deep Learning", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Humans", "Mutation, Missense", "Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hongjian", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haicang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yige", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "John J", "Last Name": "Long", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yongtao", "Last Name": "Guan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. ys2411@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2021Jan21"}, {"PMID": "33437032", "Title": "Comprehensive study of 28 individuals with SIN3A-related disorder underscoring the associated mild cognitive and distinctive facial phenotype.", "Abstract": "Witteveen-Kolk syndrome (OMIM 613406) is a recently defined neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SIN3A.

Many factors, including genetic literacy, may impact the utilization of genetic results by patients and their families. We developed a rapid, self-administered measure of genetic literacy, called Genetic Literacy Fast Test (GeneLiFT). We next evaluated the association of GeneLiFT scores with the comprehension of limitations of genomic medicine in participants undergoing genetic testing in the NIH-sponsored eMERGE III study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York. All participants underwent genetic screening for variants in 74 actionable genes associated with adult-onset disorders. A diverse cohort of 724 participants completed the survey (60% women, 45% less than 40\u00a0years old, and 53% self-reported White non-Hispanic ancestry). The GeneLiFT was validated using known group differences based on education, health literacy, and numeracy, and with questions assessing genetic knowledge. GeneLiFT identified multiple standard genetics terms, that is, jargon, not recognized by more than 50% of participants (including actionability and pathogenicity). Low genetic literacy, identified in 210 participants (29%), was significantly associated with poor understanding of the limitations of genetic testing (p-values\u00a0<\u00a010-9 ). This association was independent of education, health literacy, and numeracy levels, highlighting the importance of directly measuring genetic literacy. Low genetic literacy was also associated with low satisfaction with the informed consent process. GeneLiFT is a practical tool for rapid assessment of genetic literacy in large studies or clinical care. GeneLiFT will allow future research to efficiently assess the role of genetic literacy on the clinical impact of genetic testing.", "Keywords": ["assessment", "communication", "genetic knowledge", "genetic literacy", "risk perception", "screening", "test"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Female", "Genetic Testing", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Informed Consent", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hila", "Last Name": "Milo Rasouly", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Cuneo", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maddalena", "Last Name": "Marasa", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "DeMaria", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debanjana", "Last Name": "Chatterjee", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline J", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fasel", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Medicine and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Wynn", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunhua", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of genetic counseling", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33320693", "Title": "Bayesian Inference Associates Rare KDR Variants with Specific Phenotypes in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.", "Abstract": "Background - Approximately 25% of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been found to harbor rare mutations in disease-causing genes. To identify missing heritability in PAH we integrated deep phenotyping with whole-genome sequencing data using Bayesian statistics. Methods - We analyzed 13,037 participants enrolled in the NIHR BioResource - Rare Diseases (NBR) study, of which 1,148 were recruited to the PAH domain. To test for genetic associations between genes and selected phenotypes of pulmonary hypertension (PH), we used the Bayesian rare-variant association method BeviMed. Results - Heterozygous, high impact, likely loss-of-function variants in the Kinase Insert Domain Receptor (KDR) gene were strongly associated with significantly reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (KCO, posterior probability (PP)=0.989) and older age at diagnosis (PP=0.912). We also provide evidence for familial segregation of a rare nonsense KDR variant with these phenotypes. On computed tomographic imaging of the lungs, a range of parenchymal abnormalities were observed in the five patients harboring these predicted deleterious variants in KDR. Four additional PAH cases with rare likely loss-of-function variants in KDR were independently identified in the US PAH Biobank cohort with similar phenotypic characteristics. Conclusions - The Bayesian inference approach allowed us to independently validate KDR, which encodes for the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as a novel PAH candidate gene. Furthermore, this approach specifically associated high impact likely loss-of-function variants in the genetically constrained gene with distinct phenotypes. These findings provide evidence for KDR being a clinically actionable PAH gene and further support the central role of the vascular endothelium in the pathobiology of PAH.", "Keywords": ["computed

"Abstract": "The prevalence and biological consequences of deleterious germline variants in urothelial cancer (UC) are not fully characterized. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of germline DNA and 157 primary and metastatic tumors from 80 UC patients. We developed a computational framework for identifying putative deleterious germline variants (pDGVs) from WES data. Here, we show that UC patients harbor a high prevalence of pDGVs that truncate tumor suppressor proteins. Deepening somatic loss of heterozygosity in serial tumor samples is observed, suggesting a critical role for these pDGVs in tumor progression. Significant intra-patient heterogeneity in germline-somatic variant interactions results in divergent biological pathway alterations between primary and metastatic tumors. Our results characterize the spectrum of germline variants in UC and highlight their roles in shaping the natural history of the disease. These findings could have broad clinical implications for cancer patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Evolution", "Cohort Studies", "Genome, Human", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Humans", "Loss of Heterozygosity", "Neoplasm Staging", "Protein Domains", "Proteins", "Urologic Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aram", "Last Name": "Vosoughi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tuo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyrillus S", "Last Name": "Shohdy", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Panagiotis J", "Last Name": "Vlachostergios", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Wilkes", "Affiliation": "Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bhavneet", "Last Name": "Bhinder", "Affiliation": "Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott T", "Last Name": "Tagawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Nanus", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ana M", "Last Name": "Molina", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Himisha", "Last Name": "Beltran", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cora N", "Last Name": "Sternberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samaneh", "Last Name": "Motanagh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian D", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "Genomic Resources Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, NY, Columbia, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University, NY, Columbia, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "Department for Biomedical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Elemento", "Affiliation": "Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Sboner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan Miguel", "Last Name": "Mosquera", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bishoy M", "Last Name": "Faltas", "Affiliation": "Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine-New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA. bmf9003@med.cornell.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2020Dec03"}, {"PMID": "33268356", "Title": "Histone H3.3 beyond cancer: Germline mutations in Histone 3 Family 3A and 3B cause a previously unidentified neurodegenerative disorder in 46 patients.", "Abstract": "Although somatic mutations in Histone 3.3 (H3.3) are well-studied drivers of oncogenesis, the role of germline mutations remains unreported. We analyze 46 patients bearing de novo germline mutations in histone 3 family 3A (H3F3A) or H3F3B with progressive neurologic dysfunction and congenital anomalies without malignancies. Molecular modeling of all 37 variants demonstrated clear disruptions in interactions with DNA, other histones, and histone chaperone proteins. Patient histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) analysis revealed notably aberrant local PTM patterns distinct from the somatic lysine mutations that cause global PTM dysregulation. RNA sequencing on patient cells demonstrated up-regulated gene expression related to mitosis and cell division, and cellular assays confirmed an increased proliferative capacity. A zebrafish model showed craniofacial anomalies and a defect in Foxd3-derived glia. These data suggest that the mechanism of germline mutations are distinct from cancer-associated somatic histone mutations but may converge on control of cell proliferation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

The genetic etiology of CDH is complex. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs) in more than 150 genes have been associated with CDH, although few genes are recurrently mutated in multiple individuals and mutated genes are incompletely penetrant. This suggests that multiple genetic variants in combination, other not-yet-investigated classes of variants, and/or nongenetic factors contribute to CDH etiology. However, no studies have comprehensively investigated in affected individuals the contribution of all possible classes of variants throughout the genome to CDH etiology. In our study, we used a unique cohort of four individuals with isolated CDH with samples from blood, skin, and diaphragm connective tissue and parental blood and deep whole-genome sequencing to assess germline and somatic de novo and inherited SNVs, indels, and SVs. In each individual we found a different mutational landscape that included germline de novo and inherited SNVs and indels in multiple genes. We also found in two individuals a 343 bp deletion interrupting an annotated enhancer of the CDH-associated gene GATA4, and we hypothesize that this common SV (found in 1%-2% of the population) acts as a sensitizing allele for CDH.

Recent studies have revealed that local DNA methylation profiles might be dictated by cis-regulatory DNA sequences that mainly operate via DNA-binding factors. Consistent with this finding, we have recently shown that disruption of CTCF-binding sites by rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) can underlie cis-linked DNA methylation changes in patients with congenital anomalies. These data raise the hypothesis that rare genetic variation at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) might contribute to local DNA methylation patterning. In this work, by combining blood genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, whole genome sequencing-derived SNVs from 247 unrelated individuals along with 133 predicted TFBS motifs derived from ENCODE ChIP-Seq data, we observed an association between the disruption of binding sites for multiple TFs by rare SNVs and extreme DNA methylation values at both local and, to a lesser extent, distant CpGs. While the majority of these changes affected only single CpGs, 24% were associated with multiple outlier CpGs within \u00b11kb of the disrupted TFBS. Interestingly, disruption of functionally constrained sites within TF motifs lead to larger DNA methylation changes at nearby CpG sites. Altogether, these findings suggest that rare SNVs at TFBS negatively influence TF-DNA binding, which can lead to an altered local DNA methylation profile. Furthermore, subsequent integration of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq profiles from cardiac tissues enabled us to observe an association between rare SNV-directed DNA methylation and outlier expression of nearby genes. In conclusion, our findings not only provide insights into the effect of rare genetic variation at TFBS on shaping local DNA methylation and its consequences on genome regulation, but also provide a rationale to incorporate DNA methylation data to interpret the functional role of rare variants.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Binding Sites", "Child", "Child, Preschool",

Methods and Results We performed a retrospective review of all individuals with CHD followed at Columbia University Irving Medical Center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020. The primary end point was moderate/severe response to COVID-19 infection defined as (1) death during COVID-19 infection; or (2) need for hospitalization and/or respiratory support secondary to COVID-19 infection. Among 53 COVID-19-positive patients with CHD, 10 (19%) were <18\u00a0years of age (median age 34\u00a0years of age). Thirty-one (58%) had complex congenital anatomy including 10 (19%) with a Fontan repair. Eight (15%) had a genetic syndrome, 6 (11%) had pulmonary hypertension, and 9 (17%) were obese. Among adults, 18 (41%) were physiologic class C or D. For the entire cohort, 9 (17%) had a moderate/severe infection, including 3 deaths (6%). After correcting for multiple comparisons, the presence of a genetic syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 35.82; P=0.0002), and in adults, physiological Stage C or D (OR, 19.38; P=0.002) were significantly associated with moderate/severe infection.

Deleterious variants in NCKAP1 have been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability; however, its clinical significance remains unclear. To determine its significance, we assemble genotype and phenotype data for 21 affected individuals from 20 unrelated families with predicted deleterious variants in NCKAP1. This includes 16 individuals with de novo (n = 8), transmitted (n = 6), or inheritance unknown (n = 2) truncating variants, two individuals with structural variants, and three with potentially disruptive de novo missense variants. We report a de novo and ultra-rare deleterious variant burden of NCKAP1 in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders which needs further replication. ASD or autistic features, language and motor delay, and variable expression of intellectual or learning disability are common clinical features. Among inherited cases, there is evidence of deleterious variants segregating with neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on available human brain transcriptomic data, we show that NCKAP1 is broadly and highly expressed in both prenatal and postnatal periods and demostrate enriched expression in excitatory neurons and radial glias but depleted expression in inhibitory neurons. Mouse in utero electroporation experiments reveal that Nckap1 loss of function promotes neuronal migration during early cortical development. Combined, these data support a role for disruptive NCKAP1 variants in neurodevelopmental delay/autism, possibly by interfering with neuronal migration early in cortical development.", "Keywords": ["NCKAP1", "autism spectrum disorder", "de novo variants", "disruptive variant", "genotype-phenotype correlation", "neurodevelopmental disorder"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adolescent", "Animals", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Genotype", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Learning Disabilities", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutation", "Neuroglia", "Neurons", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Pregnancy", "Protein Isoforms", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Transcriptome", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Center for Medical Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China; Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.

neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder characterized by global developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. Microcephaly, progressive cortical atrophy, cerebellar hypoplasia and delayed myelination are neurological hallmarks in affected individuals. NMIHBA is caused by biallelic variants in PRUNE1 encoding prune exopolyphosphatase 1. We provide in-depth clinical description of two affected siblings harboring compound heterozygous variant alleles, c.383G\u2009>\u2009A (p.Arg128Gln), c.520G\u2009>\u2009T (p.Gly174*) in PRUNE1. To gain insights into disease biology, we biochemically characterized missense variants within the conserved N-terminal aspartic acid-histidine-histidine (DHH) motif and provide evidence that they result in the destabilization of protein structure and/or loss of exopolyphosphatase activity. Genetic ablation of Prune1 results in midgestational lethality in mice, associated with perturbations to embryonic growth and vascular development. Our findings suggest that NMIHBA results from hypomorphic variant alleles in humans and underscore the potential key role of PRUNE1 exopolyphoshatase activity in neurodevelopment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acid Anhydride Hydrolases", "Alleles", "Animals", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Mice", "Microcephaly", "Muscle Hypotonia", "Mutation", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Harikiran", "Last Name": "Nistala", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Dronzek", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Gonzaga-Jauregui", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shek Man", "Last Name": "Chim", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saathyaki", "Last Name": "Rajamani", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samer", "Last Name": "Nuwayhid", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dennis", "Last Name": "Delgado", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Burke", "Affiliation": "Undiagnosed Diseases Program Translational Laboratory, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ender", "Last Name": "Karaca", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew C", "Last Name": "Franklin", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Prasad", "Last Name": "Sarangapani", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Podgorski", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yajun", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa G", "Last Name": "Dominguez", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marjorie", "Last Name": "Withers", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ron A", "Last Name": "Deckelbaum", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Scheonherr", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "William A", "Last Name": "Gahl", "Affiliation": "Undiagnosed Diseases Program Translational Laboratory, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "May C", "Last Name": "Malicdan", "Affiliation": "Undiagnosed Diseases Program Translational Laboratory, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Zambrowicz", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas W", "Last Name": "Gale", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Gibbs", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Lupski", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aris N", "Last Name": "Economides", "Affiliation": "Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY 10591, USA."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2021Jan06"}, {"PMID": "33098801", "Title": "Monogenic variants in dystonia: an exome-wide sequencing study.", "Abstract": "Dystonia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition that occurs in isolation (isolated dystonia), in combination with other movement disorders (combined dystonia), or in the context of multisymptomatic phenotypes (isolated or combined dystonia with other neurological involvement).

Here we describe the release of exome-sequence data for the first 49,960\u00a0study participants, revealing approximately 4\u00a0million coding variants (of which around 98.6% have a frequency of less than 1%). The data include 198,269 autosomal predicted loss-of-function (LOF) variants, a more than 14-fold increase compared to the imputed sequence. Nearly all genes (more than 97%) had at least one carrier with a LOF variant, and most genes (more than 69%) had at least ten carriers with a LOF variant. We illustrate the power of characterizing LOF variants in this population through association analyses across 1,730\u00a0phenotypes. In addition to replicating established associations, we found novel LOF variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 and GMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of pathogenic variants of clinical importance, and show that 2% of this population has a medically actionable variant. Furthermore, we characterize the penetrance of cancer in carriers of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. Exome sequences from the first 49,960 participants highlight the promise of genome sequencing in large population-based studies and are now accessible to the scientific community.", "Keywords": [],

The disease is caused by both genetic and environmental factors and likely gene-environment interactions. While PAH can manifest across the lifespan, pediatric-onset disease is particularly challenging because it is frequently associated with a more severe clinical course and comorbidities including lung/heart developmental anomalies. In light of these differences, it is perhaps not surprising that emerging data from genetic studies of pediatric-onset PAH indicate that the genetic basis is different than that of adults. There is a greater genetic burden in children, with rare genetic factors contributing to ~42% of pediatric-onset PAH compared to ~12.5% of adult-onset PAH. De novo variants are frequently associated with PAH in children and contribute to at least 15% of all pediatric cases. The standard of medical care for pediatric PAH patients is based on extrapolations from adult data. However, increased etiologic heterogeneity, poorer prognosis, and increased genetic burden for pediatric-onset PAH calls for a dedicated pediatric research agenda to improve molecular diagnosis and clinical management. A genomics-first approach will improve the understanding of pediatric PAH and how it is related to other rare pediatric genetic disorders.", "Keywords": ["genomics", "lung disease", "pediatrics", "pulmonary arterial hypertension"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genomics", "Humans", "Mutation", "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carrie L", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 1150 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, 1150 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes", "PubDate": "2020Oct16"}, {"PMID": "33057572", "Title": "Prepubertal Internalizing Symptoms and Timing of Puberty Onset in Girls.", "Abstract": "Stressful environments have been associated with earlier menarche. We hypothesized that anxiety, and possibly other internalizing symptoms, are also associated with earlier puberty in girls. The Lessons in Epidemiology and Genetics of Adult Cancer From Youth (LEGACY) Girls Study (2011-2016) included 1,040 girls aged 6-13 years at recruitment whose growth and development were assessed every 6 months. Prepubertal maternal reports of daughter's internalizing symptoms were available for breast onset (n\u00a0=\u00a0447), pubic hair onset (n\u00a0=\u00a0456), and menarche (n\u00a0=\u00a0681). Using Cox proportional hazard regression, we estimated prospective hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the relationship between 1 standard deviation of the percentiles of prepubertal anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms and the timing of each pubertal outcome. Multivariable models included age, race/ethnicity, study center, maternal education, body mass index percentile, and family history of breast cancer. Additional models included maternal self-reported anxiety. A 1-standard deviation increase in maternally reported anxiety in girls at baseline was associated with earlier subsequent onset of breast (hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.36) and pubic hair (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.30) development, but not menarche (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.07).

To define molecular mechanisms for these diverse developmental defects, we studied transcriptional and epigenetic responses to GATA6 loss of function (LoF) and missense variants during cardiomyocyte differentiation of isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that GATA6 is a pioneer factor in cardiac development, regulating SMYD1 that activates HAND2, and KDR that with HAND2 orchestrates outflow tract formation. LoF variants perturbed cardiac genes and also endoderm lineage genes that direct PDX1 expression and pancreatic development. Remarkably, an exon 4 GATA6 missense variant, highly associated with extra-cardiac malformations, caused ectopic pioneer activities, profoundly diminishing GATA4, FOXA1/2, and PDX1 expression and increasing normal retinoic acid signaling that promotes diaphragm development. These aberrant epigenetic and transcriptional signatures illuminate the molecular mechanisms for cardiovascular malformations, pancreas and diaphragm dysgenesis that arise in patients with distinct

As it is likely that thousands of genetic variants contribute to CRC risk, it is clinically important to investigate whether these genetic variants can be used jointly for CRC risk prediction. In this paper, we derived and compared different approaches to generating predictive polygenic risk scores (PRS) from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) including 55,105 CRC-affected case subjects and 65,079 control subjects of European ancestry. We built the PRS in three ways, using (1) 140 previously identified and validated CRC loci; (2) SNP selection based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping followed by machine-learning approaches; and (3) LDpred, a Bayesian approach for genome-wide risk prediction. We tested the PRS in an independent cohort of 101,987 individuals with 1,699 CRC-affected case subjects. The discriminatory accuracy, calculated by the age- and sex-adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), was highest for the LDpred-derived PRS (AUC = 0.654) including nearly 1.2\u00a0M genetic variants (the proportion of causal genetic variants for CRC assumed to be 0.003), whereas the PRS of the 140 known variants identified from GWASs had the lowest AUC (AUC = 0.629). Based on the LDpred-derived PRS, we are able to identify 30% of individuals without a family history as having risk for CRC similar to those with a family history of CRC, whereas the PRS based on known GWAS variants identified only top 10% as having a similar relative risk. About 90% of these individuals have no family history and would have been considered average risk under current screening guidelines, but might benefit from earlier screening. The developed PRS offers a way for risk-stratified CRC screening and other targeted interventions.", "Keywords": ["cancer risk prediction", "colorectal cancer", "machine learning", "polygenic risk score"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Asian People", "Bayes Theorem", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minta", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori C", "Last Name": "Sakoda", "Affiliation": "Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Hoffmeister", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg 69120, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth A", "Last Name": "Rosenthal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine (Medical Genetics), University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey K", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Franzel J B", "Last Name": "van Duijnhoven", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen 176700, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Platz", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna H", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "University of Southern California, Preventative Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher H", "Last Name": "Dampier", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA."}, {"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "de la Chapelle", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alicja", "Last Name": "Wolk", "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm 17177, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Amit D", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, the first described mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, mediates multiple cellular processes and participates in early and late developmental programs. Aberrant signaling through this cascade contributes to oncogenesis and underlies the RASopathies, a family of cancer-prone disorders. Here, we report that de novo missense variants in MAPK1, encoding the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (i.e., extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2, ERK2), cause a neurodevelopmental disease within the RASopathy phenotypic spectrum, reminiscent of Noonan syndrome in some subjects. Pathogenic variants promote increased phosphorylation of the kinase, which enhances translocation to the nucleus and boosts MAPK signaling in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Two variant classes are identified, one of which directly disrupts binding to MKP3, a dual-specificity protein phosphatase negatively regulating ERK function. Importantly, signal dysregulation driven by pathogenic MAPK1 variants is stimulus reliant and retains dependence on MEK activity. Our data support a model in which the identified pathogenic variants operate with counteracting effects on MAPK1 function by differentially impacting the ability of the kinase to interact with regulators and substrates, which likely explains the minor role of these variants as driver events contributing to oncogenesis.

differentiation of breast tissue and a window of susceptibility (WOS) for breast cancer. Although oxidative stress markers have been associated with breast cancer risk, it is unclear whether oxidative stress levels are different during the pubertal WOS, and if so, whether these differences are related to breast cancer susceptibility. We measured urinary biomarkers of whole body oxidative stress (urinary F2-Isoprostanes and 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG)) in 158 girls (ages 6-13\u2009years), 71 with and 87 without a breast cancer family history (BCFH) from a cohort of adolescent girls from the New York site of the LEGACY cohort (Lessons in Epidemiology and Genetics in Adults Cancer from Youth). We compared levels of urinary oxidative stress biomarkers (F2-Isoprostanes and 8-oxodG) across the pubertal window, defined by Tanner Stage (TS) of breast development, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally within girls over an 18-month follow up period. Urinary oxidative stress biomarkers were unrelated to pubertal stages in cross-sectional analyses after considering adjustments for body mass index (BMI) and BCFH. In our longitudinal analysis, we found that urinary 8-oxodG levels, but not F2-Isoprostane levels, increased with age in BCFH\u2009+\u2009girls (\u03b2\u2009=\u20096.12, 95%\u00a0CI = 0.08-12.16) compared to BCFH-girls.

Structural homology modeling of two recurrent de novo variants, p.A81T and p.N107S, suggests both are likely to impact the function of ALG13. Using a corresponding ALG13-deficient yeast strain, we show that expressing yeast ALG13 with either of the highly conserved hotspot variants rescues the observed growth defect, but not its glycosylation abnormality. We present molecular and clinical data on 29 previously unreported individuals with de novo variants in ALG13. This more than doubles the number of known cases. A key finding is that a vast majority of the individuals presents with West syndrome, a feature shared with other CDG types. Among these, the initial epileptic spasms best responded to adrenocorticotropic hormone or prednisolone, while clobazam and felbamate showed promise for continued epilepsy treatment. A ketogenic diet seems to play an important role in the treatment of these individuals.", "Keywords": ["N-linked glycosylation", "congenital disorders of glycosylation", "epilepsy", "whole exome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Child, Preschool", "Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation", "Diet, Ketogenic", "Female", "Glycosylation", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Mutation", "N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases", "Spasms, Infantile", "Transferrin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bobby G", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Human Genetics Program, Sanford Children's Health Research Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erik A", "Last Name": "Eklund", "Affiliation": "Human Genetics Program, Sanford Children's Health Research Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergey A", "Last Name": "Shiryaev", "Affiliation": "Human Genetics Program, Sanford Children's Health Research Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yin Y", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mary-Alice", "Last Name": "Abbott", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baystate Children's Hospital, University of Massachusetts Medical School - Baystate, Springfield, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carla", "Last Name": "Asteggiano", "Affiliation": "CEMECO-CONICET, Children Hospital, School of Medicine, National University of Cordoba, Cordoba, Argentina."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bamshad", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eileen", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Bernstein", "Affiliation": "Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shabeed", "Last Name": "Chelakkadan", "Affiliation": "Monash Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Christodoulou", "Affiliation": "Brain and Mitochondrial Research Group, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Ciliberto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janice", "Last Name": "Cousin", "Affiliation": "Section of Human Biochemical Genetics, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fiona", "Last Name": "Gardiner", "Affiliation": "University of Melbourne, Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Suman", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics Division of Pediatric Neurology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida, USA."}, {"First Name": "William D", "Last Name": "Graf", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Connecticut Children's;

"Expressive language impairment is one of the most frequently associated clinical features of 16p11.2 copy number variations (CNV). However, our understanding of the language profiles of individuals with 16p11.2 CNVs is still limited. This study builds upon previous work in the Simons Variation in Individuals Project (VIP, now known as Simons Searchlight), to characterize language abilities in 16p11.2 deletion and duplication carriers using comprehensive assessments. Participants included 110 clinically ascertained children and family members (i.e., siblings and cousins) with 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 deletion and 58 with 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 duplication between the ages of 2-23\u2009years, most of whom were verbal. Regression analyses were performed to quantify variation in language abilities in the presence of the 16p11.2 deletion and duplication, both with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cognitive deficit. Difficulties in pragmatic skills were equally prevalent in verbal individuals in both deletion and duplication groups. NVIQ had moderate quantifiable effects on language scores in syntax and semantics/pragmatics (a decrease of less than 1 SD) for both groups. Overall, language impairments persisted even after controlling for ASD diagnosis and cognitive deficit. Language impairment is one of the core clinical features of individuals with 16p11.2 CNVs even in the absence of ASD and cognitive deficit. Results highlight the need for more comprehensive and rigorous assessment of language impairments to maximize outcomes in carriers of 16p11.2 CNVs.", "Keywords": ["16p11.2 deletion", "16p11.2 duplication", "autism", "genetics", "language profiles"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chromosome Deletion", "Chromosome Disorders", "Chromosome Duplication", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Family", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Language", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Siblings", "Speech", "Verbal Behavior", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "So Hyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medicine, White Plains, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "LeeAnne", "Last Name": "Green-Snyder", "Affiliation": "Simons Foundation, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Lord", "Affiliation": "Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Behavior, University of California Los Angeles, California, Los Angeles, USA."}, {"First Name": "Somer", "Last Name": "Bishop", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyle J", "Last Name": "Steinman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Bernier", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Hanson", "Affiliation": "Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robin P", "Last Name": "Goin-Kochel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Simons Foundation, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

Here, we report one mutation-negative female with classic Rett syndrome (RTT) harboring a de novo heterozygous novel variant [NP_001230937.1:p.(Asp248Glu)] in the highly conserved motor domain of KIF1A. In addition, three individuals with severe neurodevelopmental disorder along with clinical features overlapping with KAND are also reported carrying de novo heterozygous novel [NP_001230937.1:p.(Cys92Arg) and p.(Pro305Leu)] or previously reported [NP_001230937.1:p.(Thr99Met)] variants in KIF1A. In silico tools predicted these variants to be likely pathogenic, and 3D molecular modeling predicted defective ATP hydrolysis and/or microtubule binding. Using the neurite tip accumulation assay, we demonstrated that all novel KIF1A variants significantly reduced the ability of the motor domain of KIF1A to accumulate along the neurite lengths of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. In vitro microtubule gliding assays showed significantly reduced velocities for the variant p.(Asp248Glu) and reduced microtubule binding for the p.(Cys92Arg) and p.(Pro305Leu) variants, suggesting a decreased ability of KIF1A to move along microtubules. Thus, this study further expanded the phenotypic characteristics of KAND individuals with pathogenic variants in the KIF1A motor domain to include clinical features commonly seen in RTT individuals.",

aerodigestive tract collectively known as esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) constitute a rare group of birth defects of largely unknown etiology. Previous studies have identified a small number of rare genetic variants causing syndromes associated with EA/TEF. We performed a pilot exome sequencing study of 45 unrelated simplex trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF. Thirteen had isolated and 32 had nonisolated EA/TEF; none had a family history of EA/TEF. We identified de novo variants in protein-coding regions, including 19 missense variants predicted to be deleterious (D-mis) and 3 likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants. Consistent with previous studies of structural birth defects, there is a trend of increased burden of de novo D-mis in cases (1.57-fold increase over the background mutation rate), and the burden is greater in constrained genes (2.55-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.003). There is a frameshift de novo variant in EFTUD2, a known EA/TEF risk gene involved in mRNA splicing. Strikingly, 15 out of 19 de novo D-mis variants are located in genes that are putative target genes of EFTUD2 or SOX2 (another known EA/TEF gene), much greater than expected by chance (3.34-fold, p value\u2009=\u20097.20e-5). We estimated that 33% of patients can be attributed to de novo deleterious variants in known and novel genes. We identified APC2, AMER3, PCDH1, GTF3C1, POLR2B, RAB3GAP2, and ITSN1 as plausible candidate genes in the etiology of EA/TEF. We conclude that further genomic analysis to identify de novo variants will likely identify previously undescribed genetic causes of EA/TEF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Cadherins", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Esophageal Atresia", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Peptide Elongation Factors", "Protocadherins", "RNA Polymerase II", "Ribonucleoprotein, U5 Small Nuclear", "SOXB1 Transcription Factors", "Tracheoesophageal Fistula", "Transcription Factors, TFIII", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "rab3 GTP-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiayao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Priyanka R", "Last Name": "Ahimaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Somaye", "Last Name": "Hashemifar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Khlevner", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Picoraro", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Middlesworth", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mahmoud M", "Last Name": "Elfiky", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yufeng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. ys2411@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. wkc15@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "European journal of human genetics : EJHG", "PubDate": "2021Jan"}, {"PMID": "32614418", "Title": "Characterization of the Cancer Spectrum in Men With Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Variants: Results From the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA).", "Abstract": "The limited data on cancer phenotypes in men with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants (PVs) have hampered the development of evidence-based recommendations for early cancer detection and risk reduction in this population.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "BRCA1 Protein", "BRCA2 Protein", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Phenotype", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Silvestri", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Goska", "Last Name": "Leslie", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Daniel R", "Last Name": "Barnes", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "CIMBA Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bjarni A", "Last Name": "Agnarsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Kristiina", "Last Name": "Aittom\u00e4ki", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Alducci", "Affiliation": "Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padua, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Irene L", "Last Name": "Andrulis", "Affiliation": "Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Fred A.

To assess the contribution of noncoding DNVs to CHD, we compared genome sequences from 749 CHD probands and their parents with those from 1,611 unaffected trios. Neural network prediction of noncoding DNV transcriptional impact identified a burden of DNVs in individuals with CHD (n\u2009=\u20092,238 DNVs) compared to controls (n\u2009=\u20094,177; P\u2009=\u20098.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). Independent analyses of enhancers showed an excess of DNVs in associated genes (27 genes versus 3.7 expected, P\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5). We observed significant overlap between these transcription-based approaches (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20092.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.0, P\u2009=\u20095.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3). CHD DNVs altered transcription levels in 5 of 31 enhancers assayed.

functioning among 16p11.2 CNV carriers.", "Abstract": "Individuals with 16p11.2 copy number variant (CNV) show considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is reported in approximately 20-23% of individuals with 16p11.2 CNVs, ASD-associated symptoms are observed in those without a clinical ASD diagnosis. Previous work has shown that genetic variation and prenatal and perinatal birth complications influence ASD risk and symptom severity. This study examined the impact of genetic and environmental risk factors on phenotypic heterogeneity among 16p11.2 CNV carriers. Participants included individuals with a 16p11.2 deletion (N = 96) or duplication (N = 77) with exome sequencing from the Simons VIP study. The presence of prenatal factors, perinatal events, additional genetic events, and gender was studied. Regression analyses examined the contribution of each risk factor on ASD symptomatology, cognitive functioning, and adaptive abilities. For deletion carriers, perinatal and additional genetic events were associated with increased ASD symptomatology and decrements in cognitive and adaptive functioning. For duplication carriers, secondary genetic events were associated with greater cognitive impairments. Being female sex was a protective factor for both deletion and duplication carriers. Our findings suggest that ASD-associated risk factors contribute to the variability in symptom presentation in individuals with 16p11.2 CNVs. LAY SUMMARY: There are a wide range of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms and abilities observed for individuals with genetic changes of the 16p11.2 region. Here, we found perinatal complications contributed to more severe ASD symptoms (deletion carriers) and additional genetic mutations contributed to decreased cognitive abilities (deletion and duplication carriers). A potential protective factor was also observed for females with 16p11.2 variations.

While it is appreciated that clinically relevant variants exhibit a wide spectrum of penetrance, accurately assessing and expressing the pathogenicity of variants with lower penetrance can be challenging. The vinculin (VCL) gene illustrates these challenges. Model organism data provide\u00a0evidence that loss of function of VCL may play a role in cardiomyopathy and aggregate case-control studies suggest low penetrance.\u00a0VCL loss of function variants, however, are rarely identified in affected probands and therefore there is a paucity of family studies clarifying the clinical significance of individual variants. This study, which aggregated data from >18,000 individuals who underwent gene panel or exome testing for inherited cardiomyopathies, identified 32 probands with VCL loss-of-function variants and confirmed enrichment in probands with dilated cardiomyopathy (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20099.01; confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20094.93-16.45). Our data revealed that the majority of these individuals (89.5%) had pediatric onset of disease. Family studies demonstrated that heterozygous loss of function of VCL alone is insufficient to cause cardiomyopathy but that these variants do contribute to disease risk. In conclusion, VCL loss-of-function variants should be reported in a diagnostic setting but need to be clearly distinguished as having lower penetrance.", "Keywords": ["VCL", "cardiomyopathy gene

Five loci showed associations (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in opposite directions between luminal and non-luminal subtypes. In silico analyses showed that these five loci contained cell-specific enhancers that differed between normal luminal and basal mammary cells. The genetic correlations between five intrinsic-like subtypes ranged from 0.35 to 0.80. The proportion of genome-wide chip heritability explained by all known susceptibility loci was 54.2% for luminal A-like disease and 37.6% for triple-negative disease. The odds ratios of polygenic risk scores, which included 330 variants, for the highest 1% of quantiles compared with middle quantiles were 5.63 and 3.02 for luminal A-like and triple-negative disease, respectively.

The functional importance of peroxisomes in humans is represented by peroxisome-deficient peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger syndrome. Defects in the genes that encode the 14 peroxins that are required for peroxisomal membrane assembly, matrix protein import and division have been identified in PBDs. A number of recent findings have advanced our understanding of the biology, physiology and consequences of functional defects in peroxisomes. In this Review, we discuss a cooperative cell defense mechanisms against oxidative stress that involves the localization of BAK (also known as BAK1) to peroxisomes, which alters peroxisomal membrane permeability, resulting in the export of catalase, a peroxisomal enzyme. Another important recent finding is the discovery of a nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like protein that has been shown to be essential for how the energy GTP is generated and provided for the fission of peroxisomes. With regard to PBDs, we newly identified a mild mutation, Pex26-F51L that causes only hearing loss. We will also discuss findings from a new PBD model mouse defective in Pex14, which manifested dysregulation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway, an essential signaling pathway in cerebellar morphogenesis.

Participants had the option to proceed through the study self-guided, and few elected to have traditional pre-test genetic education and counseling. Despite this, the majority were satisfied with the process of selecting and receiving genetic results and felt that they understood their results. Concerns about privacy and confidentiality of genetic data were minimal, though some participants expressed modest concerns about keeping any potential results secret or the confidentiality of their genetic information.

Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified few SNPs associated with LV mass. We hypothesized that a polygenic discovery approach using LV mass measurements made in a clinical population would identify risk factors and diseases associated with adverse LV remodeling. We developed a polygenic single nucleotide polymorphism-based predictor of LV mass in 7,601 individuals with LV mass measurements made during routine clinical care. We tested for associations between this predictor and 894 clinical diagnoses measured in 58,838 unrelated genotyped individuals. There were 29 clinical phenotypes associated with the LV mass genetic predictor at FDR q\u2009<\u20090.05. Genetically predicted higher LV mass was associated with modifiable cardiac risk factors, diagnoses related to organ dysfunction and conditions associated with abnormal cardiac structure including heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Secondary analyses using polygenic predictors confirmed a significant association between higher LV mass and body mass index and, in men, associations with coronary atherosclerosis and systolic blood pressure. In summary, these analyses show that LV mass-associated genetic variability associates with diagnoses of cardiac diseases and with modifiable risk factors which contribute to these diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Echocardiography", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Heart Diseases", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Male", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Odds Ratio", "Organ Size", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Mosley", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. jonathan.d.mosley@vumc.org."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca T", "Last Name": "Levinson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Farber-Eger", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Todd L", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacklyn N", "Last Name": "Hellwege", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adriana M", "Last Name": "Hung", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ayush", "Last Name": "Giri", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Megan M", "Last Name": "Shuey", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian M", "Last Name": "Shaffer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mingjian", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evan L", "Last Name": "Brittain", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Office of Research & Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington DC, DC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iftikhar J", "Last Name": "Kullo", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adelaide M", "Last Name": "Arruda-Olson", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gail P", "Last Name": "Jarvik", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Medical Genetics) and Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric B", "Last Name": "Larson", "Affiliation": "Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute and Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Crosslin", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc S", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ken M", "Last Name": "Borthwick", "Affiliation": "Biomedical and Translational Informatics, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hakon", "Last Name": "Hakonarson", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Genomics, Division of Human Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua C", "Last Name": "Denny", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan M", "Last Name": "Roden", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Quinn S", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020May05"}, {"PMID": "32368696", "Title": "Systems Analysis Implicates WAVE2\u00a0Complex in the Pathogenesis of\u00a0Developmental Left-Sided Obstructive\u00a0Heart Defects.", "Abstract": "Genetic variants are the primary driver of congenital heart disease (CHD) pathogenesis.

The aim of this study was to explore the parental experiences of CES in a Latinx community and to understand how their experiences are influenced by culture and language. We conducted semi-structured interviews in English and Spanish with 38 Latinx parents of children who had CES. Some of the themes that emerged were common to those previously identified, including a sense of obligation to pursue testing and a mixed emotional response to their child's results. Parents who had lower education level and/or received care from a provider who did not share their language had more confusion about their child's CES results and greater dissatisfaction with care compared with parents who had higher education level and/or received care from a provider who spoke their language. We also found evidence of hampered shared decision making and/or disempowered patient decision making regarding CES testing. Our data suggest unique needs for Latinx families having CES, particularly those who are non-English speaking when an interpreter is used.

In this study, we conducted a TWAS using gene expression data from GTEx and summary statistics from the hitherto largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted for breast cancer overall, and by estrogen receptor subtypes (ER+ and ER-). We further compared associations with ER+ and ER- subtypes, using a case-only TWAS approach. We also conducted multigene conditional analyses in regions with multiple TWAS associations. Two genes, STXBP4 and HIST2H2BA, were specifically associated with ER+ but not with ER- breast cancer. We further identified 30 TWAS-significant genes associated with overall breast cancer risk, including four that were not identified in previous studies. Conditional analyses identified single independent breast-cancer gene in three of six regions harboring multiple TWAS-significant genes. Our study provides new information on breast cancer genetics and biology, particularly about genomic differences between ER+ and ER- breast cancer.", "Keywords": ["GWAS", "TWAS", "breast cancer subtype", "causal gene"], "MeSH terms": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Estrogens", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomics", "Humans", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Risk Assessment", "Transcriptome", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Helian", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Program in Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Genetics, Harvard T.

Clinical management of children with PAH is particularly challenging because of increased complexity of disease etiology and clinical presentation, and the lack of data from pediatric-specific clinical trials. In children, PAH often develops in association with congenital heart disease and other developmental disorders. Emerging data from genetic studies of pediatric-onset PAH indicate that the genetic basis is different than that of adults. There is a greater genetic burden in children, with rare genetic factors contributing to at least 35%\u00a0of pediatric-onset idiopathic PAH (IPAH) compared with approximately 11%\u00a0of adult-onset IPAH. De\u00a0novo variants are the most frequent monogenetic cause of PAH in children, likely contributing to approximately 15%\u00a0of all cases. Rare deleterious variants in BMPR2 contribute to pediatric-onset IPAH and familial PAH with similar frequency as adult-onset disease but rarely explain cases of PAH associated with other diseases. Rare deleterious variants in developmental genes-including TBX4, SOX17, and other genes requiring confirmation in larger cohorts-are emerging as important contributors to pediatric-onset disease. Because each causal gene contributes to only a small number of cases, large cohorts of pediatric-onset PAH are needed to further identify the unique etiologic differences of PAH in children. We propose a genetics-first approach followed by focused phenotyping of pediatric patients grouped by genetic diagnosis to define endophenotypes that can be used to improve risk stratification and treatment.", "Keywords": ["genomics", "lung disease", "pediatrics"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genomics", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension", "Risk Assessment", "Severity of Illness Index"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carrie L", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.

There is a greater genetic burden in children, with rare genetic factors contributing to at least 35% of pediatric-onset idiopathic PAH (IPAH) compared with ~11% of adult-onset IPAH. De novo variants are the most frequent genetic cause of PAH in children, likely contributing to ~15% of all cases. Rare deleterious variants in bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) contribute to pediatric-onset familial PAH and IPAH with similar frequency as adult-onset. While likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants in BMPR2 contribute across the lifespan, damaging missense variants are more frequent in early-onset PAH. Rare deleterious variants in T-box 4-containing protein (TBX4) are more common in pediatric-compared with adult-onset PAH, explaining ~8% of pediatric IPAH. PAH associated with congenital heart disease (APAH-CHD) and other developmental disorders account for a large proportion of pediatric PAH. SRY-related HMG box transcription factor (SOX17) was recently identified as an APAH-CHD risk gene, contributing less frequently to IPAH, with a greater prevalence of rare deleterious variants in children compared with adults. The differences in genetic burden and genes underlying pediatric- vs adult-onset PAH indicate that genetic information relevant to pediatric PAH cannot be extrapolated from adult studies. Large cohorts of pediatric-onset PAH are necessary to identify the unique etiological differences of PAH in children, as well as the natural history and response to therapy.", "Keywords": ["genomics", "lung disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type II", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension", "Gene Deletion", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation, Missense", "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension", "SOXF Transcription Factors", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carrie L", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eric D", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Pediatric pulmonology", "PubDate": "2021Mar"}, {"PMID": "31911677", "Title": "Fine-mapping of 150 breast cancer risk regions identifies 191 likely target genes.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified breast cancer risk variants in over 150 genomic regions, but the mechanisms underlying risk remain largely unknown. These regions were explored by combining association analysis with in silico genomic feature annotations. We defined 205 independent risk-associated signals with the set of credible causal variants in each one. In parallel, we used a Bayesian approach (PAINTOR) that combines genetic association, linkage disequilibrium and enriched genomic features to determine variants with high posterior probabilities of being causal. Potentially causal variants were significantly over-represented in active gene regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. We applied our INQUSIT pipeline for prioritizing genes as targets of those potentially causal variants, using gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci), chromatin interaction and functional annotations. Known cancer drivers, transcription factors and genes in the developmental, apoptosis, immune system and DNA integrity checkpoint gene ontology pathways were over-represented among the highest-confidence target genes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bayes Theorem", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chromosome Mapping", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Fachal", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Oncology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Hugues", "Last Name": "Aschard", "Affiliation": "Centre de Bioinformatique Biostatistique et Biologie Int\u00e9grative (C3BI), Institut Pasteur, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Beesley", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Computational Biology, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Daniel R", "Last Name": "Barnes", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jamie", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Kar", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Oncology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Karen A", "Last Name": "Pooley", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Joe", "Last Name": "Dennis", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kyriaki", "Last Name": "Michailidou", "Affiliation": "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Constance", "Last Name": "Turman", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Variants in hundreds of genes have been identified that may cause or contribute to CHD, but a genetic cause can still only be identified in about 20-30% of patients. Identifying a genetic cause for CHD can have an impact on clinical outcomes and prognosis and thus it is important for clinicians to understand when and what to test in patients with isolated CHD.

We hypothesized that psychotic symptoms would be most common in duplication carriers followed by deletion carriers and noncarriers, that an ASD diagnosis would predict psychotic symptoms among CNV carriers, and that OCD symptoms would predict psychotic symptoms among all participants. Using data collected across multiple measures, we identified 19 participants with psychotic symptoms. Logistic regression models adjusting for biological sex, age, and IQ found that 16p11.2 duplication and ASD diagnosis predicted psychotic symptom presence. Our findings suggest that the association between 16p11.2 duplication and psychotic symptoms is independent of ASD diagnosis and that ASD diagnosis and psychotic symptoms may be associated in 16p11.2 CNV carriers.

LAY SUMMARY: Either deletion or duplication at chromosome 16p11.2 raises the risk of autism spectrum disorder, and duplication, but not deletion, has been reported in schizophrenia (SCZ). In a sample of 16p11.2 deletion and duplication carriers, we found that having the duplication or having an autism diagnosis may increase the risk of psychosis, a key feature of SCZ.", "Keywords": ["autism spectrum disorder", "chromosome deletion", "chromosome duplication", "chromosomes", "human", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "pair 16", "phenotype", "schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Chromosome Deletion", "Chromosome Duplication", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amandeep", "Last Name": "Jutla", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "J Blake", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "LeeAnne", "Last Name": "Green Snyder", "Affiliation": "Simons Foundation, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "PubDate": "2020Feb"}, {"PMID": "31723001", "Title": "Association of Genomic Domains in BRCA1 and BRCA2 with Prostate Cancer Risk and Aggressiveness.", "Abstract": "Pathogenic sequence variants (PSV) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) are associated with increased risk and severity of prostate cancer. We evaluated whether PSVs in BRCA1/2 were associated with risk of overall prostate cancer or high grade (Gleason 8+) prostate cancer using an international sample of 65 BRCA1 and 171 BRCA2 male PSV carriers with prostate cancer, and 3,388 BRCA1 and 2,880 BRCA2 male PSV carriers without prostate cancer. PSVs in the 3' region of BRCA2 (c.7914+) were significantly associated with elevated risk of prostate cancer compared with reference bin c.1001-c.7913 [HR = 1.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-2.52; P = 0.001], as well as elevated risk of Gleason 8+ prostate cancer (HR = 3.11; 95% CI, 1.63-5.95; P = 0.001). c.756-c.1000 was also associated with elevated prostate cancer risk (HR = 2.83; 95% CI, 1.71-4.68; P = 0.00004) and elevated risk of Gleason 8+ prostate cancer (HR = 4.95; 95% CI, 2.12-11.54; P = 0.0002). No genotype-phenotype associations were detected for PSVs in BRCA1. These results demonstrate that specific BRCA2 PSVs may be associated with elevated risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer.

Germline pathogenic variants in DNA repair genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, and CHEK2 are associated with breast cancer risk. FANCM, which encodes for a DNA translocase, has been proposed as a breast cancer predisposition gene, with greater effects for the ER-negative and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. We tested the three recurrent protein-truncating variants FANCM:p.Arg658*, p.Gln1701*, and p.Arg1931* for association with breast cancer risk in 67,112 cases, 53,766 controls, and 26,662 carriers of pathogenic variants of BRCA1 or BRCA2. These three variants were also studied functionally by measuring survival and chromosome fragility in FANCM -/- patient-derived immortalized fibroblasts treated with diepoxybutane or olaparib. We observed that FANCM:p.Arg658* was associated with increased risk of ER-negative disease and TNBC (OR\u2009=\u20092.44, P\u2009=\u20090.034 and OR\u2009=\u20093.79; P\u2009=\u20090.009, respectively). In a country-restricted analysis, we confirmed the associations detected for FANCM:p.Arg658* and found that also FANCM:p.Arg1931* was associated with ER-negative breast cancer risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.96; P\u2009=\u20090.006). The functional results indicated that all three variants were deleterious affecting cell survival and chromosome stability with FANCM:p.Arg658* causing more severe phenotypes. In conclusion, we confirmed that the two rare FANCM deleterious variants p.Arg658* and p.Arg1931* are risk factors for ER-negative and TNBC subtypes. Overall our data suggest that the effect of truncating variants on breast cancer risk may depend on their position in the gene.

Genetic testing is used in germline and tumor testing, with each providing distinct data to guide management. Germline testing supports more accurate risk evaluation to inform screening and risk-reducing medical and surgical strategies. Tumor testing can inform cancer recurrence risk assessment and cancer treatment options. This article reviews how genetic testing informs treatment and potential risks for a patient with breast cancer and her family. Hereditary cancer genetic testing of family members should include a discussion of potential results, adverse effects, clinical management options, and insurance coverage and address concerns about privacy or discrimination.

We deploy a permutation-based gene-burden analysis to identify damaging recessive and compound heterozygous genotypes and disease genes, controlling for confounding effects, such as background mutation rate and ancestry. Cilia-related genes are significantly enriched for damaging rare recessive genotypes, but comparatively depleted for de novo variants. The opposite trend is observed for chromatin-modifying genes. Other cardiac developmental gene classes have less stratification by mode of inheritance than cilia and chromatin-modifying gene classes.

In particular, it is unclear whether an ethical duty of periodic reinterpretation should exist, who should bear that duty, and what its dimensions should be. Based on an analysis of the ethical arguments for and against a duty to reinterpret, we conclude that a duty should be recognized. Most importantly, by virtue of ordering and conducting tests likely to produce data on variants that cannot be definitively interpreted today, the health-care system incurs a duty to reinterpret when more reliable data become available. We identify four elements of the proposed ethical duty: data storage, initiation of reinterpretation, conduct of reinterpretation, and patient recontact, and we identify the parties best situated to implement each component. We also consider the reasonable extent and duration of a duty, and the role of the patient's consent in the process, although we acknowledge that some details regarding procedures and funding still need to be addressed.

SCN5A mutations associated with long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) lead to enhanced late sodium current and consequent action potential (AP) prolongation. Internalization and degradation of Nav1.5 is regulated by ubiquitylation, a post-translational mechanism that involves binding of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 to a proline-proline-serine-tyrosine sequence of Nav1.5, designated the PY-motif. We investigated the biophysical properties of the LQT3-associated SCN5A-p.Y1977N mutation located in the Nav1.5 PY-motif, both in HEK293 cells as well as in newly generated mice harboring the mouse homolog mutation Scn5a-p.Y1981N. We found that in HEK293 cells, the SCN5A-p.Y1977N mutation abolished the interaction between Nav1.5 and Nedd4-2, suppressed PY-motif-dependent ubiquitylation of Nav1.5, and consequently abrogated Nedd4-2 induced sodium current (INa) decrease. Nevertheless, homozygous mice harboring the Scn5a-p.Y1981N mutation showed no electrophysiological alterations nor changes in AP or (late) INa properties, questioning the in vivo relevance of the PY-motif. Our findings suggest the presence of compensatory mechanisms, with additional, as yet unknown, factors likely required to reduce the \"ubiquitylation reserve\" of Nav1.5. Future identification of such modulatory factors may identify potential triggers for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in the setting of LQT3 mutations.", "Keywords": ["Nedd4-2", "SCN5A", "action potential", "long QT syndrome", "mouse model", "patch-clamp", "sodium current", "ubiquitylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Female", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Long QT Syndrome", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases", "Protein Binding", "Ubiquitination", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Simona", "Last Name": "Casini", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Cardiology, Heart Centre, Amsterdam UMC, Location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.casini@amsterdamumc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Maxime", "Last Name": "Albesa", "Affiliation": "Ion Channels and Channelopathies Laboratory, Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Bern, B\u00fchlstrasse 28, 3012 Bern, Switzerland. maxime.albesa@zeiss.com."}, {"First Name": "Zizun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Ion Channels and Channelopathies Laboratory, Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Bern, B\u00fchlstrasse 28, 3012 Bern, Switzerland. zizun.wang@ibmm.unibe.ch."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Portero", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Cardiology, Heart Centre, Amsterdam UMC, Location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 Amsterdam, The Netherlands. v.m.portero@amsterdamumc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Ross-Kaschitza", "Affiliation": "Ion Channels and Channelopathies Laboratory, Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Bern, B\u00fchlstrasse 28, 3012 Bern, Switzerland. daniela.ross@ibmm.unibe.ch."}, {"First Name": "Jean-S\u00e9bastien", "Last Name": "Rougier", "Affiliation": "Ion Channels and Channelopathies Laboratory, Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Bern, B\u00fchlstrasse 28, 3012 Bern, Switzerland. jean-sebastien.rougier@ibmm.unibe.ch."}, {"First Name": "Gerard A", "Last Name": "Marchal", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Cardiology, Heart Centre, Amsterdam UMC, Location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 Amsterdam, The Netherlands. g.a.marchal@amsterdamumc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics & Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 1150 St Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA. wkc15@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Connie R", "Last Name": "Bezzina", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Cardiology, Heart Centre, Amsterdam UMC, Location Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 Amsterdam, The Netherlands. c.r.bezzina@amsterdamumc.nl."}, {"First Name": "Hugues", "Last Name": "Abriel", "Affiliation": "Ion Channels and Channelopathies Laboratory, Institute for Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Bern, B\u00fchlstrasse 28, 3012 Bern, Switzerland.

average-risk women, it is not known if this association applies to women at high familial/genetic risk. We examined the association of recreational physical activity (self-reported by questionnaire) with breast cancer risk using the Prospective Family Study Cohort, which is enriched with women who have a breast cancer family history (N = 15,550). We examined associations of adult and adolescent recreational physical activity (quintiles of age-adjusted total metabolic equivalents per week) with breast cancer risk using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for demographics, lifestyle factors, and body mass index. We tested for multiplicative interactions of physical activity with predicted absolute breast cancer familial risk based on pedigree data and with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status. Baseline recreational physical activity level in the highest four quintiles compared with the lowest quintile was associated with a 20% lower breast cancer risk (HR, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.93). The association was not modified by familial risk or BRCA mutation status (P interactions >0.05). No overall association was found for adolescent recreational physical activity. Recreational physical activity in adulthood may lower breast cancer risk for women across the spectrum of familial risk. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that physical activity might reduce breast cancer risk by about 20% for women across the risk continuum, including women at higher-than-average risk due to their family history or genetic susceptibility.See related commentary by Niehoff et al., p. 23.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cohort Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca D", "Last Name": "Kehm", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeanine M", "Last Name": "Genkinger", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York;

We conducted a pilot study for SPARK (SPARKForAutism.org) of 457 families with ASD, all consented online. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and genotyping data were generated for each family using DNA from saliva. We identified variants in genes and loci that are clinically recognized causes or significant contributors to ASD in 10.4% of families without previous genetic findings. In addition, we identified variants that are possibly associated with ASD in an additional 3.4% of families. A meta-analysis using the TADA framework at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 provides statistical support for 26 ASD risk genes. While most of these genes are already known ASD risk genes, BRSK2 has the strongest statistical support and reaches genome-wide significance as a risk gene for ASD (p-value\u2009=\u20092.3e-06).

Are Associated with Epilepsy, Colobomas, Dysmorphism, Developmental Delay, Intellectual Disability, and Cerebellar Hypoplasia.", "Abstract": "WD40 repeat-containing proteins form a large family of proteins present in all eukaryotes. Here, we identified five pediatric probands with de novo variants in WDR37, which encodes a member of the WD40 repeat protein family. Two probands shared one variant and the others have variants in nearby amino acids outside the WD40 repeats. The probands exhibited shared phenotypes of epilepsy, colobomas, facial dysmorphology reminiscent of CHARGE syndrome, developmental delay and intellectual disability, and cerebellar hypoplasia. The WDR37 protein is highly conserved in vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms and is currently not associated with a human disease. We generated a null allele of the single Drosophila ortholog to gain functional insights and replaced the coding region of the fly gene CG12333/wdr37 with GAL4. These flies are homozygous viable but display severe bang sensitivity, a phenotype associated with seizures in flies. Additionally, the mutant flies fall when climbing the walls of the vials, suggesting a defect in grip strength, and repeat the cycle of climbing and falling. Similar to wall clinging defect, mutant males often lose grip of the female abdomen during copulation. These phenotypes are rescued by using the GAL4 in the CG12333/wdr37 locus to drive the UAS-human reference WDR37 cDNA. The two variants found in three human subjects failed to rescue these phenotypes, suggesting that these alleles severely affect the function of this protein. Taken together, our data suggest that variants in WDR37 underlie a novel syndromic neurological disorder.", "Keywords": ["CG12333", "Drosophila", "WD40 repeats", "WDR37 domains", "bang sensitivity", "wdr37"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Body Dysmorphic Disorders", "Cerebellum", "Child", "Coloboma", "Developmental Disabilities", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Microfilament Proteins", "Mutation", "Nervous System Malformations", "Phenotype", "Sequence Homology", "WD40 Repeats", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Oguz", "Last Name": "Kanca", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan C", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pei-Tseng", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chirag", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Genetic Health Queensland, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, QLD 4029, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Stephen R", "Last Name": "Braddock", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, St. Louis, MO 63104, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Saint Louis University Hospital, St. Louis, MO 63104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne M", "Last Name": "Slavotinek", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-2711, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie S", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurogenetics and Hugo W.

This is likely due to the fact that individual diseases aggregate numerous pathological subtypes, each associated with a complex landscape of genetic risk factors. To overcome these challenges, researchers are integrating novel data types from numerous patients, including imaging studies capturing broadly applicable features from patient-derived materials. These datasets, when combined with machine learning, potentially hold the power to elucidate the subtle patterns that stratify patients by shared pathology. In this study, we interrogated whether high-content imaging of primary skin fibroblasts, using the Cell Painting method, could reveal disease-relevant information among patients. First, we showed that technical features such as batch/plate type, plate, and location within a plate lead to detectable nuisance signals, as revealed by a pre-trained deep neural network and analysis with deep image embeddings. Using a plate design and image acquisition strategy that accounts for these variables, we performed a pilot study with 12 healthy controls and 12 subjects affected by the severe genetic neurological disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and evaluated whether a convolutional neural network (CNN) generated using a subset of the cells could distinguish disease states on cells from the remaining unseen control-SMA pair. Our results indicate that these two populations could effectively be differentiated from one another and that model selectivity is insensitive to batch/plate type. One caveat is that the samples were also largely separated by source.

We have previously shown that copy number variations of 16p11.2 impact regional brain volume, white matter integrity, and early sensory responses in auditory cortex. Here, we test the hypothesis that abnormal cortical neurophysiology is present when genes in the 16p11.2 region are haploinsufficient, and in humans that this in turn may account for behavioral deficits specific to deletion carriers. We examine sensorimotor cortical network activity in males and females with 16p11.2 deletions compared with both typically developing individuals, and those with duplications of 16p11.2, using magnetoencephalographic imaging during preparation of overt speech or hand movements in tasks designed to be easy for all participants. In deletion carriers, modulation of beta oscillations (12-30 Hz) were increased during both movement types over effector-specific regions of motor cortices compared with typically developing individuals or duplication carriers, with no task-related performance differences between cohorts, even when corrected for their own cognitive and sensorimotor deficits. Reduced left hemispheric language specialization was observed in deletion carriers but not in duplication carriers. Neural activity over sensorimotor cortices in deletion carriers was linearly related to clinical measures of speech and motor impairment. These findings link insufficient copy number repeats at 16p11.2 to excessive neural activity (e.g., increased beta oscillations) in motor cortical networks for speech and hand motor control. These results have significant implications for understanding the neural basis of autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The recurrent \u223c600 kb deletion at 16p11.2 (BP4-BP5) is one of the most common genetic etiologies of ASD and, more generally, of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we use high-resolution magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEG-I) to define with millisecond precision the underlying neurophysiological signature of motor impairments for individuals with 16p11.2 deletions. We identify significant increases in beta (12-30 Hz) suppression in sensorimotor cortices related to performance during speech and hand movement tasks. These findings not only provide a neurophysiological phenotype for the clinical presentation of this genetic deletion, but also guide our understanding of how genetic variation encodes for neural oscillatory dynamics.", "Keywords": ["16p11.2", "autism", "beta rhythm", "magnetoencephalography", "manual", "speech"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Chromosome Deletion", "Chromosome Disorders", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16", "Female", "Gene Deletion", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sensorimotor Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leighton B N", "Last Name": "Hinkley", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging."}, {"First Name": "Corby L", "Last Name": "Dale", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging."}, {"First Name": "Tracy L", "Last Name": "Luks", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging."}, {"First Name": "Anne M", "Last Name": "Findlay", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging."}, {"First Name": "Polina", "Last Name": "Bukshpun", "Affiliation": "Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Nick", "Last Name": "Pojman", "Affiliation": "Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Tony", "Last Name": "Thieu", "Affiliation": "Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Berman", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."}, {"First Name": "Timothy P L", "Last Name": "Roberts", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104."}, {"First Name": "Pratik", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging."}, {"First Name": "Elliott H", "Last Name": "Sherr", "Affiliation": "Neurology, and sri@radiology.ucsf.edu sherre@neuropeds.ucsf.edu."}, {"First Name": "Srikantan S", "Last Name": "Nagarajan", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, sri@radiology.ucsf.edu sherre@neuropeds.ucsf.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Sep11"}, {"PMID": "31235600", "Title": "Histone H2B monoubiquitination regulates heart development via epigenetic control of cilia motility.", "Abstract": "Genomic analyses of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) have identified significant contribution from mutations affecting cilia genes and chromatin remodeling genes; however, the mechanism(s) connecting chromatin remodeling to CHD is unknown. Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is catalyzed by the RNF20 complex consisting of RNF20, RNF40, and UBE2B. Here, we show significant enrichment of loss-of-function mutations affecting H2Bub1 in CHD patients (enrichment 6.01, P = 1.67 \u00d7 10-03), some of whom had abnormal laterality associated with ciliary dysfunction. In Xenopus, knockdown of rnf20 and rnf40 results in abnormal heart looping, defective development of left-right (LR) asymmetry, and impaired cilia motility. Rnf20, Rnf40, and Ube2b affect LR patterning and cilia synergistically. Examination of global H2Bub1 level in Xenopus embryos shows that H2Bub1 is developmentally regulated and requires Rnf20. To examine gene-specific H2Bub1, we performed ChIP-seq of mouse ciliated and nonciliated tissues and showed tissue-specific H2Bub1 marks significantly enriched at cilia genes including the transcription factor Rfx3 Rnf20 knockdown results in decreased levels of rfx3 mRNA in Xenopus, and exogenous rfx3 can rescue the Rnf20 depletion phenotype. These data suggest that Rnf20 functions at the Rfx3 locus regulating cilia motility and cardiac situs and identify H2Bub1 as an upstream transcriptional regulator controlling tissue-specific expression of cilia genes.
