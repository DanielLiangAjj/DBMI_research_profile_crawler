However, measuring cell morphology remains an active field of research, which has inspired multiple computer vision algorithms over the years. Here, we show that DINO, a vision-transformer based, self-supervised algorithm, has a remarkable ability for learning rich representations of cellular morphology without manual annotations or any other type of supervision. We evaluate DINO on a wide variety of tasks across three publicly available imaging datasets of diverse specifications and biological focus. We find that DINO encodes meaningful features of cellular morphology at multiple scales, from subcellular and single-cell resolution, to multi-cellular and aggregated experimental groups. Importantly, DINO successfully uncovers a hierarchy of biological and technical factors of variation in imaging datasets. The results show that DINO can support the study of unknown biological variation, including single-cell heterogeneity and relationships between samples, making it an excellent tool for image-based biological discovery.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Doron", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Th\u00e9o", "Last Name": "Moutakanni", "Affiliation": "Meta AI, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Zitong S", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikita", "Last Name": "Moshkov", "Affiliation": "Synthetic and Systems Biology Unit, Biological Research Centre (BRC), Szeged, Hungary."}, {"First Name": "Mathilde", "Last Name": "Caron", "Affiliation": "Meta AI, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Hugo", "Last Name": "Touvron", "Affiliation": "Meta AI, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Piotr", "Last Name": "Bojanowski", "Affiliation": "Meta AI, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Wolfgang M", "Last Name": "Pernice", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan C", "Last Name": "Caicedo", "Affiliation": "Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Jun18"}, {"PMID": "35617047", "Title": "RRM1 variants cause a mitochondrial DNA maintenance disorder via impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis.", "Abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion/deletions syndromes (MDDS) encompass a clinically and etiologically heterogenous group of mitochondrial disorders caused by impaired mtDNA maintenance. Among the most frequent causes of MDDS are defects in nucleoside/nucleotide metabolism, which is critical for synthesis and homeostasis of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrates of mtDNA replication. A central enzyme for generating dNTPs is ribonucleotide reductase, a critical mediator of de novo nucleotide synthesis composed of catalytic RRM1 subunits in complex with RRM2 or p53R2. Here, we report 5 probands from 4 families who presented with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia as well as other clinical manifestations and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle. We identified 3 RRM1 loss-of-function variants, including a dominant catalytic site variant (NP_001024.1: p.N427K) and 2 homozygous recessive variants at p.R381, which has evolutionarily conserved interactions with the specificity site. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations indicate mechanisms by which RRM1 variants affect protein structure. Cultured primary skin fibroblasts of probands manifested mtDNA depletion under cycling conditions, indicating impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis. Fibroblasts also exhibited aberrant nucleoside diphosphate and dNTP pools and mtDNA ribonucleotide incorporation. Our data reveal that primary RRM1 deficiency and, by extension, impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis are causes of MDDS.", "Keywords": ["Genetic diseases", "Genetics", "Mitochondria", "Molecular pathology"], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Replication", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Humans", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Nucleosides", "Nucleotides", "Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase", "Ribonucleotide Reductases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Shintaku", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, H.

Mother-daughter age asymmetry in yeast is achieved, in part, by inheritance of higher-functioning mitochondria by buds and retention of some high-functioning mitochondria in mother cells. The mitochondrial F box protein, Mfb1p, tethers mitochondria at both poles in a cell cycle-regulated manner: it localizes to and anchors mitochondria at the mother cell tip throughout the cell cycle and at the bud tip before cytokinesis. Here, we report that cell polarity and polarized localization of Mfb1p decline with age in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, deletion of genes (BUD1, BUD2, and BUD5) that mediate symmetry breaking during establishment of cell polarity and asymmetric yeast cell division cause depolarized Mfb1p localization and defects in mitochondrial distribution and quality control.

In yeast, the ERMES complex is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria tether composed of four proteins, three of which contain a SMP (synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid binding protein) domain. No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-mitochondria contacts. The SMP domain of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP domain found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells. In neurons, PDZD8 was required for calcium ion (Ca2+) uptake by mitochondria after synaptically induced Ca2+-release from ER and thereby regulated cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics. Thus, PDZD8 represents a critical ER-mitochondria tethering protein in metazoans.

We find that the mitochondrial F-box protein (Mfb1p) localizes to mitochondria in the mother tip and is required for mitochondrial anchorage at that site, independent of the previously identified anchorage protein Num1p. Deletion of MFB1 results in loss of the mother-tip-localized mitochondrial population, defects in mitochondrial function and premature replicative ageing.
