Existing processes for soil remediation suffer from long treatment time and lack generality because of different sources, occurrences, and properties of pollutants. Here, we report a high-temperature electrothermal process for rapid, water-free remediation of multiple pollutants in soil. The temperature of contaminated soil with carbon additives ramps up to 1000 to 3000\u2009\u00b0C as needed within seconds via pulsed direct current input, enabling the vaporization of heavy metals like Cd, Hg, Pb, Co, Ni, and Cu, and graphitization of persistent organic pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The rapid treatment retains soil mineral constituents while increases infiltration rate and exchangeable nutrient supply, leading to soil fertilization and improved germination rates.

Porous membranes are integral components of in vitro tissue barrier and co-culture models, and their interaction with cells and tissues affects the performance and physiological relevance of these model systems. Parylene C and Parylene N are two biocompatible Parylene variants with potential for use in these models, but their effect on cellular behavior is not as well understood as more commonly used cell culture substrates, such as tissue culture treated polystyrene and glass. Here, we use a simple approach for benchtop oxygen plasma treatment and investigate the changes in cell spreading and extracellular matrix deposition as well as the physical and chemical changes in material surface properties. Our results support and build on previous findings of positive effects of plasma treatment on Parylene biocompatibility while showing a more pronounced improvement for Parylene C compared to Parylene N. We measured relatively minor changes in surface roughness following plasma treatments, but significant changes in oxygen concentration at the surface persisted for 7 days and was likely the dominant factor in improving cellular behavior.

The African Inland Church Kijabe Hospital (AICKH) is a level 4 missionary hospital. The hospital serves the Kenyan population in many areas, including cancer care, and some of these services were affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to leverage a recently established hospital-based cancer registry of patients treated at AICKH between 2014 and 2020 to describe the cancer cases and patient referral patterns seen at AICKH during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A cross-sectional retrospective survey was conducted through medical records abstraction in the surgery, breast clinic, palliative care and pathology departments. A total of 3279 cases were included in the study, with females accounting for 58.1% of the cases. The top-three cancers overall were breast (23.0%), oesophagus (20.5%) and prostate (8.6%). There was a minimal increase in the number of cancer cases in 2020 (1.7%) compared with 2019, with an increase of 19.3% in 2019 compared with 2018. In conclusion, AICKH is one of the few hospitals in Kenya where a large number of cancer patients seek healthcare, and referral of cancer cases changed in 2020, which may be due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent studies have shown the feasibility of preparing doped graphene from graphene oxide and its derivatives via some post-treatments, including solid-state and solvothermal methods, but they require reactive and harsh reagents. However, direct synthesis of various heteroatom-doped graphene in larger quantities and high purity through bottom-up methods remains challenging. Here, we report catalyst-free and solvent-free direct synthesis of graphene doped with various heteroatoms in bulk via flash Joule heating (FJH). Seven types of heteroatom-doped flash graphene (FG) are synthesized through millisecond flashing, including single-element-doped FG (boron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur), two-element-co-doped FG (boron and nitrogen), as well as three-element-co-doped FG (boron, nitrogen, and sulfur). A variety of low-cost dopants, such as elements, oxides, and organic compounds are used. The graphene quality of heteroatom-doped FG is high, and similar to intrinsic FG, the material exhibits turbostraticity, increased interlayer spacing, and superior dispersibility. Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction of different heteroatom-doped FG is tested, and sulfur-doped FG shows the best performance. Lithium metal battery tests demonstrate that nitrogen-doped FG exhibits a smaller nucleation overpotential compared to Cu or undoped FG. The electrical energy cost for the synthesis of heteroatom-doped FG synthesis is only 1.2 to 10.7 kJ g-1, which could render the FJH method suitable for low-cost mass production of heteroatom-doped graphene.", "Keywords": ["catalyst-free", "direct synthesis", "flash Joule heating", "flash graphene", "heteroatom-doping"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Weiyin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John Tianci", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jacob L", "Last Name": "Beckham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin M", "Last Name": "Wyss", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Advincula", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lucas", "Last Name": "Eddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carter", "Last Name": "Kittrell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jinhang", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Duy Xuan", "Last Name": "Luong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Tour", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS nano", "PubDate": "2022Apr26"}, {"PMID": "35138886", "Title": "Rare earth elements from waste.", "Abstract": "Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical materials in electronics and clean technologies.

To illustrate the types of studies that are enabled by PTA, we developed direct measurement of environmental mutagenicity (DMEM), a tool for mapping genome-wide interactions of mutagens with single living human cells at base-pair resolution. In addition, we utilized PTA for genome-wide off-target indel and structural variant detection in cells that had undergone CRISPR-mediated genome editing, establishing the feasibility for performing single-cell evaluations of biopsies from edited tissues.

These bacterial coinfections increase influenza-associated morbidity and mortality through a number of immunological and viral-mediated mechanisms, but the specific bacterial genes that contribute to postinfluenza pathogenicity are not known. Here, we used genome-wide transposon mutagenesis (Tn-Seq) to reveal bacterial genes that confer improved fitness in influenza virus-infected hosts. The majority of the 32 genes identified are involved in bacterial metabolism, including nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, protein translation, and membrane transport. We generated mutants with single-gene deletions (SGD) of five of the genes identified, SPD1414, SPD2047 (cbiO1), SPD0058 (purD), SPD1098, and SPD0822 (proB), to investigate their effects on in vivo fitness, disease severity, and host immune responses. The growth of the SGD mutants was slightly attenuated in vitro and in vivo, but each still grew to high titers in the lungs of mock- and influenza virus-infected hosts. Despite high bacterial loads, mortality was significantly reduced or delayed with all SGD mutants. Time-dependent reductions in pulmonary neutrophils, inflammatory macrophages, and select proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also observed. Immunohistochemical staining further revealed altered neutrophil distribution with reduced degeneration in the lungs of influenza virus-SGD mutant-coinfected animals.

The miniaturization of fluidics and controls has been the focus of current work on hemodialysis (HD) devices. This approach has not addressed the membrane efficiency needed for toxin clearance in small-format hemodialysis devices. Dr. Willem Kolff built the first dialyzer in 1943 and many changes have been made to HD technology since then. However, conventional HD still uses large instruments with bulky dialysis cartridges made of ~2 m2 of 10 micron thick, tortuous-path membrane material. Portable, wearable, and implantable HD systems may improve clinical outcomes for patients with end-stage renal disease by increasing the frequency of dialysis. The ability of ultrathin silicon-based sheet membranes to clear toxins is tested along with an analytical model predicting long-term multi-pass experiments from single-pass clearance experiments. Advanced fabrication methods are introduced that produce a new type of nanoporous silicon nitride sheet membrane that features the pore sizes needed for middle-weight toxin removal. Benchtop clearance results with sheet membranes (~3 cm2) match a theoretical model and indicate that sheet membranes can reduce (by orders of magnitude) the amount of membrane material required for hemodialysis. This provides the performance needed for small-format hemodialysis.", "Keywords": ["hemodialysis", "model", "nanomembranes"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "SiMPore, Inc. 150 Lucius Gordon Drive, Suite 110, West Henrietta, NY 14586, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared A", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "SiMPore, Inc. 150 Lucius Gordon Drive, Suite 110, West Henrietta, NY 14586, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kayli", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jon-Paul S", "Last Name": "DesOrmeaux", "Affiliation": "SiMPore, Inc. 150 Lucius Gordon Drive, Suite 110, West Henrietta, NY 14586, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering Department, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY 14623, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas R", "Last Name": "Gaborski", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering Department, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY 14623, USA."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Roussie", "Affiliation": "SiMPore, Inc. 150 Lucius Gordon Drive, Suite 110, West Henrietta, NY 14586, USA."}, {"First Name": "James L", "Last Name": "McGrath", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dean G", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA."}], "Journal": "Membranes", "PubDate": "2020Jun06"}, {"PMID": "32118888", "Title": "CIE self-luminous gray-scale calculation: inflections, parameters, and high-contrast limiting behavior.", "Abstract": "Wide generalizability of the CIE-recommended gray-scale calculation for self-luminous devices suggests that its parameters, the extrema of the calculation's derivatives, and its limiting behavior are fundamental.

Given that the liver is particularly important to human health, several advanced culture methods have been developed to experiment with liver disease states, including infection with Plasmodium parasites, the causative agent of malaria. These models have demonstrated that intrahepatic parasites require functionally stable hepatocytes to thrive and robust characterization of the parasite populations' response to investigational therapies is dependent on high-content and high-resolution imaging (HC/RI). We previously reported abiotic confinement extends the functional longevity of primary hepatocytes in a microfluidic platform and set out to instill confinement in a microtiter plate platform while maintaining optical accessibility for HC/RI; with an end-goal of producing an improved P. vivax liver stage culture model. We developed a novel fabrication process in which a PDMS soft mold embosses hepatocyte-confining microfeatures into polystyrene, resulting in microfeature-based hepatocyte confinement (\u03bcHEP) slides and plates. Our process was optimized to form both microfeatures and culture wells in a single embossing step, resulting in a 100 \u03bcm-thick bottom ideal for HC/RI, and was found inexpensively amendable to microfeature design changes. Microfeatures improved intrahepatic parasite infection rates and \u03bcHEP systems were used to reconfirm the activity of reference antimalarials in phenotypic dose-response assays. RNAseq of hepatocytes in \u03bcHEP systems demonstrated microfeatures sustain hepatic differentiation and function, suggesting broader utility for preclinical hepatic assays; while our tailorable

These mutant proteins can be processed and presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex molecules as neoepitopes, allowing CD8+ T cells to mount responses against them. For solid tumors, only an average 2% of neoepitopes predicted by algorithms have detectable endogenous antitumor T cell responses. This suggests that low mutation burden tumors, which include many pediatric tumors, are poorly immunogenic. Here, we report that pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have tumor-associated neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells, responding to 86% of tested neoantigens and recognizing 68% of the tested neoepitopes. These responses include a public neoantigen from the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion that is targeted in seven of nine tested patients. We characterized phenotypic and transcriptional profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at the single-cell level and found a heterogeneous population that included highly functional effectors.

The same developmental origin makes it difficult to identify specific markers that discern between an intraembryonic versus YS-origin using a lineage trace approach. Additionally, the highly migratory nature of blood cells and the inability of pre-circulatory embryonic cells (i.e., 5-7 somite pairs (sp)) to robustly engraft in transplantation, even after culture, has precluded scientists from properly answering these questions. Here we report robust, multi-lineage and serially transplantable dHSC activity from cultured 2-7sp murine embryonic explants (Em-Ex). dHSC are undetectable in 2-7sp YS explants. Additionally, the engraftment from Em-Ex is confined to an emerging CD31+CD45+c-Kit+CD41- population.

Meditation and rhythmic breathing produced significant increases in alpha brain activity. These brain physiological responses conformed to the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) changes, suggesting the ability of the human body to enter into a meditative state and effectively manage stress. When assessed after four weeks of daily practicing the techniques employed in the stress management protocol, based on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, subjects improved in applying mindfulness skills. The overall mindfulness score, Pleth variability index (PVI), and perfusion index (PI) increased after the 4-week intervention period.

Yet, the genetic evolution of H9N2 viruses in various host organisms in China has not been systematically investigated since 2009. In the present study, we performed large-scale sequence analysis of H9N2 viral genomes from public databases, representing the spectrum of viruses isolated from birds, mammals and humans in China from 1994 to 2013, and updated the clade classification for each segment. We identified 117 distinct genotypes in 730 H9N2 viruses. We analyzed the sequences of all eight segments in each virus and found three important time points: the years 2000, 2006 and 2010. In the periods divided by these years, genotypic diversity, geographic distribution and host range changed considerably. Genotypic diversity fluctuated greatly in 2000 and 2006. Since 2010, a single genotype became predominant in poultry throughout China, and the eastern coastal region became the newly identified epidemic center. Throughout their 20-year prevalence in China, H9N2 influenza viruses have emerged and adapted from aquatic birds to chickens. The minor avian species and wild birds exacerbated H9N2 genotypes by providing diversified genes, and chickens were the most prevalent vector in which the viruses evolved and expanded their prevalence.

To address this issue, a diverse group of stakeholders convened at the Building Capacity for Biology Education Research at Community Colleges meeting to discuss how to increase the prevalence of CC BER and foster participation of CC faculty as BER collaborators and authors. The group identified characteristics of CCs that make them excellent environments for studying biology teaching and learning, including student diversity and institutional cultures that prioritize teaching, learning, and assessment. The group also identified constraints likely to impede BER at CCs: limited time, resources, support, and incentives, as well as misalignment between doing research and CC faculty identities as teachers.

Here we report on an optically transparent ultrathin membrane with porosity exceeding 20%. We optimize deposition and annealing conditions to create a tensile and robust porous silicon dioxide membrane that is comparable in thickness to the vascular basement membrane (100-300 nm). We demonstrate that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) spread and proliferate on these membranes similarly to control substrates. Additionally, HUVECs are able to transfer cytoplasmic cargo to adipose-derived stem cells when they are co-cultured on opposite sides of the membrane, demonstrating its thickness supports physiologically relevant cellular interactions. Lastly, we confirm that these porous glass membranes are compatible with lift-off processes yielding membrane sheets with an active area of many square centimeters.

The body's reserve to compensate for reduced circulating blood volume is called the 'compensatory reserve'. The compensatory reserve can be accurately evaluated with real-time measurements of changes in the features of the arterial waveform measured with the use of a high-powered computer. Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) has been shown to simulate many of the physiological responses in humans associated with hemorrhage, and is used to study the compensatory response to hemorrhage.

In this study, we used a combination of targeted deletion, high-resolution splicing detection, and single-cell sequencing to deeply probe ASXL1 circular splicing. We found that efficient circular splicing required the canonical transcriptional start site and inverted AluSx elements. Sequencing-based interrogation of isoforms after ASXL1 overexpression identified promiscuous linear splicing between all exons, with the two most abundant non-canonical linear products skipping the exons that produced the circular isoforms. Single-cell sequencing revealed a strong preference for either the linear or circular ASXL1 isoforms in each cell, and found the predominant exon skipping product is frequently co-expressed with its reciprocal circular isoform. Finally, absolute quantification of ASXL1 isoforms confirmed our findings and suggests that standard methods overestimate circRNA abundance.

Due to growing interests in alternative and complementary medicine by Westerners, many of the traditions and holistic yogic breathing practices today are being utilized as a measure for healthier lifestyles. These state-of-the-art practices can have a significant impact on common mental health conditions such as depression and generalized anxiety disorder. However, the potential of yogic breathing on optimizing human performance and overall well-being is not well known. Breathing techniques such as alternate nostril, Sudarshan Kriya and bhastrika utilizes rhythmic breathing to guide practitioners into a deep meditative state of relaxation and promote self-awareness. Furthermore, yogic breathing is physiologically stimulating and can be described as a natural \"technological\" solution to optimize human performance which can be categorized into: (1) cognitive function (i.e., mind, vigilance); and (2) physical performance (i.e., cardiorespiratory, metabolism, exercise, whole body). Based on previous studies, we postulate that daily practice of breathing meditation techniques play a significant role in preserving the compensatory mechanisms available to sustain physiological function. This preservation of physiological function may help to offset the time associated with reaching a threshold for clinical expression of chronic state (i.e., hypertension, depression, dementia) or acute state (i.e., massive hemorrhage, panic attic) of medical conditions. However, additional rigorous biomedical research is needed to evaluate the physiological mechanisms of various forms of meditation (i.e., breath-based, mantra, mindfulness) on human performance. These efforts will help to define how compensatory reserve mechanisms of cardiovascular and immune systems are modulated by breath-based meditation. While it has been suggested that breath-based meditation is easier for beginning practitioners when compared to other forms of meditation more research is needed to elucidate these observations. A breath-based meditation sequence such as Sudarshan Kriya has the potential to help develop an individual's self-awareness and support better integration of the brain (i.e., mind) with other organ systems (i.e., body) for enhanced human performance.", "Keywords": ["Breathing technique", "Cognitive reserve", "Emotional regulation", "Human performance", "Meditation", "Neurophysiology", "Stress"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kirtigandha Salwe", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Kirtigandha Salwe Carter, Department of Integrative Physiology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Kirtigandha Salwe Carter, Department of Integrative Physiology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX 76107, United States."}], "Journal": "World journal of clinical cases", "PubDate": "2016Apr16"}, {"PMID": "26885992", "Title": "Hyperoxic resuscitation following hemorrhage: Good, harmless, or harmful?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Resuscitation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lusha", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "Tactical Combat Casualty Care Research Army Institute of Surgical Research San Antonio, TX."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Hinojosa-Laborde", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The journal of trauma and acute care surgery", "PubDate": "2016May"}, {"PMID": "26884477", "Title": "Variability in integration of mechanisms associated with high tolerance to progressive reductions in central blood volume: the compensatory reserve.", "Abstract": "High tolerance to progressive reductions in central blood volume has been associated with higher heart rate (HR), peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), and vagally mediated cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS).

Contrary to our hypothesis, higher HR, PVR, SNA, and BRS were not associated with greater tolerance to reduced central blood volume. These data are the first to demonstrate the variability and uniqueness of individual human physiological strategies designed to compensate for progressive reductions in central blood volume.

In this study, H9N2 AIVs isolated from chickens during 2009-2013 were antigenically analyzed by performing hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization assays using a panel of polyclonal antibodies. Our findings confirmed the antigenic drift of recent H9N2 viruses from the commercial vaccine and showed that most of these antigenic variants form a novel HI antigenic group, F, with a few belonging to groups D and E. Slight antigenic variation was observed in group F viruses. Genetic analysis of amino acid sequences deduced from hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences indicated that 9 of 15 mutations predominant in the 2009-2013 viruses can be mapped to known antigenic sites, which might be responsible for the novel antigenicity of group F. These antigenic changes make it necessary to modify the influenza vaccine to ensure efficient protection. A vaccine candidate, Ck/HeB/YT/10, was selected and provided significant protection against viruses from different antigenic groups in terms of reduction in virus shedding, suggesting broad cross-reactivity. Taken together, our results indicate that the H9N2 chicken influenza viruses in China have evolved from distinct antigenic groups into a novel group F that became dominant during the country-wide outbreak and now seems to be undergoing new antigenic divergence.

H1N1 viruses of avian origin have also caused 3 of 5 pandemics. To understand the reappearance of H1N1 in the context of pandemic emergence, we investigated whether avian H1N1 IAVs have contributed to the evolution of human, swine, and 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAVs. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, we concluded that the polymerase gene segments (especially PB2 and PA) circulating in North American avian H1N1 IAVs have been reintroduced to swine multiple times, resulting in different lineages that led to the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAVs. Moreover, the similar topologies of hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein and neuraminidase and matrix gene segments suggest that each surface glycoprotein coevolved with an internal gene segment within the H1N1 subtype. The genotype of avian H1N1 IAVs of Charadriiformes origin isolated in 2009 differs from that of avian H1N1 IAVs of Anseriformes origin. When the antigenic sites in the hemagglutinin of all 31 North American avian H1N1 IAVs were considered, 60%-80% of the amino acids at the antigenic sites were identical to those in 1918 and/or 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Thus, although the pathogenicity of avian H1N1 IAVs could not be inferred from the phylogeny due to the small dataset, the evolutionary process within the H1N1 IAV subtype suggests that the circulation of H1N1 IAVs in wild birds poses a continuous threat for future influenza pandemics in humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genes, Viral", "Genome, Viral", "Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus", "Humans", "Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype", "Phylogeny", "RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase", "Reassortant Viruses", "Swine", "Viral Nonstructural Proteins", "Viral Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zeynep A", "Last Name": "Ko\u00e7er", "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Division of Virology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jinghui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert G", "Last Name": "Webster", "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Division of Virology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America; Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "26195943", "Title": "Breast Cancer and Sarcoidosis: Case Series and Review of the Literature.", "Abstract": "Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, which can involve different organs and systems.

generally associated with greater sympathoexcitation, high-frequency oscillatory patterns of mean arterial pressure (MAP), and tachycardia. On average, women are less tolerant to central hypovolemia than men; however, the autonomic mechanisms governing these comparisons are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that women with relatively high tolerance (HT) to central hypovolemia would display similar physiological reserve capacity for sympathoexcitation and oscillations in MAP at presyncope compared to HT men. About 10 men and five women were exposed to progressive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) until the presence of presyncopal symptoms. Based on our previous classification system, all subjects were classified as HT because they completed at least -60\u00a0mmHg LBNP. Muscle sympathetic serve activity (MSNA) was measured directly from the peroneal nerve via microneurography and arterial pressure (AP) was measured at the finger by photoplethysmography. LBNP time to presyncope was less (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in women (1727\u00a0\u00b1\u00a070\u00a0sec) than in men (2022\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0201\u00a0sec).

Coincident with similar stroke volume (SV) at presyncope, women had similar MAP and heart rates. However, women had less physiological reserve capacity for SV, AP-MSNA coherence, and oscillations in the high-frequency (HF) components of arterial pressure compared to men. Contrary to our hypothesis, lower tolerance to central hypovolemia in women was not associated with sympathoexcitation, but can be explained, in part by lower physiological reserve to elicit oscillatory patterns in AP, maintenance of AP-MSNA coherence and SV when compared to men.", "Keywords": ["Baroreflex activity", "blood Loss", "gender", "lower body negative pressure"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "US Army Institute of Surgical Research JBSA Fort Sam Houston, Houston, Texas robert.carter422.mil@mail.mil."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Hinojosa-Laborde", "Affiliation": "US Army Institute of Surgical Research JBSA Fort Sam Houston, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Victor A", "Last Name": "Convertino", "Affiliation": "US Army Institute of Surgical Research JBSA Fort Sam Houston, Houston, Texas."}], "Journal": "Physiological reports", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "26095253", "Title": "Critical Role for the DNA Sensor AIM2 in Stem Cell Proliferation and Cancer.", "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths.

The factors that allow interspecies transmission but limit human-to-human transmission are unknown. Here we show that A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9) influenza virus infection of chickens (natural hosts) is asymptomatic and that it generates a high genetic diversity. In contrast, diversity is tightly restricted in infected ferrets, limiting further adaptation to a fully transmissible form. Airborne transmission in ferrets is accompanied by the mutations in PB1, NP and NA genes that reduce viral polymerase and neuraminidase activity. Therefore, while A(H7N9) virus can infect mammals, further adaptation appears to incur a fitness cost. Our results reveal that a tight genetic bottleneck during avian-to-mammalian transmission is a limiting factor in A(H7N9) influenza virus adaptation to mammals.

Internalized viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) of negative-strand RNA viruses induce an early IFN response by interacting with retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and its recruitment to mitochondria. Here we employ three-dimensional stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to visualize incoming influenza A virus (IAV) vRNPs as helical-like structures associated with mitochondria. Unexpectedly, an early IFN induction in response to vRNPs is not detected. A distinct amino-acid motif in the viral polymerases, PB1/PA, suppresses early IFN induction. Mutation of this motif leads to reduced pathogenicity in vivo, whereas restoration increases it. Evolutionary dynamics in these sequences suggest that completion of the motif, combined with viral reassortment can contribute to pandemic risks.

Recent reports demonstrated a crucial role for interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in osteomyelitis, but deletion of the inflammasome components caspase-1 and NLRP3 failed to rescue Pstpip2(cmo) mice from inflammatory bone disease. Thus, the upstream mechanisms controlling IL-1\u03b2 production in Pstpip2(cmo) mice remain to be identified. In addition, the environmental factors driving IL-1\u03b2-dependent inflammatory bone erosion are unknown. Here we show that the intestinal microbiota of diseased Pstpip2(cmo) mice was characterized by an outgrowth of Prevotella. Notably, Pstpip2(cmo) mice that were fed a diet rich in fat and cholesterol maintained a normal body weight, but were markedly protected against inflammatory bone disease and bone erosion. Diet-induced protection against osteomyelitis was accompanied by marked reductions in intestinal Prevotella levels and significantly reduced pro-IL-1\u03b2 expression in distant neutrophils. Furthermore, pro-IL-1\u03b2 expression was also decreased in Pstpip2(cmo) mice treated with antibiotics, and in wild-type mice that were kept under germ-free conditions. We further demonstrate that combined deletion of caspases 1 and 8 was required for protection against IL-1\u03b2-dependent inflammatory bone disease, whereas the deletion of either caspase alone or of elastase or neutrophil proteinase 3 failed to prevent inflammatory disease. Collectively, this work reveals diet-associated changes in the intestinal microbiome as a crucial factor regulating inflammasome- and caspase-8-mediated maturation of IL-1\u03b2 and osteomyelitis in Pstpip2(cmo) mice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Body Weight", "Caspase 1", "Caspase 8", "Cholesterol", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Diet, High-Fat", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Inflammasomes", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-1beta", "Intestines", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Microbiota", "Myeloblastin", "Neutrophils", "Osteomyelitis", "Pancreatic Elastase", "Prevotella"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Lukens", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Prajwal", "Last Name": "Gurung", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Vogel", "Affiliation": "Animal Resources Center and the Veterinary Pathology Core, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordon R", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "McGoldrick", "Affiliation": "Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Srinivasa Rao", "Last Name": "Bandi", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher R", "Last Name": "Calabrese", "Affiliation": "Small Animal Imaging Core, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lieselotte", "Last Name": "Vande Walle", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Medical Protein Research, VIB, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium [2] Department of Biochemistry, Ghent University, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Mohamed", "Last Name": "Lamkanfi", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Medical Protein Research, VIB, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium [2] Department of Biochemistry, Ghent University, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Thirumala-Devi", "Last Name": "Kanneganti", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2014Dec11"}, {"PMID": "25016024", "Title": "Respiratory pump contributes to increased physiological reserve for compensation during simulated haemorrhage.", "Abstract": "Intrathoracic pressure regulation (IPR) represents a therapy for increasing systemic circulation through the creation of negative intrathoracic pressure.

PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a 'steric zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "HeLa Cells", "Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B", "Humans", "Inclusion Bodies", "Male", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "Myositis, Inclusion Body", "Osteitis Deformans", "Peptide Termination Factors", "Prions", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "RNA", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hong Joo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38120, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nam Chul", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yong-Dong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily A", "Last Name": "Scarborough", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zamia", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kyle S", "Last Name": "MacLea", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Freibaum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Songqing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amandine", "Last Name": "Molliex", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anderson P", "Last Name": "Kanagaraj", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin B", "Last Name": "Boylan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aleksandra M", "Last Name": "Wojtas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosa", "Last Name": "Rademakers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jack L", "Last Name": "Pinkus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Greenberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John Q", "Last Name": "Trojanowski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bryan J", "Last Name": "Traynor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bradley N", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Topp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Athina-Soragia", "Last Name": "Gkazi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jack", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Kottlors", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janbernd", "Last Name": "Kirschner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Pestronk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yun R", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alice Flynn", "Last Name": "Ford", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aaron D", "Last Name": "Gitler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Benatar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oliver D", "Last Name": "King", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Virginia E", "Last Name": "Kimonis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric D", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Conrad C", "Last Name": "Weihl", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Shorter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Paul", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Mar28"}, {"PMID": "23112125", "Title": "Lymphotoxin \u03b11\u03b22 expression on B cells is required for follicular dendritic cell activation during the germinal center response.", "Abstract": "CD19-deficient mice were used as a model to study follicular dendritic cell (FDC) activation because these mice have normal numbers of FDC-containing primary follicles, but lack the ability to activate FDCs or form GCs. It was hypothesized that CD19 expression is necessary for B-cell activation and upregulation of membrane lymphotoxin (mLT) expression, which promotes FDC activation. Using VCAM-1 and Fc\u03b3RII/III as FDC activation markers, it was determined that the adoptive transfer of CD19(+) wild-type B cells into CD19-deficient hosts rescued GC formation and FDC activation, demonstrating that CD19 expression on B cells is required for FDC activation. In contrast, CD19(+) donor B cells lacking mLT were unable to induce VCAM-1 expression on FDCs, furthermore Fc\u03b3RII/III upregulation was impaired in FDCs stimulated with mLT-deficient B cells. VCAM-1 expression on FDCs, but not Fc\u03b3RII/III, was rescued when CD19-deficient B cells expressing transgenic mLT were cotransferred into recipient mice with CD19(+) , mLT-deficient B cells, suggesting that FDC activation requires the CD19-dependent upregulation of mLT on activated B cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that activated B cells are responsible for the initiation of FDC activation resulting in a microenvironment supportive of GC development and maintenance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens, CD19", "B-Lymphocytes", "Dendritic Cells, Follicular", "Germinal Center", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphotoxin alpha1, beta2 Heterotrimer", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Receptors, IgG", "Up-Regulation", "Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Riley C", "Last Name": "Myers", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA."}, {"First Name": "R Glenn", "Last Name": "King", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Louis B", "Last Name": "Justement", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "European journal of immunology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
