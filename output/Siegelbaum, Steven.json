Here we provide evidence from combined immunogold electron microscopy, cell-type specific genetic deletion and pharmacology that the NMDARs required for supralinear temporal summation of the CA1 PP EPSP are presynaptic, located in the PP terminals.

Whether the social aggression and SNR memory functions of dCA2 are related or represent independent processes is unknown. Here we investigated the hypotheses that an animal is more likely to attack a novel compared to familiar animal and that dCA2 promotes social aggression through its ability to discriminate between novel and familiar conspecifics. To test these ideas, we conducted a multi-day resident intruder (R-I) test of aggression towards novel and familiar conspecifics. We found that mice were more likely to attack a novel compared to familiarized intruder and that silencing of dCA2 caused a more profound inhibition of aggression towards a novel than familiarized intruder. To explore whether and how dCA2 pyramidal neurons encode aggression, we recorded their activity using microendoscopic calcium imaging throughout the days of the R-I test. We found that a fraction of dCA2 neurons were selectively activated or inhibited during exploration, dominance, and attack behaviors and that these signals were enhanced during interaction with a novel compared to familiarized conspecific. Based on dCA2 population activity, a set of binary linear classifiers accurately decoded whether an animal was engaged in each of these forms of social behavior. Of particular interest, the accuracy of decoding aggression was greater with novel compared to familiarized intruders, with significant cross-day decoding using the same familiar animal on each day but not for a familiar-novel pair.

A role for CA2 in seizure generation was suggested based on findings of a reduction in CA2 synaptic inhibition (Williamson and Spencer, 1994) and the presence of interictal-like spike activity in CA2 in resected hippocampal tissue from TLE patients (Wittner et al., 2009). We recently found that in the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PILO-SE) mouse model of TLE there was an increase in CA2 intrinsic excitability associated with a loss of CA2 synaptic inhibition. Furthermore, chemogenetic silencing of CA2 significantly reduced seizure frequency, consistent with a role of CA2 in promoting seizure generation and/or propagation (Whitebirch et al., 2022). In the present study, we explored the cellular basis of this inhibitory deficit using immunohistochemical and electrophysiological approaches in PILO-SE male and female mice. We report a widespread decrease in the density of pro-cholecystokinin-immunopositive (CCK+) interneurons and a functional impairment of CCK+ interneuron-mediated inhibition of CA2 PNs. We also found a disruption in the perisomatic perineuronal net in the CA2 stratum pyramidale. Such pathologic alterations may contribute to an enhanced excitation of CA2 PNs and CA2-dependent seizure activity in the PILO-SE mouse model.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Impaired synaptic inhibition in hippocampal circuits has been identified as a key feature that contributes to the emergence and propagation of seizure activity in human patients and animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Among the hippocampal subfields, the CA2 region is particularly resilient to seizure-associated neurodegeneration and has been suggested to play a key role in seizure activity in TLE.

Here, we developed a modified social fear conditioning paradigm that induced in both sexes robust behavioral discrimination of a conspecific associated with a footshock (CS+) from a non-reinforced interaction partner (CS-).

One-photon calcium imaging revealed that the accuracy with which CA2 representations discriminate the CS+ from the CS-animal was enhanced following social fear conditioning and strongly correlated with behavioral discrimination. Moreover the CA2 representations incorporated a generalized or abstract representation of social valence irrespective of conspecific identity and location.

However, distal dendritic spikes are subject to significant attenuation by dendritic cable properties, and often produce only a weak subthreshold depolarization of the soma. Nonetheless, such spikes have been implicated in memory storage, sensory perception and place field formation. How can such a weak somatic response produce such powerful behavioral effects? Here, we use dual dendritic and somatic recordings in acute hippocampal slices of male mice to reveal that dendritic spike propagation, but not spike initiation, is strongly enhanced when the somatic resting potential is depolarized, likely as a result of increased inactivation of A-type K+ channels. Somatic depolarization also facilitates the induction of a form of dendritic spike driven heterosynaptic plasticity that enhances memory specificity. Thus, the effect of somatic membrane depolarization to enhance dendritic spike propagation and long-term synaptic plasticity is likely to play an important role in hippocampal-dependent spatial representations as well as learning and memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons receive synaptic input along their dendrites but produce action potential (AP) output at their soma. Signals arriving at the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) have little impact on the soma unless they combine to initiate a dendritic spike, which needs to propagate to the soma to trigger an AP. This study shows that small subthreshold depolarization of the soma powerfully enhances the propagation of dendritic spikes, through inactivation of dendritic A-type potassium channels. Enhanced dendritic spike propagation also markedly facilitates the induction of a form of plasticity driven by the distal synaptic inputs.

Previous studies show that differences in dendritic properties and synaptic input density enable the PP inputs to produce a much stronger excitation of CA2 compared with CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here, using mice of both sexes, we report that the difference in PP efficacy varies substantially as a function of presynaptic firing rate. Although a single PP stimulus evokes a 5- to 6-fold greater EPSP in CA2 compared with CA1, a brief high-frequency train of PP stimuli evokes a strongly facilitating postsynaptic response in CA1, with relatively little change in CA2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that blockade of NMDARs significantly reduces strong temporal summation in CA1 but has little impact on that in CA2. As a result of the differences in the frequency- and NMDAR-dependent temporal summation, naturalistic patterns of presynaptic activity evoke CA1 and CA2 responses with distinct dynamics, differentially tuning CA1 and CA2 responses to bursts of presynaptic firing versus single presynaptic spikes, respectively.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent studies have demonstrated that abundant entorhinal cortical innervation and efficient dendritic propagation enable hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons to produce robust excitation evoked by single cortical stimuli, compared with CA1.

A burst of stimuli evokes a strongly facilitating response in CA1, but not in CA2.

Although most studies of interneurons have focused on their role in fast synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA release, different classes of interneurons express unique sets of neuropeptides, many of which have been shown to exert powerful effects on neuronal function and memory when applied pharmacologically. However, relatively little is known about whether and how release of endogenous neuropeptides from inhibitory cells contributes to their behavioral role in regulating memory formation. Here we report that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons participate in social memory storage by enhancing information transfer from hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Notably, this action depends on release of the neuropeptide enkephalin from VIP neurons, causing long-term depression of feedforward inhibition onto CA2 pyramidal cells. Moreover, VIP neuron activity in the CA2 region is increased selectively during exploration of a novel conspecific.

This odor response is driven by direct input from the olfactory bulb, but is also shaped by a dense network of associative or intracortical inputs to piriform, which may enhance or constrain the cortical odor representation. With optogenetic techniques, it is possible to functionally isolate defined inputs to piriform cortex and assess their potential to activate or inhibit piriform pyramidal neurons. The anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) receives direct input from the olfactory bulb and sends an associative projection to piriform cortex that has potential roles in the state-dependent processing of olfactory behaviors. Here, we provide a detailed functional assessment of the AON afferents to piriform in male and female C57Bl/6J mice. We confirm that the AON forms glutamatergic excitatory synapses onto piriform pyramidal neurons; and while these inputs are not as strong as piriform recurrent collaterals, they are less constrained by disynaptic inhibition. Moreover, AON-to-piriform synapses contain a substantial NMDAR-mediated current that prolongs the synaptic response at depolarized potentials. These properties of limited inhibition and slow NMDAR-mediated currents result in strong temporal summation of AON inputs within piriform pyramidal neurons, and suggest that the AON could powerfully enhance activation of piriform neurons in response to odor.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Odor information is transmitted from olfactory receptors to olfactory bulb, and then to piriform cortex, where ensembles of activated neurons form neural representations of the odor. While these ensembles are driven by primary bulbar afferents, and shaped by intracortical recurrent connections, the potential for another early olfactory area, the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), to contribute to piriform activity is not known. Here, we use optogenetic circuit-mapping methods to demonstrate that AON inputs can significantly activate piriform neurons, as they are coupled to NMDAR currents and to relatively modest disynaptic inhibition.

In dorsal CA1, spatial encoding is biased toward CA2 (CA1c) and in deep layers of the radial axis. In contrast, nonspatial coding peaks toward subiculum (CA1a) and in superficial layers. While preferential innervation by spatial vs. nonspatial input from entorhinal cortex (EC) may contribute to this specialization, it cannot fully explain the range of in vivo responses. Differences in intrinsic properties thus may play a critical role in modulating such synaptic input differences. In this study we examined the postsynaptic integrative properties of dorsal CA1 PNs in six subpopulations along the transverse (CA1c, CA1b, CA1a) and radial (deep, superficial) axes. Our results suggest that active and passive properties of deep and superficial neurons evolve over the transverse axis to promote the functional specialization of CA1c vs. CA1a as dictated by their cortical input. We also find that CA1b is not merely an intermediate mix of its neighbors, but uniquely balances low excitability with superior input integration of its mixed input, as may be required for its proposed role in sequence encoding. Thus synaptic input and intrinsic properties combine to functionally compartmentalize CA1 processing into at least three transverse axis regions defined by the processing schemes of their composite radial axis subpopulations.NEW & NOTEWORTHY There is increasing interest in CA1 pyramidal neuron heterogeneity and the functional relevance of this diversity. We find that active and passive properties evolve over the transverse and radial axes in dorsal CA1 to promote the functional specialization of CA1c and CA1a for spatial and nonspatial memory, respectively.

Here, we use pharmacogenetics and optogenetics in mice to acutely and reversibly silence dorsal CA2 and its projections to ventral hippocampus.

Here we explore the cellular and synaptic mechanisms responsible for the differential excitatory drive from the entorhinal cortical pathway onto mouse CA2 compared with CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs). Although both types of neurons receive direct input from entorhinal cortex onto their distal dendrites, these inputs produce a 5- to 6-fold larger EPSP at the soma of CA2 compared with CA1 PNs, which is sufficient to drive action potential output from CA2 but not CA1. Experimental and computational approaches reveal that dendritic propagation is more efficient in CA2 than CA1 as a result of differences in dendritic morphology and dendritic expression of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih). Furthermore, there are three times as many cortical inputs onto CA2 compared with CA1 PN distal dendrites. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the differences in dendritic properties of CA2 compared with CA1 PNs are necessary to enable the CA2 PNs to generate their characteristically large EPSPs in response to their cortical inputs; in contrast, CA1 dendritic properties limit the size of the EPSPs they generate, even to a similar number of cortical inputs. Thus, the matching of dendritic integrative properties with the density of innervation is crucial for the differential processing of information from the direct cortical inputs by CA2 compared with CA1 PNs.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent discoveries have shown that the long-neglected hippocampal CA2 region has distinct synaptic properties and plays a prominent role in social memory and schizophrenia. This study addresses the puzzling finding that the direct entorhinal cortical inputs to hippocampus, which target the very distal pyramidal neuron dendrites, provide an unusually strong excitatory drive at the soma of CA2 pyramidal neurons, with EPSPs that are 5-6 times larger than those in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We here elucidate synaptic and dendritic mechanisms that account quantitatively for the marked difference in EPSP size.

ICAN depends on muscarinic receptor stimulation and exhibits a dependence on neuronal activity, membrane depolarization and Ca(2+)-influx similar to that observed for the sADP. Despite the widespread occurrence of sADPs in neurons throughout the brain, the molecular identity of the ion channels underlying these events, as well as ICAN , remains uncertain. Here we used a combination of genetic, pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the muscarinic receptor-dependent sADP in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mouse prefrontal cortex. First, we confirmed that in the presence of the cholinergic agonist carbachol a brief burst of action potentials triggers a prominent sADP in these neurons. Second, we confirmed that this sADP requires activation of a PLC signaling cascade and intracellular calcium signaling. Third, we obtained direct evidence that the transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 5 channel (TRPM5), which is thought to function as a CAN channel in non-neural cells, contributes importantly to the sADP in the layer 5 neurons. In contrast, the closely related TRPM4 channel may play only a minor role in the sADP.", "Keywords": ["Ca2+-activated non-selective cation (CAN) current", "muscarinic receptors", "persistent firing", "slow afterdepolarization (sADP)", "transient receptor potential melastatin 5 channel (TRPM5)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ya-Ting", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sebastien J", "Last Name": "Thuault", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pierre", "Last Name": "Launay", "Affiliation": "Equipe Avenir, Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Service de N\u00e9phrologie, H\u00f4pital Bichat, Universit\u00e9 Paris Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Robert F", "Last Name": "Margolskee", "Affiliation": "Monell Chemical Senses Center Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric R", "Last Name": "Kandel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute New York, NY, USA ; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University New York, NY, USA ; Kavli Institute for Brain Sciences, Columbia University New York, NY, USA ; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Siegelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute New York, NY, USA ; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University New York, NY, USA ; Kavli Institute for Brain Sciences, Columbia University New York, NY, USA ; Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "25201528", "Title": "Reelin signaling specifies the molecular identity of the pyramidal neuron distal dendritic compartment.", "Abstract": "The apical dendrites of many neurons contain proximal and distal compartments that receive synaptic inputs from different brain regions.

Mnemonic information is processed in the hippocampus through several parallel routes involving distinct subregions. In the classic trisynaptic pathway, information proceeds from entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate gyrus to CA3 and then to CA1, the main hippocampal output. Genetic lesions of EC (ref. 3) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (ref. 4), CA3 (ref. 5) and CA1 (ref. 6) regions have revealed their distinct functions in learning and memory. In contrast, little is known about the role of CA2, a relatively small area interposed between CA3 and CA1 that forms the nexus of a powerful disynaptic circuit linking EC input with CA1 output. Here we report a novel transgenic mouse line that enabled us to selectively examine the synaptic connections and behavioural role of the CA2 region in adult mice. Genetically targeted inactivation of CA2 pyramidal neurons caused a pronounced loss of social memory--the ability of an animal to remember a conspecific--with no change in sociability or several other hippocampus-dependent behaviours, including spatial and contextual memory.

These channels are directly regulated by the binding of cAMP, which both shifts the voltage dependence of HCN channel opening to more positive potentials and increases maximal Ih at extreme negative voltages where voltage gating is complete. Here we report that the HCN channel brain-specific auxiliary subunit TRIP8b produces opposing actions on these two effects of cAMP. In the first action, TRIP8b inhibits the effect of cAMP to shift voltage gating, decreasing both the sensitivity of the channel to cAMP (K1/2) and the efficacy of cAMP (maximal voltage shift); conversely, cAMP binding inhibits these actions of TRIP8b. These mutually antagonistic actions are well described by a cyclic allosteric mechanism in which TRIP8b binding reduces the affinity of the channel for cAMP, with the affinity of the open state for cAMP being reduced to a greater extent than the cAMP affinity of the closed state. In a second apparently independent action, TRIP8b enhances the action of cAMP to increase maximal Ih. This latter effect cannot be explained by the cyclic allosteric model but results from a previously uncharacterized action of TRIP8b to reduce maximal current through the channel in the absence of cAMP. Because the binding of cAMP also antagonizes this second effect of TRIP8b, application of cAMP produces a larger increase in maximal Ih in the presence of TRIP8b than in its absence. These findings may provide a mechanistic explanation for the wide variability in the effects of modulatory transmitters on the voltage gating and maximal amplitude of Ih reported for different neurons in the brain.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cyclic AMP", "Ion Channel Gating", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mutation", "Peroxins", "Protein Binding", "Xenopus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, 2 Department of Pharmacology, and 3 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Bina", "Last Name": "Santoro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Saponaro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Haiying", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Moroni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Siegelbaum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}, {"PMID": "24050406", "Title": "A cortico-hippocampal learning rule shapes inhibitory microcircuit activity to enhance hippocampal information flow.", "Abstract": "How does coordinated activity between distinct brain regions implement a set of learning rules to sculpt information processing in a given neural circuit?

The CCK interneurons provide a surprisingly strong feedforward inhibitory drive to effectively control the coincident excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons by convergent inputs.

Here, we examine the physiological role of Ih in deep layer pyramidal neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), focusing on persistent activity, a form of sustained firing thought to be important for the behavioral function of the PFC during working memory tasks. We find that HCN1 contributes to the intrinsic persistent firing that is induced by a brief depolarizing current stimulus in the presence of muscarinic agonists. Deletion of HCN1 or acute pharmacological blockade of Ih decreases the fraction of neurons capable of generating persistent firing. The reduction in persistent firing is caused by the membrane hyperpolarization that results from the deletion of HCN1 or Ih blockade, rather than a specific role of the hyperpolarization-activated current in generating persistent activity. In vivo recordings show that deletion of HCN1 has no effect on up states, periods of enhanced synaptic network activity. Parallel behavioral studies demonstrate that HCN1 contributes to the PFC-dependent resolution of proactive interference during working memory. These results thus provide genetic evidence demonstrating the importance of HCN1 to intrinsic persistent firing and the behavioral output of the PFC.
