[{"PMID": "38309185", "Title": "Disrupted third visual pathway function in schizophrenia: Evidence from real and implied motion processing.", "Abstract": "Impaired motion perception in schizophrenia has been associated with deficits in social-cognitive processes and with reduced activation of visual sensory regions, including the middle temporal area (MT+) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). These findings are consistent with the recent proposal of the existence of a specific 'third visual pathway' specialized for social perception in which motion is a fundamental component. The third visual pathway transmits visual information from early sensory visual processing areas to the STS, with MT+ acting as a critical intermediary. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate functioning of this pathway during processing of naturalistic videos with explicit (real) motion and static images with implied motion cues. These measures were related to face emotion recognition and motion-perception, as measured behaviorally. Participants were 28 individuals with schizophrenia (Sz) and 20 neurotypical controls. Compared to controls, individuals with Sz showed reduced activation of third visual pathway regions (MT+, pSTS) in response to both real- and implied-motion stimuli. Dysfunction of early visual cortex and pulvinar were also associated with aberrant real-motion processing. Implied-motion stimuli additionally engaged a wide network of brain areas including parietal, motor and frontal nodes of the human mirror neuron system. The findings support concepts of MT+ as a mediator between visual sensory areas and higher-order brain and argue for greater focus on MT+ contributions to social-cognitive processing, in addition to its well-documented role in visual motion processing.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Schizophrenia", "Visual Pathways", "Temporal Lobe", "Brain", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Brain Mapping", "Motion Perception", "Photic Stimulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ant\u00edgona", "Last Name": "Mart\u00ednez", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, 140 Old Orangeburg Road, Orangeburg, NY 10962, USA.

Given that prior work examining reading deficits in individuals with Sz has primarily focused on single-line and single-word reading tasks, eye movements that are unique to passage reading, such as return-sweep saccades, have not yet been examined in Sz. Return-sweep saccades are large eye movements that are made when readers move from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line during natural passage reading. Examining return-sweeps provides an opportunity to examine lower-level, oculomotor deficits during reading under circumstances when upcoming higher-level, lexical information is not available for visual processing because visual acuity constraints do not permit detailed lexical processing of line-initial words when return-sweeps are programmed. To examine the source of reading deficits in Sz, we analysed an existing data set in which participants read multi-line passages with manipulations to line spacing. Readers with Sz made significantly more return-sweep targeting errors followed by corrective saccades compared with healthy controls. Both groups showed similar effects of line spacing on return-sweep targeting accuracy, suggesting similar sensitivities to visual crowding during reading. Furthermore, the patterns of fixation durations in readers with Sz corroborate prior work indicating reduced parafoveal processing of upcoming words.

This ability is highly dependent upon intact processing within both cortical and subcortical components of the early visual pathways. Social cognitive deficits, including face emotion recognition (FER) deficits, are characteristic of several neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (Sz) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here, we investigated potential visual sensory contributions to FER deficits in Sz (n = 28, 8/20 female/male; age 21-54 years) and adult ASD (n = 20, 4/16 female/male; age 19-43 years) participants compared to neurotypical (n = 30, 8/22 female/male; age 19-54 years) controls using task-based fMRI during an implicit static/dynamic FER task. Compared to neurotypical controls, both Sz (d = 1.97) and ASD (d = 1.13) participants had significantly lower FER scores which interrelated with diminished activation of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). In Sz, STS deficits were predicted by reduced activation of early visual regions (d = 0.85, p = 0.002) and of the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus (d = 0.44, p = 0.042), along with impaired cortico-pulvinar interaction.

CVN058, a brain-penetrant, potent and selective 5-HT3R antagonist, shows efficacy in rodent models of cognition and was well-tolerated in Phase-1 studies. We evaluated the target engagement of CVN058 using mismatch negativity (MMN) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Subjects were stable outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with antipsychotics. Subjects were not permitted to use other 5-HT3R modulators or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Each subject received a high (150\u2009mg) and low (15\u2009mg or 75\u2009mg) oral dose of CVN058 and placebo in a randomized order across 3 single-day treatment visits separated by at least 1 week. The primary pre-registered outcome was amplitude of duration MMN. Amplitude of other MMN deviants (frequency, intensity, frequency modulation, and location), P50, P300 and auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were exploratory endpoints. 19 of 22 randomized subjects (86.4%) completed the study.

Low GABA in a subset of these patients is consistent with our hypothesized model of low GABA leading to glutamate disinhibition in MDD.

Twenty-seven schizophrenia participants and 21 healthy control subjects watched a clip of the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly while high resolution multiband functional MRI images were collected.

Activation deficits were greatest in middle TPJ (TPJm) and correlated significantly with impaired TASIT performance across groups. Follow-up analyses of the TPJ-pSTS revealed decreased synchronization with other cortical areas, decreased correlation with the motion content of the movie, and decreased correlation with the saccades made during the movie. The functional impairment of the TPJm, a hub area in the middle of the TPJ-pSTS, predicts deficits in social inference in schizophrenia participants by disrupting the integration of visual motion processing into the TPJ.

Here, we utilize a combined eye-tracking, neurophysiological, and computational modeling approach to analyze underlying visual and oculomotor processes. Subjects included 26 Sz patients (SzP) and 26 healthy controls. Eye-tracking and electroencephalography data were acquired continuously during the reading of passages from the Gray Oral Reading Tests reading battery, permitting between-group evaluation of both oculomotor activity and fixation-related potentials (FRP). Schizophrenia patients showed a marked increase in time required per word (d = 1.3, P < .0001), reflecting both a moderate increase in fixation duration (d = .7, P = .026) and a large increase in the total saccade number (d = 1.6, P < .0001). Simulation models that incorporated alterations in both lower-level visual and oculomotor function as well as higher-level lexical processing performed better than models that assumed either deficit-type alone. In neurophysiological analyses, amplitude of the fixation-related P1 potential (P1f) was significantly reduced in SzP (d = .66, P = .013), reflecting reduced phase reset of ongoing theta-alpha band activity (d = .74, P = .019). In turn, P1f deficits significantly predicted increased saccade number both across groups (P = .017) and within SzP alone (P = .042). Computational and neurophysiological methods provide increasingly important approaches for investigating sensory contributions to impaired cognition during naturalistic processing in Sz. Here, we demonstrate deficits in reading rate that reflect both sensory/oculomotor- and semantic-level impairments and that manifest, respectively, as alterations in saccade number and fixation duration.

While we find that behavioral performance and activation/deactivation of the RSVP task are largely similar between groups, SzP exhibited decreased functional connectivity within late visual components and between prefrontal and other components. We also find that performance correlates with the deactivation of the ventral attention network in SzP only. This relationship is mediated by the functional connectivity of critical components of the attentional control system. In summary, our results suggest that the attentional control system is potentially used to compensate for visual cortex deficits. Furthermore, prefrontal deficits in SzP may interfere with this compensatory use of the attentional control system.

We investigated this issue by measuring contrast thresholds for orientation detection, orientation discriminability, and orientation-tilt-aftereffect curves in schizophrenia subjects and matched controls. These measures depend on the amplitude and width of underlying orientation tuning curves, which, in turn, depend on excitatory and inhibitory interactions.

Here, we pooled TMT performances across 310 SZ individuals and 219 healthy controls (HC), along with clinical, cognitive, and resting-state functional-connectivity MRI (rsFC-MRI) measures. In addition, TMT was measured in a group of 24 patients at symptomatic clinical high risk (CHR) for SZ and 24 age-matched HC (age range 7-27 years).

As opposed to SZ, CHR patients showed intact EAP function. In HC age-matched to CHR, EAP ability was shown to increase across the age range of vulnerability preceding SZ onset.

Therefore, in the present study, we examined, in vivo, in the striatum of awake, freely moving rats the effect of cysteamine on the basal and amphetamine-induced release of dopamine, given also the fact that amphetamine-induced psychosis is a widely accepted animal model of schizophrenia. In vivo transversal microdialysis was used to collect the striatal dialysate samples and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), coupled with electrochemical detection- to assess the samples dopamine levels. Amphetamine,1\u03bcM, administered locally through the microdialysis fiber, running through both the left and right striatum, produced a significant increase in the extracellular level of dopamine. The increase lasted over an hour when dopamine gradually returned to its basal levels.

However, at the same concentration and administered together with amphetamine, 1\u03bcM, it completely inhibited the stimulant effect of amphetamine.

To date, the contributions of basic auditory deficits to higher-order cognitive impairments, such as source-monitoring, and to clinical symptoms have yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the deficits and relationships between basic auditory functions, source-monitoring performances, and clinical symptom severity in SZ. Auditory processing of 4 psychoacoustic features (pitch, intensity, amplitude, length) and 2 types of source-monitoring (internal and reality monitoring) performances were assessed in 29 SZ and 29 healthy controls. Clinical symptoms were evaluated in patients with the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale.

The interaction of NFL with GluN1 was assessed by means of molecular, pharmacological, electrophysiological, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and schizophrenia-associated behavior analyses. NFL deficits cause an NMDAR hypofunction phenotype including abnormal hippocampal function, as seen in schizophrenia. NFL-/- deletion in mice reduces dendritic spines and GluN1 protein levels, elevates ubiquitin-dependent turnover of GluN1 and hippocampal glutamate measured by MRS, and depresses hippocampal long-term potentiation. NMDAR-related behaviors are also impaired, including pup retrieval, spatial and social memory, prepulse inhibition, night-time activity, and response to NMDAR antagonist, whereas motor deficits are minimal. Importantly, partially lowering NFL in NFL+/- mice to levels seen regionally in schizophrenia, induced similar but milder NMDAR-related synaptic and behavioral deficits.

Sz patients were significantly less affected by the global background motion, and reported trajectories that were more veridically accurate than those of controls. In order to study the mechanism of this effect, we performed a second experiment where we applied transcranial electrical stimulation over area MT+ to selectively modify global motion processing of optic flow displays in healthy participants. Cathodal and high frequency random noise stimulation had opposite effects on trajectory perception in optic flow. The brain stimulation over a control site and in a control task revealed that the effect of stimulation was specific for global motion processing in area MT+.

In psychosis, the very structure of language can be disturbed, including semantic coherence (e.g., derailment and tangentiality) and syntactic complexity (e.g., concreteness). Subtle disturbances in language are evident in schizophrenia even prior to first psychosis onset, during prodromal stages. Using computer-based natural language processing analyses, we previously showed that, among English-speaking clinical (e.g., ultra) high-risk youths, baseline reduction in semantic coherence (the flow of meaning in speech) and in syntactic complexity could predict subsequent psychosis onset with high accuracy. Herein, we aimed to cross-validate these automated linguistic analytic methods in a second larger risk cohort, also English-speaking, and to discriminate speech in psychosis from normal speech. We identified an automated machine-learning speech classifier - comprising decreased semantic coherence, greater variance in that coherence, and reduced usage of possessive pronouns - that had an 83% accuracy in predicting psychosis onset (intra-protocol), a cross-validated accuracy of 79% of psychosis onset prediction in the original risk cohort (cross-protocol), and a 72% accuracy in discriminating the speech of recent-onset psychosis patients from that of healthy individuals. The classifier was highly correlated with previously identified manual linguistic predictors. Our findings support the utility and validity of automated natural language processing methods to characterize disturbances in semantics and syntax across stages of psychotic disorder. The next steps will be to apply these methods in larger risk cohorts to further test reproducibility, also in languages other than English, and identify sources of variability. This technology has the potential to improve prediction of psychosis outcome among at-risk youths and identify linguistic targets for remediation and preventive intervention.

To understand the potential time course of development of deficits in schizophrenia, we obtained MMN to unattended duration, intensity and frequency deviants, and visual P1 to attended LSF stimuli, in 43 healthy individuals ages 6 to 25years (mean 17), and compared results to data from 30 adult schizophrenia patients (mean age 38). We analyzed \"time-domain\" measures of amplitude and latency, and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP, \"time-frequency\") to evaluate underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Duration and intensity MMN amplitudes increased from childhood to late adolescence, while frequency MMN reached maximum amplitude during early development. As reported previously, in ERSP analyses, MMN activity corresponded primarily to theta-band (4-7Hz) activity, while responses to standards occurred primarily in alpha (8-12Hz) across age groups. Both deviant-induced theta and standard-induced alpha activity declined significantly with age for all deviant types. Likewise, visual P1 also showed an amplitude decline over development, reflecting a reduction in both evoked power and ITC. While MMN \"difference\" waveform ERP data suggest failure of maturation in schizophrenia, MMN ERSP analyses instead support a neurodegenerative process, as these isolate responses to deviants and standards, showing large low-frequency evoked power for both in children. Neurodegenerative processes are also supported by large visual P1 amplitudes and large low-frequency evoked power in children, in contrast with adult schizophrenia.

PCP significantly reduced rodent duration MMN (p<0.001) and \u03b8-band (p<0.01) response. PCP effects were prevented by concurrent glycine treatment (p<0.01 vs PCP alone).

It is still unclear how sensory processing deficits compare to and contribute to higher order cognitive dysfunction, which can be investigated with later attention-dependent auditory event-related potential (ERP) components such as a subcomponent of P300, P3b. In this meta-analysis, we compared MMN deficits in SCZ using simple deviants to more complex deviants. We also pooled studies that measured MMN and P3b in the same study sample and examined the relationship between MMN and P3b deficits within study samples. Our analysis reveals that, to date, studies using simple deviants demonstrate larger deficits than those using complex deviants, with effect sizes in the range of moderate to large. The difference in effect sizes between deviant types was reduced significantly when accounting for magnitude of MMN measured in healthy controls. P3b deficits, while large, were only modestly greater than MMN deficits (d=0.21).

MMN generators are localized primarily to primary and secondary auditory regions, and are known to reflect activity mediated by cortical N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR). Nevertheless, mechanisms underlying MMN generation at the local circuit level remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes recent advances in circuit-level conceptualization of MMN based upon neuro-oscillatory findings. In the neuro-oscillatory (aka event-related spectral perturbation, ERSP) approach, responses to sensory stimuli are decomposed into underlying frequency bands prior to analysis. MMN reflects activity primarily in theta (4-7Hz) frequency band, which is thought to depend primarily upon interplay between cortical pyramidal neurons and somatostatin (SST)-type local circuit GABAergic interneurons. Schizophrenia-related deficits in theta generation are also observed not only in MMN, but also in other auditory and visual contexts. At the local circuit level, SST interneurons are known to maintain tonic inhibition over cortical pyramidal interneurons. SST interneurons, in turn, are inhibited by a class of interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). In rodents, SST interneurons have been shown to respond differentially to deviant vs. standard stimuli, and inhibition of SST interneurons has been found to selectively inhibit deviance-related activity in rodent visual cortex. Here we propose that deficits in theta frequency generation, as exemplified by MMN, may contribute significantly to cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia, and may be tied to impaired interplay between cortical pyramidal neurons and local circuit SST-type GABAergic interneurons.", "Keywords": ["Auditory", "Cortex", "Event-related potentials", "Glutamate", "Mismatch negativity"], "MeSH terms": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Contingent Negative Variation", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Humans", "Interneurons", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Schizophrenia", "Theta Rhythm"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Javitt", "Affiliation": "Division of Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, United States; Schizophrenia Research Division, Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, Orangeburg, NY 10962, United States.

Eighty-seven non-depressed individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (including 51 inpatients) and 58 control subjects completed the revised UCLA Loneliness scale. Social cognition was assessed with a self-report questionnaire and a performance-based task. Social trait perception was assessed with a facial task. Comorbid medical diagnoses were available for all inpatients. Patients reported greater loneliness levels than controls, while in- and out-patients did not significantly differ. In patients, loneliness was associated with self-report measures of social cognition. Patients' loneliness scores predicted a diagnosis of drug abuse/dependence, number of drugs used, hypertension and abnormal hemoglobin A1c levels. Patients experienced higher levels of loneliness than controls, independently of their objective social isolation. Loneliness did not rely on the same psychological processes in patients than in controls. Loneliness in schizophrenia is a symptom that deserves more scrutiny, particularly as it relates to the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this population.", "Keywords": ["Comorbidity", "Loneliness", "Metabolic syndrome", "Social cognition"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Humans", "Loneliness", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fabien", "Last Name": "Tr\u00e9meau", "Affiliation": "Nathan S.

Accordingly, clinical studies have been targeting the modulatory site of the NMDA receptor, based on the decreased function of NMDA receptor, to see whether increasing NMDA function can potentially help treat the negative and cognitive deficits seen in the disease. Glycine and D-serine are endogenous ligands to the NMDA modulatory site, but since high doses are needed to affect brain levels, related compounds are being developed, for example glycine transport (GlyT) inhibitors to potentially elevate brain glycine or targeting enzymes, such as D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) to slow the breakdown and increase the brain level of D-serine. In the present study we further evaluated the effect of DAAO inhibitors 5-chloro-benzo[d]isoxazol-3-ol (CBIO) and sodium benzoate (NaB) in a phencyclidine (PCP) rodent mouse model to see if the inhibitors affect PCP-induced locomotor activity, alter brain D-serine level, and thereby potentially enhance D-serine responses. D-Serine dose-dependently reduced the PCP-induced locomotor activity at doses above 1000 mg/kg. Acute CBIO (30 mg/kg) did not affect PCP-induced locomotor activity, but appeared to reduce locomotor activity when given with D-serine (600 mg/kg); a dose that by itself did not have an effect. However, the effect was also present when the vehicle (Trappsol(\u00ae)) was tested with D-serine, suggesting that the reduction in locomotor activity was not related to DAAO inhibition, but possibly reflected enhanced bioavailability of D-serine across the blood brain barrier related to the vehicle. With this acute dose of CBIO, D-serine level in brain and plasma were not increased. Another weaker DAAO inhibitor NaB (400 mg/kg), and NaB plus D-serine also significantly reduced PCP-induced locomotor activity, but without affecting plasma or brain D-serine level, arguing against a DAAO-mediated effect. However, NaB reduced plasma L-serine and based on reports that NaB also elevates various plasma metabolites, for example aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), a potential effect via the System A amino acid carrier may be involved in the regulation of synaptic glycine level to modulate NMDAR function needs to be investigated. Acute ascorbic acid (300 mg/kg) also inhibited PCP-induced locomotor activity, which was further attenuated in the presence of D-serine (600 mg/kg). Ascorbic acid may have an action at the dopamine membrane carrier and/or altering redox mechanisms that modulate NMDARs, but this needs to be further investigated. The findings support an effect of D-serine on PCP-induced hyperactivity. They also offer suggestions on an interaction of NaB via an unknown mechanism, other than DAAO inhibition, perhaps through metabolomic changes, and find unexpected synergy between D-serine and ascorbic acid that supports combined NMDA glycine- and redox-site intervention.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the processing of rhythmic sounds is more efficient than the processing of irregularly timed sounds. To do this, we simultaneously measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electro-encephalograms (EEG) while participants detected oddball target sounds in alternating blocks of rhythmic (e.g., with equal inter-stimulus intervals) or random (e.g., with randomly varied inter-stimulus intervals) tone sequences. Behaviorally, participants detected target sounds faster and more accurately when embedded in rhythmic streams. The fMRI response in the auditory cortex was stronger during random compared to random tone sequence processing.

AER deficits are tied behaviorally to impaired ability to interpret tonal (\"prosodic\") features of speech that normally convey emotion, such as modulations in base pitch (F0M) and pitch variability (F0SD). These modulations can be recreated using synthetic frequency modulated (FM) tones that mimic the prosodic contours of specific emotional stimuli. The present study investigates neural mechanisms underlying impaired AER using a combined event-related potential/resting-state functional connectivity (rsfMRI) approach in 84 schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patients and 66 healthy comparison subjects. Mismatch negativity (MMN) to FM tones was assessed in 43 patients/36 controls. rsfMRI between auditory cortex and medial temporal (insula) regions was assessed in 55 patients/51 controls. The relationship between AER, MMN to FM tones, and rsfMRI was assessed in the subset who performed all assessments (14 patients, 21 controls). As predicted, patients showed robust reductions in MMN across FM stimulus type (p = 0.005), particularly to modulations in F0M, along with impairments in AER and FM tone discrimination.

Eighty-one individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 62 control subjects completed a computer task with 30 well-characterized neutral faces. They rated each face on 10 trait judgments: attractive, mean, trustworthy, intelligent, dominant, fun, sociable, aggressive, emotionally stable and weird. The degree to which trait ratings were predicted by objectively-measured subtle emotion expressions served as a measure of implicit emotion processing. Explicit emotion recognition was also examined. Trait ratings were significantly predicted by subtle facial emotional expressions in controls and patients. However, impairment in the implicit emotion perception of fear, happiness, anger and surprise was found in patients. Moreover, these deficits were associated with poorer everyday problem-solving skills and were relatively independent of explicit emotion recognition. Implicit emotion processing is impaired in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

The present study used time-frequency based analyses to investigate the role of impaired alpha ERD in visual processing deficits in schizophrenia (Sz). Subjects viewed sinusoidal gratings of high (HSF) and low (LSF) spatial frequency (SF) designed to test functioning of the parvo- vs. magnocellular pathways, respectively. Patients with Sz and healthy controls paid attention selectively to either the LSF or HSF gratings which were presented in random order. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded to all stimuli. As in our previous study, it was found that Sz patients were selectively impaired at detecting LSF target stimuli and that ERP amplitudes to LSF stimuli were diminished, both for the early sensory-evoked components and for the attend minus unattend difference component (the Selection Negativity), which is generally regarded as a specific index of feature-selective attention. In the time-frequency domain, the differential ERP deficits to LSF stimuli were echoed in a virtually absent theta-band phase locked response to both unattended and attended LSF stimuli (along with relatively intact theta-band activity for HSF stimuli). In contrast to the theta-band evoked responses which were tightly stimulus locked, stimulus-induced desynchronizations of ongoing alpha activity were not tightly stimulus locked and were apparent only in induced power analyses. Sz patients were significantly impaired in the attention-related modulation of ongoing alpha activity for both HSF and LSF stimuli. These deficits correlated with patients' behavioral deficits in visual information processing as well as with visually based neurocognitive deficits.

Within this context, studies of visual cortical function may be particularly important both because visual processing deficits directly affect social and occupational function and because these systems are well characterized at the basic science level, permitting informative translational research. This article summarizes a conference on visual processing dysfunction in schizophrenia held in Lausanne, Switzerland from June 30 to July 1, 2014 and introduces this special issue. Speakers focused on multiple aspects of visual dysfunction in schizophrenia using behavioral, neurophysiological and fMRI-based approaches. Four main themes emerged. First was a focus on response disturbances within the early visual system, using paradigms such as sensory EEG and MEG-based responses. Second, behavioral deficits were noted in processing related to local interaction within visual regions, using paradigms such as Vernier acuity or contour integration. These deficits provided potential model systems to understand impaired connectivity within the brain in schizophrenia more generally. Third, several visual measures were found to correlate highly with symptoms and/or neurocognitive processing. Deficits in contour integration, for example, correlated highly with conceptual disorganization, whereas perceptual instability correlated with delusion formation. These findings highlight links between perceptual-level disturbance and clinical manifestation. Finally, the potential involvement of specific neurotransmitter receptors, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors and alpha7 nicotinic receptors were discussed as potential etiological mechanisms.

Moreover, neurophysiological responses can be assessed even in untrained animals and are therefore particularly amenable to translational, cross-species investigation. To date, several sensory-level ERP measures, including auditory mismatch negativity and N1, and visual P1 and steady-state responses, have been validated in both human clinical investigations and animal models.

We studied neuropsychiatric and neurochemical effects of the NMDAR-glycine site obligatory co-agonist d-serine (DSR) in healthy subjects using a randomized, controlled crossover challenge design including a baseline assessment day and two DSR/placebo administration days. Thirty-five subjects aged 23-29 years participated in the study and received a 2.1 g orally administered DSR dose. The main outcome measures were the changes in scores of mood-related Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP), and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). DSR acute administration: (1) was well tolerated and resulted at 2 h in \u2265 200 times increase in DSR serum levels; (2) elicited reduced VAS-measured depression and anxiety feelings; (3) improved attention and vigilance as measured by CPT-IP D-prime score; (4) preferentially improved performance in RAVLT list 7 reflecting ability to retain information over interference; (5) had significant but nonspecific effects on Category Fluency and Benton Visual Retention tests; and (6) did not affect glycine and glutamate serum levels. These data indicate that in healthy subjects, DSR reduces subjective feelings of sadness and anxiety and has procognitive effects that are overall opposed to the known effects of NMDAR antagonists.

The goal of this paper is to characterize the properties of prosody and pitch perception tasks and to investigate whether they can be shortened. The pitch perception test evaluated is a tone-matching task developed by Javitt and colleagues (J-TMT). The prosody test evaluated is the auditory emotion recognition task developed by Juslin and Laukka (JL-AER). The sample includes 124 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 131 healthy controls (HC). Properties, including facility and discrimination, of each item were assessed. Effects of item characteristics (e.g., emotion) were also evaluated. Shortened versions of the tests are proposed based on facility, discrimination, and/or ability of item characteristics to discriminate between patients and controls. Test-retest reliability is high for patients and controls for both the original and short forms of the J-TMT and JL-AER. Thus, the original as well as short forms of the J-TMT and JL-AER are suggested for inclusion in clinical trials of social cognitive and perceptual treatments. The development of short forms further increases the utility of these auditory tasks in clinical trials and clinical practice.

While much debate continues regarding whether newer secondgeneration (ie, \"atypical\") antipsychotics are superior to first-generation (ie, \"typical\") agents in the treatment of schizophrenia, it remains paramount that clinicians consider both the unique adverse effect profile of each medication and the clinical characteristics of individual patients that may influence the risk for specific adverse effects or treatment nonadherence. Perhaps the most important component of critical care for patients with schizophrenia is the monitoring for and management of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as they are key contributors to premature mortality in schizophrenia. Despite advances in nonpharmacologic treatments and ongoing drug development, antipsychotic medications remain the standard of care for the core symptoms of schizophrenia.

AX-CPT is commonly used to study cognition in schizophrenia, and patients have characteristic pattern of behavioral and ERP response. In AX-CPT subjects respond when a flashed cue \"A\" is followed by a target \"X,\" ignoring other letter combinations. Patients show reduced hit rate to \"go\" trials, and increased false alarms to sequences that require inhibition of a prepotent response. EEG recordings show reduced sensory (P1/N1), as well as later cognitive components (N2, P3, CNV). Behavioral deficits correlate most strongly with sensory dysfunction. Oscillatory analyses provide critical information regarding sensory/cognitive processing over and above standard ERP analyses. Recent analyses of induced oscillatory activity in single trials during AX-CPT in healthy volunteers showed characteristic response patterns in theta, alpha, and beta frequencies tied to specific sensory and cognitive processes. Alpha and beta modulated during the trials and beta modulation over the frontal cortex correlated with reaction time. In this study, EEG data was obtained from 18 schizophrenia patients and 13 controls during AX-CPT performance, and single trial decomposition of the signal yielded power in the target wavelengths. Significant task-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) was observed in both alpha and beta frequency bands over parieto-occipital cortex related to sensory encoding of the cue. This modulation was reduced in patients for beta, but not for alpha. In addition, significant beta ERD was observed over motor cortex, related to motor preparation for the response, and was also reduced in patients. These findings demonstrate impaired dynamic modulation of beta frequency rhythms in schizophrenia, and suggest that failures of oscillatory activity may underlie impaired sensory information processing in schizophrenia that in turn contributes to cognitive deficits.", "Keywords": ["AX-CPT", "alpha", "beta", "cognitive", "motor preparation", "oscillations", "schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elisa C", "Last Name": "Dias", "Affiliation": "Center for Schizophrenia Research, Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Bickel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Epstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pejman", "Last Name": "Sehatpour", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Javitt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23864667", "Title": "Efference copy failure during smooth pursuit eye movements in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Abnormal smooth pursuit eye movements in patients with schizophrenia are often considered a consequence of impaired motion perception. Here we used a novel motion prediction task to assess the effects of abnormal pursuit on perception in human patients. Schizophrenia patients (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 16) judged whether a briefly presented moving target (\"ball\") would hit/miss a stationary vertical line segment (\"goal\"). To relate prediction performance and pursuit directly, we manipulated eye movements: in half of the trials, observers smoothly tracked the ball; in the other half, they fixated on the goal. Strict quality criteria ensured that pursuit was initiated and that fixation was maintained. Controls were significantly better in trajectory prediction during pursuit than during fixation, their performance increased with presentation duration, and their pursuit gain and perceptual judgments were correlated. Such perceptual benefits during pursuit may be due to the use of extraretinal motion information estimated from an efference copy signal. With an overall lower performance in pursuit and perception, patients showed no such pursuit advantage and no correlation between pursuit gain and perception. Although patients' pursuit showed normal improvement with longer duration, their prediction performance failed to benefit from duration increases.

Since a hallmark of schizophrenia is impaired information selection, we tested whether this deficiency stems from dysfunctional predictive sensing by measuring the degree to which neuronal activity predicts relevant events. In healthy subjects, we established that these mechanisms are engaged in an effort-dependent manner and that, based on a correspondence between human scalp and intracranial nonhuman primate recordings, their main role is a predictive suppression of excitability in task-irrelevant regions. In contrast, schizophrenia patients displayed a reduced alignment of neuronal activity to attended stimuli, which correlated with their behavioral performance deficits and clinical symptoms.

Studies indicate that N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal integrity, and choline, a marker of cell membrane turnover and white matter integrity, may be altered in schizophrenia. Davunetide is a neurotrophic peptide that can enhance cognitive function in animal models of neurodegeneration. Davunetide has recently demonstrated modest functional improvement in a study of people with schizophrenia. In a subset of these subjects, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was conducted to explore the effects of davunetide on change in NAA/creatine (NAA/Cr) and choline/creatine (choline/Cr) over 12 weeks of treatment. Of 63 outpatients with schizophrenia who received randomized davunetide (5 and 30\u2009mg/day) or placebo in the parent clinical trial, 18 successfully completed (1)H-MRS in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at baseline and at 12 weeks. Cognition was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). NAA/Cr was unchanged for combined high- and low-dose davunetide groups (N=11). NAA/Cr in the high-dose davunetide group (N=8) suggested a trend increase of 8.0% (P=0.072) over placebo (N=7). Choline/Cr for combined high- and low-dose davunetide groups suggested a 6.4% increase (P=0.069), while the high-dose group showed a 7.9% increase (P=0.040) over placebo. Baseline NAA/Cr correlated with the composite MCCB score (R=0.52, P=0.033), as did individual cognitive domains of attention/vigilance, verbal learning, and social cognition; however, neither metabolite correlated with functional capacity. In this exploratory study, 12 weeks of adjunctive davunetide appeared to produce modest increases in NAA/Cr and choline/Cr in DLPFC in people with schizophrenia. This is consistent with a potential neuroprotective mechanism for davunetide. The data also support use of MRS as a useful biomarker of baseline cognitive function in schizophrenia.
