The current standard of care is a quasi-closed loop integrating automated insulin delivery with a continuous glucose monitoring sensor.

In addition, immunomodulatory treatments to delay the onset of type\u20091 diabetes in high-risk (stage\u20092) individuals have gained regulatory approval. We have pioneered a cell conversion approach to restore insulin production through pharmacological conversion of intestinal epithelial cells into insulin-producing cells. We have advanced this approach along a translational trajectory through the discovery of small molecule forkhead box protein O1 inhibitors. When administered to different rodent models of insulin-deficient diabetes, these inhibitors have resulted in robust glucose-lowering responses and generation of insulin-producing cells in the gut epithelium.

Since then great strides have been made in diabetes research. It has determined where insulin is secreted from, which organs it acts on, how it is transferred into the cell and is delivered to the nucleus, how it orchestrates the expression pattern of the genes, and how it works with each organ to maintain systemic metabolism. Any breakdown in this system leads to diabetes. Thanks to the numerous researchers who have dedicated their lives to cure diabetes, we now know that there are three major organs where insulin acts to maintain glucose/lipid metabolism: the liver, muscles, and fat. The failure of insulin action on these organs, such as insulin resistance, result in hyperglycemia and/or dyslipidemia. The primary trigger of this condition and its association among these tissues still remain to be uncovered. Among the major organs, the liver finely tunes the glucose/lipid metabolism to maintain metabolic flexibility, and plays a crucial role in glucose/lipid abnormality due to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance disrupts this tuning, and selective insulin resistance arises. The glucose metabolism loses its sensitivity to insulin, while the lipid metabolism maintains it. The clarification of its mechanism is warranted to reverse the metabolic abnormalities due to insulin resistance.

To elucidate the mechanism of IR activation by S597, we determine cryo-EM structures of the mouse IR/S597 complex.

Importantly, S597 fully activates IR mutants that disrupt insulin binding or destabilize the insulin-induced compact T-shape, thus eliciting insulin-like signaling. S597 also selectively activates IR signaling among different tissues and triggers IR endocytosis in the liver.

Reversibility of \u03b2 cell failure is a key translational question. Here, we reverse engineered and interrogated pancreatic islet-specific regulatory networks to discover T2D-specific subpopulations characterized by metabolic inflexibility and endocrine progenitor/stem cell features. Single-cell gain- and loss-of-function and glucose-induced Ca2+ flux analyses of top candidate master regulatory (MR) proteins in islet cells validated transcription factor BACH2 and associated epigenetic effectors as key drivers of T2D cell states. BACH2 knockout in T2D islets reversed cellular features of the disease, restoring a nondiabetic phenotype.

It includes defects of insulin production, secretion, and altered numbers of hormone-producing cells. In previous work, we have shown that beta cell failure is mechanistically linked to loss of Foxo1 function. This loss of function likely results from increased Foxo1 protein degradation, due to hyperacetylation of Foxo1 from increased nutrient turnover. To understand the mechanisms of Foxo1-related beta cell failure, we performed genome-wide analyses of its target genes, and identified putative mediators of sub-phenotypes of cellular dysfunction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated a striking pattern of Foxo1 binding to the promoters of a cluster of aldo-ketoreductases on chromosome 13: Akr1c12, Akr1c13, Akr1c19. Of these, Akr1c19 has been reported as a marker of Pdx1-positive endodermal progenitor cells. Here we show that Akr1c19 expression is dramatically decreased in db/db islets. Thus, we investigated whether Akr1c19 is involved in beta cell function. We performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cultured beta cells and generated Akr1c19 knockout mice. We show that Foxo1 and HNF1a cooperatively regulate Akr1c19 expression. Nonetheless, functional characterization of Akr1c19 both using islets and knockout mice did not reveal abnormalities on glucose homeostasis.

The former antedate the latter, but the latter become progressively refractory to treatment and contribute to therapeutic failures. It's unclear whether the two processes share a common pathogenesis and what underlies their progressive nature. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that genes in the lipid/lipoprotein pathway and those in the glucose metabolic pathway are governed by different transcriptional regulatory logics that affect their response to physiologic (fasting/refeeding) as well as pathophysiologic cues (insulin resistance and hyperglycemia). To this end, we obtained genomic and transcriptomic maps of the key insulin-regulated transcription factor, FoxO1, and integrated them with those of CREB, PPAR-\u03b1, and glucocorticoid receptor. We found that glucose metabolic genes are primarily regulated by promoter and intergenic enhancers in a fasting-dependent manner, while lipid genes are regulated through fasting-dependent intron enhancers and fasting-independent enhancerless introns. Glucose genes also showed a remarkable transcriptional resiliency (i.e., the ability to compensate following constitutive FoxO1 ablation through an enrichment of active marks at shared PPAR-\u03b1/FoxO1 regulatory elements). Unexpectedly, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia were associated with a \"spreading\" of FoxO1 binding to enhancers and the emergence of unique target sites. We surmise that this unusual pattern correlates with the progressively intractable nature of hepatic insulin resistance.

Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (IR) are responsible for the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes through different mechanisms. In particular, IR plays a key role in the etiology of atherosclerosis in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. IR - exacerbated by organ-level selectivity - is more important than glycemic control per se in determining cardiovascular outcomes. This may be exacerbated by the fact that IR is organ and pathway specific due to the only selective loss of sensitivity to insulin action of specific pathways/processes. Therefore, it is counterintuitive that the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in (frequently) diabetic renal disease patients should involve their exposure to high daily doses of glucose peritoneally. In view of the controversy about the causal association between glucose load and CVD in PD patients, we discuss the role that selective IR may play in the progression of CVD in diabetic renal end-stage patients.

not been fully elucidated. We have found that adipose tissue macrophages produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) upon feeding, which suppresses hepatic glucose production in cooperation with insulin. Both elevated insulin and gut-microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide in response to feeding are required for IL-10 production via the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Indeed, myeloid-specific knockout of the insulin receptor or bone marrow transplantation of mutant TLR4 marrow cells results in increased expression of gluconeogenic genes and impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, myeloid-specific Akt1 and Akt2 knockout results in similar phenotypes that are rescued by additional knockout of TSC2, an inhibitor of mTOR. In obesity, IL-10 production is impaired due to insulin resistance in macrophages, whereas adenovirus-mediated expression of IL-10 ameliorates postprandial hyperglycemia. Thus, the orchestrated response of the endogenous hormone and gut environment to feeding is a key regulator of postprandial glycemia.", "Keywords": ["Akt", "gut microbiome", "insulin", "interleukin-10", "lipopolysaccharide", "macrophages", "mammalian target of rapamycin", "postprandial gluconeogenesis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Blood Glucose", "Gluconeogenesis", "Hyperglycemia", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Interleukin-10", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Mice, Knockout", "Postprandial Period", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gotaro", "Last Name": "Toda", "Affiliation": "Department of Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists, are potent insulin sensitizers with antiatherogenic properties, but their clinical use is limited by side effects. PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation on two lysine residues (K268 and K293) induces brown remodeling of white adipose tissue and uncouples the adverse effects of TZDs from insulin sensitization. Here we show that PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation confers antiatherogenic properties and retains the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZD while circumventing its detriments. We generated mice homozygous with mice with deacetylation-mimetic PPAR\u03b3 mutations K268R/K293R (2KR) on an LDL-receptor knockout (Ldlr -/- ) background. 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice showed smaller atherosclerotic lesion areas than Ldlr -/- mice, particularly in aortic arches. With rosiglitazone treatment, 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice demonstrated a residual antiatherogenic response and substantial protection against bone loss and fluid retention. The antiatherosclerotic effect of 2KR was attributed to the protection of endothelium, indicated by improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and repressed expression of proatherogenic factors including inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6, and NADPH oxidase 2. Therefore, manipulating PPAR\u03b3 acetylation is a promising therapeutic strategy to control risk of CVD in diabetes treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Atherosclerosis", "Blotting, Western", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutation", "NADPH Oxidase 2", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II", "PPAR gamma", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Receptors, LDL", "Thiazolidinediones"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Longhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Lihong", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Kraakman", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Aaron", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Qianfen", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Maria Alicia", "Last Name": "Carrillo-Sepulveda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY."}, {"First Name": "Alan R", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY lq2123@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32393635", "Title": "The PDK1-FoxO1 signaling in adipocytes controls systemic insulin sensitivity through the 5-lipoxygenase-leukotriene B4 axis.", "Abstract": "Although adipocytes are major targets of insulin, the influence of impaired insulin action in adipocytes on metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. We here show that adipocyte-specific PDK1 (3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1)-deficient (A-PDK1KO) mice manifest impaired metabolic actions of insulin in adipose tissue and reduction of adipose tissue mass. A-PDK1KO mice developed insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis, and this phenotype was suppressed by additional ablation of FoxO1 specifically in adipocytes (A-PDK1/FoxO1KO mice) without an effect on adipose tissue mass. Neither circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin nor inflammatory markers in adipose tissue differed between A-PDK1KO and A-PDK1/FoxO1KO mice. Lipidomics and microarray analyses revealed that leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels in plasma and in adipose tissue as well as the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) in adipose tissue were increased and restored in A-PDK1KO mice and A-PDK1/FoxO1KO mice, respectively. Genetic deletion of the LTB4 receptor BLT1 as well as pharmacological intervention to 5-LO or BLT1 ameliorated insulin resistance in A-PDK1KO mice. Furthermore, insulin was found to inhibit LTB4 production through down-regulation of 5-LO expression via the PDK1-FoxO1 pathway in isolated adipocytes.

Neurons expressing the Glut4 glucose transporter influence peripheral insulin sensitivity. Here, we analyzed the effects of insulin receptor (IR) signaling in hypothalamic Glut4 neurons on glucose sensing as well as leptin and amino acid signaling. By measuring electrophysiological responses to low glucose conditions, we found that the majority of Glut4 neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) were glucose excitatory neurons. GLUT4-Cre-driven insulin receptor knockout mice with a combined ablation of IR in Glut4-expressing tissues showed increased counterregulatory response to either 2-deoxyglucose-induced neuroglycopenia or systemic insulin-induced hypoglycemia.

Here we used DNA affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to probe the network of hormone-regulated TFs by using phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) in liver and primary hepatocytes as model systems. The repertoire of insulin-regulated TFs is unexpectedly broad and diverse. Whereas in liver the two test promoters are regulated by largely overlapping sets of TFs, in primary hepatocytes Pck1 and G6pc regulation diverges. Insulin treatment preferentially results in increased occupancy by the two promoters, consistent with a model in which the hormone's primary role is to recruit corepressors rather than to clear activators. Nine insulin-responsive TFs are present in both models, but only FoxK1, FoxA2, ZFP91, and ZHX3 require an intact Pck1p insulin response sequence for binding.

Insulin and IGF-1 enhance muscle protein synthesis through their receptors, but the relative roles of each in muscle proteostasis have not been fully elucidated. Using mice with muscle-specific deletion of the insulin receptor (M-IR-/- mice), the IGF-1 receptor (M-IGF1R-/- mice), or both (MIGIRKO mice), we assessed the relative contributions of IR and IGF1R signaling to muscle proteostasis. In differentiated muscle, IR expression predominated over IGF1R expression, and correspondingly, M-IR-/- mice displayed a moderate reduction in muscle mass whereas M-IGF1R-/- mice did not. However, these receptors serve complementary roles, such that double-knockout MIGIRKO mice displayed a marked reduction in muscle mass that was linked to increases in proteasomal and autophagy-lysosomal degradation, accompanied by a high-protein-turnover state. Combined muscle-specific deletion of FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 in MIGIRKO mice reversed increased autophagy and completely rescued muscle mass without changing proteasomal activity. These data indicate that signaling via IR is more important than IGF1R in controlling proteostasis in differentiated muscle. Nonetheless, the overlap of IR and IGF1R signaling is critical to the regulation of muscle protein turnover, and this regulation depends on suppression of FoxO-regulated, autophagy-mediated protein degradation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Cell Differentiation", "Female", "Forkhead Box Protein O1", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Insulin", "Lysosomes", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Atrophy", "Myoblasts", "Oxygen", "Phosphorylation", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex", "Receptor, IGF Type 1", "Receptor, Insulin", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian T", "Last Name": "O'Neill", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin Y", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Klaus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samir", "Last Name": "Softic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan T", "Last Name": "Krumpoch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joachim", "Last Name": "Fentz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristin I", "Last Name": "Stanford", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew M", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Weikang", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andre", "Last Name": "Kleinridders", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Renata O", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Hirshman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "E Dale", "Last Name": "Abel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laurie J", "Last Name": "Goodyear", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "K Sreekumaran", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C Ronald", "Last Name": "Kahn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2016Sep01"}, {"PMID": "27207531", "Title": "Disruption of Adipose Rab10-Dependent Insulin Signaling Causes Hepatic Insulin Resistance.", "Abstract": "Insulin controls glucose uptake into adipose and muscle cells by regulating the amount of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane. The effect of insulin is to promote the translocation of intracellular GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The small Rab GTPase, Rab10, is required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Here we demonstrate that both insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane are reduced by about half in adipocytes from adipose-specific Rab10 knockout (KO) mice. These data demonstrate that the full effect of insulin on adipose glucose uptake is the integrated effect of Rab10-dependent and Rab10-independent pathways, establishing a divergence in insulin signal transduction to the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. In adipose-specific Rab10 KO female mice, the partial inhibition of stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes induces insulin resistance independent of diet challenge. During euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, there is no suppression of hepatic glucose production despite normal insulin suppression of plasma free fatty acids. The impact of incomplete disruption of stimulated adipocyte GLUT4 translocation on whole-body glucose homeostasis is driven by a near complete failure of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production rather than a significant inhibition in muscle glucose uptake.

Unlike insulin resistance, \u03b2 cell dysfunction remains difficult to predict and monitor, because of the inaccessibility of the endocrine pancreas, the integrated relationship with insulin sensitivity, and the paracrine effects of incretins. The goal of our study was to survey the plasma response to a metabolic challenge in order to identify factors predictive of \u03b2 cell dysfunction. To this end, we combined (i) the power of unbiased iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification) mass spectrometry with (ii) direct sampling of the portal vein following an intravenous glucose/arginine challenge (IVGATT) in (iii) mice with a genetic \u03b2 cell defect. By so doing, we excluded the effects of peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as those of incretins on \u03b2 cells, and focused on the first phase of insulin secretion to capture the early pathophysiology of \u03b2 cell dysfunction. We compared plasma protein profiles with ex vivo islet secretome and transcriptome analyses. We detected changes to 418 plasma proteins in vivo, and detected changes to 262 proteins ex vivo The impairment of insulin secretion was associated with greater overall changes in the plasma response to IVGATT, possibly reflecting metabolic instability. Reduced levels of proteins regulating redox state and neuronal stress markers, as well as increased levels of coagulation factors, antedated the loss of insulin secretion in diabetic mice.

We present a case of a dialysis patient who presented with hypoglycemia and was found to have accidental sulfonylurea ingestion. This is a 73-year-old man with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, without history of diabetes, who presented with hypoglycemia. Past medical history includes multiple myeloma, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. At initial presentation, his blood glucose was 47\u2009mg/dL, with concomitant elevations in the following: C-peptide 30.5 (nl: 0.8-3.5\u2009ng/mL), insulin 76 (nl: 3-19\u2009\u03bcIU/mL), and proinsulin 83.3 (nl: \u22648.0\u2009pmol/L). During the 72-hour fast, which he completed without hypoglycemia, insulin declined to be within normal limits (to 12\u2009\u03bcIU/mL); proinsulin (to 12.1\u2009pmol/L) and C-peptide (to 7.2\u2009ng/mL) levels decreased but remained elevated. The sulfonylurea screen ultimately returned positive for glipizide, clinching the diagnosis. This is the first reported case which characterizes the chronic elevation of proinsulin in a patient with ESRD, as well as its dramatic increase after a presumed solitary exposure to sulfonylurea.

The delineation of two branched pathways of insulin receptor (InsR) signaling to glucose versus triglyceride production, one through FoxO and the other through SREBP-1c, provides a mechanism to account for this pathophysiological abnormality. We tested the complementary hypothesis that selective IR arises due to different intrinsic sensitivities of glucose production versus de novo lipogenesis to insulin as a result of cell-autonomous down-regulation of InsR number in response to chronic hyperinsulinemia. We demonstrate in mouse primary hepatocytes that chronic hyperinsulinemia abrogates insulin's inhibition of glucose production, but not its stimulation of de novo lipogenesis. Using a competitive inhibitor of InsR, we show that there is a 4-fold difference between levels of InsR inhibition required to cause resistance of glucose production versus lipogenesis to the actions of insulin.

These abnormalities may partly arise from altered developmental programming of \u03b2-cells. Foxo1 is important to maintain adult \u03b2-cells, but little is known about its role in pancreatic progenitor cells as determinants of future \u03b2-cell function. We addressed this question by generating an allelic series of somatic Foxo1 knockouts at different stages of pancreatic development in mice. Surprisingly, ablation of Foxo1 in pancreatic progenitors resulted in delayed appearance of Neurogenin3(+) progenitors and their persistence into adulthood as a self-replicating pool, causing a fourfold increase of \u03b2-cell mass. Similarly, Foxo1 ablation in endocrine progenitors increased their numbers, extended their survival, and expanded \u03b2-cell mass. In contrast, ablation of Foxo1 in terminally differentiated \u03b2-cells did not increase \u03b2-cell mass nor did it affect Neurogenin3 expression. Despite the increased \u03b2-cell mass, islets from mice lacking Foxo1 in pancreatic or endocrine progenitors responded poorly to glucose, resulting in glucose intolerance. We conclude that Foxo1 integrates cues that determine developmental timing, pool size, and functional features of endocrine progenitor cells, resulting in a legacy effect on adult \u03b2-cell mass and function.

In type 2 diabetes, levels of the former are low and the latter are exaggerated, posing a pathophysiologic and therapeutic conundrum. A branching model of insulin signalling, with FoxO1 presiding over glucose production and Srebp-1c regulating lipogenesis, provides a potential explanation. Here we illustrate an alternative mechanism that integrates glucose production and lipogenesis under the unifying control of FoxO.

This report discusses how various types of omics data can be integrated to shed light on the changes in metabolism that occur in obesity and diabetes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Comorbidity", "Computational Biology", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Discovery", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Glucose", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipid Metabolism", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Obesity", "Prediabetic State", "Prevalence", "Research Design"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Irwin J", "Last Name": "Kurland", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Stable Isotope and Metabolomics Core Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine Diabetes Center, Bronx, New York 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Burant", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven M", "Last Name": "Fischer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barbara B", "Last Name": "Kahn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher B", "Last Name": "Newgard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suma", "Last Name": "Ramagiri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriele V", "Last Name": "Ronnett", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Ryals", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Sanders", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joe", "Last Name": "Shambaugh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Shockcor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven S", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23420833", "Title": "Expanded granulocyte/monocyte compartment in myeloid-specific triple FoxO knockout increases oxidative stress and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice.", "Abstract": "Increased neutrophil and monocyte counts are often associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, but their relationship to insulin sensitivity is unknown.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylcysteine", "Animals", "Antioxidants", "Apoptosis", "Atherosclerosis", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cysteine", "Female", "Forkhead Box Protein O1", "Forkhead Box Protein O3", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Free Radical Scavengers", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Insulin", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Monocytes", "Neutrophils", "Nitrogen", "Oxidative Stress", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction", "Tyrosine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyoichiro", "Last Name": "Tsuchiya", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, 1150 St Nicholas Ave, Russ Berrie Pavilion Room 238, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marit", "Last Name": "Westerterp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vidya", "Last Name": "Subramanian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anthony W", "Last Name": "Ferrante", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan R", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Circulation research", "PubDate": "2013Mar29"}, {"PMID": "23401241", "Title": "Loss of TIMP3 underlies diabetic nephropathy via FoxO1/STAT1 interplay.", "Abstract": "ADAM17 and its inhibitor TIMP3 are involved in nephropathy, but their role in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is unclear. Diabetic Timp3(-/-) mice showed increased albuminuria, increased membrane thickness and mesangial expansion. Microarray profiling uncovered a significant reduction of Foxo1 expression in diabetic Timp3(-/-) mice compared to WT, along with FoxO1 target genes involved in autophagy, while STAT1, a repressor of FoxO1 transcription, was increased. Re-expression of Timp3 in Timp3(-/-) mesangial cells rescued the expression of Foxo1 and its targets, and decreased STAT1 expression to control levels; abolishing STAT1 expression led to a rescue of FoxO1, evoking a role of STAT1 in linking Timp3 deficiency to FoxO1. Studies on kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic nephropathy confirmed a significant reduction in TIMP3, FoxO1 and FoxO1 target genes involved in autophagy compared to controls, while STAT1 expression was strongly increased. Our study suggests that loss of TIMP3 is a hallmark of DKD in human and mouse models and designates TIMP3 as a new possible therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Albuminuria", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Biopsy", "Cell Line", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Forkhead Box Protein O1", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Kidney Glomerulus", "Mesangial Cells", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Primary Cell Culture", "RNA Interference", "STAT1 Transcription Factor", "Signal Transduction", "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3", "Transfection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Loredana", "Last Name": "Fiorentino", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Cavalera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stefano", "Last Name": "Menini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Marchetti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Mavilio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Fabrizi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Conserva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Viviana", "Last Name": "Casagrande", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rossella", "Last Name": "Menghini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Pontrelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivan", "Last Name": "Arisi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mara", "Last Name": "D'Onofrio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Lauro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rama", "Last Name": "Khokha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Pugliese", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Loreto", "Last Name": "Gesualdo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Renato", "Last Name": "Lauro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Massimo", "Last Name": "Federici", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "EMBO molecular medicine", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "23349480", "Title": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells link hyperinsulinemia to hepatic insulin resistance.", "Abstract": "Insulin signaling in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) is critical to maintain endothelial function but also to mediate insulin action on peripheral glucose disposal. However, gene knockout studies have reached disparate conclusions. Thus, insulin receptor inactivation in ECs does not impair insulin action, whereas inactivation of Irs2 does. Previously, we have shown that endothelial ablation of the three Foxo genes protects mice from atherosclerosis. Interestingly, here we show that mice lacking FoxO isoforms in ECs develop hepatic insulin resistance through excessive generation of nitric oxide (NO) that impairs insulin action in hepatocytes via tyrosine nitration of insulin receptors. Coculture experiments demonstrate that NO produced in liver sinusoidal ECs impairs insulin's ability to suppress glucose production in hepatocytes. The effects of liver sinusoidal ECs can be mimicked by NO donors and can be reversed by NO inhibitors in vivo and ex vivo. The findings are consistent with a model in which excessive, rather than reduced, insulin signaling in ECs predisposes to systemic insulin resistance, prompting a reevaluation of current approaches to insulin sensitization.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Coculture Techniques", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hepatocytes", "Hyperinsulinism", "Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins", "Insulin Resistance", "Liver", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Nitric Oxide", "Nitric Oxide Donors", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Receptor, Insulin", "Signal Transduction", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyoichiro", "Last Name": "Tsuchiya", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2013May"}]
