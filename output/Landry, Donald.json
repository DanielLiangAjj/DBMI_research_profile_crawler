[{"PMID": "38425914", "Title": "Exploring the Landscape of Aptamers: From Cross-Reactive to Selective to Specific, High-Affinity Receptors for Cocaine.", "Abstract": "We reported over 20 years ago MNS-4.1, the first DNA aptamer with a micromolar affinity for cocaine. MNS-4.1 is based on a structural motif that is very common in any random pool of oligonucleotides, and it is actually a nonspecific hydrophobic receptor with wide cross-reactivity with alkaloids and steroids. Despite such weaknesses preventing broad applications, this aptamer became widely used in proof-of-concept demonstrations of new formats of biosensors. We now report a series of progressively improved DNA aptamers recognizing cocaine, with the final optimized receptors having low nanomolar affinity and over a thousand-fold selectivity over the initial cross-reactants. In the process of optimization, we tested different methods to eliminate cross-reactivities and improve affinity, eventually achieving properties that are comparable to those of the reported monoclonal antibody candidates for the therapy of overdose. Multiple aptamers that we now report share structural motifs with the previously reported receptor for serotonin. Further mutagenesis studies revealed a palindromic, highly adaptable, broadly cross-reactive hydrophobic motif that could be rebuilt through mutagenesis, expansion of linker regions, and selections into receptors with exceptional affinities and varying specificities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyungae", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Obtin", "Last Name": "Alkhamis", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Canoura", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Bryant", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edward M", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mihaela", "Last Name": "Barbu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dragan", "Last Name": "Nikic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Saswata", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, United States."}, {"First Name": "Milan N", "Last Name": "Stojanovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}], "Journal": "JACS Au", "PubDate": "2024Feb26"}, {"PMID": "38370689", "Title": "A pharmacological toolkit for human microglia identifies Topoisomerase I inhibitors as immunomodulators for Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "While efforts to identify microglial subtypes have recently accelerated, the relation of transcriptomically defined states to function has been largely limited to in silico annotations.

Using different model systems including HMC3 cells, iPSC-derived microglia and cerebral organoids, we characterize the effect of these compounds in mimicking human microglial subtypes in vitro. We show that the Topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin induces a CD74high/MHChigh microglial subtype which is specialized in amyloid beta phagocytosis. Camptothecin suppressed amyloid toxicity and restored microglia back to their homeostatic state in a zebrafish amyloid model.

Unfortunately, the native enzyme was highly unstable and the corresponding mutagenized derivatives, RBP-8000 and E196-301, although improving in vitro thermo-stability and in vivo half-life, were a partial solution to the problem. For cocaine use disorder treatment, an efficient cocaine-metabolizing enzyme with a longer residence time in circulation would be needed. We investigated in vitro the possibility of developing red blood cells (RBCs) loaded with RBP-8000 and E196-301 as a biocompatible system to metabolize cocaine for a longer period of time. RBP 8000 stability within human RBCs is limited (approximately 50% residual activity after 1 h at 37\u00b0C) and not different as for the free enzyme, while both free and encapsulated E196-301 showed a greater thermo-stability. By reducing cellular glutathione content during the loading procedure, in order to preserve the disulfide bonds opportunely created to stabilize the enzyme dimer structure, it was possible to produce an encapsulated protein maintaining 100% stability at least after 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Moreover, E196-301-loaded RBCs were efficiently able to degrade cocaine in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The same stability results were obtained when murine RBCs were used paving the way to preclinical investigations. Thus, our in vitro data show that E196-301-loaded RBCs could act as efficient bioreactors in degrading cocaine to non-toxic metabolites to be possibly considered in substance-use disorder treatments. This approach should now be investigated in a preclinical model of cocaine use disorder to evaluate if further protein modifications are needed to further improve long term enzyme stability.", "Keywords": ["E196-301 stability", "RBP 8000 stability", "cocaine degradation", "cocaine esterase", "cocaine use disorder", "red blood cells as drug delivery system"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luigia", "Last Name": "Rossi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Pierig\u00e8", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "Agostini", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, ASUR AV1, Pesaro, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Noemi", "Last Name": "Bigini", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Veronica", "Last Name": "Termopoli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Yingting", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling and Biopharmaceutical Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling and Biopharmaceutical Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chang-Guo", "Last Name": "Zhan", "Affiliation": "Molecular Modeling and Biopharmaceutical Center, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mauro", "Last Name": "Magnani", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32755992", "Title": "MECHANISMS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY: Vitamin D and COVID-19.", "Abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has generated an explosion of interest both in the mechanisms of infection leading to dissemination and expression of this disease, and in potential risk factors that may have a mechanistic basis for disease propagation or control.

psychiatric disorders. We have previously reported that the administration of (R,S)-ketamine prevents stress-induced depressive-like behavior in male mice, perhaps by altering \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated transmission in hippocampal CA3. However, it is still unknown whether metabolites of (R,S)-ketamine can be prophylactic in both sexes. We administered (R,S)-ketamine or its metabolites (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R,6R)-HNK) and (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine ((2S,6S)-HNK) at various doses 1 week before one of a number of stressors in male and female 129S6/SvEv mice. Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the effect of prophylactic drug administration on glutamatergic activity in CA3. To examine the interaction between ovarian hormones and stress resilience, female mice also underwent ovariectomy (OVX) surgery and a hormone replacement protocol prior to drug administration. (2S,6S)-HNK and (2R,6R)-HNK protected against distinct stress-induced behaviors in both sexes, with (2S,6S)-HNK attenuating learned fear in male mice, and (2R,6R)-HNK preventing stress-induced depressive-like behavior in both sexes. (R,S)-ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK, but not (2S,6S)-HNK, attenuated large-amplitude AMPAR-mediated bursts in hippocampal CA3. All three compounds reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated currents 1 week after administration. Furthermore, ovarian-derived hormones were necessary for and sufficient to restore (R,S)-ketamine- and (2R,6R)-HNK-mediated prophylaxis in female mice. Our data provide further evidence that resilience-enhancing prophylactics may alter AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission in CA3.

In the central nervous system, the NO dual nature in neuroprotection and neurotoxicity has been explored to unveil its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A growing body of research shows that the activation of the NO signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic adenine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB) (so-called NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway) ameliorates altered neuroplasticity and memory deficits in AD animal models. In addition to NO donors, several other pharmacological agents, such as phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have been used to activate the pathway and rescue memory disorders. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, are marketed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and arterial pulmonary hypertension due to their vasodilatory properties. The ability of PDE5 inhibitors to interfere with the NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway by increasing the levels of cGMP has prompted the hypothesis that PDE5 inhibition might be used as an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. To this end, newly designed PDE5 inhibitors belonging to different chemical classes with improved pharmacologic profile (e.g. higher potency, improved selectivity, and blood-brain barrier penetration) have been synthesized and evaluated in several animal models of AD. In addition, recent medicinal chemistry effort has led to the development of agents concurrently acting on the PDE5 enzyme and a second target involved in AD. Both marketed and investigational PDE5 inhibitors have shown to reverse cognitive defects in young and aged wild type mice as well as transgenic mouse models of AD and tauopathy using a variety of behavioral tasks. These studies confirmed the therapeutic potential of PDE5 inhibitors as cognitive enhancers. However, clinical studies assessing cognitive functions using marketed PDE5 inhibitors have not been conclusive. Drug discovery efforts by our group and others are currently directed towards the development of novel PDE5 inhibitors tailored to AD with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. In summary, the present perspective reports an overview of the correlation between the NO signaling and AD, as well as an outline of the PDE5 inhibitors used as an alternative approach in altering the NO pathway leading to an improvement of learning and memory. The last two sections describe the preclinical and clinical evaluation of PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of AD, providing a comprehensive analysis of the current status of the AD drug discovery efforts involving PDE5 as a new therapeutic target.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Memory", "Nitric oxide", "Phosphodiesterase 5", "Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Cyclic GMP", "Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Nitric Oxide", "Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Zuccarello", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Acquarone", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Calcagno", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elentina K", "Last Name": "Argyrousi", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shi-Xian", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

However, due to the disadvantages to existing oxime-based reactivators for treatment of OPC poisoning, we considered non-oxime mechanisms of reactivation. A high throughput screen of compound libraries was performed to discover previously unidentified reactivation compounds, followed by studies on their analogs. In the process, we discovered multiple non-oxime classes of compounds, the most robust of which we have already reported [1]. Herein, we report other classes of compounds we identified in our screen that are efficient at reactivation. During biochemical characterization, we also found some compounds with other activities that may inspire novel therapeutic approaches to OPC toxicity. Specifically, we found compounds that [1] increase the rate of substrate hydrolysis by AChE and, [2] protect the enzyme from inhibition by OPC. Further, we discovered that a subset of reactivator compounds recover activity from both AChE and the related enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). We now report these compounds, their activities and discuss how each relates to therapeutic approaches that would provide alternatives to traditional oxime-based reactivation.", "Keywords": ["Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)", "Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)", "Non-oxime reactivators", "Organophosphate compounds (OPCs)", "Structure activity relationship (SAR) study"], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylcholinesterase", "Butyrylcholinesterase", "Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "Cholinesterase Reactivators", "Donepezil", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Hydrolysis", "Imidazoles", "Indans", "Kinetics", "Organophosphate Poisoning", "Oximes", "Piperazines", "Piperidines", "Pyridines", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francine S", "Last Name": "Katz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, 630 W 168th Street, BB8-444, New York, NY, 10032, USA.

Since the LTH correlates directly with chronic pain in many animal models, we tested the hypothesis that inhibiting PKG-1\u03b1 would attenuate LTH-mediated pain. We first synthesized and characterized compound N46 (N-((3R,4R)-4-(4-(2-fluoro-3-methoxy-6-propoxybenzoyl)benzamido)pyrrolidin-3-yl)-1H-indazole-5-carboxamide). N46 inhibits PKG-1\u03b1 with an IC50 of 7.5 nmol, was highly selective when tested against a panel of 274 kinases, and tissue distribution studies indicate that it does not enter the CNS. To evaluate its antinociceptive potential, we used 2 animal models in which the pain involves both activated PKG-1\u03b1 and LTH. Injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the rat hind paw causes a thermal hyperalgesia that was significantly attenuated 24 hours after a single intravenous injection of N46. Next, we used a rat model of osteoarthritic knee joint pain and found that a single intra-articular injection of N46 alleviated the pain 14 days after the pain was established and the relief lasted for 7 days. Thermal hyperalgesia and osteoarthritic pain are also associated with the activation of the capsaicin-activated transient receptor protein vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channel. We show that capsaicin activates PKG-1\u03b1 in nerves and that a subcutaneous delivery of N46 attenuated the mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity elicited by exposure to capsaicin. Thus, PKG-1\u03b1 appears to be downstream of the transient receptor protein vanilloid-1. Our studies provide proof of concept in animal models that a PKG-1\u03b1 antagonist has a powerful antinociceptive effect on persistent, already existing inflammatory pain.

Because mTOR signaling is required for initiation of messenger RNA translation, we hypothesized that cotargeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. We found that a novel PI3K \u03b4 isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc-dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 \u03b5 (CK1\u03b5). Targeting CK1\u03b5 using a selective chemical inhibitor or short hairpin RNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3K\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib.

We recently discovered that obesity activates a previously unknown pathway that promotes both excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) and defective insulin signaling in hepatocytes, leading to exacerbation of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obesity. At the hub of this new pathway is a kinase cascade involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), p38\u03b1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPKAPK2/3 (MK2/3). Genetic-based inhibition of these kinases improves metabolism in obese mice. Here, we report that treatment of obese insulin-resistant mice with an allosteric MK2/3 inhibitor, compound (cmpd) 28, ameliorates glucose homeostasis by suppressing excessive HGP and enhancing insulin signaling. The metabolic improvement seen with cmpd 28 is additive with the leading T2D drug, metformin, but it is not additive with dominant-negative MK2, suggesting an on-target mechanism of action.

To identify PfENT1 inhibitors, we screened 64\u202f560 compounds and identified 171 by their ability to rescue the growth of PfENT1-expressing fui1\u0394 yeast in the presence of a cytotoxic PfENT1 substrate, 5-fluorouridine (5-FUrd). In secondary assays, nine of the highest activity compounds inhibited PfENT1-dependent growth of a purine auxotrophic yeast strain with adenosine as the sole purine source (IC50 0.2-2 \u03bcM). These nine compounds completely blocked [(3)H]adenosine uptake into PfENT1-expressing yeast and erythrocyte-free trophozoite-stage parasites (IC50 5-50 nM), and inhibited chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant parasite proliferation (IC50 5-50 \u03bcM). Wild-type (WT) parasite IC50 values were up to 4-fold lower compared to PfENT1-knockout (pfent1\u0394) parasites. pfent1\u0394 parasite killing showed a delayed-death phenotype not observed with WT. We infer that, in parasites, the compounds inhibit both PfENT1 and a secondary target with similar efficacy. The secondary target identity is unknown, but its existence may reduce the likelihood of parasites developing resistance to PfENT1 inhibitors. Our data support the hypothesis that blocking purine transport through PfENT1 may be a novel and compelling approach for antimalarial drug development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine", "Antimalarials", "Axenic Culture", "Biological Transport", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Complementation Test", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Nucleobase, Nucleoside, Nucleotide, and Nucleic Acid Transport Proteins", "Nucleoside Transport Proteins", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Protozoan Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Trophozoites", "Uridine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "I J", "Last Name": "Frame", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roman", "Last Name": "Deniskin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Rinderspacher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francine", "Last Name": "Katz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shi-Xian", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robyn D", "Last Name": "Moir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sophie H", "Last Name": "Adjalley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Olivia", "Last Name": "Coburn-Flynn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Fidock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Willis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Myles H", "Last Name": "Akabas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2015Mar20"}, {"PMID": "24879056", "Title": "Chloride channel blockade relaxes airway smooth muscle and potentiates relaxation by \u03b2-agonists.", "Abstract": "Severe bronchospasm refractory to \u03b2-agonists continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in asthmatic patients. We questioned whether chloride channels/transporters are novel targets for the relaxation of airway smooth muscle (ASM). We have screened a library of compounds, derivatives of anthranilic and indanyloxyacetic acid, that were originally developed to antagonize chloride channels in the kidney. We hypothesized that members of this library would be novel calcium-activated chloride channel blockers for the airway. The initial screen of this compound library identified 4 of 20 compounds that relaxed a tetraethylammonium chloride-induced contraction in guinea pig tracheal rings. The two most effective compounds, compounds 1 and 13, were further studied for their potential to either prevent the initiation of or relax the maintenance phase of an acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction or to potentiate \u03b2-agonist-mediated relaxation. Both relaxed an established ACh-induced contraction in human and guinea pig ex vivo ASM. In contrast, the prevention of an ACh-induced contraction required copretreatment with the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter blocker bumetanide. The combination of compound 13 and bumetanide also potentiated relaxation by the \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol in guinea pig tracheal rings. Compounds 1 and 13 hyperpolarized the plasma cell membrane of human ASM cells and blocked spontaneous transient inward currents, a measure of chloride currents in these cells. These functional and electrophysiological data suggest that modulating ASM chloride flux is a novel therapeutic target in asthma and other bronchoconstrictive diseases.", "Keywords": ["NKCC", "bumetanide", "electrophysiology", "niflumic acid", "organ bath"], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylcholine", "Adrenergic beta-Agonists", "Animals", "Asthma", "Cell Membrane", "Chloride Channels", "Chlorides", "Guinea Pigs", "Humans", "Isoproterenol", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle Relaxation", "Muscle, Smooth", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Tetraethylammonium", "Trachea"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Danielsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York; and jed9073@nyp.org."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Yim", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Rinderspacher", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Wen", "Last Name": "Fu", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.
