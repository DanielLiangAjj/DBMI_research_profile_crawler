Ineffective antimicrobial activity by these last resort therapeutics can occur by transfer of mcr-1, a plasmid-mediated resistance gene, causing modification of the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and disruption of the interactions between polymyxins and lipid A. Whether this modification alters the innate host immune response or carries a high fitness cost in the bacteria is not well established. To investigate this, we studied infection with K. pneumoniae (KP) ATCC 13883 harboring either the mcr-1 plasmid (pmcr-1) or the vector control (pBCSK) ATCC 13883. Bacterial fitness characteristics of mcr-1 acquisition were evaluated. Differentiated human monocytes (THP-1s) were stimulated with KP bacterial strains or purified LPS from both parent isolates and isolates harboring mcr-1. Cell culture supernatants were analyzed for cytokine production. A bacterial pneumonia model in WT C57/BL6J mice was used to monitor immune cell recruitment, cytokine induction, and bacterial clearance in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Isolates harboring mcr-1 had increased colistin MIC compared to the parent isolates but did not alter bacterial fitness. Few differences in cytokines were observed with purified LPS from mcr-1 expressing bacteria in vitro. However, in a mouse pneumonia model, no bacterial clearance defect was observed between pmcr-1-harboring KP and parent isolates. Consistently, no differences in cytokine production or immune cell recruitment in the BALF were observed, suggesting that other mechanisms outweigh the effect of these lipid A mutations in LPS.", "Keywords": ["Klebsiella pneumoniae", "antimicrobial resistance", "carbapenem resistance", "colistin", "colistin resistance", "host immune response", "lipid A", "mcr-1", "polymyxin", "pulmonary infection"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Colistin", "Lipid A", "Immunity, Innate", "Mice", "Klebsiella Infections", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Pneumonia, Bacterial", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Cytokines", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Female"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gitanjali", "Last Name": "Bhushan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Castano", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tania", "Last Name": "Wong Fok Lung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Chandler", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, University of Maryland, School of Dentistry, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas H", "Last Name": "McConville", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert K", "Last Name": "Ernst", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, University of Maryland, School of Dentistry, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice S", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Infection and immunity", "PubDate": "2024Jun11"}, {"PMID": "37793346", "Title": "Ketogenesis promotes tolerance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection.", "Abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pulmonary infection.

This experience underscores the complexity of host-S. aureus interactions, which appear to be greater than many other bacterial pathogens against which successful vaccines have been developed. It is increasingly evident that S. aureus employs strategic countermeasures to evade or exploit human immune responses. From entering host cells to persist in stealthy intracellular reservoirs, to sensing the environmental milieu and leveraging bacterial or host metabolic products to reprogram host immune responses, S. aureus poses considerable challenges for the development of effective vaccines. The fact that this pathogen causes distinct types of infections and can undergo transient genetic, transcriptional or metabolic adaptations in vivo that do not occur in vitro compounds challenges in vaccine development. Notably, the metabolic versatility of both bacterial and host immune cells as they compete for available substrates within specific tissues inevitably impacts the variable repertoire of gene products that may or may not be vaccine antigens. In this respect, S. aureus has chameleon phenotypes that have alluded vaccine strategies thus far. Nonetheless, a number of recent studies have also revealed important new insights into pathogenesis vulnerabilities of S. aureus. A more detailed understanding of host protective immune defenses versus S. aureus adaptive immune evasion mechanisms may offer breakthroughs in the development of effective vaccines, but at present this goal remains a very high bar. Coupled with the recent advances in human genetics and epigenetics, newer vaccine technologies may enable such a goal. If so, future vaccines that protect against or mitigate the severity of S. aureus infections are likely to emerge at the intersection of precision and personalized medicine.

To establish infection, bacteria express a well-defined set of so-called virulence factors that facilitate colonization and activate an immune response, gene products that have been identified in murine models. Less well-understood are the adaptive changes that occur over time in vivo, enabling the organisms to evade innate and adaptive immune clearance mechanisms. These colonizers proliferate, generating a population sufficient to provide selection for mutants, such as small colony variants and mucoid variants, that are optimized for long term infection. Such host-adapted strains have evolved in response to selective pressure such as antibiotics and the recruitment of phagocytes at sites of infection and their release of signaling metabolites (e.g., succinate). These metabolites can potentially function as substrates for bacterial growth and but also generate oxidant stress. Whole genome sequencing and quantified expression of selected genes have helped to explain how P. aeruginosa and S. aureus adapt to the presence of these metabolites over the course of in vivo infection. The serial isolation of clonally related strains from patients with cystic fibrosis has provided the opportunity to identify bacterial metabolic pathways that are altered under this immune pressure, such as the anti-oxidant glyoxylate and pentose phosphate pathways, routes contributing to the generation of biofilms. These metabolic pathways and biofilm itself enable the organisms to dissipate oxidant stress, while providing protection from phagocytosis.

Importantly, intranasal transfer of bone marrow-derived M-MDSCs from mice able to produce IL-10 at 1 day prior to infection improved the ability of IL-10-/- mice to clear KP35 in the lungs, decreasing their mortality.

In response to IFN-\u03bb, the transmigration of neutrophils across a polarized monolayer of airway epithelial cells was increased, consistent with diminished epithelial integrity. KP35 infection increased epithelial permeability, and pretreatment with IFN-\u03bb amplified this effect and facilitated bacterial transmigration. These effects of IFN-\u03bb were confirmed in vivo, in that mice lacking the receptor for IFN-\u03bb (Ifnlr1-/-) were protected from bacteremia in a murine model of KP35 pneumonia. Conversely, the integrity of the epithelial barrier was protected by IL-22, with subsequent impairment of neutrophil and bacterial transmigration in vitro. Maximal expression of IL-22 in vivo was observed later in the course of infection than IFN-\u03bb production, with high levels of IL-22 produced by recruited immune cells at 48 hours, consistent with a role in epithelial barrier recovery.

However, organisms that efficiently activate damaging innate immune responses, such as those mediated by the inflammasome and caspase-1, may cause pulmonary damage and interfere with bacterial clearance. The extracellular, opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses not only pathogen-associated molecular patterns that activate NF-\u03baB signaling in epithelial and immune cells, but also flagella that activate the NLRC4 inflammasome. We demonstrate that induction of inflammasome signaling, ascribed primarily to the alveolar macrophage, impaired P. aeruginosa clearance and was associated with increased apoptosis/pyroptosis and mortality in a murine model of acute pneumonia. Strategies that limited inflammasome activation, including infection by fliC mutants, depletion of macrophages, deletion of NLRC4, reduction of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 production, inhibition of caspase-1, and inhibition of downstream signaling in IL-1R- or IL-18R-null mice, all resulted in enhanced bacterial clearance and diminished pathology. These results demonstrate that the inflammasome provides a potential target to limit the pathological consequences of acute P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "Animals", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Clodronic Acid", "Flagellin", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Inflammasomes", "Interferon-beta", "Interleukin-17", "Interleukin-18", "Interleukin-1beta", "Macrophages, Alveolar", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mucociliary Clearance", "Neutrophils", "Pneumonia, Bacterial", "Pseudomonas Infections", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Taylor S", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice S", "Last Name": "Prince", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}]
