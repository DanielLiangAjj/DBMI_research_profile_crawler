[{"PMID": "38902234", "Title": "Gliovascular transcriptional perturbations in Alzheimer's disease reveal molecular mechanisms of blood brain barrier dysfunction.", "Abstract": "To uncover molecular changes underlying blood-brain-barrier dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing in 24 Alzheimer's disease and control brains and focused on vascular and astrocyte clusters as main cell types of blood-brain-barrier gliovascular-unit. The majority of the vascular transcriptional changes were in pericytes. Of the vascular molecular targets predicted to interact with astrocytic ligands, SMAD3, upregulated in Alzheimer's disease pericytes, has the highest number of ligands including VEGFA, downregulated in Alzheimer's disease astrocytes. We validated these findings with external datasets comprising 4,730 pericyte and 150,664 astrocyte nuclei. Blood SMAD3 levels are associated with\u00a0Alzheimer's disease-related neuroimaging outcomes. We determined inverse relationships between pericytic SMAD3 and astrocytic VEGFA in human iPSC and zebrafish models. Here, we detect vast transcriptome changes in Alzheimer's disease at the gliovascular-unit, prioritize perturbed pericytic SMAD3-astrocytic VEGFA interactions, and validate these in cross-species models to provide a molecular mechanism of blood-brain-barrier disintegrity in Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Humans", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Smad3

biology.", "Abstract": "Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these \"mind-mitochondria\" associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues. Thus, self-reported psychosocial experiences are linked to human brain mitochondrial phenotypes.", "Keywords": ["mitochondria", "proteome", "psychosocial factors", "single cell RNA-seq",

Here, we investigate the function of ZCCHC17 and its role in AD pathogenesis using data from human autopsy tissue (consisting of males and females) and female human cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of ZCCHC17 followed by mass spectrometry analysis in human iPSC-derived neurons reveals that ZCCHC17's binding partners are enriched for RNA-splicing proteins. ZCCHC17 knockdown results in widespread RNA-splicing changes that significantly overlap with splicing changes found in AD brain tissue, with synaptic genes commonly affected. ZCCHC17 expression correlates with cognitive resilience in AD patients, and we uncover an APOE4-dependent negative correlation of ZCCHC17 expression with tangle burden. Furthermore, a majority of ZCCHC17 interactors also co-IP with known tau interactors, and we find a significant overlap between alternatively spliced genes in ZCCHC17 knockdown and tau overexpression neurons. These results demonstrate ZCCHC17's role in neuronal RNA processing and its interaction with pathology and cognitive resilience in AD, and suggest that the maintenance of ZCCHC17 function may be a

However, the molecular mechanisms promoting pro-neurogenic astroglial fate despite AD pathology are unknown. In this study, we used APP/PS1dE9 mouse model and induced Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) expression in the hippocampus. Ngfr, which promotes neurogenic fate of astroglia during the amyloid pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish brain, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcomes. Histological analyses of the changes in proliferation and neurogenesis, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies showed that the induced expression of Ngfr reduced the reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), which we found was sufficient to reduce neurogenesis in astroglia. Anti-neurogenic effects of Lcn2 was mediated by Slc22a17, blockage of which recapitulated the pro-neurogenicity by Ngfr. Long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Postmortem human AD hippocampi and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with reactive gliosis and reduced neurogenesis. Comparing transcriptional changes in mouse, zebrafish, and human AD brains for cell intrinsic differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression networks revealed common altered downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, such as PFKP, which can enhance proliferation and neurogenesis in vitro when blocked. Our study suggests that the reactive non-neurogenic astroglia in AD can be coaxed to a pro-neurogenic fate and AD pathology can be alleviated with Ngfr.

Co-immunoprecipitation of ZCCHC17 followed by mass spectrometry analysis in human iPSC-derived neurons reveals that ZCCHC17's binding partners are enriched for RNA splicing proteins. ZCCHC17 knockdown results in widespread RNA splicing changes that significantly overlap with splicing changes found in AD brain tissue, with synaptic genes commonly affected. ZCCHC17 expression correlates with cognitive resilience in AD patients, and we uncover an APOE4 dependent negative correlation of ZCCHC17 expression with tangle burden. Furthermore, a majority of ZCCHC17 interactors also co-IP with known tau interactors, and we find significant overlap between alternatively spliced genes in ZCCHC17 knockdown and tau overexpression neurons.

Here, we report on a SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring the E484K mutation in a 281-bed psychiatric facility in New Jersey among unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals (HCPs). A total of 81 inpatients and HCPs tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from 29 October 9 to 30 November 2020. The R.1 variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two MAbs in clinical use, as well as 2 receptor binding domain MAbs and 4 N-terminal domain (NTD) MAbs. NTD MAbs against pseudovirus harboring single characteristic R.1 mutations highlight the role of S255F in loss of activity. Additionally, we note dampened neutralization capacity by plasma from individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. The relative resistance of the R.1 variant is likely lower than that of B.1.351 and closer to that of P.1 and B.1.526. The R.1 lineage has been reported in 47 states in the United States and 40 countries. Although high proportions exhibited symptoms (26% and 61% among patients and HCPs, respectively) and relative antibody resistance, we detected only 10 R.1 variants from over 2,900 samples (~0.34%) collected from January to October 2021. Among 3 vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. IMPORTANCE The neutralizing capacities of monoclonal antibodies used to treat COVID-19 and of those recovered from previously infected and vaccinated individuals against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) remain important questions. We report on a nosocomial outbreak caused by a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring an E484K mutation among 81 unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals. We note high attack rates with symptoms in nearly 50% of infected individuals, in sharp contrast to an unrelated institutional outbreak caused by the R.1 variant among a vaccinated population. We found little evidence of significant community spillover. This variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two monoclonal antibodies in clinical use and dampened the neutralization capacity of convalescent-phase plasma from individuals with previous infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. Among three vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. These findings underscore the importance of vaccination for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease.", "Keywords": ["SARS-CoV-2", "spike protein", "vaccine", "variants of concern"], "MeSH terms":

We also observed AMPK over-activation as well as increased fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial biomass in Ngn2-induced neurons derived from a new APPSwe/Swe knockin human ES cell line. We demonstrate that A\u03b242o-dependent over-activation of the CAMKK2-AMPK kinase dyad mediates synaptic loss through coordinated phosphorylation of MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission and ULK2-dependent mitophagy.

An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates. Therefore, in AD cerebrovascular risk factors promote cerebrovascular pathology which in turn, interacts with FMNL2 altering the normal astroglial-vascular mechanisms underlying the clearance of amyloid and tau increasing their deposition in brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood\u2013brain-barrier", "Cerebrovascular risk factors", "FMNL2", "GWAS", "Gliovascular

Here, using quantitative proteomics across three independent cohorts we systematically characterized the co-regulation patterns of mitochondrial RC proteins in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Whereas the abundance of RC protein subunits that physically assemble into stable complexes were correlated, indicating their co-regulation, RC assembly factors exhibited modest co-regulation. Within complex I, nuclear DNA-encoded subunits exhibited >2.5-times higher co-regulation than mitochondrial (mt)DNA-encoded subunits. Moreover, mtDNA copy number was unrelated to mtDNA-encoded subunits abundance, suggesting that mtDNA content is not limiting. Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains exhibited reduced abundance of complex I RC subunits, an effect largely driven by a 2-4% overall lower mitochondrial protein content.

We describe the early genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated health care professionals (HCP). Our postvaccination COVID-19 symptoms-based surveillance program among HCPs in a 17-hospital network identified all vaccinated HCPs who tested positive for COVID-19 after routine screening or after self-reporting. From 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2021, 23,687 HCPs received either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All available postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 samples and a random collection from nonvaccinated patients during the similar time frame were subjected to VOC screening and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Sixty-two percent (23,697/37,500) of HCPs received at least one vaccine dose, with 60% (22,458) fully vaccinated. We detected 138 (0.58%, 138/23,697) COVID-19 cases, 105 among partially vaccinated and 33 (0.15%, 33/22,458) among fully vaccinated. Five partially vaccinated required hospitalization, four with supplemental oxygen. VOC screening from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38%) harboring N501Y and 1 (6%) with E484K polymorphisms; percentage of concurrent nonvaccinated samples was 37% (523/1,404) and 20% (284/1,394), respectively. There was an upward trend from January to April for E484K/Q (3% to 26%) and N501Y (1% to 49%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not detect an increased frequency of any receptor-binding domain (RBD)/N-terminal domain (NTD) polymorphism between groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Our results support robust protection by vaccination, particularly among recipients of both doses. Despite VOCs accounting for over 40% of SARS-CoV-2 from fully vaccinated individuals, the genomic diversity appears to proportionally represent VOCs among nonvaccinated populations. IMPORTANCE A number of highly effective vaccines have been developed and deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence and epidemiological dominance of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with high transmission potential and immune evasion properties, the so-called variants of concern (VOC), continue to be a major concern. Whether these VOCs alter the efficacy of the administered vaccines is of great concern and a critical question to study. We describe the initial genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from partial/fully vaccinated health care professionals and probe specifically for VOC enrichment. Our findings support the high level of protection provided by full vaccination despite a steep increase in the prevalence of polymorphisms associated with increased transmission potential (N501Y) and immune evasion (E484K) in the nonvaccinated population. Thus, we do not find evidence of VOC enrichment among vaccinated groups. Overall, the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 recovered postvaccination appears to proportionally represent the observed viral diversity within the community.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "breakthrough", "spike protein", "vaccine", "variants of concern"], "MeSH terms": ["2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273", "Adult", "Aged", "BNT162 Vaccine", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "Epidemiologic Studies", "Female", "Genomics", "Genotype", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Mutation", "New Jersey", "Pandemics", "SARS-CoV-2", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "Vaccination", "Whole Genome Sequencing", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Barun", "Last Name": "Mathema", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia Universitygrid.21729.3f Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kar Fai", "Last Name": "Chow", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Biorepository, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanan", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Zody", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose R", "Last Name": "Mediavilla", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus H", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaelea", "Last Name": "Composto", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dayna M", "Last Name": "Oschwald", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soren", "Last Name": "Germer", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Fennessey", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kishan", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Biorepository, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health BI Analytics, Edison, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ann", "Last Name": "Cassell", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health BI Analytics, Edison, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Pascual", "Affiliation": "John Theurer Cancer Center, Outcomes Division, Hackensack University Medical Centergrid.239835.6, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Ip", "Affiliation": "John Theurer Cancer Center, Outcomes Division, Hackensack University Medical Centergrid.239835.6, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e9", "Last Name": "Corvelo", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophia", "Last Name": "Dar", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Biorepository, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yael", "Last Name": "Kramer", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Biorepository, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Centergrid.429884.b, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Perlin", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry N", "Last Name": "Kreiswirth", "Affiliation": "Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey, USA."}], "Journal": "Microbiology spectrum", "PubDate": "2021Dec22"}, {"PMID": "34742335", "Title": "Characterization of mitochondrial DNA quantity and quality in the human aged and Alzheimer's disease brain.", "Abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Strikingly, this increase in presynaptic mitochondrial size upon MFF downregulation augments their capacity for Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) uptake during neurotransmission, leading to reduced presynaptic [Ca2+]c accumulation, decreased presynaptic release and terminal axon branching.

However, a family member's genotype data may not be collected because of the high cost of in-person interview to obtain blood sample or death of a relative. Previously, efficient nonparametric genotype-specific risk estimation in censored mixture data has been proposed without considering covariates. With multiple predictive risk factors available, risk estimation requires a multivariate model to account for additional covariates that may affect disease risk simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to consider the role of covariates in genotype-specific distribution estimation using family history data. We propose an estimation method that permits more precise risk prediction by controlling for individual characteristics and incorporating interaction effects with missing genotypes in relatives, and thus, gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions can be handled within the framework of a single model. We examine performance of the proposed methods by simulations and apply them to estimate the age-specific cumulative risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation using first-degree relatives who are at genetic risk for PD. The utility of estimated carrier risk is demonstrated through designing a future clinical trial under various assumptions. Such sample size estimation is seen in the Huntington's disease literature using the length of abnormal expansion of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene but is less common in the PD literature.
