Multiple genes and signal pathways are dysregulated during HIRI. This study aims to identify genes as potential therapeutic targets for ameliorating HIRI. Datasets containing samples from the human donor liver (GSE151648) and mouse HIRI model (GSE117066) were analyzed to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The selected DEGs were confirmed by real-time PCR and western blot in the hepatocyte hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) model, mouse HIRI model, and human liver samples after transplantation. Genetic inhibition was used to further clarify the underlying mechanism of the gene in vitro and in vivo. Among the DEGs, CSRNP1 was significantly upregulated (|log FC|=\u20092.08, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and was positively correlated with the MAPK signal pathway (R\u2009=\u20090.67, P\u2009<\u20090.001). CSRNP1 inhibition by siRNA significantly suppressed apoptosis in the AML-12 cell line after HR (mean Annexin+ ratio\u2009=\u200960.62% vs 42.47%, P\u2009=\u20090.0019), but the protective effect was eliminated with an additional MAPK activator. Knocking down CSRNP1 gene expression by intravenous injection of AAV-shRNA markedly reduced liver injury in mouse HIRI model (ALT: AAV-NC vs AAV-shCsrnp1\u2009=\u200926,673.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092761.2 vs 3839.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091432.8, P\u2009<\u20090.001; AST: AAV-NC vs AAV-shCsrnp1\u2009=\u20098640.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091450.3 vs 1786.8\u2009\u00b1\u2009518.3, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Liver-targeted delivery of siRNA by nanoparticles effectively inhibited intra-hepatic genetic expression of Csrnp1 and alleviated IRI by reducing tissue inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis.

We performed multi-regional omics sequencing on 150 samples to assess the genetic basis and immune microenvironment in NAT and matched primary tumor or lymph node metastases. NATs demonstrated different mutated genes compared with GC, and NAT genomes underwent independent evolution with low variant allele frequency. Mutation profiles were predominated by aging and smoking-associated signatures in NAT instead of signatures associated with genetic instability. Although the immune microenvironment within NATs shows substantial intra-patient heterogeneity, the proportion of shared TCR clones among NATs is five times higher than that of tumor regions. These findings support the notion that subclonal expansion is not pronounced in NATs. We also demonstrated remarkable intra-patient heterogeneity of GCs and revealed heterogeneity of focal amplification of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) that leads to differential expression. Finally, we identified that monoclonal seeding is predominant in GC, which is followed by metastasis-to-metastasis dissemination in individual lymph nodes.

Aquaculture in saline-alkaline waters is a crucial strategy to meet the increasing demand for aquatic products. The Chinese mitten crab is an important economic food in China, but the molecular mechanism by which it tolerates carbonate alkalinity (CA) in water remains unclear. Here, we found that enzyme activities of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the gills, such as citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, were markedly reduced under CA stress induced by 40\u00a0mM NaHCO3. Secondly, the TCA cycle in the gills is inhibited under acute CA stress, according to proteomic and metabolomic analyses. The expressions of six enzymes, namely aconitate hydratase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, succinate-CoA ligase, and malate dehydrogenase, were downregulated, resulting in the accumulation of phosphoenolpyruvic acid, citric acid, cis-aconitate, and \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid. Finally, we testified that if the TCA cycle is disturbed by malonate, the survival rate increases in CA water. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the TCA cycle in the gills is inhibited under CA stress. Overall, the results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of tolerance to saline-alkaline water in crabs, which helped us expand the area for freshwater aquaculture and comprehensively understand the physiological characteristics of crab migration.", "Keywords": ["Carbonate alkalinity", "Eriocheir sinensis", "Metabolomics", "Proteomics", "The TCA cycle"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Citric Acid Cycle", "Gills", "Brachyura", "Carbonates", "Stress, Physiological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China."}, {"First Name": "Xue-Sa", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiu-Yun", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhi-Zhong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China."}, {"First Name": "Fei", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China; College of Fisheries and Life Science, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai 201306, China."}, {"First Name": "Yong-An", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Breeding, Shandong Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute, Jinan 250013, China.

We constructed Hi-C contact maps for the cotyledon, apical hook and hypocotyl of soybean subjected to dark and light conditions. The resulting high-resolution Hi-C contact maps identified chromosome territories, A/B compartments, A/B sub-compartments, TADs (Topologically Associated Domains) and chromatin loops in each organ. We observed increased chromatin compaction under light and we found that domains that switched from B sub-compartments in darkness to A sub-compartments under light contained genes that were activated during photomorphogenesis. At the local scale, we identified a group of TADs constructed by gene clusters consisting of different numbers of Small Auxin-Upregulated RNAs (SAURs), which exhibited strict co-expression in the hook and hypocotyl in response to light stimulation. In the hypocotyl, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) regulated the transcription of a SAURs cluster under light via TAD condensation.

We have shown that PAK1 expression positively correlated with PD-L1 in PDA patients, and that inhibition of PAK1 downregulated PD-L1 expression of PDA cells. More importantly, we have demonstrated that PAK1 competed with PD-L1 in binding to tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), a ubiquitin E3 ligase, resulting in less ubiquitination and degradation of PD-L1. Moreover, PAK1 inhibition promoted CD8+ T cells activation and infiltration.

As a result, the axial results are affected by the environmental noise. The immunity to environmental noise increases with measurement accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In compound digital holography microscopy (CDHM)-based measurements, precise identification of the tracking marker is critical to ensuring measurement precision. The reconstruction centering method (RCM) was proposed to suppress the drawbacks caused by installation errors and, at the same time, improve the correct identification of the tracking marker. The reconstructed center is considered to be the center of the microsphere, rather than the center of imaging in conventional digital holographic microscopy. This method was verified by simulation of rays tracing through microspheres and axial moving experiments. The axial displacements of silica microspheres with diameters of 5 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm were tested by CDHM in combination with the RCM.

Here, we reveal that the FACT complex promotes glycolysis and sustains the correct cell fate of neural stem cells/neuroblasts in the Drosophila 3rd instar larval central brain. We show that the FACT complex binds to the promoter region of the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gene and positively regulates ERR expression. ERR is known to act as an aerobic glycolytic switch by upregulating the enzymes required for glycolysis. Dysfunction of the FACT complex leads to the downregulation of ERR transcription, resulting in a decreased ratio of glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (G/O) in neuroblasts. Consequently, neuroblasts exhibit smaller cell sizes, lower proliferation potential, and altered cell fates. Overexpression of ERR or suppression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in neuroblasts increases the relative G/O ratio and rescues defective phenotypes caused by dysfunction of the FACT complex. Thus, the G/O ratio, mediated by the FACT complex, plays a crucial role in neuroblast cell fate maintenance.

Despite the potential of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors in mitigating the desmoplastic stromal response and enhancing the immune milieu, their efficacy is curtailed by suboptimal pharmacokinetics (PK) and insufficient tumor penetration. To surmount these hurdles, we have pioneered a novel strategy, employing lipid bilayer-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (termed \"silicasomes\") as a carrier for the delivery of Nintedanib. Nintedanib, a triple PTK inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors, was encapsulated in the pores of silicasomes via a remote loading mechanism for weak bases. This innovative approach not only enhanced pharmacokinetics and intratumor drug concentrations but also orchestrated a transformative shift in the desmoplastic and immune landscape in a robust orthotopic KRAS-mediated pancreatic carcinoma (KPC) model. Our results demonstrate attenuation of vascular density and collagen content through encapsulated Nintedanib treatment, concomitant with significant augmentation of the CD8+/FoxP3+ T-cell ratio. This remodeling was notably correlated with tumor regression in the KPC model. Strikingly, the synergy between encapsulated Nintedanib and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy further potentiated the antitumor effect. Both free and encapsulated Nintedanib induced a transcriptional upregulation of PD-L1 via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In summary, our pioneering approach involving the silicasome carrier not only improved antitumor angiogenesis but also profoundly reshaped the desmoplastic stromal and immune landscape within PDAC. These insights hold excellent promise for the development of innovative combinatorial strategies in PDAC therapy.", "Keywords": ["Anti-angiogenesis", "Drug delivery", "Immunotherapy", "PTK inhibitor", "Pancreatic cancer", "Tumor stroma"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lijia", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Division of Nanomedicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Nanomedicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu-Pei", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Division of Nanomedicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Division of Nanomedicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chong Hyun", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andre E", "Last Name": "Nel", "Affiliation": "Division of Nanomedicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}], "Journal": "Nano today", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "38647615", "Title": "Hyperthermophilic pretreatment composting can reduce ammonia emissions by controlling proteolytic bacterial community and the physicochemical properties.", "Abstract": "Proteolysis is the rate-limiting step in the mineralization of organic nitrogen into ammonium (NH4+) and thereby the ammonia (NH3) released during the composting.

The results indicated that the Cu decreased the oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates in the carp, reduced the metabolic- and antioxidant-related enzyme activities and glutathione levels in the carp, and enhanced the caspase activities and reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels in the gills of the carp. Moreover, in addition to the changes in the above parameters, the Cu decreased the cell numbers and hemoglobin concentrations and increased the phosphatidylserine exposure and cytochrome c levels in the red blood cells of the carp. These results demonstrate that Cu is capable of decreasing respiratory metabolism and increasing oxidation-related lesions and apoptosis inside the gills and red blood cells of the fish. However, dietary FA quenched the Cu-induced apoptosis and oxidative lesions by reversing the same biomarker indicators, thereby suppressing the Cu-induced decrease in respiratory metabolism. Thus, FA can be used as a suppressor of Cu stress in fish.", "Keywords": ["Cu", "apoptosis", "ferulic acid", "gills", "oxidative lesion", "red blood cells", "respiratory metabolism"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huatao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province for Conservation and Utilization of Fishes Resources in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Haijing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Siyue", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Chengyan", "Last Name": "Ai", "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingting", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Archives, Neijiang Normal University, Neijiang 641100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "Journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2024Mar04"}, {"PMID": "38539271", "Title": "Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and its receptor.", "Abstract": "The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires exhibits distinct signatures associated with COVID-19 severity.

Schizochytrium is a promising alternative source of n-3 FUFA because it has enriched docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6). The aim of this study was to assess palatability, the presence of diarrhea, plasma biochemistry panels, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, and immune function in beagle dogs when supplementing a mixture of protein hydrolysate from black soldier fly larvae and schizochytrium (BSFPs) into their diets. Experiment I: 24 young beagle dogs (16 males and 8 females; 4-5 months; BW: 6.40 \u00b1 0.15 kg) were randomly divided into four groups: (1) control (CON), (2) 5% BSFPs, (3) 10% BSFPs, (4) 15% BSFPs. Their body weights and fecal scores were recorded, and blood samples were collected for analysis. Experiment II: three diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% BSFPs were evaluated by comparing them with a basal diet (CON) to evaluate palatability. These results suggested that a lower presence of diarrhea existed in the BSFP diet than the CON diet (p < 0.05). Three treatment groups remarkably increased their total protein (TP) and albumin (ALB) contents and decreased their concentrations of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in plasma (p < 0.05). Moreover, the 5% and 15% BSFPs groups had a higher calcium (CA) content in plasma, and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and contents of creatinine (CREA) and urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly reduced by supplementing BSFP in their diets (p < 0.05). Their anti-oxidative enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were dramatically enhanced, and their malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were remarkably reduced (p < 0.05). Immunoglobulin A and G (IgA and IgG) concentrations in the plasma in the 10% and 15% BSFPs groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, lower interleukin-8 (IL-8) contents were shown in the BSFP diets than the CON diet (p < 0.05). Similarly, the diets supplemented with BSFPs exhibited a positive effect on palatability (p < 0.05).

According to earlier research, ginsenoside Rb1 causes apoptosis and reduces the cell cycle. Its adverse effects, especially those on the development of the embryo, still need to be thoroughly studied. A host's lifestyle choices, including smoking, drinking too much alcohol, using tobacco products, and having an HPV infection, can increase the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), one of the most prevalent malignancies of the oral cavity. To address this challenge, this investigation focuses on the design of GRb1 for treating OSCC. In vitro cytotoxicity studies confirmed that GRb1 was more effective in PCI-9A and PCI-13 cells, with reduced toxicity in non-cancerous cells. Further verification of cellular morphology was achieved through various biochemical staining methods. The mechanism of cell death was investigated by Annexin V-FITC and PI methods. Additionally, the antimetastatic attributes of GRb1 have been evaluated using both migration scratch and Transwell migration assays, which have collectively revealed excellent antimetastatic potential. The DNA fragmentation of the PCI-9A and PCI-13 cells was assessed using a comet assay. Ginsenoside Rb1 improved ROS levels and caused mitochondrial membrane potential alterations and DNA damage, which resulted in apoptosis. OSCC administration significantly reduced the levels of SOD, GSH, GPx, and CAT, increasing the levels of PCI-9A and PCI-13 cells, while GRb1 improved this situation. Therefore, we propose that Ginsenoside Rb1 could be an alternative therapeutic strategy for OSCC therapy.", "Keywords": ["Antimetastasis", "Apoptosis", "DNA fragmentation", "Ginsenoside Rb1", "Oral squamous"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Le", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "Department of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, No.31, Longhua Road, Haikou, 570100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Anatomy and Physiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China."}, {"First Name": "Long", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, No.31, Longhua Road, Haikou, 570100, China."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, No.31, Longhua Road, Haikou, 570100, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengcheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, No.31, Longhua Road, Haikou, 570100, China.

Especially, the large accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in a diseased body will aggravate the periodontal tissue damage, and AGEs induce M1 macrophages. In this project, the novel nanodrugs, glucose-PEG-PLGA@MCC950 (GLU@MCC), are designed to achieve active targeting with the help of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) which is highly expressed in M1 macrophages induced by AGEs. Then, the nanodrugs release MCC950, which is a kind of NLRP3 inhibitor. These nanodrugs not only can improve the water solubility of MCC950 but also exhibit superior characteristics, such as small size, stability, innocuity, etc. In vivo experiments showed that GLU@MCC could reduce periodontal tissue damage and inhibit cell apoptosis in periodontitis model mice. In vitro experiments verified that its mechanism of action might be closely related to the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammatory factor in M1 macrophages. GLU@MCC could effectively reduce the damage to H400 cells caused by AGEs, decrease the expression of NLRP3, and also obviously reduce the M1-type macrophage pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, caspase-1, and TNF-\u03b1. Meanwhile, the expression of anti-inflammatory factor Arg-1 in the M2 macrophage was increased. In brief, GLU@MCC would inhibit the expression of inflammatory factor NLRP3 and exert antiperiodontal tissue damage in chronic periodontitis via GLUT1 in the M1 macrophage as the gating target.

In the feed experiment, a total of 24 adult cats (12 females and 12 males; BW: 3.02 \u00b1 0.06 kg) were randomly divided into four groups: (1) diet with chicken and fish meal as primary protein resource (CON); (2) diet with 5% BSFPs replacing chicken meal, fish meal, chicken oil, and fish oil (5% BSFPs); (3) 10% BSFPs; and (4) 15% BSFPs. The body weight and feed intake were recorded, and a blood sample was collected for analysis. In the palatability experiment, three diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% BSFPs were evaluated by comparing with CON. These results suggested that different levels of BSFPs could improve palatability in cat diets by enhancing the first sniff, the first bite, and feed intake (p < 0.05). However, no significant influence existed in body weight and average daily feed intake (p > 0.05). In comparison to the CON group, 5% and 15% BSFPs significantly increased the total protein content, and all treatment groups decreased the triglyceride content and enhanced the calcium concentration in plasma; in addition, the activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase and the content of creatinine and urea nitrogen were significantly reduced by the supplementation inclusion of BSFPs in the diets (p < 0.05). The enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase was dramatically enhanced by the supplementation of 10% and 15% BSFPs in diets compared with the CON diet, and the activity of superoxide dismutase was increased and the malondialdehyde concentration was remarkably reduced in all three treatments (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, different levels of BSFPs in the diets significantly increased the immunoglobulin A content in plasma; similarly, the immunoglobulin G concentration was significantly enhanced by the supplementation of 10% and 15% BSFPs in the diets (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the interleukin-1\u03b2 content was significantly reduced in the inclusion of 10% and 15% BSFPs in the diets, and 15% BSFPs remarkably decreased the content of interleukin-8 in plasma compared with the CON diet (p < 0.05). To sum up, the supplementation of different levels of BSFPs exhibited a positive effect on palatability and enhanced the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune capacity. Particularly, the addition levels of 10% and 15% BSFPs were more effective in antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and immunity.", "Keywords": ["anti-inflammation", "black soldier fly larvae", "cats", "palatability", "protein hydrolysate", "schizochytrium"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "You", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430023, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingkang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430023, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430023, China."}, {"First Name": "Luyang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430023, China."}, {"First Name": "Deying", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430023, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuxiao", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "P&O Biotechnology (Hubei) Co., Ltd., Wuhan 436043, China."}, {"First Name": "Haifeng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "P&O Biotechnology (Hubei) Co., Ltd., Wuhan 436043, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430023, China."}], "Journal": "Animals : an open access journal from MDPI", "PubDate": "2024Feb28"}, {"PMID": "38472914", "Title": "Effects of Supplementing Selenium-Enriched Cardamine violifolia to Laying Hens on Egg Quality and Yolk Antioxidant Capacity during Storage at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C.", "Abstract": "Oxidative stress occurs in the process of egg storage. Antioxidants as feed additives can enhance egg quality and extend the shelf life of eggs. Selenium-enriched Cardamine violifolia (SEC) has strongly antioxidant properties. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with SEC on egg quality and the yolk antioxidant capacity of eggs stored at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C. Four hundred fifty 65-week-old, Roman hens that were similar in laying rate (90.79 \u00b1 1.69%) and body weight (2.19 \u00b1 0.23 kg) were divided into 5 groups. The birds were fed diets supplemented with 0 mg/kg selenium (Se) (CON), 0.3 mg/kg Se from sodium selenite (SS), 0.3 mg/kg Se from Se-enriched yeast (SEY), 0.3 mg/kg Se for selenium-enriched Cardamine violifolia (SEC) or 0.3 mg/kg Se from Se-enriched Cardamine violifolia and 0.3 mg/kg Se from Se-enriched yeast (SEC + SEY) for 8 weeks. The eggs were collected on the 8th week and were analyzed for egg quality and oxidative stability of yolk during storage at 4 \u00b0C or 25 \u00b0C for 0, 2, 4, or 6 weeks. Dietary SEC and SEC + SEY supplementation increased the Haugh unit (HU) and albumen foam stability in eggs stored at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C (p < 0.05). SS and SEC supplementation increased the yolk index in eggs stored at 25 \u00b0C (p < 0.05). SEC or SEC + SEY slowed down an increase in albumen pH and gel firmness in eggs stored at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C (p < 0.05). Moreover, SEC or SEC + SEY alleviated the increase in malonaldehyde (MDA), and the decrease in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) level and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity in yolks stored at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C (p < 0.05).

Sirolimus not only significantly inhibits HCC recurrence but also protects renal function. However, the improvement effect of sirolimus on nontumour-related death in patients is still unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of sirolimus on nontumour-related deaths. In this study, we retrospectively enrolled 403 LT patients with HCC from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018. The median follow-up time was 47.1\u00a0months. The patients were divided into the sirolimus group (N\u2009=\u2009184) and the sirolimus-free group (N\u2009=\u2009219). There were no significant differences between the sirolimus group and the sirolimus-free group in survival (P\u2009=\u20090.054). In transplant patients who exceeded the Milan or Hangzhou criteria, the sirolimus group achieved higher survival than the sirolimus-free group (P\u2009=\u20090.005; P\u2009=\u20090.02). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that sirolimus strongly reduced the hazard ratio (HR) for nontumour-related death in LT patients who exceeded the Milan (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.18-1; P\u2009=\u20090.05) or Hangzhou criteria (HR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08-0.89; P\u2009=\u20090.032). HCC recurrence increased the risk of nontumour-related death.

Concerning the hydrazinium cyclo-pentazolate (HCP), we conduct a computational study to estimate the thermal conductivity of HCP by means of the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. To achieve that, we have customized interaction parameters based on the default OPLS force field for the HCP, as benchmarked by its crystal structure. Our simulations have revealed surprisingly anisotropic thermal conductivity for the HCP, while the thermal conductivity becomes highest roughly in the direction perpendicular tocyclo-N5-with its value notably higher than common high explosives. By modulating the interaction parameters within the HCP molecule, we have further captured a dominant role of the interaction betweencyclo-N5-in regulating the thermal conductivity of the HCP. The attractive Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential may restrict the relative motion betweencyclo-N5-, which forms a long-range order thus enhances thermal transport in the direction perpendicular tocyclo-N5-.

Addressing their roles is of significance for utilizing them to enhance agronomic traits in crops. However, our understanding of soybean RVEs is extremely limited. In the study, we investigated the expression patterns of soybean CCA1-like genes under salt stress using our RNA-Seq data. Subsequently, a salt stress-inducible gene, GmRVE8a, was chosen for further study. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GmRVE8a is most closely related to Arabidopsis RVE4 and RVE8. Also, GmRVE8a showed circadian expression pattern with 24\u00a0h rhythmic period, suggesting that it might be a clock-regulated gene. Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis lines over-expressing GmRVE8a were generated. It was observed that ectopic over-expression of GmRVE8a caused a significant delay in flowering. Further observation indicated that under salt and drought stress, transgenic seedlings were stronger than wild type. Consistently, three-week-old transgenic plants grew better than wild type under salt and drought conditions, and the MDA content in transgenic lines was significantly lower than wild type, suggesting that GmRVE8a might be a positive regulator in response to salt and drought stress. Intriguingly, Y2H assay indicated that GmRVE8a physically interacted with a drought-tolerant protein, GmNAC17.

To solve the above problems, we propose a novel graph-based semi-supervised deep clustering method for image clustering. First, the parity cross-convolutional feature extraction and fusion module is used to extract high-quality image features. Then, the clustering constraint layer is designed to improve the clustering efficiency. And, the output layer is customized to achieve unsupervised regularization training. Finally, the adjacency matrix is inferred by actual network prediction. A graph-based regularization method is adopted for unsupervised training networks.

Extracellular ATP is a strong activator of NLRP3 by inducing K+ efflux as a key signaling event, suggesting that K+-permeable ion channels could have high therapeutic potential. In microglia, these include ATP-gated THIK-1\u00a0K+ channels and P2X7 receptors, but their interactions and potential therapeutic role in the human brain are unknown. Using a novel specific inhibitor of THIK-1 in combination with patch-clamp electrophysiology in slices of human neocortex, we found that THIK-1 generated the main tonic K+ conductance in microglia that sets the resting membrane potential. Extracellular ATP stimulated K+ efflux in a concentration-dependent manner only via P2X7 and metabotropic potentiation of THIK-1. We further demonstrated that activation of P2X7 was mandatory for ATP-evoked IL-1\u03b2 release, which was strongly suppressed by blocking THIK-1. Surprisingly, THIK-1 contributed only marginally to the total K+ conductance in the presence of ATP, which was dominated by P2X7. This suggests a previously unknown, K+-independent mechanism of THIK-1 for NLRP3 activation. Nuclear sequencing revealed almost selective expression of THIK-1 in human brain microglia, while P2X7 had a much broader expression. Thus, inhibition of THIK-1 could be an effective and, in contrast to P2X7, microglia-specific therapeutic strategy to contain neuroinflammation.", "Keywords": ["Human brain", "Ion channels", "Microglia", "Neocortex", "Neuroinflammation", "Pharmacology", "Purinergic signalling"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Microglia", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Ion Channels", "Adenosine Triphosphate", "Receptors, Purinergic P2X7"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Rifat", "Affiliation": "Institute of Neurophysiology, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Bernardino", "Last Name": "Ossola", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Roland W", "Last Name": "B\u00fcrli", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Lee A", "Last Name": "Dawson", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Nicola L", "Last Name": "Brice", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Rowland", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Lizio", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Keith", "Last Name": "Page", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Pawel", "Last Name": "Fidzinski", "Affiliation": "Berlin Institute of Health at Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Onken", "Affiliation": "Berlin Institute of Health at Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Holtkamp", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Epilepsy-Center Berlin-Brandenburg, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Frank L", "Last Name": "Heppner", "Affiliation": "Neurocure Cluster of Excellence, Neuroscience Clinical Research Center, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "J\u00f6rg R P", "Last Name": "Geiger", "Affiliation": "Institute of Neurophysiology, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Madry", "Affiliation": "Institute of Neurophysiology, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Charit\u00e9platz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany. christian.madry@charite.de."}], "Journal": "Journal of neuroinflammation", "PubDate": "2024Feb26"}, {"PMID": "38401150", "Title": "Excessive iron deposition in root apoplast is involved in growth arrest of roots in response to low pH.", "Abstract": "The rhizotoxicity of protons (H+) in acidic soils is a fundamental constraint that results in serious yield losses.

Here, by we analyse of a chromosome-level assembly of a female crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), a typical core waterbird. We identify neo-sex chromosomes resulting from fusion of microchromosomes with ancient sex chromosomes. These fusion events likely occurred following the divergence of Threskiornithidae and Ardeidae. The neo-W chromosome of the crested ibis exhibits the characteristics of slow degradation, which is reflected in its retention of abundant gametologous genes. Neo-W chromosome genes display an apparent ovary-biased gene expression, which is largely driven by genes that are retained on the crested ibis W chromosome but lost in other bird species.

However, their therapeutic potential in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) has not been explored. Herein, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, we found that ubiquitin-specific protease 21 (USP21) was upregulated in CCA, high USP21 level was associated with poor prognosis. In vivo and in vitro, we identified USP21 as a master regulator of CCA growth and maintenance, which directly interacted with deubiquitinates and stabilized the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) through K48-linked deubiquitination, and in turn, this stabilization increased HIF1A expression, thus upregulating key glycolytic enzyme genes ENO2, ENO3, ALDOC, ACSS2, and then promoted aerobic glycolysis, which provided energy for CCA cell proliferation. In addition, USP21 could directly stabilize alpha-Enolase 1 (ENO1) to promote aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, increased USP21 level enhanced chemotherapy resistance to the gemcitabine-based regimen.

Among them, red blood cell-derived EVs (RBC-EVs) have attracted great attention due to their abundant sources and low risks of gene transfer (RBC-EVs lack nuclear and mitochondrial DNA). Here, we first revealed the high expression level of membrane protein solute carrier family 4 member 1 (SLC4A1) in RBC-EVs through proteomic analysis. We then identified several binding peptides with high affinity for the SLC4A1 extracellular domain (SLC4A1-EC) from phage display library screening. A high affinity of SLC4A1-EC and the three peptides (XRB2, XRE4, and XRH7) were assessed in vitro using surface plasmon resonance analysis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The binding sites of SLC4A1-EC and polypeptides were further predicted by LigPlot + analysis, and the results showed that these three polypeptides could bind to part of the hydrophobic residues of SLC4A1-EC. The binding efficiency of the anchor peptides to the RBC-EVs was further verified by flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging. In conclusion, we successfully screened three specific RBC-EV-targeting peptides which could potentially be utilized for isolating RBC-derived EVs from serum samples. More importantly, this peptide could be coupled with targeting peptides to modify RBC-EVs for drug delivery. Our work will provide a viable method for optimizing the function of RBC-EVs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Limei", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Orthopedic Technology, Shenzhen 518035, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Orthopedic Technology, Shenzhen 518035, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin 999077, Hong Kong SAR, China."}, {"First Name": "Huawei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Yujie", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Shenzhen Institute of Mental Health, Shenzhen Mental Health Center, ShenzhenKangning Hospital, Shenzhen 518020, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Orthopedic Technology, Shenzhen 518035, Guangdong, China."}], "Journal": "ACS omega", "PubDate": "2024Feb13"}, {"PMID": "38371735", "Title": "Retrospective study for correlation analysis of nutritional status with osteoporosis, sarcopenia and cognitive impairment in elderly patients with coronary heart disease.", "Abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is an abbreviation of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, which remains challenging for diagnosis and treatment. Current study aims to explore the correlation between geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and osteoporosis, sarcopenia, cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients with CHD, and to analyze the clinical diagnostic value of GNRI in the above complications. A total of 92 elderly patients with CHD treated in Suzhou Ninth People's Hospital from January 2020 to October 2023 were retrospectively collected as the experimental group, and 68 non-CHD subjects matched for sex and age in the same period of physical examination were randomly selected as the control group. Osteoporosis, sarcopenia and cognitive dysfunction were analyzed in all patients, and the correlation between GNRI and these indices in different populations was analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation. The diagnostic efficacy of GNRI in osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and cognitive impairment was analyzed by ROC curves. There was no significant difference in age, sex distribution, body mass index (BMI) and serum biological indexes between the elderly patients with CHD and the control group (all P\u2009>\u20090.05). Correlation analysis showed that GNRI level was positively correlated with bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD) T value and osteocalcin (OCN) (All r\u2009>\u20090, P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Based on these studies, combination thrombolytic therapy with intravenous tPA and m-proUK has been suggested as a promising treatment for patients with ischemic stroke. This paper evaluates the efficacy and safety of the dual therapy by computational simulations of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics coupled with a local fibrinolysis model. Seven dose regimens are simulated and compared with the standard intravenous tPA monotherapy. Our simulation results provide more insights into the complementary reaction mechanisms of tPA and m-proUK during clot lysis and demonstrate that the dual therapy can achieve a similar recanalization time (about 50\u00a0min) to tPA monotherapy, while keeping the circulating fibrinogen level within a normal range. Specifically, our results show that for all dual therapies with a 5\u00a0mg tPA bolus, the plasma concentration of fibrinogen remains stable at around 7.5\u00a0\u03bcM after a slow depletion over 50\u00a0min, whereas a rapid depletion of circulating fibrinogen (to 5\u00a0\u03bcM) is observed with the standard tPA therapy, indicating the potential advantage of dual therapy in reducing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Through simulations of varying dose combinations, it has been found that increasing tPA bolus can significantly affect fibrinogen level but only moderately improves recanalization time. Conversely, m-proUK doses and infusion duration exhibit a mild impact on fibrinogen level but significantly affect recanalization time. Therefore, future optimization of dose regimen should focus on limiting the tPA bolus while adjusting m-proUK dosage and infusion rate. Such adjustments could potentially maximize the therapeutic advantages of this combination therapy for ischemic stroke treatment.", "Keywords": ["Combination therapy", "Computational model", "Ischemic stroke", "Pharmacodynamics", "Pharmacokinetics", "Pro-urokinase", "Thrombolysis", "Tissue plasminogen activator"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator", "Fibrinolysis", "Ischemic Stroke", "Fibrinolytic Agents", "Thrombolytic Therapy", "Fibrinogen", "Stroke", "Recombinant Proteins", "Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yilin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom.

However, the specific mechanism and potential clinical therapeutic significance remain vague. This study attempts to profile the regulatory networks of circRNA and RBP using a multi-omics approach. Has_circ_0006646 (circ0006646) is an unreported circRNA in HCC and is associated with a poor prognosis. Silencing of circ0006646 significantly hinders metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, circ0006646 prevents the interaction between nucleolin (NCL) and the E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing 21 to reduce the proteasome-mediated degradation of NCL via K48-linked polyubiquitylation.

An alternative treatment is aortic valve neocuspidization which is a relatively new reparative procedure whereby the three aortic cusps are replaced with patient pericardium or bovine tissues. Recent research indicates that aortic blood flow is disturbed, and turbulence effects have yet to be evaluated in either bioprosthetic or aortic valve neocuspidization valve types in patient-specific settings. The aim of this study is to better understand turbulence production in the aorta and evaluate its effects on laminar and turbulent wall shear stress. Four patients with aortic valve disease were treated with either bioprosthetic valves (n=2) or aortic valve neocuspidization valvular repair (n=2). Aortic geometries were segmented from magnetic resonance images (MRI), and 4D flow MRI was used to derive physiological inlet and outlet boundary conditions. Pulsatile large-eddy simulations were performed to capture the full range of laminar, transitional and turbulence characteristics in the aorta. Turbulence was produced in all aortas with highest levels occurring during systolic deceleration. In the ascending aorta, turbulence production is attributed to a combination of valvular skew, valvular eccentricity, and ascending aortic dilation. In the proximal descending thoracic aorta, turbulence production is dependent on the type of arch-descending aorta connection (e.g., a narrowing or sharp bend) which induces flow separation. Laminar and turbulent wall shear stresses are of similar magnitude throughout late systolic deceleration and diastole, although turbulent wall shear stress magnitudes exceed laminar wall shear stresses between 27.3% and 61.1% of the cardiac cycle. This emphasises the significance of including turbulent wall shear stress to improve our comprehension of progressive arterial wall diseases. The findings of this study recommend that aortic valve treatments should prioritise minimising valvular eccentricity and skew in order to mitigate turbulence generation.", "Keywords": ["Aortic valve neocuspidization", "Aortic valve replacement", "Bioprosthesis", "Blood flow", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Haemodynamics", "Large-eddy simulation", "Ozaki procedure", "Turbulence", "Wall shear stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Animals", "Cattle", "Aortic Valve", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Hemodynamics", "Aorta", "Aortic Valve Disease", "Stress, Mechanical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily Louise", "Last Name": "Manchester", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Fluids and Environment, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.

K. pneumoniae in this biofilm state demonstrates remarkable resistance, evades immune system attacks, and poses challenges for complete eradication, thereby complicating clinical anti-infection efforts. Moreover, the precise mechanisms governing biofilm formation and disruption remain elusive. Recent studies have discovered that fingolimod (FLD) exhibits biofilm properties against Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, the antibiofilm properties of FLD were evaluated against multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae in this study. The antibiofilm activity of FLD against K. pneumoniae was assessed utilizing the Alamar Blue assay along with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and crystal violet (CV) staining. The results showed that FLD effectively reduced biofilm formation, exopolysaccharide (EPS), motility, and bacterial abundance within K. pneumoniae biofilms without impeding its growth and metabolic activity. Furthermore, the inhibitory impact of FLD on the production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signaling molecules was identified, thereby demonstrating its notable anti-quorum sensing (QS) properties. The results of qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that FLD significantly decreased the expression of genes associated with the efflux pump gene (AcrB, kexD, ketM, kdeA, and kpnE), outer membrane (OM) porin proteins (OmpK35, OmpK36), the quorum-sensing (QS) system (luxS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production (wzm), and EPS production (pgaA). Simultaneously, FLD exhibited evident antibacterial synergism, leading to an increased survival rate of G. mellonella infected with MDR K. pneumoniae.

Owing to a great number of publicly accessible GWAS summary statistics, and the difficulty in obtaining individual-level genotype data, many existing gene-based association tests have been adapted to require only GWAS summary statistics rather than individual-level data. However, these association tests are restricted to unrelated individuals and thus do not apply to family samples directly. Moreover, due to its flexibility and effectiveness, the linear mixed model has been increasingly utilized in GWAS to handle correlated data, such as family samples. However, it remains unknown how to perform gene-based association tests in family samples using the GWAS summary statistics estimated from the linear mixed model. In this study, we show that, when family size is negligible compared to the total sample size, the diagonal block structure of the kinship matrix makes it possible to approximate the correlation matrix of marginal Z scores by linkage disequilibrium matrix. Based on this result, current methods utilizing summary statistics for unrelated individuals can be directly applied to family data without any modifications. Our simulation results demonstrate that this proposed strategy controls the type 1 error rate well in various situations.

Barley seed germination, particularly in increasingly saline soils, is key to ensure the safety of crop production. However, the mechanism of salt-affected seed germination in barley remains elusive. Here, two different colored barley varieties were used to independently study the regulation mechanism of salt tolerance during barley seed germination. High salinity delays barley seed germination by slowing down starch mobilization efficiency in seeds. The starch plate test revealed that salinity had a significant inhibitory effect on \u03b1-amylase activity in barley seeds. Further, NaCl treatment down-regulated the expression of Amy1, Amy2 and Amy3 genes in germinated seeds, thereby inhibiting \u03b1-amylase activity. In addition, the result of embryogenic culture system in vitro showed that the shoot elongation of barley was significantly inhibited by salt stress. These findings indicate that it is a feasible idea to study the regulation mechanism of salinity on barley seed germination and embryo growth from the aspect of starch-related source-sink communication.", "Keywords": ["barley", "salinity", "seed germination", "starch mobilization", "\u03b1\u2010Amylase activity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "College of Marine and Biology Engineering Yancheng Institute of Technology Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "College of Marine and Biology Engineering Yancheng Institute of Technology Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Zhou", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "College of Marine and Biology Engineering Yancheng Institute of Technology Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "College of Marine and Biology Engineering Yancheng Institute of Technology Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Yuxiang", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "College of Marine and Biology Engineering Yancheng Institute of Technology Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Huiquan", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Coastal Area Institute of Agricultural Sciences Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Coastal Area Institute of Agricultural Sciences Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Changya", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Yancheng Grain and Oil Crop Technical Guidance Station Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "College of Marine and Biology Engineering Yancheng Institute of Technology Yancheng Jiangsu China."}, {"First Name": "Gongneng", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "College of Marine and Biology Engineering Yancheng Institute of Technology Yancheng Jiangsu China."}], "Journal": "Plant direct", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "38310085", "Title": "Combination of serum alpha-fetoprotein, PIVKA-\u2161 and glypican-3 in diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "To assess the value of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-\u2161 (PIVKA-\u2161) and glypican-3 (GPC-3) in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).", "Keywords": ["Alpha-fetoprotein", "Diagnosis", "Glypican-3", "Hepatocellular carcinoma", "Meta-analysis", "Protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-\u2161", "Serum markers"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "alpha-Fetoproteins", "Biomarkers", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Glypicans", "Liver Neoplasms", "Protein Precursors", "Prothrombin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hongliang", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China. shl2399@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Jianguo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongfeng", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Fourth Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China. kaiw3@zju.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Xiaobo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. wxb2310@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. zjxu@zju.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

In recent years, many other effects of metformin have been discovered. In this review, we provide the research advances in metformin in liver disease. High-dose metformin can activate AMPK by inhibiting mitochondrial complex 1. In addition, low-dose metformin could activate lysosomal AMPK through PEN2. Activated AMPK can reduce fatty acid synthesis, inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis, and reshape the tumor microenvironment.

With the continued increase in complexity and scale, the need for an accurate and efficient simulation environment compatible with photonics and electronics becomes paramount. This paper introduces a method using the Verilog-A hardware language in the electronic design automation (EDA) platform to create equivalent circuit and compact models for photonic devices, considering their dispersion, polarization, multimode, and bidirectional transmission characteristics. These models can be co-simulated alongside electrical components in the electronic simulator, covering both the time and frequency domains simultaneously. Model parameters can be modified at any stage of the design process. Using the full link of an optoelectronic transceiver as an example, analyses from our Verilog-A model system show a mean absolute percentage error of 1.55% in the time-domain and 0.0318% in the frequency-domain when compared to the commercial co-simulation system (e.g., Virtuoso-INTERCONNECT). This underscores the accuracy and efficiency of our approach in OEICs design.

The exact interplay between stress and liver diseases remains unclear. Autophagy plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis, and recent studies indicate tight crosstalk between stress and autophagy in liver diseases. Once the balance between damage and autophagy is broken, autophagy can no longer resist injury or maintain homeostasis. In recent years, FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21)-induced autophagy has attracted much attention. FGF21 is regarded as a stress hormone and can be up-regulated by an abundance of signaling pathways in response to stress. Also, increased FGF21 activates autophagy by a complicated signaling network in which mTOR plays a pivotal role. This review summarizes the mechanism of FGF21-mediated autophagy and its derived application in the defense of stress in liver diseases and offers a glimpse into its promising prospect in future clinical practice.", "Keywords": ["Autophagy", "Fibroblast growth factor 21", "Liver diseases", "Stress"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Modan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Chiyu", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Huigang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyu", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianyong", "Last Name": "Zhuo", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Zuyuan", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhihang", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310058, China."}], "Journal": "Genes & diseases", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "38285095", "Title": "Impact of preoperative infection on the outcomes of liver transplant recipients: a national propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study in China.", "Abstract": "Impact of preoperative infection on liver transplantation (LT) needs further investigation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Female", "Propensity Score", "Middle Aged", "China", "Retrospective Studies", "Postoperative Complications", "Adult", "Risk Factors", "Preoperative Period", "Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ze", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Yisu", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jianrong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Surgical Intensive Care Unit, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou."}, {"First Name": "Chenhao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Zhisheng", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "National Center for Healthcare Quality Management in Liver Transplant."}, {"First Name": "Jiarui", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Renyi", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Wenzhi", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Zhengyang", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province."}, {"First Name": "Xuyong", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jiayin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Liver Surgery, Liver Transplantation Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatic Surgery and Liver Transplantation Center."}, {"First Name": "Shusen", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "NHC Key Laboratory of Combined Multi-organ Transplantation."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine."}], "Journal": "International journal of surgery (London, England)", "PubDate": "2024Apr01"}, {"PMID": "38280847", "Title": "Targeted immunotherapy: harnessing the immune system to battle multiple myeloma.", "Abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable hematological malignancy disease characterized by the progressive dysfunction of the patient's immune system.

To obtain fundamental understanding and predict molecular design rules of the polymer antibody, we analyze the complex structure between the biomarker protein epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and a series of polymer ligands via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For monomeric ligands, strong enrichment of aromatic residues in protein binding sites is revealed, in line with the reported observations for natural antibodies. Yet, for linear polymers with a growing degree of polymerization, for the first time, a drastic change is revealed on the type of enriched protein residues and the location of protein binding sites, driven by the increasing steric hindrance effect that makes the adsorption of the polymer in the protein exterior feasible. Varying the polymer length and monomeric composition also significantly affects the ligand binding affinity. Here, we have captured three distinct dependences of the ligand binding free energy on the degree of polymerization: for NIPAm based hydrophilic polymers, TBAm dominated hydrophobic polymers and AAc dominated charged polymers. These results can be rationalized by the complex structure and the composition of protein residues at the binding interface. The entire analysis demonstrates unique binding features for polymer ligands and the possibility to modulate their binding sites and affinity by engineering the polymer structure.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Polymers", "Ligands", "Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Adsorption"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Menghan", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, 200 Xiao Ling Wei, Nanjing 210094, P.

Nevertheless, effectively and conveniently integrating compatible shielding functions into fabrics while maintaining breathability and moisture permeability remains a significant challenge. Here, we take hydrophilic PVA-co-PE nanofibrous film-coated PET fabric (NFs/PET) as a flexible substrate and deposit a dielectric/conductive (SiO2/Al) bilayer film via magnetron sputtering. This strategy endows the fabric surface with high electrical conductivity, nanoscale roughness comparable to visible and infrared waves, and a dielectric-metal contact interface possessing localized plasmon resonance and Mie scattering effects. The results demonstrate that the optimized SiO2/Al/NFs/PET composite conductive fabric (referred to as S4-1) possesses favorable X-band electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (50 dB) as well as excellent long-wave infrared (LWIR) shielding or IR stealth performance (IR emissivity of 0.60). Notably, the S4-1 fabric has a cooling effect of about 12.4 \u00b0C for a heat source (80 \u00b0C) and an insulating effect of about 17.2 \u00b0C for a cold source (-20 \u00b0C), showing excellent shielding capability for heat conduction and heat radiations. Moreover, the moisture permeability of the S4-1 fabric is about 300 g/(m2\u00b7h), which is better than the requirement concerning moisture permeability for wearable fabrics (\u22652500-5000 g/(m2\u00b724 h)), indicating excellent heat and moisture comfort. In short, our fabrics have lightweight, thin, moisture-permeable and excellent shielding performance, which provides novel ideas for the development of wearable multi-band shielding fabrics applied to complex electromagnetic environments.", "Keywords": ["conductive fabrics", "electromagnetic shielding interference", "infrared stealth", "infrared\u2013thermal radiation", "multi-band compatible shielding", "thermal\u2013moisture comfort"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiongzhen", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Mengya", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Liyan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuedan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Mufang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Textile Fiber and Products, Ministry of Education, Wuhan Textile University, Wuhan 430200, China."}], "Journal": "Polymers", "PubDate": "2023Dec19"}, {"PMID": "38197976", "Title": "Identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets of kidney stone disease using bioinformatics.", "Abstract": "Kidney stone disease (KSD) is a common urological disease, but its pathogenesis remains unclear.

However, accurately detecting esterase activity within mitochondria poses challenges due to its ubiquitous presence in cells and the uncontrolled localization of fluorogenic probes. To overcome this hurdle and reveal variations among different mitochondria, we isolated mitochondria and preserved their activity and functionality in a buffered environment. Subsequently, we utilized a laboratory-built nano-flow cytometer in conjunction with an esterase-responsive calcein-AM fluorescent probe to measure the esterase activity of individual mitochondria. This approach enabled us to investigate the influence of temperature, pH, metal ions, and various compounds on the mitochondrial esterase activity without any interference from other cellular constituents. Interestingly, we observed a decline in the mitochondrial esterase activity following the administration of mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors. Furthermore, we found that mitochondrial esterase activity was notably higher in the presence of a high concentration of ATP compared to that of ADP and AMP. Additionally, we noticed a correlation between elevated levels of complex IV and increased mitochondrial esterase activity. These findings suggest a functional connection between the mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitochondrial esterase activity. Moreover, we detected an upsurge in mitochondrial esterase activity during the early stages of apoptosis, while cellular esterase activity decreased. This highlights the significance of analyzing enzyme activity within specific organelle subregions. In summary, the integration of a nano-flow cytometer and fluorescent dyes introduces a novel method for quantifying mitochondrial enzyme activity with the potential to uncover the alterations and

Since the dissipation mechanism in terahertz band usually focuses on electronic conduction loss, almost all terahertz absorbers are constructed with electronically conducting materials being opaque, which limits their applications in scenarios requiring high visible transmittance. Here, we demonstrate a transparent terahertz absorber based on permittivity-gradient elastomer-encapsulated-organohydrogel. Our organohydrogel-based terahertz absorber exhibits a high absorbing property (average reflection loss of 49.03\u2009dB) in 0.5-4.5\u2009THz band with a thin thickness of 700\u2009\u03bcm and a high average visible transmittance of 85.51%.

Although alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is an established model organism for forage development, the understanding of YTH proteins in alfalfa is still limited. In the present investigation, 53 putative YTH genes, each encoding a YT521 domain-containing protein, were identified within the alfalfa genome. These genes were categorized into two subfamilies: YTHDF (49 members) and YTHDC (four members). Each subfamily demonstrates analogous motif distributions and domain architectures. Specifically, proteins encoded by MsYTHDF genes incorporate a single domain structure, while those corresponding to MsYTH5, 8, 12, 16 who are identified as members of the MsYTHDC subfamily, exhibit CCCH-type zinc finger repeats at their N-termini. It is also observed that the predicted aromatic cage pocket that binds the m6A residue of MsYTHDC consists of a sequence of two tryptophan residues and one tyrosine residue (WWY). Conversely, in MsYTHDF, the binding pocket comprises two highly conserved tryptophan residues and either one tryptophan residue (WWW) or tyrosine residue (WWY) in MsYTHDF.Through comparative analysis of qRT-PCR data, we observed distinct expression patterns in specific genes under abiotic stress, indicating their potential regulatory roles. Notably, five genes (MsYTH2, 14, 26, 27, 48) consistently exhibit upregulation, and two genes (MsYTH33, 35) are downregulated in response to both cold and salt stress. This suggests a common mechanism among these YTH proteins in response to various abiotic stressors in alfalfa. Further, integrating qRT-PCR with RNA-seq data revealed that MsYTH2, MsYTH14, and MsYTH16 are highly expressed in leaves at various development stages, underscoring their potential roles in regulating the growth of these plant parts. The obtained findings shed further light on the biological functions of MsYTH genes and may aid in the selection of suitable candidate genes for future genetic enhancement endeavors aimed at improving salt and cold tolerance in alfalfa.", "Keywords": ["Alfalfa", "Cold stress", "Gene family", "Salt", "YTH domain", "m6A methylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Medicago sativa", "Tryptophan", "RNA, Messenger", "Tyrosine", "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant", "Phylogeny"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shugao", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ludong University, Yantai, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ludong University, Yantai, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianmin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ludong University, Yantai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanling", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ludong University, Yantai, China. yinyl0605@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Ludong University, Yantai, China. yzhaosoils@gmail.com."}], "Journal": "BMC genomics", "PubDate": "2024Jan02"}, {"PMID": "38165498", "Title": "Effectiveness of a Biofeedback Intervention Targeting Mental and Physical Health Among College Students Through Speech and Physiology as Biomarkers Using Machine Learning: A Randomized Controlled Trial.", "Abstract": "Biofeedback therapy is mainly based on the analysis of physiological features to improve an individual's affective state. There are insufficient objective indicators to assess symptom improvement after biofeedback. In addition to psychological and physiological features, speech features can precisely convey information about emotions. The use of speech features can improve the objectivity of psychiatric assessments. Therefore, biofeedback based on subjective symptom scales, objective speech, and physiological features to evaluate efficacy provides a new approach for early screening and treatment of emotional problems in college students. A 4-week, randomized, controlled, parallel biofeedback therapy study was conducted with college students with symptoms of anxiety or depression. Speech samples, physiological samples, and clinical symptoms were collected at baseline and at the end of treatment, and the extracted speech features and physiological features were used for between-group comparisons and correlation analyses between the biofeedback and wait-list groups. Based on the speech features with differences between the biofeedback intervention and wait-list groups, an artificial neural network was used to predict the therapeutic effect and response after biofeedback therapy. Through biofeedback therapy, improvements in depression (p\u2009=\u20090.001), anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.001), insomnia (p\u2009=\u20090.013), and stress (p\u2009=\u20090.004) severity were observed in college-going students (n\u2009=\u200952). The speech and physiological features in the biofeedback group also changed significantly compared to the waitlist group (n\u2009=\u200952) and were related to the change in symptoms. The energy parameters and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of speech features can predict whether biofeedback intervention effectively improves anxiety and insomnia symptoms and treatment response. The accuracy of the classification model built using the artificial neural network (ANN) for treatment response and non-response was approximately 60%. The results of this study provide valuable information about biofeedback in improving the mental health of college-going students. The study identified speech features, such as the energy parameters, and MFCC as more accurate and objective indicators for tracking biofeedback therapy response and predicting efficacy.

Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by an accelerated loss of skeletal muscle (SM) mass that may be age-related or the result of malnutrition in cancer patients (Cruz-Jentoft and Sayer, 2019). Preoperative sarcopenia in HCC patients treated with hepatectomy or liver transplantation is an independent risk factor for poor survival (Voron et al., 2015; van Vugt et al., 2016). Previous studies have used various criteria to define sarcopenia, including muscle area and density. However, the lack of standardized diagnostic methods for sarcopenia limits their clinical use. In 2018, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) renewed a consensus on the definition of sarcopenia: low muscle strength, loss of muscle quantity, and poor physical performance (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). Radiological imaging-based measurement of muscle quantity or mass is most commonly used to evaluate the degree of sarcopenia. The gold standard is to measure the SM and/or psoas muscle (PM) area using abdominal computed tomography (CT) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3), as it is linearly correlated to whole-body SM mass (van Vugt et al., 2016). According to a \"North American Expert Opinion Statement on Sarcopenia,\" SM index (SMI) is the preferred measure of sarcopenia (Carey et al., 2019).

Using an adeno-associated virus (AAV), we achieved local chronic overproduction of IL-10 in the CSG, left stellate ganglion (LSG). As a result, in the IL-10 group, we observed a decreased number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) cells in the LSG. IL-10 markedly downregulated the nerve growth factor, synaptophysin, as well as growth-associated protein 43 expression. In vivo, results from ambulatory electrocardiography showed that IL-10 overexpression significantly inhibited the cardiac sympathetic nervous system activity and improved heart rate variability. Meanwhile, we observed decreased LSG function as well as prolonged ventricular effective refractory period and suppressed VA after myocardial infarction (MI) in the IL-10 group. In addition, IL-10 overexpression attenuated inflammation and decreased norepinephrine levels in the myocardium after acute MI.

Inhibiting GLUT1 decreases tumor cell proliferation and induces tumor cell damage. Natural GLUT1 inhibitors have been studied only to a small extent, and the structures of known natural GLUT1 inhibitors are limited to a few classes of natural products. Therefore, discovering and researching other natural GLUT1 inhibitors with novel scaffolds are essential. Physalis angulata L. var. villosa is a plant known as Mao-Ku-Zhi (MKZ). Withanolides are the main phytochemical components of MKZ. MKZ extracts and the components of MKZ exhibited antitumor activity in recent pharmacological studies. However, the antitumor-active components of MKZ and their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. A cell membrane-biomimetic nanoplatform (CM@Fe3O4/MIL-101) was used for target separation of potential GLUT1 inhibitors from MKZ. A new withanolide, physagulide Y (2), together with six known withanolides (1, 3-7), was identified as a potential GLUT1 inhibitor. Physagulide Y was the most potent GLUT1 inhibitor, and its antitumor activity and possible mechanism of action were explored in MCF-7 human cancer cells.

The aim of the current study was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis to determine the global prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes of osteosarcopenia. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022351229). PubMed, Cochrane, Medline and Embase were searched from inception to February 2023 to retrieve eligible observational population-based studies. Pooled osteosarcopenia prevalence was calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI), and subgroup analyses were performed. The risk factor of osteosarcopenia and its association with clinical outcomes were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR), respectively. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 test. Study quality was assessed using validated instruments matched to study designs. The search identified 55\u00a0158 studies, and 66 studies (64\u00a0404 participants, mean age from 46.6 to 93\u00a0years) were analysed in the final analysis, including 48 cross-sectional studies, 17 cohort studies and 1 case-control study.

The study investigated the molecular process and the role of microRNA (miR)-29a-3p in NP. Peripheral blood was collected from NP patients and healthy newborns. Human lung fibroblasts cell line (WI-38) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) to establish a cellular model for NP. Then, miR-29a-3p and Kr\u00fcppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) levels were detected by RT-qPCR or Western blot. The relationship between miR-29a-3p and KLF4 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell survival was assessed using the CCK-8 assay, whereas the levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 were quantified using ELISA. Additionally, apoptosis was evaluated through flow cytometry. Meanwhile, Bax and Bcl-2 were detected by RT-qPCR. Neonatal rats were administered LPS intraperitoneally (3 mg/kg) to induce NP, and pathological injury and inflammatory reaction were analyzed. MiR-29a-3p was elevated but KLF4 was silenced in NP patient's serum, LPS-treated WI-38 cell line, and LPS-treated newborn rats. Silence of miR-29a-3p or elevation of KLF4 constrained cell proliferation with inflammation of LPS-treated WI-38 cell line. MiR-29a-3p immediately targeted KLF4.

It is an effective method to improve the disease resistance of wheat plants by molecular breeding. With the continuous development of sequencing technology, long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been discovered in many eukaryotes and act as key regulators of many cellular processes. In this study, 12 sets of RNA-seq data from wheat leaves pre- and post-pathogen infection were analyzed and 2,266 candidate lincRNAs were identified. Consistent with previous findings, lincRNA has shorter length and fewer exons than mRNA. The results of differential expression analysis showed that 486 DE-lincRNAs were selected as lincRNAs that could respond to powdery mildew stress. Since lincRNAs may be functionally related to their adjacent target genes, the target genes of these lincRNAs were predicted, and the GO and KEGG functional annotations of the predicted target genes were performed. Integrating the functions of target genes and the biological processes in which they were involved uncovered 23 lincRNAs that may promote or inhibit the occurrence of wheat powdery mildew. Co-expression patterns of lincRNAs with their adjacent mRNAs showed that some lincRNAs showed significant correlation with the expression patterns of their potential target genes.

Here, hepatocyte-specific gp78 knockout (HKO) or overexpressed (OE) mice were generated to examine the effect of gp78 on liver IRI, and a multi-omics approach (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) was performed to explore the potential mechanism. Gp78 expression decreased after reperfusion in LT patients and mice with IRI, and gp78 expression was positively correlated with liver damage. Gp78 absence from hepatocytes alleviated liver damage in mice with IRI, ameliorating inflammation. However, mice with hepatic gp78 overexpression showed the opposite phenotype. Mechanistically, gp78 overexpression disturbed lipid homeostasis, remodeling polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism, causing oxidized lipids accumulation and ferroptosis, partly by promoting ACSL4 expression.

The results showed dysbiosis in the gut microbiota of patients with PJS, and decreased synthesis of short-chain fatty acids. Bacteroides was positively correlated with maximum polyp length, while Agathobacter was negatively correlated with age of onset. In addition, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were positively correlated with the age of onset but negatively correlated with the number of polyps. Furthermore, the butyric acid level was negatively correlated with the frequency of endoscopic surgeries. In contrast, we compared the gut microbiota of STK11-positive and STK11-negative patients with PJS for the first time, but 16\u00a0S sequencing analysis revealed no significant differences. Finally, we established a random forest prediction model based on the gut microbiota characteristics of patients to provide a basis for the targeted diagnosis and treatment of PJS in the future.", "Keywords": ["Benign polyps", "Gut microbiota", "Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome", "Serine/threonine kinase 11", "Short chain fatty acids"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Fatty Acids, Volatile", "Butyrates"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "An", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuhong", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Air Force Medical Center, Beijing, 100142, China."}, {"First Name": "Shengpeng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Lingyi", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Dianji", "Last Name": "Tu", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Sumin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunxuan", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaojie", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China."}, {"First Name": "Shoubin", "Last Name": "Ning", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Air Force Medical Center, Beijing, 100142, China. shoubinning@126.com."}, {"First Name": "Shiming", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China. 13228686589@163.com."}], "Journal": "BMC microbiology", "PubDate": "2023Nov30"}, {"PMID": "38031751", "Title": "Examining the Distribution of Bone Bruise Patterns in Contact and Noncontact Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries: Letter to the Editor.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament", "Knee Joint", "Contusions", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caining", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuanmin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The American journal of sports medicine", "PubDate": "2023Dec"}, {"PMID": "38030304", "Title": "TP53/mTORC1-mediated bidirectional regulation of PD-L1 modulates immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.", "Abstract": "Immunotherapy has facilitated great breakthroughs in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

In view of the above shortcomings, a horizontal federated DPC (HFDPC) is proposed. First, HFDPC introduces the idea of horizontal federated learning and proposes a protection mechanism for client parameter transmission. Second, DPC is improved by using similar density chain (SDC) to alleviate the \"Domino\" effect caused by multiple local peaks in the flow pattern dataset. Finally, a novel data dimension reduction and image encryption are used to improve the effectiveness of data partitioning.

majority of extinct vertebrates in the past few centuries. To date, the evolutionary characteristics of island endemic bird's is poorly known. In this research, we de novo assembled a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for the Swinhoe's pheasant, which is a typical endemic island bird. Results of collinearity tests suggest rapid ancient chromosome rearrangement that may have contributed to the initial species radiation within Phasianidae, and a role for the insertions of CR1 transposable elements in rearranging chromosomes in Phasianidae. During the evolution of the Swinhoe's pheasant, natural selection positively selected genes involved in fecundity and body size functions, at both the species and population levels, which reflect genetic variation associated with island adaptation. We further tested for variation in population genomic traits between the Swinhoe's pheasant and its phylogenetically closely related mainland relative the silver pheasant, and found higher levels of genetic drift and inbreeding in the Swinhoe's pheasant genome.

The joint detection of PIVKA-II and other biomarkers could significantly improve diagnostic accuracy in HCC. Furthermore, PIVKA-II serves as a valuable prognostic predictor, transplantation eligibility, resectability, tumor recurrence, therapeutic efficacy, and malignant tumor behaviors. Additionally, PIVKA-II represents a potential target for agent development to establish new therapeutic strategies. Besides HCC, PIVKA-II also serves as a biomarker of vitamin K status.

Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate PM cholesterol and show endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol depletion. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia.

mitigating atherosclerosis. Paeoniflorin, a monoterpenoid glycoside found in plants of the Paeoniaceae family, has shown various effects on cardiovascular and liver diseases. Nevertheless, its impact on atherosclerosis in vivo remains poorly understood. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of paeoniflorin on atherosclerosis using apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice and explore the underlying mechanisms, with a specific focus on its modulation of RCT. ApoE-/- mice were continuously administered paeoniflorin by gavage for three months. We assessed lipid parameters in serum and examined pathological changes and gene expressions related to RCT pathways in the aorta, liver, and intestine. In an in vitro study, we utilized RAW264.7 macrophages to investigate the inhibitory effect of paeoniflorin on foam cell formation and its potential to promote RCT. The results revealed that paeoniflorin reduced atherosclerosis, alleviated hyperlipidemia, and mitigated hepatic steatosis. Paeoniflorin may promote RCT by stimulating cholesterol efflux from macrophages via the liver X receptor alpha pathway, enhancing serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels, and regulating key genes in hepatic and intestinal RCT. Additionally, treatment ApoE-/- mice with paeoniflorin suppressed the expression of inflammation-related genes, including CD68, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and mitigated oxidative stress in both the aorta and liver. Our results indicated that paeoniflorin has the potential to be a more effective and safer treatment for atherosclerosis, thanks to its promotion of RCT and its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects.", "Keywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Paeoniflorin", "Reverse cholesterol transport"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Cholesterol", "Atherosclerosis", "Monoterpenes", "Apolipoproteins E", "Mice, Inbred C57BL"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruo", "Last Name": "Man Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Nantong University Pharmacy College, Nantong, 226001, China."}, {"First Name": "Chun Yan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Nantong University Pharmacy College, Nantong, 226001, China."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Nantong University Pharmacy College, Nantong, 226001, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Le", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Nantong University Pharmacy College, Nantong, 226001, China.

Rapid and sensitive analysis of trace PAHs and halogenated PAHs in complex environmental samples is a challenging topic for analytical science. Here we report the development of a nanospray laser-induced plasma ionization MS method for rapid and sensitive analysis of trace PAHs and halogenated PAHs under ambient and open-air conditions. A nanospray tip was applied for loading samples and placed pointing to the MS inlet, being a nanospray emitter with the application of a high voltage. A beam of laser was focused to induce energetic plasma between the nanospray emitter and the MS inlet for ionization of PAHs and halogenated PAHs for mass spectrometric analysis. Meanwhile, an inner-wall naphthyl-coated nanospray emitter was developed and applied as a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) probe for highly selective enrichment of trace PAHs and halogenated PAHs in complex environmental samples, and some organic solvent was applied to desorb the analytes for nanospray laser-induced plasma ionization MS analysis. Satisfactory linearity for each target PAH and halogenated PAH was obtained, with correlation coefficient values (r) no less than 0.9917. The method showed extremely high sensitivity for analysis of trace PAHs and halogenated PAHs in water, with limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) of 0.0001-0.02 and 0.0003-0.08 \u03bcg/L, respectively.

VTE is a particularly consequential pathology, as incidence is correlated with extremely common risk factors, and a large cohort of patients experience recurrent VTE after initial intervention. Altered hemodynamics, hypercoagulability, and damaged vascular tissue cause deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, the two permutations of VTE. Venous valves have been identified as likely locations for initial blood clot formation, but the exact pathway by which thrombosis occurs in this environment is not entirely clear. Several risk factors are known to increase the likelihood of VTE, particularly those that increase inflammation and coagulability, increase venous resistance, and damage the endothelial lining. While these risk factors are useful as predictive tools, VTE diagnosis prior to presentation of outward symptoms is difficult, chiefly due to challenges in successfully imaging deep-vein thrombi. Clinically, VTE can be managed by anticoagulants or mechanical intervention. Recently, direct oral anticoagulants and catheter-directed thrombolysis have emerged as leading tools in resolution of venous thrombosis. While a satisfactory VTE model has yet to be developed, recent strides have been made in advancing in silico models of venous hemodynamics, hemorheology, fluid-structure interaction, and clot growth. These models are often guided by imaging-informed boundary conditions or inspired by benchtop animal models. These gaps in knowledge are critical targets to address necessary improvements in prediction and diagnosis, clinical management, and VTE experimental and computational models.", "Keywords": ["Hemodynamics", "Modeling", "Thrombosis", "Venous thromboembolism"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Venous Thromboembolism", "Anticoagulants", "Venous Thrombosis", "Pulmonary Embolism", "Risk Factors", "Biology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Connor", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 122 Chemical and Biomedical Engineering Building, University Park, PA, 16802-4400, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hicham", "Last Name": "Saaid", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 122 Chemical and Biomedical Engineering Building, University Park, PA, 16802-4400, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vijay", "Last Name": "Vedula", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessica C", "Last Name": "Cardenas", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and the Center for Translational Injury Research, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter K", "Last Name": "Henke", "Affiliation": "Section of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Franck", "Last Name": "Nicoud", "Affiliation": "CNRS, IMAG, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Yun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Beverley J", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Department of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, King's College, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Keefe B", "Last Name": "Manning", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, 122 Chemical and Biomedical Engineering Building, University Park, PA, 16802-4400, USA. kbm10@psu.edu."}], "Journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "37907330", "Title": "School-based Evaluation Advancing Response for Child Health (SEARCH): a mixed longitudinal cohort study from multifaceted perspectives in Jiangsu, China.", "Abstract": "Schools play a crucial role in providing mental health services to children and adolescents.

The underlying mechanism needs to be better understood, and there has yet to be an efficient therapeutic target. This study retrospectively reviewed 109 patients undergoing liver transplantation, with dynamic profiling of CD3/4/8/16/19/45/56 on the peripheral immune cells (before transplant and 2-4\u2009days after). Altogether, 35 out of the 109 patients developed EAD after liver transplantation. We observed a significant decrease in the natural killer cell proportion (NK cell shift, p\u2009=\u20090.008). The NK cell shift was linearly correlated with cold ischemic time (p\u2009=\u20090.016) and was potentially related to the recipients' outcomes. In mouse models, ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) treatments induced the recruitment of NK cells from peripheral blood into liver tissues. NK cell depletion blocked a series of immune cascades (including CD8+ CD127+ T cells) and inhibited hepatocyte injury effectively in I/R and liver transplantation models. We further found that I/R treatment increased hepatic expression of the ligands for natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D), a primary activating cell surface receptor in NK cells. Blockade of NKG2D showed a similar protective effect against I/R injury, indicating its role in NK cell activation and the subsequent immunological injury. Our findings built a bridge for the translation from innate immune response to EAD at the bedside. Peripheral NK cell shift is associated with the incidence of EAD after liver transplantation.

As a result, we achieve high-performance Kesterite solar cells with total-area efficiency of 13.6% (certified at 13.44%) and 1.09\u2009cm2-area efficiency of 12.0% (certified at 12.1%).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiazheng", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Kang", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinlin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Licheng", "Last Name": "Lou", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Menghan", "Last Name": "Jiao", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Bowen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Dongmei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiangjian", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China. shijj@iphy.ac.cn."}, {"First Name": "Huijue", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanhong", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China. yhluo@iphy.ac.cn."}, {"First Name": "Qingbo", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, 100190, China. qbmeng@iphy.ac.cn."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2023Oct20"}, {"PMID": "37862164", "Title": "The rice peroxisomal receptor PEX5 negatively regulates resistance to rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.", "Abstract": "The receptor protein PEX5, an important component of peroxisomes, regulates growth, development, and immunity in yeast and mammals. PEX5 also influences growth and development in plants, but whether it participates in plant immunity has remained unclear. Here, we report that knockdown of OsPEX5 enhances resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We demonstrate that OsPEX5 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6, a positive regulator of plant immunity. APIP6 ubiquitinates OsPEX5 in\u00a0vitro and promotes its degradation in\u00a0vivo via the 26S proteasome pathway. In addition, OsPEX5 interacts with the aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2B1, which functions in growth-defense trade-offs in rice. OsPEX5 stabilizes OsALDH2B1 to enhance its repression of the defense-related gene OsAOS2.

Known as a functional nutrient, betaine has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo.

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of betaine in the treatment of behavioral changes and its underlying mechanism. Three-week-old male mice were randomly housed for 8\u2009weeks in either group housing (GH) or SI. The animals were divided into normal saline-treated GH, normal saline-treated SI, and betaine-treated SI groups in the sixth week. The cognitive and depression-like behavior was determined in the eighth week. We found that long-term betaine administration improved cognitive behavior in SI mice but failed to prevent depression-like behavior. Moreover, long-term betaine administration inhibited hippocampal microglia over-activation and polarized microglia toward the M2 phenotype, which effectively inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors in SI mice. Finally, the protective effect of betaine treatment in SI mice might not be due to altered activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

has shown great potential in tumor treatment. However, many factors impair the efficacy of CAR-T therapy, such as antigenic heterogeneity and loss, limited potency and persistence, poor infiltration capacity, and a suppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome these obstacles, recent studies have reported a new generation of CAR-T cells expressing cytokines called armored CAR-T, TRUCK-T, or the fourth-generation CAR-T. Here we summarize the strategies of arming CAR-T cells with natural or synthetic cytokine signals to enhance their anti-tumor capacity. Moreover, we summarize the advances in CAR-T cells expressing non-cytokine proteins, such as membrane receptors, antibodies, enzymes, co-stimulatory molecules, and transcriptional factors. Furthermore, we discuss several prospective strategies for armored CAR-T therapy development.

OBJECTIVE: To compare direct health care costs associated with biologic use for the treatment of SEA from a US third-party payer perspective. METHODS: We developed a cost-minimization model to compare costs and cost offsets associated with 3 biologics-benralizumab, mepolizumab, and dupilumab-for 2- and 4-year periods. The model relied on longitudinal data from clinical trials to inform the primary (base case) analysis cost comparison and RWE study data, in a separate scenario, to compare costs in nonclinical trial settings. Primary model outcomes included exacerbations (including hospitalizations), OCS-dependent years (including associated complications), and total direct health care biologic costs. Results were calculated at the per patient and population level (per 1,000 patients). Sensitivity analyses with key model parameters were performed. RESULTS: Benralizumab had the lowest total biologic costs per patient for both the 2- and 4-year periods. Over 4 years, the marginal cost difference in total biologic costs per patient was $23,061 lower for benralizumab vs mepolizumab and $17,242 lower for benralizumab vs dupilumab. The 4-year population level analysis of benralizumab vs mepolizumab revealed $4.8 million in marginal cost offsets due to 582 fewer exacerbations and 153 fewer OCS-dependent years and a marginal total cost savings of $27.9 million per 1,000 patients for benralizumab. The 4-year population level analysis of benralizumab vs dupilumab revealed $2.3 million in marginal cost offsets due to 291 fewer exacerbations and 64 fewer OCS-dependent years and marginal total cost savings of $19.5 million per 1,000 patients for benralizumab. RWE data were available for a 2-year cost comparison scenario of benralizumab vs mepolizumab, which showed similar results to the base case analysis. Sensitivity analyses varying assumptions on key model parameter estimates confirmed results, with benralizumab having lower total direct health care costs in all scenarios tested, and showed that model results were most sensitive to changes in biologic costs and exacerbation reduction rates. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving benralizumab had higher nonbiologic cost offsets because of reductions in exacerbations and OCS-dependent years, leading to greater cost savings for third-party payers compared with patients receiving mepolizumab or dupilumab. Taken together with biologic costs, benralizumab presents greater savings in health care costs for payers than patients with SEA who use mepolizumab or dupilumab.

Although the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHVL) has been implicated in emotional distress, its involvement in post-MI cardiac dysfunction remains largely unexplored. This study was designed to investigate the effect of the VMHVL activation in the MI rat model and its underlying mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that activation of VMHVL neurons enhances the activity of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and superior cervical ganglion (SCG). This activation leads to an elevation in catecholamine levels, which subsequently modulates myosin function and triggers the release of anti-inflammatory factors, to exacerbate the post-MI cardiac prognosis. The denervation of the superior cervical ganglion (SGN) effectively blocked the cardiac sympathetic effects induced by the VMHVL activation, and ameliorated the cardia fibrosis and dysfunction. Therefore, our study identified the role of the \"VMHVL-PVN-SCG\" sympathetic pathway in the post-MI heart, and proposed SGN as a promising strategy in mitigating cardiac prognosis in stressful rats.", "Keywords": ["Adrenergic signaling pathway", "Myocardial infarction", "Sympathetic nervous system", "VMHVL"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Rats", "Animals", "Myocardial Infarction", "Heart", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Heart Failure", "Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zihan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, PR China;

However, the routine requirement of tissue or blood samples for genome sequencing often poses challenges in many elusive reptiles, hence limiting the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies to reptile studies. An alternative reptilian DNA resource suitable for genome sequencing is in urgent need. Here, we used the corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) as a reptile model species to demonstrate that the shed skin is a high-quality DNA source for genome sequencing. Skin sheds provide a noninvasive type of sample that can be easily collected without restraining or harming the animal. Our findings suggest that shed skin from corn snakes yields DNA of sufficient quantity and quality that are comparable to tissue DNA extracts. Genome sequencing data analysis revealed that shed skin DNA is subject to bacteria contamination at variable levels, which is a major issue related to shed skin DNA and may be addressed by a modified DNA extraction method through introduction of a 30 min pre-digestion step. This study provides an enhanced method for the use of reptile shed skins as a high-quality DNA source for whole genome sequencing.

This study aims to evaluate LDL transport and accumulation at the carotid artery bifurcation following carotid artery stenting (CAS) by means of computational simulation. The computational model consists of coupled blood flow and LDL transport, with the latter being modeled as a dilute substance dissolved in the blood and transported by the flow through a convection-diffusion transport equation. The endothelial layer was assumed to be permeable to LDL, and the hydraulic conductivity of LDL was shear-dependent. Anatomically realistic geometric models of the carotid bifurcation were built based on pre- and post-stent computed tomography (CT) scans. The influence of stent design was investigated by virtually deploying two different types of stents (open- and closed-cell stents) into the same carotid bifurcation model. Predicted LDL concentrations were compared between the post-stent carotid models and the relatively normal contralateral model reconstructed from patient-specific CT images. Our results show elevated LDL concentration in the distal section of the stent in all post-stent models, where LDL concentration is 20 times higher than that in the contralateral carotid. Compared with the open-cell stents, the closed-cell stents have larger areas exposed to high LDL concentration, suggesting an increased risk of stent restenosis.

In order to investigate the effect of AEE on the inhibition of aortic lipid plaque formation and macrophage-derived foam cell formation induced by oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), in vivo atherosclerosis model by feeding ApoE-/- mice with a high-fat diet and foam cells formation in vitro model by ox-LDL-induced RAW264.7 macrophages were established. It was found that AEE decreased the levels of TC and LDL-C in serum, and the plaque formation area and lipid accumulation in the aortic intima of ApoE-/- mice. In vitro studies showed that AEE could prevent the uptake of ox-LDL and reduce the contents of TC and FC in cells.

However, little is known about patterns of genomic diversity in ancient populations. Here we generated whole-genome sequences from ancient or historical (100-10,000\u2009yr old) specimens collected across mainland Asia, including a 10,600-yr-old Russian Far East specimen (RUSA21, 8\u00d7 coverage) plus six ancient mitogenomes, 14 South China tigers (0.1-12\u00d7) and three Caspian tigers (4-8\u00d7). Admixture analysis showed that RUSA21 clustered within modern Northeast Asian phylogroups and partially derived from an extinct Late Pleistocene lineage. While some of the 8,000-10,000-yr-old Russian Far East mitogenomes are basal to all tigers, one 2,000-yr-old specimen resembles present Amur tigers. Phylogenomic analyses suggested that the Caspian tiger probably dispersed from an ancestral Northeast Asian population and experienced gene flow from southern Bengal tigers. Lastly, genome-wide monophyly supported the South China tiger as a distinct subspecies, albeit with mitochondrial paraphyly, hence resolving its longstanding taxonomic controversy. The distribution of mitochondrial haplogroups corroborated by biogeographical modelling suggested that Southwest China was a Late Pleistocene refugium for a relic basal lineage. As suitable habitat returned, admixture between divergent lineages of South China tigers took place in Eastern China, promoting the evolution of other northern subspecies. Altogether, our analysis of ancient genomes sheds light on the evolutionary history of tigers and supports the existence of nine modern subspecies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Tigers", "DNA, Ancient", "Phylogeny", "Russia", "China"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences;

However, the wide variability in visceral hybrid configurations means that a priori prediction of surgical outcome based on haemodynamic flow profiles such as velocity pattern and wall shear stress post repair remain challenging. We sought to appraise the clinical relevance of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses in the setting of visceral hybrid TAAA repairs. Two patients, one with a type III and the other with a type V TAAA, underwent successful elective and emergency visceral hybrid repairs, respectively. Flow patterns and haemodynamic parameters were analysed using reconstructed pre- and post-operative CT scans. Both type III and type V TAAAs showed highly disturbed flow patterns with varying helicity values preoperatively within their respective aneurysms. Low time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and high endothelial cell action potential (ECAP) and relative residence time (RRT) associated with thrombogenic susceptibility was observed in the posterior aspect of both TAAAs preoperatively. Despite differing bypass configurations in the elective and emergency repairs, both treatment options appear to improve haemodynamic performance compared to preoperative study. However, we observed reduced TAWSS in the right iliac artery (portending a theoretical risk of future graft and possibly limb thrombosis), after the elective type III visceral hybrid repair, but not the emergency type V repair. We surmise that this difference may be attributed to the higher neo-bifurcation of the aortic stent graft in the type III as compared to the type V repair. Our results demonstrate that CFD can be used in complicated visceral hybrid repair to yield potentially actionable predictive insights with implications on surveillance and enhanced post-operative management, even in patients with complicated geometrical bypass configurations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracoabdominal", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Aorta", "Action Potentials", "Hemodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chi Wei", "Last Name": "Ong", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Ian J Y", "Last Name": "Wee", "Affiliation": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Milan", "Last Name": "Toma", "Affiliation": "Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fangsen", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Yun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Arthur Mark", "Last Name": "Richards", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Hwa Liang", "Last Name": "Leo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Andrew M T L", "Last Name": "Choong", "Affiliation": "Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, National University Heart Centre, Singapore, Singapore. email@drandrewchoong.com."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2023Aug23"}, {"PMID": "37573085", "Title": "Letter to Editor Regarding Article, 'Patients With Previous COVID-19 Infection Can Safely Undergo Primary Total Joint Arthroplasty'.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "COVID-19", "Arthroplasty", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Patients"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caining", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "Department of Joint Surgery and Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanmin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Joint Surgery and Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Joint Surgery and Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China."}], "Journal": "The Journal of arthroplasty", "PubDate": "2023Sep"}, {"PMID": "37566172", "Title": "A numerical study of the effect of thrombus breakdown on predicted thrombus formation and growth.", "Abstract": "Thrombosis is a complex biological process which involves many biochemical reactions and is influenced by blood flow. Various computational models have been developed to simulate natural thrombosis in diseases such as aortic dissection (AD), and device-induced thrombosis in blood-contacting biomedical devices. While most hemodynamics-based models consider the role of low shear stress in the initiation and growth of thrombus, they often ignore the effect of thrombus breakdown induced by elevated shear stress. In this study, a new shear stress-induced thrombus breakdown function is proposed and implemented in our previously published thrombosis model. The performance of the refined model is assessed by quantitative comparison with experimental data on thrombus formation in a backward-facing step geometry, and qualitative comparison with in vivo data obtained from an AD patient. Our results show that incorporating thrombus breakdown improves accuracy in predicted thrombus volume and captures the same pattern of thrombus evolution as measured experimentally and in vivo. In the backward-facing step geometry, thrombus breakdown impedes growth over the step and downstream, allowing a stable thrombus to be reached more quickly. Moreover, the predicted thrombus volume, height and length are in better agreement with the experimental measurements compared to the original model which does not consider thrombus breakdown. In the patient-specific AD, the refined model outperforms the original model in predicting the extent and location of thrombosis. In conclusion, the effect of thrombus breakdown is not negligible and should be included in computational models of thrombosis.", "Keywords": ["Backward-facing step", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Hemodynamics", "Shear stress", "Thrombosis modeling", "Thrombus breakdown"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Hemodynamics", "Thrombosis", "Aortic Dissection", "Stress, Mechanical", "Biological Phenomena", "Models, Cardiovascular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kaihong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Chl\u00f6e H", "Last Name": "Armour", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Richard G J", "Last Name": "Gibbs", "Affiliation": "Regional Vascular Unit, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Yun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK. yun.xu@imperial.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "37562671", "Title": "BMI1-induced CD127+KLRG1+ memory T cells enhance the efficacy of liver cancer immunotherapy.", "Abstract": "The efficacy of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) immunotherapy is hindered by the limited reactivity and short duration of tumor-infiltrating T cells. These deficiencies may be ascribed to the proliferative ability of T cells. The primary objective of this study was to identify the key factor regulating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) proliferation within the HCC microenvironment. Through the utilization of tissue-infiltrated T cell proteomics and fraction proteomics, we analyzed the differential proteins in T cells among HCC, liver fibrosis, and hemangioma (serving as controls) groups. Additionally, we examined the differential regulatory TFs of T cells between the HCC and VH (volunteer healthy, as a control) groups. Using cyTOF and flow cytometry technologies, as well as generating CD8+ T-specific BMI1 knockout mice, we confirmed that BMI1 controls CD127+KLRG1+ memory cell differentiation. Through RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq, we verified that BMI1 regulates TCF1 expression independently of its classical function. Furthermore, by conducting Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) IHC analysis, employing a hydrodynamic mouse HCC model, and utilizing liver-specific nanoparticle targeting therapy, we demonstrated that BMI1 in HCC influences the proliferation of infiltrating CD8+T. BMI1 inhibition promotes effector T cell differentiation while suppressing memory T cell differentiation. Moreover, liver-specific BMI1 knockdown proves beneficial in ameliorating T cell dysfunction and decelerating HCC progression. Our research group has pioneered the exploration of the proteomics of HCC-infiltrated T cells, shedding light on the pivotal role of BMI1 in controlling CD127+KLRG1+ memory CD8+ T cell differentiation, which serves as the cornerstone for achieving immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.", "Keywords": ["Esterase-responsive polymer (ERP)", "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)", "N6-methyadeosine (m6A) modifications", "TCF1", "Tumor-infiltrated T cells (TILs)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Immunotherapy", "Liver Neoplasms", "Memory T Cells", "Mice, Knockout", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Polycomb Repressive Complex 1", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shuai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianguo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Yiyuan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "The Forth School of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Wangyao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "The Forth School of Clinical Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenchen", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuyong", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Nasha", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China."}, {"First Name": "Shusen", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, China; Shulan (Hangzhou) Hospital, Zhejiang Shuren University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310022, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China; State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, China.

However, key functional genes have not been well studied partly due to its hard transformation. Here, bermudagrass \"Wrangler\" successfully overexpressing CdWRKY2 exhibited significantly enhanced salt and ABA sensitivity with severe inhibition of shoot and root growth compared to the transgenic negative line. The reduced auxin accumulation and higher ABA sensitivity of the lateral roots (LR) under salt stress were observed in CdWRKY2 overexpression Arabidopsis lines. IAA application could rescue or partially rescue the salt hypersensitivity of root growth inhibition in CdWRKY2-overexpressing Arabidopsis and bermudagrass, respectively. Subsequent experiments in Arabidopsis indicated that CdWRKY2 could directly bind to the promoter region of AtWRKY46 and downregulated its expression to further upregulate the expression of ABA and auxin pathway-related genes.

Method: Among the six cases analysed in this report, three were treated with a stent graft in the ascending aorta to manage chronic dissection in the proximal aorta; dimensions of those stent grafts varied between 34 and 45 mm in diameter, and from 77 to 100 mm in length. Three patients, matched by age, sex and their nature of pathology, were subjected to the focal closure of a single communicating entry by the use of an occluding device (Amplatzer ASD and PFO occluders between 14 and 18 mm disc diameter) with similar Charlson comorbidity score. Results: Both conceptually different nonsurgical management strategies were technically feasible; however, with stent grafts, an early or delayed erosion to full re-dissection was documented with stent grafts, in contrast to complete seal, with an induced remodelling and a long-term survival after the successful placing of coils and occluder devices. Moreover, aortic root motion was not impaired by the focal occlusion of a communication with an occluder, while free motion was impeded after stent graft placement. Conclusions: The intriguing observation in our small series was that stent grafts placed in the ascending aorta portends the risk of an either early (post-procedural) or delayed migration and erosion of aortic tissues at the landing site or biological interface between 12 and 16 months after the procedure, a phenomenon not seen with the use of focal occluding devices up to 5 years of follow-up. Obviously, the focal approach avoids the erosion of the aortic wall as the result of minimal interaction with the biological interface, such as a diseased aortic wall. Potential explanations may be related to a reduced motion of the aortic root after the placement of stent graft in the ascending aorta, whereas the free motion of aortic root was preserved with an occluder. The causality of erosion may however not be fully understood, as besides the stiffness and radial force of the stent graft, other factors such as the induced inflammatory reactions of aortic tissue and local adhesions within the chest may also play a role. With stent grafts failing to portend long-term success, they may still have a role as a temporizing solution for elective surgical conversion.

Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), the target of the drug ezetimibe (EZ), assists in the initial step of dietary cholesterol uptake. However, how cholesterol moves downstream of NPC1L1 is unknown. Here we show that Aster-B and Aster-C are critical for non-vesicular cholesterol movement in enterocytes, bridging NPC1L1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and ACAT2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss of NPC1L1 diminishes accessible PM cholesterol in enterocytes and abolishes Aster recruitment to the intestinal brush border. Enterocytes lacking Asters accumulate cholesterol at the PM and display evidence of ER cholesterol depletion, including decreased cholesterol ester stores and activation of the SREBP-2 transcriptional pathway. Aster-deficient mice have impaired cholesterol absorption and are protected against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia.

Four patients treated with TEVAR who developed a distal SINE (dSINE) were included; two patients had a stable dSINE and two patients experienced expansion of the dSINE upon follow-up examinations. CFD simulations were performed on geometries reconstructed from computed tomography scans acquired upon early detection of dSINE in these patients. Computational results showed that stable dSINEs presented larger regions with low time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and high relative residence time (RRT), and partial thrombosis was observed at subsequent follow-ups. Furthermore, significant systolic antegrade flow was observed in the unstable dSINE which also had a larger retrograde flow fraction (RFF) on the SINE plane.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for OA apart from total joint replacement in advanced stages. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of adult stem cell with diverse differentiation capabilities and immunomodulatory potentials. MSCs are known to effectively regulate the cartilage microenvironment, promote cartilage regeneration, and alleviate OA symptoms. As a result, they are promising sources of cells for OA therapy. Recent studies have revealed the presence of resident MSCs in synovial fluid, synovial membrane, and articular cartilage, which can be collected as knee joint-derived MSCs (KJD-MSC). Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that KJD-MSCs have great potential for OA treatment, whether applied alone, in combination with biomaterials, or as exocrine MSCs. In this article, we will review the characteristics of MSCs in the joints, including their cytological characteristics, such as proliferation, cartilage differentiation, and immunomodulatory abilities, as well as the biological function of MSC exosomes. We will also discuss the use of tissue engineering in OA treatment and introduce the concept of a new generation of stem cell-based tissue engineering therapy, including the use of engineering, gene therapy, and gene editing techniques to create KJD-MSCs or KJD-MSC derivative exosomes with improved functionality and targeted delivery.

Herein, this work explores the coaction of low temperatures and current rates (C rates) on Li plating in LIBs by electrochemical tests, material characterization, and numerical analysis. With a decrease in temperature and an increase in C rate, the battery charging process shifts from normal intercalation to Li plating and even ultimately fails at -20 \u00b0C and 0.5C. The morphology observations reveal the detailed growth process of individual plated Li through sand-like Li, whisker Li, dendritic Li, mossy Li, and finally bulk Li, as well as aggregated Li from sparse to dense. Through quantitative analysis, the dynamic pattern under long-term cycles is revealed. The low temperature and high C rate will lead to an increase in Li plating capacity and irreversibility, which are further deteriorated with the cycles. In addition, a critical condition of high Li plating and high reversibility at -10 \u00b0C and 0.2C is found, and further studies are needed to reveal the competition between kinetics and thermodynamics in the Li plating process. This work provides detailed information on the range and growth process of Li plating and quantifies Li plating, which can be used for practical Li plating prediction and regulation.", "Keywords": ["lithium plating", "lithium plating judgment", "lithium-ion battery", "quantitative analysis", "subzero operation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kai", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei 230026, Anhui China."}, {"First Name": "Xueyan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei 230026, Anhui China."}, {"First Name": "Zhuojun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei 230026, Anhui China."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei 230026, Anhui China."}, {"First Name": "Lili", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei 230026, Anhui China."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Department of Thermal Science and Energy Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei 230026, Anhui China."}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2023Aug02"}, {"PMID": "37463594", "Title": "Letter to the Editor Regarding the Article \"Results of a Highly Porous Metal-Backed Cementless Patella Implant: A Minimum 5-Year Follow-Up\".", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Patella", "Follow-Up Studies", "Porosity", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Knee Prosthesis", "Metals", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "School of Clinical Medicine, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Joint Surgery and Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanmin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Joint Surgery and Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China."}], "Journal": "The journal of knee surgery", "PubDate": "2024May"}, {"PMID": "37459515", "Title": "Densified vertically lamellar electrode architectures for compact energy storage.", "Abstract": "As one of the most compact electrochemical energy storage systems, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are playing an indispensable role in the process of vehicle electrification to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility. Making battery electrodes thicker is a promising strategy for improving the energy density of LIBs which is essential for applications with weight or volume constraints, such as electric-powered transportation; however, their power densities are often significantly restricted due to elongated and tortuous charge traveling distances. Here, we propose an effective methodology that couples bidirectional freeze-casting and compression-induced densification to create densified vertically lamellar electrode architectures for compact energy storage. The vertically lamellar architectures not only overcome the critical thickness limit for conventional electrodes but also facilitate and redistribute the lithium-ion flux enabling both high rate capability and stable cyclability. Furthermore, this proposed methodology is universal as demonstrated in various electrochemical active material systems. This study offers a facile approach that realizes simultaneous high energy and high power in high-loading battery electrodes and provides useful rationales in designing electrode architectures for scalable energy storage systems.", "Keywords": ["energy storage", "lithium-ion batteries", "self-assembly"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhengyu", "Last Name": "Ju", "Affiliation":

Based on the transcriptomics analysis of the human embryonic kidney 293T cell model established using 1 mM uric acid, we evaluated that AA showed opposite modulation of purine metabolism to the UA group and markedly suppressed the intensity of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase 2, and ribose 5-phosphate isomerase A. Molecular docking also reveals the inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase 1. The SCE exhibits similar regulation of these genes, so we conclude that AA was a promising component in SCE against hyperuricemia.

The LAP@PDOL GPE effectively facilitates the dissociation of lithium salts via electrostatic interaction and simultaneously constructs multiple lithium-ion transport channels within the gel polymer network. This hierarchical GPE demonstrates a remarkable ionic conductivity of 5.16 \u00d7 10-4 S cm-1 at 30 \u00b0C. Furthermore, the robust laponite component of the LAP@PDOL GPE forms a barrier against Li dendrite growth while also participating in the establishment of a stable electrode/electrolyte interface with Si-rich components. The in situ polymerization process further improves the interfacial contact, enabling the LiFePO4/LAP@PDOL GPE/Li cell to exhibit an impressive capacity of 137 mAh g-1 at 1C, with a capacity retention of 98.5% even after 400 cycles.

potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger and has great potential for anti-aging applications. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanism of curcumin in prolonging the lifespan of C. elegans. Four concentrations of curcumin (10, 25, 50, and 100\u00a0\u00b5M) were administered, and the optimal treatment concentration was determined by analyzing the nematode lifespan, physiology, and biochemistry. Additionally, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were performed to explore the antioxidant effect of curcumin and its underlying mechanism. Results revealed that curcumin could significantly improve the survival capacity of C. elegans without influencing its growth. Curcumin was observed to significantly decrease the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under extreme conditions such as heat stress and paraquat stress. In addition, curcumin increased the amount of nematode mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. RNA-seq results revealed that the underlying mechanism of curcumin in C. elegans is related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. qRT-PCR results confirmed that the expression of oxidative stress-related genes (sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, gst-4) was increased, and the expression of MAPK signaling pathway-related genes (sek-1, pmk-1, nsy-1) was significantly downregulated. Furthermore, the administration of curcumin extended the lifespan of nematodes, potentially through the enhancement of oxidative stress resistance and the downregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings improve our understanding of both lifespan extension and the potential mechanism of curcumin in C. elegans.", "Keywords": ["Caenorhabditis elegans", "MAPK pathway", "RNA-seq", "ROS", "curcumin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianing", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Pengyun", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuting", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenggang", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37339952", "Title": "Selective binding of retrotransposons by ZFP352 facilitates the timely dissolution of totipotency network.", "Abstract": "Acquisition of new stem cell fates relies on the dissolution of the prior regulatory network sustaining the existing cell fates. Currently, extensive insights have been revealed for the totipotency regulatory network around the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) period. However, how the dissolution of the totipotency network is triggered to ensure the timely embryonic development following ZGA is largely unknown. In this study, we identify the unexpected role of a highly expressed 2-cell (2C) embryo specific transcription factor, ZFP352, in facilitating the dissolution of the totipotency network. We find that ZFP352 has selective binding towards two different retrotransposon sub-families. ZFP352 coordinates with DUX to bind the 2C specific MT2_Mm sub-family. On the other hand, without DUX, ZFP352 switches affinity to bind extensively onto SINE_B1/Alu sub-family. This leads to the activation of later developmental programs like ubiquitination pathways, to facilitate the dissolution of the 2C state. Correspondingly, depleting ZFP352 in mouse embryos delays the 2C to morula transition process. Thus, through a shift of binding from MT2_Mm to SINE_B1/Alu, ZFP352 can trigger spontaneous dissolution of the totipotency network. Our study highlights the importance of different retrotransposons sub-families in facilitating the timely and programmed cell fates transition during early embryogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

In this paper, a new Pd2 MnGa Heusler-type MMSMA with an extremely small Edis and hysteresis is reported. The microstructures, crystal structures, magnetic properties, martensitic transformations, and magnetic-field-induced strain of aged Pd2 MnGa alloys are investigated. A martensitic transformation from L21 to 10M structures is seen at 127.4\u00a0K with a small thermal hysteresis of 1.3\u00a0K. The reverse martensitic transformation is induced by applying a magnetic field with a small Edis (=\u00a00.3\u00a0J\u00a0mol-1 only) and a small magnetic-field hysteresis (=\u00a07\u00a0kOe) at 120\u00a0K. The low values of Edis and the hysteresis may be attributed to good lattice compatibility in the martensitic transformation. A large magnetic-field-induced strain of 0.26% is recorded, indicating the proposed MMSMA's potential as an actuator.

However, it has been proved to be associated with post-transplant hyperlipemia. The mechanism behind this is unknown, and it is urgent to explore preventive strategies for hyperlipemia after transplantation. Therefore, we established a hyperlipemia mouse model to investigate the mechanism, by injecting TAC intraperitoneally for eight weeks. After TAC treatment, the mice developed hyperlipemia (manifested as elevated triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), as well as decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c)). Accumulation of lipid droplets was observed in the liver. In addition to lipid accumulation, TAC induced inhibition of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3\u03b2 (LC3B) II/I and LC3B II/actin ratios, transcription factor EB (TFEB), protein 62 (P62), and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)) and downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in vivo. Overexpression of FGF21 may reverse TAC-induced TG accumulation. In this mouse model, the recombinant FGF21 protein ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and hyperlipemia through repair of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. We conclude that TAC downregulates FGF21 and thus exacerbates lipid accumulation by impairing the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Recombinant FGF21 protein treatment could therefore reverse TAC-caused lipid accumulation and hypertriglyceridemia by enhancing autophagy.", "Keywords": ["Autophagy", "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)", "Lipid", "Lipophagy", "Lysosome", "Tacrolimus", "Transcription factor EB (TFEB)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Tacrolimus", "Liver", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Autophagy", "Disease Models, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhensheng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China."}, {"First Name": "Xun", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyu", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhengxing", "Last Name": "Lian", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuyong", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310058, China. zjxu@zju.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Journal of Zhejiang University.

NMT exhibits excellent dual-emission at 455 and 575\u00a0nm under single excitation. Tetracycline is sensitively detected through quenching the dual-emission of NMT. NMT specifically recognizes tetracycline through intermolecular hydrogen bonding between -OH/-NH2 of tetracycline and deprotonated O-/-NH-/CN of NMT.

In this study, we systematically compare four commonly used DDA library-free approaches including Spectronaut's directDIA, DIA-Umpire, DIA-MSFragger, and in silico-predicted library for analysis of phosphoproteomics SWATH, DIA, and diaPASEF data as well as ubiquitinomics diaPASEF data. Spectronaut's directDIA shows the highest sensitivity for phosphopeptide detection not only in synthetic phosphopeptide samples but also in phosphoproteomics SWATH-MS and DIA data from real biological samples, when compared to the other three library-free strategies. For phosphoproteomics diaPASEF data, Spectronaut's directDIA and the in silico-predicted library based on DIA-NN identify almost the same number of phosphopeptides as a project-specific DDA spectral library. However, only about 30% of the total phosphopeptides are commonly identified, suggesting that the library-free strategies for phospho-diaPASEF data need further improvement in terms of sensitivity. For ubiquitinomics diaPASEF data, the in silico-predicted library performs the best among the four workflows and detects \u223c50% more K-GG peptides than a project-specific DDA spectral library.

When it reaches the end stage, mortality rises to 50% or more. Although liver transplantation has emerged as the most efficient treatment for end-stage liver disease, its application has been limited by the scarcity of donor livers. The lack of acceptable donor organs implies that patients are at high risk while waiting for suitable livers. In this scenario, cell therapy has emerged as a promising treatment approach. Most of the time, transplanted cells can replace host hepatocytes and remodel the hepatic microenvironment. For instance, hepatocytes derived from donor livers or stem cells colonize and proliferate in the liver, can replace host hepatocytes, and restore liver function. Other cellular therapy candidates, such as macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells, can remodel the hepatic microenvironment, thereby repairing the damaged liver. In recent years, cell therapy has transitioned from animal research to early human studies.

Mechanisms to monitor and eliminate these mutant stem cells remain elusive. Here, using the Drosophila larval brain as a model, we show that X-ray irradiation (IR) at the early larval stage leads to accumulation of nuclear Prospero (Pros), resulting in premature differentiation of neural stem cells (neuroblasts, NBs). Through NB-specific RNAi screenings, we determined that it is the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, rather than non-homologous end-joining pathway that plays, a dominant role in the maintenance of NBs under IR stress.

In addition to the common mechanisms underlying tumor recurrence, another unavoidable problem is that the immunosuppressive therapeutic regimen after transplantation could promote tumor recurrence and metastasis. Transplant oncology is an emerging field that addresses oncological challenges in transplantation. In this context, a comprehensive therapeutic management approach is required to balance the anti-tumor treatment and immunosuppressive status of recipients. Double-negative T cells (DNTs) are a cluster of heterogeneous cells mainly consisting of two subsets stratified by T cell receptor (TCR) type. Among them, TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ DNTs are considered to induce immune suppression in immune-mediated diseases, while TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ DNTs are widely recognized as tumor killers. As a composite cell therapy, healthy donor-derived DNTs can be propagated to therapeutic numbers in vitro and applied for the treatment of several malignancies without impairing normal tissues or being rejected by the host. In this work, we summarized the biological characteristics and functions of DNTs in oncology, immunology, and transplantation.

However, due to the shortage of donor livers and rapid progression of HCC, a majority of patients are dropped out from the waitlist. Recently, immunotherapy has shown great promise in the treatment of advanced HCC. However, the use of immunotherapy is limited in LT mainly due to the potentially increasing risk of graft rejection. One of the main challenges for researchers is the protection of donor graft from an immunotherapy-boosted immune response mounted by the host. Besides, the safety, availability, and costs of immunotherapy are other challenges that need to be addressed. Here, we reviewed the literature involving patients who received immunotherapy prior to transplant to avoid waitlist dropouts and following transplantation to prevent the progression of tumor recurrence and metastasis. Statistically, the incidence of rejection was 25.0% pre-transplant and 18.5% post-transplant. Based on the review of these clinical studies, we can conclude that conducting clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of currently available immunotherapy drugs and identifying novel immunotherapy targets through extensive research may be promising for patients who do not meet the selection criteria for LT and who experience post-transplant recurrence.

TPS-a, the largest number of genes, was derived from monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Collinearity analysis showed that 38 out of the 76 TPS genes in G. hirsutum were collinear within G. arboreum and G. raimondii. Twenty-one GhTPS-a genes belong to the cadinene synthase (GhCDN) subfamily and were divided into five groups, A, B, C, D, and E. The special cis-elements in the promoters of 12 GhCDN-A genes suggested that the JA and ethylene signaling pathways may be involved in their expression regulation. When 12 GhCDN-A genes were simultaneously silenced through virus-induced gene silencing, the glandular color of GhCDN-A-silenced plants was lighter than that of the control, supported by a gossypol content decrease based on HPLC testing, suggesting that GhCDN-A subgroup genes participate in gossypol synthesis. According to RNA-seq analysis, gossypol synthesis-related genes and disease-resistant genes in the glandular variety exhibited upregulated expression compared to the glandless variety, whereas hormone signaling-related genes were downregulated.

worldwide but currently cannot be cured. Suppressing the level of miR-214 in osteoclasts by the anti-miRNA oligonucleotide (AMO) anti-miR-214 reverses bone absorption and provides a potential treatment. Here we report a peptide-guided delivery strategy using red blood cell extracellular vesicles (RBCEVs) as the vehicle to realize osteoclast-targeted delivery of anti-miR-214. A bi-functional peptide, TBP-CP05, which binds to both the CD63 on RBCEVs and receptors on osteoclasts, acts as the guide. TBP-CP05 binds with RBCEVs through CP05, displays the TRAP-binding peptide (TBP) on the surface of EVs, and endows RBCEVs with osteoclast-targeting capability both in vitro and in vivo. Intravenous injection of the osteoclast-targeting RBCEVs (OT-RBCEVs) led to the enrichment of EVs in the bone skeleton, significant inhibition of the osteoclast activity, elevated osteoblast activity, and improved bone density in osteoporotic mice. Altogether, this work demonstrates efficient guidance of drug-loaded EVs to the targeted cells in vivo using bi-functional fusion peptides, and showcases that targeted delivery of anti-miR-214 by OT-RBCEVs may be a viable method for OP treatment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT. Surface functionalization of EVs endows these nanovesicles cell-specific targeting property which guides the drug cargos to specific tissues and cells with higher accuracy, longer retention, and minimal off-target effects. Methods to functionalize EVs with minimal procedures are highly desired for clinical applications. Here we present a facile method using a bifunctional fusion peptide to guide RBCEVs to osteoclasts. A simple incubation of the bifunctional peptide and RBCEVs results in osteoclast-targeting RBCEVs (OT-RBCEVs) that effectively deliver anti-miR-214 to osteoclasts in vivo in a mouse model of osteoporosis, bringing a potential therapy to osteoporotic patients.

"Abstract Prognostic prediction of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in patients is crucial in clinical decision and health care policy making. This study aimed to develop and validate prediction models for in-hospital mortality after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). We developed and validated logistic regression (LR), LASSO regression, and machine learning (ML) algorithms including support vector machines (SVM) and XGBoost models. Fifty-four candidate predictors were included. Model performance was expressed in terms of discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration (intercept and slope). For model development, 2804 patients with sTBI in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) China Registry study were included. External validation was performed in 1113 patients with sTBI in the CENTER-TBI European Registry study. XGBoost achieved high discrimination in mortality prediction, and it outperformed logistic and LASSO regression. The XGBoost model established in this study also outperformed prediction models currently available, including the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) core and International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (CRASH) basic models. When including 54 variables, XGBoost and SVM reached C-statistics of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-0.92) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.79-0.90) at internal validation, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.87-0.88) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.85-0.87) at external validation, respectively. A simplified version of XGBoost and SVM using 26 variables selected by recursive feature elimination (RFE) reached C-statistics of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82-0.92) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91) at internal validation, and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.87-0.88) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.87) at external validation, respectively. However, when the number of variables included decreased, the difference between ML and LR diminished. All the prediction models can be accessed via a web-based calculator. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pupillary light reflex, Injury Severity Score (ISS) for brain region, and the presence of acute subdural hematoma were the five strongest predictors for mortality prediction. The study showed that ML techniques such as XGBoost may capture information hidden in demographic and clinical predictors of patients with sTBI and yield more precise predictions compared with LR approaches.", "Keywords": ["extreme gradient boosting", "logistic regression", "machine learning", "prognostic model", "traumatic brain injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Glasgow Coma Scale", "Prognosis", "Algorithms", "Machine Learning"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuyao", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ewout W", "Last Name": "Steyerberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Isabel R A Retel", "Last Name": "Helmrich", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Fiona", "Last Name": "Lecky", "Affiliation": "Centre for Urgent and emergency care Research (CURE), Health Services Research Section, School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Jianying", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Junfeng", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Head Trauma, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Head Trauma, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Guotong", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Andrew I R", "Last Name": "Maas", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Guoyi", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiyao", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Head Trauma, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37056930", "Title": "NUF2 Drives Cholangiocarcinoma Progression and Migration via Inhibiting Autophagic Degradation of TFR1.", "Abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy and associated with poor prognosis.

In this research, we investigated the biological processes and underlying mechanisms of NUF2 in CCA. We discovered that the expression of NUF2 was upregulated in CCA and negatively correlated with prognosis. Changes in NUF2 levels had an impact on cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, NUF2 functioned as an oncogene to promote the progression of CCA through p38/MAPK signaling by inhibiting p62 binding of TFR1 and affecting its autophagic degradation. In addition, TFR1 promoted CCA progression and Kaplan-Meier analyses uncovered patients with high expression of TFR1 was associated with the poor survival.

can interact with proteins in their environment and form a protein corona. The pH of the aqueous media affects the structure and properties of the protein corona, and currently there is a lack of understanding of the effects of pH on the characteristics of protein coronas. In this study, we examined the impact of pH (2-11) on the structural and physicochemical properties of whey protein coronas formed around TiO2 nanoparticles. The pH of the solution influenced the structure of whey protein molecules, especially around their isoelectric point. Thermogravimetric and quartz crystal microbalance analyses showed that the adsorption capacity of the whey proteins was the largest at their isoelectric points and the lowest under highly acidic or alkaline conditions. The majority of the proteins were tightly bound to the nanoparticle surfaces, forming a hard corona. The influence of solution pH on protein corona properties was mainly attributed to its impact on the electrostatic forces in the system, which impacted the protein conformation and interactions. This study provides useful insights into the influence of pH on the formation and properties of protein coronas around inorganic nanoparticles, which may be important for understanding the gastrointestinal and environmental fates.", "Keywords": ["QCM-D", "interaction", "pH", "protein corona", "titanium dioxide", "whey protein"], "MeSH terms": ["Whey Proteins", "Protein Corona", "Whey", "Nanoparticles", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Honghong", "Last Name": "Shan", "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Shaoxing University, Shaoxing 312000, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiaorun", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Quality and Safety/National R&D Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine Processing, College of Engineering, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Shaoxing University, Shaoxing 312000, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "Mengchao", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Institute for Food and Drug Control, Nanjing 211198, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Shaoxing University, Shaoxing 312000, Zhejiang, China."}, {"First Name": "David Julian", "Last Name": "McClements", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chongjiang", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Quality and Safety/National R&D Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine Processing, College of Engineering, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, China."}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Quality and Safety/National R&D Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine Processing, College of Engineering, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of agricultural and food chemistry", "PubDate": "2023Apr12"}, {"PMID": "36986658", "Title": "In Silico Study of Different Thrombolytic Agents for Fibrinolysis in Acute Ischemic Stroke.", "Abstract": "Alteplase is the only FDA-approved drug for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

This paper evaluates the efficacy and safety of urokinase, ateplase, tenecteplase, and reteplase for intravenous AIS therapy by computational simulations of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics combined with a local fibrinolysis model. The performances of the drugs are evaluated by comparing clot lysis time, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) inhibition resistance, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) risk, and activation time from drug administration to clot lysis. Our results reveal that urokinase has the quickest lysis completion but the highest ICH risk due to excess fibrinogen depletion in systemic plasma. While tenecteplase and alteplase have very similar thrombolysis efficacy, tenecteplase has a lower risk of ICH and better resistance to PAI-1.

The hybrid nanoparticles achieve differential release of the combined drugs in the CSCs and bulk tumor cells by responding to their specific intracellular signal variation. In the hypoxic CSCs, ATRA is released to induce differentiation of the CSCs, and in the differentiating CSCs with decreased chemoresistance, DOX is released upon elevation of reactive oxygen species to cause subsequent cell death. In the bulk tumor cells, the drugs are released synchronously upon the hypoxic and oxidative conditions to exert potent anticancer effect. This cell-distinct drug release enhances the synergistic therapeutic efficacy of ATRA and DOX with different anticancer mechanism.

In vitro experiment showed that SSe could inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, knowing that NF-\u03baB is an important intracellular nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a key energy metabolism switch affecting the survival status of the whole cell.At the same time, Bay11-7082(NF-\u03baB signaling pathway inhibitors) and SSe resulted in phosphorylation of p65 and I\u03baB\u03b1, decreased expression of PDK1 and Bcl-2,and increased expression of Bax in lung cancer cells. Our further study demonstrated that the reduction of PDK1 activity inhibited lactate secretion, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, caused the release of Cytochrome C (Cyto C), activated mitochondrial respiration, and promoted the apoptosis of lung cancer cells.

In the current practices, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts in urea electrolysis remains critical. In this work, the NiCu-P/NF catalyst is prepared by anchoring Ni/Cu bimetallic phosphide nanosheets onto Ni foam (NF). In the experiments, the micron-sized elemental Cu polyhedron is first anchored on the surface of the NF substrate to provide more space for the growth of bimetallic nanosheets. Meanwhile, the Cu element adjusted the electron distribution within the composite and formed Ni/P orbital vacancies, which in turn accelerated the kinetic process. As a result, the optimal NiCu-P/NF sample exhibits excellent catalytic activity and cycling stability in a hybrid electrolysis system for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Further, the alkaline urea-containing electrolyzer is assembled with NiCu-P/NF as two electrodes reached a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with a low driving potential of 1.422 V, which outperforms the typical commercial noble metal electrolyzer (RuO2||Pt/C).

The expression of 17 CRGs and immune cells were explored, then correlation was analyzed. Based on CRGs, two molecular clusters were identified by consensus clustering algorithm. KM survival and IME features including immune cells, immune response, checkpoint genes between clusters were evaluated. NFE2L2, LIAS, and CDKN2A were screened out as prognostic signatures by univariate, LASSO and step regression. A risk model was established, and validated by KM method with p\u00a0=\u00a00.0026, and perfect AUC values. The accuracy of risk model was also well validated in external dataset. A nomogram was constructed and evaluated by calibration curves and DCA. Low level of immune cells, immune response, and enriched checkpoint genes were found in high-risk group. GSEA of signatures and GSVA of ES-related pathways revealed the potential molecular mechanism involved in ES progression. Several drugs showed sensitivity to ES samples.

We developed a liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform to deliver mRNA-encoded peanut allergen epitopes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which function as robust tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells that induce FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs). The mRNA strand was constructed by including nucleotide sequences encoding for nonallergenic MHC-II binding T-cell epitopes, identified in the dominant peanut allergen, Ara h2. These epitopes were inserted in the mRNA strand downstream of an MHC-II targeting sequence, further endowed in vitro with 5' and 3' capping sequences, a PolyA tail, and uridine substitution. Codon-optimized mRNA was used for microfluidics synthesis of LNPs with an ionizable cationic lipid, also decorated with a lipid-anchored mannose ligand for LSEC targeting. Biodistribution to the liver was confirmed by in vivo imaging, while ELISpot assays demonstrated an increase in IL-10-producing Tregs in the spleen. Prophylactic administration of tandem-repeat or a combination of encapsulated Ara h2 epitopes induced robust tolerogenic effects in C3H/HeJ mice, sensitized to and subsequently challenged with crude peanut allergen extract. In addition to alleviating physical manifestations of anaphylaxis, there was suppression of Th2-mediated cytokine production, IgE synthesis, and mast cell release, accompanied by increased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production in the peritoneum. Similar efficacy was demonstrated during LNP administration postsensitization. While nondecorated particles had lesser but significant effects, PolyA/LNP-Man lacked protective effects.

In order to develop effective treatments, the underlying mechanisms of antibiotic resistance must be understood. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538 strain was passaged in medium with and without gentamicin and obtained lab-evolved gentamicin-resistant S. aureus (RGEN) and gentamicin-sensitive S. aureus (SGEN) strains, respectively. Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA)-based proteomics approach was applied to compare the two strains. A total of 1426 proteins were identified, of which 462 were significantly different: 126 were upregulated and 336 were downregulated in RGEN compared to SGEN. Further analysis found that reduced protein biosynthesis was a characteristic feature in RGEN, related to metabolic suppression. The most differentially expressed proteins were involved in metabolic pathways. In RGEN, central carbon metabolism was dysregulated and energy metabolism decreased. After verification, it was found that the levels of NADH, ATP, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities increased. These findings suggest that inhibition of central carbon and energy metabolic pathways may play an important role in the resistance of S. aureus to gentamicin, and that gentamicin resistance is associated with oxidative stress.

Understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance will help better control these antibiotic-resistant pathogens in the future. The present study characterized the differential proteome of gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using the most advanced DIA-based proteomics technology. Many of the differential expressed proteins were related to metabolism, specifically, reduced central carbon and energy metabolism.

Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role of increased LV contractility in both obstructive and non-obstructive forms of HCM, suggesting common disease mechanisms and anticipating shared response to therapy. Taken together, the findings significantly increase our understanding of the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of HCM, with potential implications for disease management.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Using advanced techniques, new evidence has highlighted the existence of other structures that participate in intercellular communication. Extracellular vesicles can carry transcripts and signaling molecules. Microvilli on the oocyte can induce the formation of TZPs and secrete OSFs.

Selective modulation of these APC activities contributes to our understanding of the regulation of these physiological mechanisms and permits the development of therapeutics for the pathologies associated with these pathways.

Twenty-one nanobodies were identified that selectively recognize APC compared with the protein C zymogen. Overall, 3 clusters of nanobodies were identified based on the competition for APC in biolayer interferometry studies. APC functional assays for anticoagulant activity, histone H3 cleavage, and protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) cleavage were used to understand their diversity. These functional assays revealed 13 novel nanobody-induced APC activity profiles via the selective modulation of APC pleiotropic activities, with the potential to regulate specific mechanisms for therapeutic purposes. Within these, 3 nanobodies (LP2, LP8, and LP17) inhibited all 3 APC functions. Four nanobodies (LP1, LP5, LP16, and LP20) inhibited only 2 of the 3 functions. Monofunction inhibition specific to APC anticoagulation activity was observed only by 2 nanobodies (LP9 and LP11). LP11 was also found to shift the ratio of APC cleavage of PAR1 at R46 relative to R41, which results in APC-mediated biased PAR1 signaling and APC cytoprotective effects. Thus, LP11 has an activity profile that could potentially promote hemostasis and cytoprotection in bleedings associated with hemophilia or coagulopathy by selectively modulating APC anticoagulation and PAR1 cleavage profile.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Protein C", "Receptor, PAR-1", "Single-Domain Antibodies", "Endothelial Cells", "Anticoagulants", "Antibodies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Derek S", "Last Name": "Sim", "Affiliation": "Coagulant Therapeutics Corporation, Berkeley, CA."}, {"First Name": "Meenal", "Last Name": "Shukla", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Cornell R", "Last Name": "Mallari", "Affiliation": "Coagulant Therapeutics Corporation, Berkeley, CA."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 A", "Last Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, La Jolla, CA."}, {"First Name": "Doug", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Consultants for Coagulant Therapeutics, Berkeley, CA."}, {"First Name": "Maxine", "Last Name": "Bauzon", "Affiliation": "Consultants for Coagulant Therapeutics, Berkeley, CA."}, {"First Name": "Terry W", "Last Name": "Hermiston", "Affiliation": "Coagulant Therapeutics Corporation, Berkeley, CA."}, {"First Name": "Laurent O", "Last Name": "Mosnier", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Medicine, Scripps Research, La Jolla, CA."}], "Journal": "Blood advances", "PubDate": "2023Jul11"}, {"PMID": "36733737", "Title": "Quantitative tumor depth determination using dual wavelength excitation fluorescence.", "Abstract": "Quantifying solid tumor margins with fluorescence-guided surgery approaches is a challenge, particularly when using near infrared (NIR) wavelengths due to increased penetration depths.

The surface terminations, intercalants, and the interfaces between MXenes and other substances are of importance for tuning the properties of MXenes. For instance, surface termination of MXenes can change the density of states at the Fermi levels to make MXenes electronically tunable. Different terminations can lead to band opening and changes in behavior from metallic to semiconducting, as well as dramatic changes in the work function of MXenes. On the other hand, electron transfer occurring at the interface between MXenes and other substances due to the physical interaction/chemical bonding, changes the electron configuration of MXenes and realizes the functionalization. In this review, the most up-to-date progress of the surface and interface regulation of MXenes is comprehensively summarized, introducing the effect of various synthesis methods on the surface and interface chemistry, the routes on tuning the surface and interface chemistry, and the related potential applications.

Modulator of apoptosis-1 (MOAP1), also named MAP-1, belongs to the PNMA gene family and plays a key role in regulating apoptosis and tumor growth. However, its influences on NSCLC are largely unclear, and thus were explored in our present study, particularly the underlying mechanisms. Here, we initially find that MOAP1 expression is significantly decreased in NSCLC patients compared with the normal ones, and negatively correlated with the TNM and pathologic stages among patients. Additionally, MOAP1 low expression predicts a poorer prognosis than that of the NSCLC patients expressing higher MOAP1. Our in\u00a0vitro studies confirm much lower MOAP1 expression in NSCLC cell lines. Of note, promoting MOAP1 expression strongly reduces the proliferation and induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells, accompanied with cell cycle arrest distributed in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, we find that MOAP1 has a negative correlation with Th2 cells' infiltration, but a positive correlation with the infiltration levels of eosinophils. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process is also greatly restrained in NSCLC cells with MOAP1 over-expression, as proved by the reduced migration and invasion of cells. We further identify a positive correlation between MOAP1 and tripartite motif-containing 68 (TRIM68) in patients with NSCLC. Further analysis shows that TRIM68 directly interacts with MOAP1 and stabilizes MOAP1. Importantly, TRIM68 can activate MOAP1 by inducing the K63-linked polyubiquitination of MOAP1. Finally, animal studies verify that promoting MOAP1 efficiently suppresses tumor growth and lung metastasis in the nude mice. Collectively, our results reveal a novel mechanism through which MOAP1 stabilized by TRIM68 inhibits NSCLC development and targeting MOAP1 for its up-regulation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for NSCLC treatment.", "Keywords": ["EMT", "K63-linked polyubiquitination", "MOAP1", "NSCLC", "TRIM68"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Apoptosis", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice, Nude", "Humans", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins", "Tripartite Motif Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China; Department of Basic Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China."}, {"First Name": "Mengting", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China."}, {"First Name": "Aihua", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenrong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, China.

However, the overexpression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) protein restricted ROS production through a negative feedback pathway in tumor cells, promoting tumor progression, and weakening the effect of drug therapy. Here, a PROTACs nanodrug delivery system (PN) was constructed to increase ROS generation by degrading the NQO1 protein. Specifically, a PROTAC (proteolytic targeting chimera) molecule DQ was designed and synthesized. Then DQ and withaferin A (WA, an inducer of ROS) were loaded into PNs. DQ degraded the overexpressed NQO1 protein in tumor cells through a protein ubiquitination degradation pathway, thereby weakening the antioxidant capacity of tumor cells. Meanwhile, the reduction of NQO1 could inhibit the negative feedback effect of ROS production, thus increasing ROS generation. It has been demonstrated that PNs can significantly increase ROS production and possess potent antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo. This nanoplatform may offer an alternative approach to treating tumors with NQO1 overexpression.", "Keywords": ["NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1", "PROTAC nanoplatform", "antitumor", "reactive oxygen species", "withaferin A"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Haili", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Bioactive Natural Product Research, School of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tong Jia Xiang, Nanjing 210009, P.

Here we reveal two physiological contexts that generate accessible PM cholesterol and engage the Aster pathway in the liver: fasting and reverse cholesterol transport. During fasting, adipose-tissue-derived fatty acids activate hepatocyte sphingomyelinase to liberate sequestered PM cholesterol. Aster-dependent cholesterol transport during fasting facilitates cholesteryl ester formation, cholesterol movement into bile and very low-density lipoprotein production. During reverse cholesterol transport, high-density lipoprotein delivers excess cholesterol to the hepatocyte PM through scavenger receptor class B member 1. Loss of hepatic Asters impairs cholesterol movement into feces, raises plasma cholesterol levels and causes cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissues.

However, climate change entails changes not only in mean temperature but also in temperature fluctuation, and how this fluctuation regulates the thermal response of microbial respiration has never been systematically evaluated. By analysing subtropical forest soils from a 2,000\u2009km transect across China, we showed that although a positive relationship between soil microbial biomass-specific respiration and temperature was observed under increased constant incubation temperature, an increasing temperature fluctuation had a stronger negative effect.

"Telomerase has long been considered as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and a therapeutic target for drug discovery. Detecting telomerase activity in vivo could provide more direct information of tumor progression and response to drug treatment, which, however, is hampered by the lack of an effective probe that can generate an output signal without a tissue penetration depth limit. In this study, using the principle of distance-dependent magnetic resonance tuning, we constructed a telomerase-activated magnetic resonance imaging probe (TAMP) by connecting superparamagnetic ferroferric oxide nanoparticles (SPFONs) and paramagnetic Gd-DOTA (Gd(III) 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) complexes via telomerase-responsive DNA motifs. Upon telomerase-catalyzed extension of the primer in TAMP, Gd-DOTA-conjugated oligonucleotides can be liberated from the surface of SPFONs through a DNA strand displacement reaction, restoring the T1 signal of the Gd-DOTA for a direct readout of the telomerase activity. Here we show that, by tracking telomerase activity, this probe provides consistent monitoring of tumor growth kinetics during progression and in response to drug treatment and enables in situ screening of telomerase inhibitors in whole-animal models. This study provides an alternative toolkit for cancer diagnosis, treatment response assessment, and anticancer drug screening.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Telomerase", "Kinetics", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junduan", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "MOE Key Laboratory for Analytical Science of Food Safety and Biology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Analysis and Detection Technology for Food Safety, State Key Laboratory of Photocatalysis on Energy and Environment, College of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, P.R.

Different 3-dimensional computational models based on the patient-specific carotids were constructed to calculate hemodynamic parameters, including flow velocity, time-averaged wall shear (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI) and relative residence time (RRT). The results demonstrated that exercise training increased TAWSS but decreased OSI and RRT in some cases after the intervention, and high-intensity exercise further suppressed the adverse blood flow. However, exercise training remarkably reduced TAWSS and elevated OSI and RRT in patients with mild stenosis at upstream of stented segment. Additionally, we discovered that the hemodynamic environment change induced by exercise training was not significant compared to the stent position in some cases. Exercise had a less beneficial impact on the disturbed blood flow after the distal common carotid artery (CCA) stenting.

The impacts of water content and foliation angle on the stress-strain curves and basic mechanical properties of the Phyllite were analyzed. The experimental results indicate that the peak stress and peak strain decrease first and then increase with increasing foliation angle as a U-shape or V-shape, and the phyllite specimens are weakened significantly by the presence of water. Moreover, an approach with acoustic emission, digital image correlation, and scanning electron microscopic is employed to observe and analyze the macroscopic and mesoscopic failure process. The results show that tensile microcracks dominate during the progressive failure of phyllite, and their initiation, propagation, and coalescence are the main reasons for the failure of the phyllite specimens. The water acts on biotite and clay minerals that are main components of phyllite, and it contributes to the initiation, propagation, and coalescence of numerous microcracks. Finally, four failure modes are classified as followed: (a) for the specimens with small foliation angles \u03b1 = 0\u00b0 or 30\u00b0 (Saturated), both shear sliding and tensile-split across the foliation planes; (b) for the specimens with low to medium foliation angles \u03b1 = 30\u00b0 (Dry) or 45\u00b0(Saturated), shear sliding dominates the foliation planes; (c) for the specimens with medium to high foliation angles \u03b1 = 45\u00b0 (Dry) or 60\u00b0, shear sliding dominates the foliation planes; (d) for the specimens with high foliation angles \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, tensile-split dominates the foliation planes.", "Keywords": ["AE parameter analysis", "DIC method", "anisotropic rock", "crack evolution", "failure modes", "phyllite"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guanping", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Safety and Health for Metal Mines, Sinosteel Maanshan General Institute of Mining Research Co., Ltd., Maanshan 243000, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianhua", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Safety and Health for Metal Mines, Sinosteel Maanshan General Institute of Mining Research Co., Ltd., Maanshan 243000, China."}, {"First Name": "Yabin", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Changsha Institute of Mining Research Co., Ltd., Changsha 410012, China."}, {"First Name": "Zong-Xian", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Oulu Mining School, University of Oulu, 90570 Oulu, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Safety and Health for Metal Mines, Sinosteel Maanshan General Institute of Mining Research Co., Ltd., Maanshan 243000, China."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "School of Resources and Safety Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "Journal": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2022Dec15"}, {"PMID": "36550400", "Title": "Prevalence of frailty among patients with inflammatory bowel disease and its association with clinical outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Studies have reported frailty as an independent risk factor of mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

By combining with guide stars, wavefront shaping is emerging as a powerful tool to make scattering media optically transparent. However, for in vivo biomedical applications, the speeds of existing techniques are still too slow to accommodate the fast speckle decorrelation of live tissue. To address this key bottleneck, we develop a quaternary phase encoding scheme to enable single-exposure time-reversed ultrasonically encode optical focusing with full-phase modulations. Specifically, we focus light inside dynamic scattering media with an average mode time down to 29 ns, which indicates that more than 104 effective spatial modes can be controlled within 1\u00a0millisecond. With this technique, we demonstrate in vivo light focusing in between a highly opaque adult zebrafish of 5.1 millimeters in thickness and a ground glass diffuser.

However, elucidating the role played by miR-30c-5p in the silicosis-associated EMT process remains a great challenge. In this work, based on the establishment of mouse silicosis and A549 cells EMT models, miR-30c-5p was interfered with in vivo and in vitro models to reveal its effects on EMT and autophagy. Moreover, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), and autophagy were further interfered with in the A549 cells models to uncover the possible molecular mechanism through which miR-30c-5p inhibits silicosis associated EMT. The results demonstrated the targeted binding of miR-30c-5p to CTGF, ATG5, and MALAT1, and showed that miR-30c-5p could prevent EMT in lung epithelial cells by acting on CTGF and ATG5-associated autophagy, thereby inhibiting the silicosis fibrosis process.

Here, we show that an adipocyte-selective product of the Clstn3 locus (CLSTN3\u03b2) present in only placental mammals facilitates the efficient use of stored triglyceride by limiting lipid droplet (LD) expansion. CLSTN3\u03b2 is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that localizes to ER-LD contact sites through a conserved hairpin-like domain. Mice lacking CLSTN3\u03b2 have abnormal LD morphology and altered substrate use in brown adipose tissue, and are more susceptible to cold-induced hypothermia despite having no defect in adrenergic signalling. Conversely, forced expression of CLSTN3\u03b2 is sufficient to enforce a multilocular LD phenotype in cultured cells and adipose tissue. CLSTN3\u03b2 associates with cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector proteins and impairs their ability to transfer lipid between LDs, thereby restricting LD fusion and expansion. Functionally, increased LD surface area in CLSTN3\u03b2-expressing adipocytes promotes engagement of the lipolytic machinery and facilitates fatty acid oxidation.

has not yet been completely defined. SETD1A (histone lysine methyltransferase SET domain-containing 1A) is related to the occurrence of various cancers. However, the role of SETD1A in nasopharyngeal carcinoma remains unclear. The SETD1A overexpression vector, si-NC, si-SETD1A#1, and si-SETD1A#2 were transfected into nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells to overexpress or knockdown SETD1A expression. The assay of biofunction was used to explore the role of SETD1A in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. The assay of glucose uptake, lactate release, ATP level, western blot, cell proliferation, and cellular apoptosis analysis were performed to investigate the potential mechanism of SETD1A regulation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This study was the first to show that SETD1A was upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and the overexpression of SETD1A significantly promoted the cell proliferation and glycolysis and suppressed the cellular apoptosis. Moreover, SETD1A enhances aerobic glycolysis and cell biological function of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. SETD1A induced PI3K/AKT activation and subsequently prevented cellular apoptosis. In conclusion, this study identified overexpressed SETD1A as a positive regulator of proliferation that induced nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells' aerobic glycolysis via PI3K/AKT signaling activation in vitro. This study laid a strong foundation for unveiling the precise anticancer mechanism of SETD1A. The SETD1A may become a novel biomarker for further inhibitor design to obstruct the PI3K/AKT-dependent nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression.", "Keywords": ["PI3K/AKT", "SETD1A", "glycolysis", "nasopharyngeal carcinoma", "proliferation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianyi", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Classics of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taizhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taizhou, Jiangsu, 225300, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinshu", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taizhou, Jiangsu, 225300, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taizhou, Jiangsu, 225300, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueshen", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Taizhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Taizhou, Jianshu, 22530, China."}, {"First Name": "Xia", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Changzhou Second People's Hospital, No. 1 29, Xinglong Lane, Tianning District, Changzhou, Jiangsu, 213003, China."}], "Journal": "Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36471327", "Title": "Similarities and differences between MIS-C and KD: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a new syndrome with some clinical manifestations similar to Kawasaki disease (KD), which is difficult to distinguish.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome", "COVID-19", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome", "Immunoglobulins, Intravenous", "C-Reactive Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tong", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, No. 3333 Binsheng Road, Hangzhou, 310052, P.R.

Phycocyanin, which is commonly extracted from Spirulina platensis, has been explored as a natural blue pigment for application in the food industry. It is also used as a nutraceutical in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products because of its potentially beneficial biological properties, such as radical scavenging, immune modulating, and lipid peroxidase activities. The biggest challenges to the widespread application of phycocyanin for this purpose are its high sensitivity to chemical degradation when exposed to heat, light, acids, high pressure, heavy metal cations, and denaturants. Consequently, it is of considerable importance to improve its chemical stability, which requires a thorough knowledge of the relationship between the structure, environment, and chemical reactivity of phycocyanin. To increase the application of this natural pigment and nutraceutical within foods and other products, the structure, biological activities, and factors affecting its stability are reviewed, as well as strategies that have been developed to improve its stability.

The sample shows microsphere morphology composed of nanosheets with interfacial interactions between the components. It possesses an overpotential of -136\u2005mV at -10\u2005mA\u2009cm-2 in acid medium, which is superior to that of single component and most two-phase heterostructures. Especially, the overpotential at -200\u2005mA\u2009cm-2 is smaller than that of Pt/C. The excellent performance can be attributed to the d-orbital upshift of the Co active sites due to charge redistribution between the three-phase heterojunction and the optimization of the hydrogen free energy.

This study aims to explore the key mechanisms in the crosstalk between sarcopenia and HCC based on multi-omics profiling. A total of 136 male patients with HCC were enrolled. Sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for poor outcomes after liver transplantation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Inflammatory cytokine and metabolomic profiling on these patients identified elevated plasma sTNF-R1/CHI3L1 and dysregulated lipid metabolism as related to sarcopenia and tumor recurrence risk concurrently (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Integrated analysis revealed close relationship between CHI3L1 and fatty acid metabolism. In mouse cachectic models by intraperitoneal injection of H22\u00a0cells, CHI3L1 was significantly elevated in the atrophic muscle tissue, as well as in circulation. In-vitro, CHI3L1 was up-regulated in muscle cells to protect itself from inflammatory damage through TNF-\u03b1/TNF-R1 signaling. CHI3L1 secreted by the muscle cells promoted the invasion of co-cultured HCC cells. Tumor tissue transcriptome data for 73 out of the 136 patients revealed that CHI3L1 may regulate fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress. In vitro, CHI3L1 caused ROS and lipid accumulation. Targeted lipid profiling further proved that CHI3L1 was able to activate arachidonic acid metabolism, leading to lipid peroxide (LPO) accumulation. Meanwhile, LPO inhibition could compromise the remarkable pro-cancerous effects of CHI3L1. In conclusion, sarcopenia adversely affects the outcomes of liver transplantation for HCC. In sarcopenic patients, CHI3L1 was up-regulated and secreted by the skeletal muscle to protect itself through TNF-\u03b1/TNF-R1 signaling, which, in turn, can promote HCC tumor progression by inducing LPO accumulation.", "Keywords": ["CHI3L1", "Hepatocellular carcinoma", "Lipid peroxide", "Metabolomic", "Sarcopenia"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Male", "Mice", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1", "Chitinases", "Fatty Acids", "Lipids", "Liver Neoplasms", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I", "Sarcopenia", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Oncology and Intelligent Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310006, China;

TBAD is initiated by an intimal tear that allows blood to flow between the aortic wall layers, causing them to separate. As a result, alongside the original aorta (true lumen), a false lumen (FL) develops. TBAD compromises the whole cardiovascular system, in the worst case resulting in complete aortic rupture. Clinical studies have shown that dilation and rupture of the FL are related to the failure of the FL to thrombose. Complete FL thrombosis has been found to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic TBAD and is the desired outcome of any treatment. Partial FL thrombosis has been associated with late dissection-related deaths and the requirement for re-intervention, thus the level of FL thrombosis is dominant in classifying the risk of TBAD patients. Therefore, it is important to investigate and understand under which conditions complete thrombosis of the FL occurs. Method: Local FL hemodynamics play an essential role in thrombus formation and growth. In this study, we developed a simplified phenomenological model to predict FL thrombosis in TBAD under physiological flow conditions. Based on an existing shear-driven thrombosis model, a comprehensive model reduction study was performed to improve computational efficiency. The reduced model has been implemented in Ansys CFX and applied to a TBAD case following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to test the model. Predicted thrombus formation based on post-TEVAR geometry at 1-month was compared to actual thrombus formation observed on a 3-year follow-up CT scan. Results: The predicted FL status is in excellent agreement with the 3-year follow-up scan, both in terms of thrombus location and total volume, thus validating the new model. The computational cost of the new model is significantly lower than the previous thrombus model, with an approximate 65% reduction in computational time. Such improvement means the new model is a significant step towards clinical applicability. Conclusion: The thrombosis model developed in this study is accurate and efficient at predicting FL thrombosis based on patient-specific data, and may assist clinicians in choosing individualized treatments in the future.", "Keywords": ["computational fluid dynamics", "false lumen thrombosis", "phenomenological modelling", "thoracic endovascular aortic repair", "type B aortic dissection"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alireza", "Last Name": "Jafarinia", "Affiliation": "Institute of Strength of Materials, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Chl\u00f6e H", "Last Name": "Armour", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Richard G J", "Last Name": "Gibbs", "Affiliation": "Regional Vascular Unit, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Yun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Hochrainer", "Affiliation": "Institute of Strength of Materials, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36384587", "Title": "Periodontal soft tissue increase induced by periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics surgery.", "Abstract": "To quantitatively assess periodontal soft tissue changes, including gingival thickness and keratinized gingiva width after periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO) surgery by digital measurements.\u00a0 METHODS: This study enrolled 15 maxillaries with 89 anterior teeth and 16 mandibles with 94 anterior teeth from Chinese adult patients with skeletal Angle Class III malocclusion for whom PAOO surgery was proposed during orthodontic treatment.

Evidence suggests that NLRP3 activation involves changes in intracellular K+. Nuclear Enriched Transcript Sort Sequencing (NETSseq), which allows for deep sequencing of purified cell types from human post-mortem brain tissue, demonstrated a highly specific expression of the tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K+ channel 1 (THIK-1) in microglia compared to other glial and neuronal cell types in the human brain. NETSseq also showed a significant increase of THIK-1 in microglia isolated from cortical regions of brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) relative to control donors. Herein, we report the discovery and pharmacological characterisation of C101248, the first selective small-molecule inhibitor of THIK-1. C101248 showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of both mouse and human THIK-1 (IC50: \u223c50\u00a0nM) and was inactive against K2P family members TREK-1 and TWIK-2, and Kv2.1. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of microglia from mouse hippocampal slices showed that C101248 potently blocked both tonic and ATP-evoked THIK-1 K+ currents. Notably, C101248 had no effect on other constitutively active resting conductance in slices from THIK-1-depleted mice. In isolated microglia, C101248 prevented NLRP3-dependent release of IL-1\u03b2, an effect not seen in THIK-1-depleted microglia. In conclusion, we demonstrated that inhibiting THIK-1 (a microglia specific gene that is upregulated in brains from donors with AD) using a novel selective modulator attenuates the NLRP3-dependent release of IL-1\u03b2 from microglia, which suggests that this channel may be a potential therapeutic target for the modulation of neuroinflammation in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "KCNK13", "Microglia", "NLRP3 inflammasome", "Neuroinflammation", "THIK-1"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Inflammasomes", "Microglia", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bernardino", "Last Name": "Ossola", "Affiliation": "Cerevance Ltd, 418 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0PZ, UK.

The intensive application of chemical insecticides to A. gossypii led to the development of resistance against several insecticides, including imidacloprid. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the association between imidacloprid resistance and the fitness of A. gossypii to limit the spread of the resistant population under field contexts. In this study, we used the age-stage, two-sex life table method to comprehensively investigate the fitness of imidacloprid resistant (ImR) and susceptible strains (SS) of melon aphids. Results showed that ImR aphids have prolonged developmental stages and decreased longevity, fecundity, and reproductive days. The key demographic parameters (r, \u03bb, and R0) were significantly reduced in ImR strain compared to SS aphids. Additionally, the molecular mechanism for fitness costs was investigated by comparing the expression profile of juvenile hormone-binding protein (JHBP), juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (JHEH), juvenile hormone acid O-methyltransferase (JHAMT), Vitellogenin (Vg), ecdysone receptor (EcR), and ultraspiracle protein (USP) supposed to be associated with development and reproduction in insects. The results of RT-qPCR showed that EcR, JHBP, JHAMT, JHEH, and Vg genes were downregulated, while USP was statistically the same in ImR A. gossypii compared to the SS strain.

However, evidence for this association is limited and inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether the association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality.

Methods: In this two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, instrumental variables (IVs) for RA were derived from a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis including 58,284 subjects. Summary statistics for CD originated from a GWAS meta-analysis with 15,283 subjects. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis. Four complementary methods were applied, including the weighted-median, weighted mode, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test and MR-Egger regression, to strengthen the effect estimates. Results: Positive causal effects of genetically increased RA risk on CD were derived [IVW odds ratio (OR): 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-1.79, p = 3.21E-04]. The results of reverse MR analysis demonstrated no significant causal effect of CD on RA (IVW OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.91-1.21, p = 0.499).
