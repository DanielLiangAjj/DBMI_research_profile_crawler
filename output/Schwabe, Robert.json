The two tissue compartments containing Sox10 + cells in the surrounding of taste buds include the connective tissue core of taste papillae and von Ebner's glands (vEGs) that are connected to the trench of circumvallate and foliate papillae. In this study, we used inducible Cre mouse models to map the cell lineages of connective tissue (including stromal and Schwann cells) and vEGs and performed single cell RNA-sequencing of the epithelium of Sox10-Cre/tdT mouse circumvallate/vEG complex. In vivo lineage mapping showed that the distribution of traced cells in circumvallate taste buds was closely linked with that in the vEGs, but not in the connective tissue. Sox10 , but not the known stem cells marker Lgr5 , expression was enriched in the cell clusters of main ducts of vEGs that contained abundant proliferating cells, while Sox10-Cre/tdT expression was enriched in type-III taste bud cells and excretory ductal cells. Moreover, multiple genes encoding pathogen receptors are enriched in the vEG main ducts.

While induction of oxidative stress is well established in fibrotic livers, there is limited information on stress-mediated mechanisms of HSC activation. Cellular stress triggers an adaptive defense mechanism via master protein homeostasis regulator, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which induces heat shock proteins to respond to proteotoxic stress. Although the importance of HSF1 in restoring cellular homeostasis is well-established, its potential role in liver fibrosis is unknown. Here, we show that HSF1 messenger RNA is induced in human cirrhotic and murine fibrotic livers. Hepatocytes exhibit nuclear HSF1, whereas stellate cells expressing alpha smooth muscle actin do not express nuclear HSF1 in human cirrhosis. Interestingly, despite nuclear HSF1, murine fibrotic livers did not show induction of HSF1 DNA binding activity compared with controls. HSF1-deficient mice exhibit augmented HSC activation and fibrosis despite limited pro-inflammatory cytokine response and display delayed fibrosis resolution. Stellate cell and hepatocyte-specific HSF1 knockout mice exhibit higher induction of profibrogenic response, suggesting an important role for HSF1 in HSC activation and fibrosis. Stable expression of dominant negative HSF1 promotes fibrogenic activation of HSCs. Overactivation of HSF1 decreased phosphorylation of JNK and prevented HSC activation, supporting a protective role for HSF1. Our findings identify an unconventional role for HSF1 in liver fibrosis. Conclusion: Our results show that deficiency of HSF1 is associated with exacerbated HSC activation promoting liver fibrosis, whereas activation of HSF1 prevents profibrogenic HSC activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Animals", "Cytokines", "Heat Shock Transcription Factors", "Heat-Shock Proteins", "Heat-Shock Response", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "RNA, Messenger"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Asmita", "Last Name": "Choudhury", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anuradha", "Last Name": "Ratna", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arlene", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "Sebastian", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher L", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aveline A", "Last Name": "Filliol", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Bledsoe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chengkai", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert F", "Last Name": "Schwabe", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D", "Last Name": "Shoulders", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pranoti", "Last Name": "Mandrekar", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA."}], "Journal": "Hepatology communications", "PubDate": "2022Oct"}, {"PMID": "35923109", "Title": "Mouse model of NASH that replicates key features of the human disease and progresses to fibrosis stage 3.", "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the United States and the world; with no Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological treatment available, it remains an area of unmet medical need.

Moreover, the Food and Drug Administration recommends that clinical trials for drugs to treat this disease include patients with fibrosis stage 2 or greater. Therefore, when using animal models for investigating the pathophysiology of NAFLD and for the preclinical evaluation of new drugs, it is important that the animals develop substantial fibrosis. The aim of this study was to develop a mouse model of NAFLD that replicated the disease in humans, including obesity and progressive liver fibrosis. Agouti yellow mutant mice, which have hyperphagia, were fed a Western diet and water containing high-fructose corn syrup for 16\u2009weeks. Mice became obese and developed glucose intolerance. Their gut microbiota showed dysbiosis with changes that replicate some of the changes described in humans with NASH.

Liver fibrosis is the consequence of sustained, iterative liver injury, and the main determinant of outcomes in NASH. The liver possesses remarkable inherent plasticity, and liver fibrosis can regress when the injurious agent is removed, thus providing opportunities to alter long-term outcomes through therapeutic interventions.

NAFLD is a metabolic disease that is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome; however, during the evolution of NAFLD from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to more advanced stages of NASH with liver fibrosis, the immune system plays an integral role. Triggers for inflammation are rooted in hepatic (lipid overload, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress) and extrahepatic (gut-liver axis, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle) systems, resulting in unique immune-mediated pathomechanisms in NAFLD. In recent years, the implementation of single-cell RNA-sequencing and high dimensional multi-omics (proteogenomics, lipidomics) and spatial transcriptomics have tremendously advanced our understanding of the complex heterogeneity of various liver immune cell subsets in health and disease. In NAFLD, several emerging inflammatory mechanisms have been uncovered, including profound macrophage heterogeneity, auto-aggressive T cells, the role of unconventional T cells and platelet-immune cell interactions, potentially yielding novel therapeutics. In this review, we will highlight the recent discoveries related to inflammation in NAFLD, discuss the role of immune cell subsets during the different stages of the disease (including disease regression) and integrate the multiple systems driving inflammation. We propose a refined concept by which the immune system contributes to all stages of NAFLD and discuss open scientific questions arising from this paradigm shift that need to be unravelled in the coming years.

In chronic liver disease, fibrosis is a major factor determining outcomes, but efficient antifibrotic therapies are lacking. Although platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 constitute key fibrogenic mediators, they do not account for the well-established link between cell death and fibrosis in the liver. Here, we hypothesized that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may link epithelial cell death to fibrogenesis in the injured liver. DAMP receptor screening identified purinergic receptor P2Y14 among several candidates as highly enriched in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver. Conversely, P2Y14 ligands uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose and UDP-galactose were enriched in hepatocytes and were released upon different modes of cell death. Accordingly, ligand-receptor interaction analysis that combined proteomic and single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed P2Y14 ligands and P2Y14 receptor as a link between dying cells and HSCs, respectively. Treatment with P2Y14 ligands or coculture with dying hepatocytes promoted HSC activation in a P2Y14-dependent manner. P2Y14 ligands activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling in HSCs, resulting in ERK-dependent HSC activation. Global and HSC-selective P2Y14 deficiency attenuated liver fibrosis in multiple mouse models of liver injury. Functional expression of P2Y14 was confirmed in healthy and diseased human liver and human HSCs. In conclusion, P2Y14 ligands and their receptor constitute a profibrogenic DAMP pathway that directly links cell death to fibrogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Ligands", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Mice", "Proteomics", "Receptors, Purinergic P2", "Receptors, Purinergic P2Y", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Uridine Diphosphate", "YAP-Signaling Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ingmar", "Last Name": "Mederacke", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aveline", "Last Name": "Filliol", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Affo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ajay", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Celine", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiuyan", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Hamberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Brundu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Aashreya", "Last Name": "Ravichandra", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Huebener", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helena", "Last Name": "Anke", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongxue", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raquel A", "Last Name": "Mart\u00ednez Garc\u00eda de la Torre", "Affiliation": "Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil C", "Last Name": "Henderson", "Affiliation": "Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Florian W R", "Last Name": "Vondran", "Affiliation": "Department of General, Visceral and Transplant Surgery, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Carla V", "Last Name": "Rothlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology and Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06519, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heike", "Last Name": "Baehre", "Affiliation": "Research Core Unit Metabolomics, Institute of Pharmacology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pau", "Last Name": "Sancho-Bru", "Affiliation": "Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Robert F", "Last Name": "Schwabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2022Apr06"}, {"PMID": "35333579", "Title": "Nuclear HMGB1 protects from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through negative regulation of liver X receptor.", "Abstract": "Dysregulations of lipid metabolism in the liver may trigger steatosis progression, leading to potentially severe clinical consequences such as nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLDs). Molecular mechanisms underlying liver lipogenesis are very complex and fine-tuned by chromatin dynamics and multiple key transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear factor HMGB1 acts as a strong repressor of liver lipogenesis. Mice with liver-specific Hmgb1 deficiency display exacerbated liver steatosis, while Hmgb1-overexpressing mice exhibited a protection from fatty liver progression when subjected to nutritional stress. Global transcriptome and functional analysis revealed that the deletion of Hmgb1 gene enhances LXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 activity. HMGB1 repression is not mediated through nucleosome landscape reorganization but rather via a preferential DNA occupation in a region carrying genes regulated by LXR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3. Together, these findings suggest that hepatocellular HMGB1 protects from liver steatosis development. HMGB1 may constitute a new attractive option to therapeutically target the LXR\u03b1-PPAR\u03b3 axis during NAFLD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name":

Disease stages range from steatosis via steatohepatitis and fibrosis to cirrhosis, severe alcohol-associated hepatitis and liver cancer. ALD is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage of progression with no effective therapies. A major research goal is to improve diagnosis, prognosis and also treatments for early ALD. This however needs prioritization of this disease for financial investment in basic and clinical research to more deeply investigate mechanisms and identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets for early detection and intervention. Topics of interest are communication of the liver with other organs of the body, especially the gut microbiome, the individual genetic constitution, systemic and liver innate inflammation, including bacterial infections, as well as fate and number of hepatic stellate cells and the composition of the extracellular matrix in the liver. Additionally, mechanical forces and damaging stresses towards the sophisticated vessel system of the liver, including the especially equipped sinusoidal endothelium and the biliary tract, work together to mediate hepatocytic import and export of nutritional and toxic substances, adapting to chronic liver disease by morphological and functional changes. All the aforementioned parameters contribute to the outcome of alcohol use disorder and the risk to develop advanced disease stages including cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis and liver cancer.

"Title": "Leukocyte-Derived High-Mobility Group Box 1 Governs Hepatic Immune Responses to Listeria monocytogenes.", "Abstract": "High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nucleoprotein with proinflammatory functions following cellular release during tissue damage. Moreover, antibody-mediated HMGB1 neutralization alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock, suggesting a role for HMGB1 as a superordinate therapeutic target for inflammatory and infectious diseases. Recent genetic studies have indicated cell-intrinsic functions of HMGB1 in phagocytes as critical elements of immune responses to infections, yet the role of extracellular HMGB1 signaling in this context remains elusive. We performed antibody-mediated and genetic HMGB1 deletion studies accompanied by in vitro experiments to discern context-dependent cellular sources and functions of extracellular HMGB1 during murine bloodstream infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Antibody-mediated neutralization of extracellular HMGB1 favors bacterial dissemination and hepatic inflammation in mice. Hepatocyte HMGB1, a key driver of postnecrotic inflammation in the liver, does not affect Listeria-induced inflammation or mortality. While we confirm that leukocyte HMGB1 deficiency effectuates disseminated listeriosis, we observed no evidence of dysfunctional autophagy, xenophagy, intracellular bacterial degradation, or inflammatory gene induction in primary HMGB1-deficient phagocytes or altered immune responses to LPS administration. Instead, we demonstrate that mice devoid of leukocyte HMGB1 exhibit impaired hepatic recruitment of inflammatory monocytes early during listeriosis, resulting in alterations of the transcriptional hepatic immune response and insufficient control of bacterial dissemination.

To identify new therapeutic targets, we performed single-cell and nuclear RNA-seq data set analyses on 17 human ovarian cancer specimens, revealing the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) as highly expressed in ovarian cancer cells. Conversely, oncostatin M (OSM), the ligand of OSMR, was highly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages and promoted proliferation and metastasis in cancer cells. Ovarian cancer cell lines and additional patient samples also exhibited elevated levels of OSMR when compared with other cell types in the tumor microenvironment or to normal ovarian tissue samples. OSMR was found to be important for ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration. Binding of OSM to OSMR caused OSMR-IL6ST dimerization, which is required to produce oncogenic signaling cues for prolonged STAT3 activation. Human monoclonal antibody clones B14 and B21 directed to the extracellular domain of OSMR abrogated OSM-induced OSMR-IL6ST heterodimerization, promoted the internalization and degradation of OSMR, and effectively blocked OSMR-mediated signaling in vitro. Importantly, these antibody clones inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by suppressing oncogenic signaling through OSMR and STAT3 activation. Collectively, this study provides a proof of principle that anti-OSMR antibody can mediate disruption of OSM-induced OSMR-IL6ST dimerization and oncogenic signaling, thus documenting the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of human OSMR antagonist antibodies for immunotherapy in ovarian cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uncovers a role for OSMR in promoting ovarian cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by activating STAT3 signaling and demonstrates the preclinical efficacy of

In patients, liver fibrosis typically develops over several decades and can progress to cirrhosis, and liver failure due to replacement of functional liver tissue with scar tissue. Additionally, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis are associated with an increased risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Here, we sought to understand these potentially opposing functions by interrogating functional relationships among CAF subtypes, their mediators, desmoplasia, and tumor growth in a wide range of tumor types metastasizing to the liver, the most common organ site for metastasis. Depletion of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which represented the main source of CAF in mice and patients in our study, or depletion of all CAF decreased tumor growth and mortality in desmoplastic colorectal and pancreatic metastasis but not in nondesmoplastic metastatic tumors. Single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis, as well as studies in immune cell-depleted and HSC-selective knockout mice, uncovered direct CAF-tumor interactions as a tumor-promoting mechanism, mediated by myofibroblastic CAF-secreted (myCAF-secreted) hyaluronan and inflammatory CAF-secreted (iCAF-secreted) HGF. These effects were opposed by myCAF-expressed type I collagen, which suppressed tumor growth by mechanically restraining tumor spread, overriding its own stiffness-induced mechanosignals. In summary, mechanical restriction by type I collagen opposes the overall tumor-promoting effects of CAF, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for their dual functions in cancer. Therapeutic targeting of tumor-promoting CAF mediators while preserving type I collagen may convert CAF from tumor promoting to tumor restricting.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Collagens", "Fibrosis", "Hepatology", "Oncology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Collagen Type I", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Humans", "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Mice, Knockout", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sonakshi", "Last Name": "Bhattacharjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Hamberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Aashreya", "Last Name": "Ravichandra", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maximilian", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ajay", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Affo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aveline", "Last Name": "Filliol", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "LiKang", "Last Name": "Chin", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas M", "Last Name": "Savage", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deqi", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naita Maren", "Last Name": "Wirsik", "Affiliation": "Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Mehal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Arpaia", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ekihiro", "Last Name": "Seki", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Mack", "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Minhang Hospital and School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raghu", "Last Name": "Kalluri", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ben Z", "Last Name": "Stanger", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca G", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ingmar", "Last Name": "Mederacke", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Robert F", "Last Name": "Schwabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2021Jun01"}, {"PMID": "33753162", "Title": "Prediction of in vivo supersaturation and precipitation of poorly water-soluble drugs: Achievements and aspirations.", "Abstract": "This review focuses on options available to a pharmaceutical scientist to predict in vivo supersaturation and precipitation of poorly water-soluble drugs.

of chronic disease. Deletion of the NF-\u03baB subunit c-Rel limits fibrosis in multiple organs, although the mechanistic nature of this protection is unresolved. Using cell-specific gene-targeting manipulations in mice undergoing liver damage, we elucidate a critical role for c-Rel in controlling metabolic changes required for inflammatory and fibrogenic activities of hepatocytes and macrophages and identify Pfkfb3 as the key downstream metabolic mediator of this response. Independent deletions of Rel in hepatocytes or macrophages suppressed liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride, while combined deletion had an additive anti-fibrogenic effect. In transforming growth factor-\u03b21-induced hepatocytes, c-Rel regulates expression of a pro-fibrogenic secretome comprising inflammatory molecules and connective tissue growth factor, the latter promoting collagen secretion from HMs. Macrophages lacking c-Rel fail to polarize to M1 or M2 states, explaining reduced fibrosis in Rel\u0394LysM mice. Pharmacological inhibition of c-Rel attenuated multi-organ fibrosis in both murine and human fibrosis. In conclusion, activation of c-Rel/Pfkfb3 in damaged tissue instigates a paracrine signalling network among epithelial, myeloid and mesenchymal cells to stimulate fibrogenesis.

obesity epidemic, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now the most common chronic liver disease, with almost 25% global prevalence. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ranges in severity from simple steatosis, a benign 'pre-disease' state, to the liver injury and inflammation that characterize nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which in turn predisposes individuals to liver fibrosis. Fibrosis is the major determinant of clinical outcomes in patients with NASH and is associated with increased risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH has no approved therapies, and liver fibrosis shows poor response to existing pharmacotherapy, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Patient and mouse data have shown that NASH is associated with the activation of developmental pathways: Notch, Hedgehog and Hippo-YAP-TAZ. Although these evolutionarily conserved fundamental signals are known to determine liver morphogenesis during development, new data have shown a coordinated and causal role for these pathways in the liver injury response, which becomes maladaptive during obesity-associated chronic liver disease. In this Review, we discuss the aetiology of this reactivation of developmental pathways and review the cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous mechanisms by which developmental pathways influence disease progression.

Macrophage MerTK promotes an ERK-TGF\u03b21 pathway that activates HSCs and induces liver fibrosis. These data provide insights into the role of liver macrophages in NASH fibrosis and provide a plausible mechanism underlying MERTK as a genetic risk factor for NASH fibrosis.", "Keywords": ["ADAM17", "MerTK", "MerTK cleavage", "NASH", "TGF\u03b2;", "hepatic stellate cells", "liver fibrosis", "macrophage", "nonalcoholic steatohepatitis", "retinoic acid"], "MeSH terms": ["ADAM17 Protein", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Chronic Disease", "Humans", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Rats", "c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bishuang", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function mouse models showed attenuated NASH-associated liver fibrosis, demonstrating causality to obesity-induced liver pathology.

Primary HSCs isolated from wild-type (WT), Nlrp3-/- , or Nlrp3L351PneoR knock-in crossed to inducible (estrogen receptor Cre-CreT) mice were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), or 4OH-tamoxifen, respectively.

Mice were then sacrificed; liver tissue and serum were harvested. Nlrp3 inflammasome activation along with HSC phenotype and fibrosis were assessed by RT-PCR, western blotting, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence (IF), and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\u00a0Stimulated WT HSCs displayed increased levels of NLRP3 inflammasome-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cathepsin B activity, accompanied by an up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of fibrotic makers, an effect abrogated in Nlrp3-/- HSCs.

Because of the wide landscape of genomic alterations and limited therapeutic success of targeting tumor cells, a recent focus has been on better understanding and possibly targeting the microenvironment in which liver tumors develop. A unique feature of liver cancer is its close association with liver fibrosis. More than 80% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) develop in fibrotic or cirrhotic livers, suggesting an important role of liver fibrosis in the premalignant environment (PME) of the liver. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), in contrast, is characterized by a strong desmoplasia that typically occurs in response to the tumor, suggesting a key role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and fibrosis in its tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we discuss the functional contributions of myofibroblasts, CAFs, and fibrosis to the development of HCC and CCA in the hepatic PME and TME, focusing on myofibroblast- and extracellular matrix-associated growth factors, fibrosis-associated immunosuppressive pathways, as well as mechanosensitive signaling cascades that are activated by increased tissue stiffness.

Whereas most of the activity of NF-\u03baB is regulated through the inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) kinase (IKK)-dependent degradation of I\u03baB, IKK also phosphorylates subunits of NF-\u03baB. We investigated the contribution of the phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 at the IKK phosphorylation site serine 536 (Ser(536)) in humans, which is thought to be required for the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. Through experiments with knock-in mice (S534A mice) expressing a mutant p65 with an alanine-to-serine substitution at position 534 (the murine homolog of human Ser(536)), we observed increased expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent genes after injection of mice with the inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or exposure to gamma irradiation, and the enhanced gene expression was most pronounced at late time points. Compared to wild-type mice, S534A mice displayed increased mortality after injection with LPS. Increased NF-\u03baB signaling in the S534A mice was at least in part explained by the increased stability of the S534A p65 protein compared to that of the Ser(534)-phosphorylated wild-type protein.

Reduced crystallization temperature of API, a parameter introduced by Zhou et al.,1 was utilized in this study for rank ordering interactions in API-polymeric systems. The trends in reduced crystallization temperature monitored over polymer concentration range of up to 20% polymer loading were utilized to calculate \"crystallization parameter\" or CP for two model systems (nifedipine and BI ABC). The rank order of CP, i.e., a measure of API-polymer interaction, for nifedipine followed the order PVP > PVP-VA > Soluplus > HPMCAS > PV Ac > PAA. This rank ordering was correlated to published results of molecular interactions and physical stability for nifedipine. A different rank ordering was observed for BI ABC: PAA > PVP > HPMCAS > Soluplus > PVPV-VA > PVAc. Interactions for BI ABC were not as differentiated when compared to nifedipine based on CP trends. BI ABC dispersions at drug loadings between 40 and 60% were physically stable for prolonged periods under ICH conditions as well as accelerated stress. We propose that large CP differences among polymers could be predictive of stability outcomes.

Our previous study suggested a potential contribution of NC derived cells to early immature fungiform taste buds in late embryonic (E18.5) and young postnatal (P1-10) mice. In the present study we demonstrated the contribution of the underlying connective tissue (CT) to mature taste buds in mouse tongue and soft palate. Three independent mouse models were used for fate mapping of NC and NC derived connective tissue cells: (1) P0-Cre/R26-tdTomato (RFP) to label NC, NC derived Schwann cells and derivatives; (2) Dermo1-Cre/RFP to label mesenchymal cells and derivatives; and (3) Vimentin-CreER/mGFP to label Vimentin-expressing CT cells and derivatives upon tamoxifen treatment. Both P0-Cre/RFP and Dermo1-Cre/RFP labeled cells were abundant in mature taste buds in lingual taste papillae and soft palate, but not in the surrounding epithelial cells. Concurrently, labeled cells were extensively distributed in the underlying CT.

Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are considered key inducers of sterile inflammation following cell death, but the relative contribution of specific DAMPs, including high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), is ill defined. Due to the postnatal lethality of Hmgb1-knockout mice, the role of HMGB1 in sterile inflammation and disease processes in vivo remains controversial. Here, using conditional ablation strategies, we have demonstrated that epithelial, but not bone marrow-derived, HMGB1 is required for sterile inflammation following injury. Epithelial HMGB1, through its receptor RAGE, triggered recruitment of neutrophils, but not macrophages, toward necrosis. In clinically relevant models of necrosis, HMGB1/RAGE-induced neutrophil recruitment mediated subsequent amplification of injury, depending on the presence of neutrophil elastase. Notably, hepatocyte-specific HMGB1 ablation resulted in 100% survival following lethal acetaminophen intoxication. In contrast to necrosis, HMGB1 ablation did not alter inflammation or mortality in response to TNF- or FAS-mediated apoptosis. In LPS-induced shock, in which HMGB1 was considered a key mediator, HMGB1 ablation did not ameliorate inflammation or lethality, despite efficient reduction of HMGB1 serum levels.

contributors mediating fibrogenesis hampers the design of effective antifibrotic therapies. Different cellular sources, including tissue-resident and bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, pericytes and epithelial cells, have been suggested to give rise to myofibroblasts, but their relative contributions remain controversial, with profound differences between organs and different diseases. Here we employ a novel Cre-transgenic mouse that marks 99% of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a liver-specific pericyte population, to demonstrate that HSCs give rise to 82-96% of myofibroblasts in models of toxic, cholestatic and fatty liver disease. Moreover, we exclude that HSCs function as facultative epithelial progenitor cells in the injured liver.

Adipose tissue also contributes significantly to RE storage. The present studies, employing genetic and nutritional interventions, explored factors that are responsible for regulating RE accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue and how these influence levels of retinoic acid (RA) and RA-responsive gene expression. Our data establish that acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) activity is not involved in RE synthesis in the liver, even when mice are nutritionally stressed by feeding a 25-fold excess retinol diet or upon ablation of cellular retinol-binding protein type I (CRBPI), which is proposed to limit retinol availability to ARATs. Unlike the liver, where lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) is responsible for all RE synthesis, this is not true for adipose tissue where Lrat-deficient mice display significantly elevated RE concentrations. However, when CrbpI is also absent, RE levels resemble wild-type levels, suggesting a role for CrbpI in RE accumulation in adipose tissue. Although expression of several RA-responsive genes is elevated in Lrat-deficient liver, employing a sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry protocol and contrary to what has been assumed for many years, we did not detect elevated concentrations of all-trans-RA. The elevated RA-responsive gene expression was associated with elevated hepatic triglyceride levels and decreased expression of Ppar\u03b4 and its downstream Pdk4 target, suggesting a role for RA in these processes in vivo.", "Keywords": ["9-cis-retinoic acid or 9-cis-RA", "cellular retinol-binding protein type I", "diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1", "retinol-binding protein or RBP4"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue, White", "Animals", "Epididymis", "Esterification", "Esters", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Liver", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "PPAR delta", "Phosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferase", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Acetyl-Transferring Kinase", "Retinoids", "Retinol O-Fatty-Acyltransferase", "Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nuttaporn", "Last Name": "Wongsiriroj", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roseann", "Last Name": "Piantedosi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kryscilla Jian Zhang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Johannes", "Last Name": "Kluwe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert F", "Last Name": "Schwabe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ira J", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of lipid research", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "24132111", "Title": "The microbiome and cancer.", "Abstract": "Microbiota and host form a complex 'super-organism' in which symbiotic relationships confer benefits to the host in many key aspects of life.

Moreover, it is not known whether other mononuclear phagocytes such as dendritic cells (DCs) contribute to hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and liver fibrosis. We show for the first time that hepatic macrophages enhance myofibroblast survival in a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-dependent manner and thereby promote liver fibrosis. Microarray and pathway analysis revealed no induction of HSC activation pathways by hepatic macrophages but a profound activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in HSCs. Conversely, depletion of mononuclear phagocytes during fibrogenesis in vivo resulted in suppressed NF-\u03baB activation in HSCs. Macrophage-induced activation of NF-\u03baB in HSCs in vitro and in vivo was mediated by interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Notably, IL-1 and TNF did not promote HSC activation but promoted survival of activated HSCs in vitro and in vivo and thereby increased liver fibrosis, as demonstrated by neutralization in coculture experiments and genetic ablation of IL-1 and TNF receptor in vivo. Coculture and in vivo ablation experiments revealed only a minor contribution to NF-\u03baB activation in HSCs by DCs, and no contribution of DCs to liver fibrosis development, respectively.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Survival", "Coculture Techniques", "Dendritic Cells", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Deletion", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Interleukin-1", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "NF-kappa B", "Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jean-Philippe", "Last Name": "Pradere", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Johannes", "Last Name": "Kluwe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuele", "Last Name": "De Minicis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jing-Jing", "Last Name": "Jiao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Geum-Youn", "Last Name": "Gwak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dianne H", "Last Name": "Dapito", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Myoung-Kuk", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nina D", "Last Name": "Guenther", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ingmar", "Last Name": "Mederacke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ana-Cristina", "Last Name": "Dragomir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Costica", "Last Name": "Aloman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert F", "Last Name": "Schwabe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}, {"PMID": "23220258", "Title": "Regulation of wound healing and organ fibrosis by toll-like receptors.", "Abstract": "Chronic injury often triggers maladaptive wound healing responses leading to the development of tissue fibrosis and subsequent organ malfunction. Inflammation is a key component of the wound healing process and promotes the development of organ fibrosis. Here, we review the contribution of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to wound healing with a particular focus on their role in liver, lung, kidney, skin and myocardial fibrosis. We discuss the role of TLRs on distinct cell populations that participate in the repair process following tissue injury, and the contribution of exogenous and endogenous TLR ligands to the wound healing response. Systemic review of the literature shows that TLRs promote tissue repair and fibrosis in many settings, albeit with profound differences between organs. In particular, TLRs exert a pronounced effect on fibrosis in organs with higher exposure to bacterial TLR ligands, such as the liver. Targeting TLR signaling at the ligand or receptor level may represent a novel strategy for the prevention of maladaptive wound healing and fibrosis in chronically injured organs.
