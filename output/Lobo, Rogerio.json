However, it remains unclear whether lean versus obesity status influences findings in the various phenotypes of women with PCOS. 274 women with PCOS were consecutively assessed. Among these women, there were 149 with phenotype A, 24 with phenotype B, 94 with phenotype C, and 7 with phenotype D. We found normal body weight to be very common (65%) in phenotype C patients, common (43%) in phenotype A and D patients, and less represented (but still 25%) in phenotype B patients. Obesity was common in phenotype B (54%) and phenotype A (33%) patients and uncommon in phenotype C (only 11%) and phenotype D (14%) patients. Obese and lean patients of each phenotype were compared. Compared to the phenotype C PCOS patients, both phenotype A and B patients had higher total testosterone circulating values and higher luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio (p < 0.01) while anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were higher only in phenotype A PCOS patients. Instead, in the three obese PCOS phenotypes no differences in serum insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) calculation, and lipid blood values were observed. Analysis of data of lean patients gave similar results. Compared to the phenotype C PCOS patients, both phenotype A and B patients had higher total testosterone circulating values and higher LH/FSH ratio (p < 0.01) while AMH levels were higher only in phenotype A PCOS patients. However, no differences were observed in the circulating insulin levels, HOMA-IR calculation, or blood lipids between the three groups of lean PCOS patients. We conclude that Rotterdam phenotypes express the differences between PCOS patients in terms of ovulatory pattern and androgen secretion but fail to differentiate between obese patients with altered metabolic patterns and lean patients with normal metabolic patterns.

The neuropeptide kisspeptin participates in the mechanism through stimulation of the hormone's production. The purpose of this study was to review the articles which compared kisspeptin levels in women with PCOS with those of controls. A systematic review of observational studies was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations. The selected studies encompassed a population of patients with PCOS and controls, whose serum kisspeptin levels were evaluated. The studies were retrieved from the Medline, Cochrane, and Embase databases, and four of them were chosen for the review. In most studies, the serum kisspeptin levels were higher in women with PCOS than in controls notwithstanding the BMI. One of the articles showed that circulating plasma levels of kisspeptin were significantly higher in women with PCOS whose BMI was lower than 25 than in obese and overweight women.

However, little is known about how the major types of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) affect pituitary-ovarian hormonal relationships. This study evaluated these relationships in recently menopausal women (52.45\u2009\u00b1\u20092.49 yr of age) in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) who were compliant to randomized, double-blinded treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen (o-CEE; n = 109), transdermal 17\u03b2-estradiol (t-E2; n = 107), or placebo (n = 146). Androstenedione, testosterone, 17\u03b2-estradiol, estrone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured in serum before (baseline) and 48 mo after randomization to treatment. Descriptive summaries of hormone levels were performed, and multiple regression analyses were used to examine the effects of o-CEE, t-E2, and placebo on these hormone levels at 48 mo, adjusting for baseline levels. A network analysis examined the covariance of changes in hormone levels over the 48 mo within treatment groups. As expected, at 48 mo of treatment, hormone levels differed between women in the two active treatment groups compared with placebo, and network analysis indicated stronger relationships among hormone levels in the t-E2 and o-CEE groups compared with placebo. Associations among testosterone, 17\u03b2-estradiol, FSH, and LH differed between the o-CEE group compared with t-E2 and placebo groups. Thus, two common HT regimens differentially alter pituitary-ovarian hormone levels, altering feedback cycles and interhormonal associations in recently menopausal women.

Analyzing the transcriptomes and methylomes of human aESCs, pESCs, and bi-parental ESCs enabled the characterization of regulatory relations at known imprinted regions and uncovered imprinted gene candidates within and outside known imprinted regions.

Twenty SNPs within the innate immunity pathway most related with CIMT after 4 yr were not among those associated with CIMT prior to MHT. In 403 women who completed the study in their assigned treatment group, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the innate immunity pathway were found to alter the treatment effect on 4 yr change in CIMT (i.e., significant interaction between treatment and genetic variation in the innate immunity pathway; P < 0.001).

A major factor for this increased malignancy risk is prolonged exposure of the endometrium to unopposed estrogen that results from anovulation.

Endometrial surveillance includes transvaginal ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy to assess thickened endometrium, prolonged amenorrhea, unopposed estrogen exposure or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medical management for abnormal vaginal bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia consists of estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, cyclic or continuous progestins or a levonorgestrel-releasing (Mirena) intrauterine device. Lifestyle modification with caloric restriction and exercise is appropriate to treat obesity as a concomitant risk factor for developing endometrial disease. An increased risk of ovarian cancer may also exist in some women with PCOS. There are strong data to suggest that oral contraceptive use is protective against ovarian cancer and increases with the duration of therapy. The mechanism of this protection may be through suppression of gonadotropin secretion rather than the prevention of \"incessant ovulation\". There is no apparent association of PCOS with breast cancer, although the high prevalence of metabolic dysfunction from obesity is a common denominator for both conditions.

Whether these SNPs associate with CIMT and CAC in women randomized to MHT remains to be determined.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Calcinosis", "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Interleukin-5", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Virginia M", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. miller.virginia@mayo.edu"}, {"First Name": "Tanya M", "Last Name": "Petterson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elysia N", "Last Name": "Jeavons", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abhinita S", "Last Name": "Lnu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David N", "Last Name": "Rider", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Heit", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie M", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordon S", "Last Name": "Huggins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Howard N", "Last Name": "Hodis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Budoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nanette", "Last Name": "Santoro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul N", "Last Name": "Hopkins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rogerio A", "Last Name": "Lobo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "JoAnn E", "Last Name": "Manson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frederick", "Last Name": "Naftolin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hugh S", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S Mitchell", "Last Name": "Harman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mariza", "Last Name": "de Andrade", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Physiological genomics", "PubDate": "2013Jan15"}]
