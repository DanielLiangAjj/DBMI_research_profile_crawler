[{"PMID": "38717153", "Title": "Molecular Landscape and Clinical Implication of CCNE1-amplified Esophagogastric Cancer.", "Abstract": "Cyclin E overexpression as a result of CCNE1 amplification is a critical driver of genomic instability in gastric cancer, but its clinical implication is largely unknown. Thus, we integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and immune profiling analysis of 7,083 esophagogastric tumors and investigated the impact of CCNE1 amplification on molecular features and treatment outcomes. We identified CCNE1 amplification in 6.2% of esophageal adenocarcinoma samples, 7.0% of esophagogastric junction carcinoma, 4.2% of gastric adenocarcinoma samples, and 0.8% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Metastatic sites such as lymph node and liver showed an increased frequency of CCNE1 amplification relative to primary tumors. Consistent with a chromosomal instability phenotype, CCNE1 amplification was associated with decreased CDH1 mutation and increased TP53 mutation and ERBB2 amplification. We observed no differences in immune biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden comparing CCNE1-amplified and nonamplified tumors, although CCNE1 amplification was associated with changes in immune populations such as decreased B cells and increased M1 macrophages from transcriptional analysis. Real-world survival analysis demonstrated that patients with CCNE1-amplified gastric cancer had worse survival after trastuzumab for HER2-positive tumors, but better survival after immunotherapy. These data suggest that CCNE1-amplified gastric cancer has a distinct molecular and immune profile with important therapeutic implications, and therefore further investigation of CCNE1 amplification as a predictive biomarker is warranted.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cyclin E", "Oncogene Proteins", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Gene Amplification", "Receptor, ErbB-2", "Adenocarcinoma", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Mutation", "Male", "Esophagogastric Junction", "Female", "Trastuzumab", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "B7-H1 Antigen", "Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Antigens, CD", "Cadherins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Naryan", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Sciences, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Samec", "Affiliation": "Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Phillip", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Joanne", "Last Name": "Xiu", "Affiliation": "Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Emil", "Last Name": "Lou", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Sanjay", "Last Name": "Goel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Anwaar", "Last Name": "Saeed", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Ryan H", "Last Name": "Moy", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer research communications", "PubDate": "2024Jun03"}, {"PMID": "37666264", "Title": "First-line regorafenib with nivolumab and chemotherapy in advanced oesophageal, gastric, or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer in the USA: a single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial.", "Abstract": "The addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy improves survival in patients with advanced oesophagogastric (oesophageal, gastric, or gastro-oesophageal junction) adenocarcinoma; however, outcomes remain poor.

However, the greatest barriers to the success of allo-HCT are relapse and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Many studies have examined the reconstitution of the immune system after allo-HCT and searched for factors associated with clinical outcome. Serum biomarkers have also been studied to predict the incidence and prognosis of GVHD. However, the use of multiparametric immunophenotyping has been less extensively explored: studies usually focus on preselected and predefined cell phenotypes and so do not fully exploit the richness of flow cytometry data. Here we aimed to identify cell phenotypes present 30 days after allo-HCT that are associated with clinical outcomes in 37 patients participating in a trial relating to the prevention of GVHD, derived from 82 flow cytometry markers and 13 clinical variables. To do this we applied variable selection methods in a competing risks modeling framework, and identified specific subsets of T, B, and NK cells associated with relapse.

Here we found that antiviral autophagy was conserved in flies and mammals during infection with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus that causes disease in humans and livestock. In Drosophila, Toll-7 limited RVFV replication and mortality through activation of autophagy. RVFV infection also elicited autophagy in mouse and human cells, and viral replication was increased in the absence of autophagy genes. The mammalian Toll-like receptor adaptor, MyD88, was required for anti-RVFV autophagy, revealing an evolutionarily conserved requirement for pattern-recognition receptors in antiviral autophagy. Pharmacologic activation of autophagy inhibited RVFV infection in mammalian cells, including primary hepatocytes and neurons. Thus, autophagy modulation might be an effective strategy for treating RVFV infection, which lacks approved vaccines and therapeutics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Allyl Compounds", "Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Autophagy", "Cells, Cultured", "Drosophila", "Evolution, Molecular", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Mammals", "Mice", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "Neurons", "Quinazolines", "Rats", "Rift Valley Fever", "Rift Valley fever virus", "Toll-Like Receptor 7", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan H", "Last Name": "Moy", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Penn Genome Frontiers Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Beth", "Last Name": "Gold", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Penn Genome Frontiers Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jerome M", "Last Name": "Molleston", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Penn Genome Frontiers Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Veronica", "Last Name": "Schad", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Penn Genome Frontiers Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kilangsungla", "Last Name": "Yanger", "Affiliation": "Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary-Virginia", "Last Name": "Salzano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoshimasa", "Last Name": "Yagi", "Affiliation": "Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8602, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Katherine A", "Last Name": "Fitzgerald", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ben Z", "Last Name": "Stanger", "Affiliation": "Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha S", "Last Name": "Soldan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Cherry", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Penn Genome Frontiers Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

Studies have implicated autophagy genes in restricting the replication of a diverse array of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and protozoans. However, in most cases, the in vivo role of antimicrobial autophagy against pathogens has been undefined. Drosophila provides a genetically tractable model system that can be easily adapted to study autophagy in innate immunity, and recent studies in flies have demonstrated that autophagy is an essential antimicrobial response against bacteria and viruses in vivo. These findings reveal striking conservation of antimicrobial autophagy between flies and mammals, and in particular, the role of pathogen-associated pattern recognition in triggering this response. This review discusses our current understanding of antimicrobial autophagy in Drosophila and its potential relevance to human immunity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Biological Evolution", "Conserved Sequence", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Infections", "Models, Animal", "Receptors, Pattern Recognition"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan H", "Last Name": "Moy", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Penn Genome Frontiers Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Cherry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of innate immunity", "PubDate": "2013"}]
