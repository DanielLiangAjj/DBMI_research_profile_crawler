A multitude of US and international hypertension guidelines, scientific statements, and policy statements have recommended evidence-based approaches for hypertension management and improved blood pressure (BP) control. These recommendations are based largely on high-quality observational and randomized controlled trial data. However, recent published data demonstrate troubling temporal trends with declining BP control in the United States after decades of steady improvements. Therefore, there is a widening disconnect between what hypertension experts recommend and actual BP control in practice. This scientific statement provides information on the implementation strategies to optimize hypertension management and to improve BP control among adults in the United States. Key approaches include antiracism efforts, accurate BP measurement and increased use of self-measured BP monitoring, team-based care, implementation of policies and programs to facilitate lifestyle change, standardized treatment protocols using team-based care, improvement of medication acceptance and adherence, continuous quality improvement, financial strategies, and large-scale dissemination and implementation.

The authors examined how recent standing or moving versus sitting affect average daytime BP on ABPM. Methods and Results This analysis used baseline assessments from a clinical trial in desk workers with office systolic BP (SBP) 120 to 159\u2009mm\u2009Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) 80 to 99\u2009mm\u2009Hg. ABPM was measured every 30\u2009minutes with a SunTech Medical Oscar 2 monitor. Concurrent posture (standing or seated) and moving (steps) were measured via a thigh-worn accelerometer. Linear regression determined within-person BP variability explained (R2) by standing and steps before ABPM readings. Mean daytime BP and the prevalence of mean daytime BP >135/85\u2009mm\u2009Hg from readings after sitting (seated) or after recent standing or moving (nonseated) were compared with all readings. Participants (n=266, 59% women; age, 45.2\u00b111.6\u2009years) provided 32.5\u00b13.9\u2009daytime BP readings. Time standing and steps before readings explained variability up to 17% for daytime SBP and 14% for daytime DBP. Using the 5-minute prior interval, seated SBP/DBP was lower (130.8/79.7\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.001) and nonseated SBP/DBP was higher (137.8/84.3\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.001) than mean daytime SBP/DBP from all readings (133.9/81.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg).\u00a0The prevalence of mean daytime SBP/DBP \u2265135/85\u2009mm\u2009Hg also differed: 38.7% from seated readings, 70.3% from nonseated readings, and 52.6% from all readings (P<0.05).

Methods and Results PubMed was queried from inception through November 30, 2021. Studies were included if they reported the prevalence or prognosis of hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting to the ED. Studies reporting data on hypertensive emergencies in other departments were excluded. The extracted data were arcsine transformed and pooled using a random-effects model. Fifteen studies (n=4370 patients) were included. Pooled analysis demonstrates that the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.40%-0.70%) in all patients presenting to ED and 35.9% (95% CI, 26.7%-45.5%) among patients presenting in ED with hypertensive crisis. Ischemic stroke (28.1% [95% CI, 18.7%-38.6%]) was the most prevalent hypertension-mediated organ damage, followed by pulmonary edema/acute heart failure (24.1% [95% CI, 19.0%-29.7%]), hemorrhagic stroke (14.6% [95% CI, 9.9%-20.0%]), acute coronary syndrome (10.8% [95% CI, 7.3%-14.8%]), renal failure (8.0% [95% CI, 2.9%-15.5%]), subarachnoid hemorrhage (6.9% [95% CI, 3.9%-10.7%]), encephalopathy (6.1% [95% CI, 1.9%-12.4%]), and the least prevalent was aortic dissection (1.8% [95% CI, 1.1%-2.8%]).

While they often occur concurrently, their individual effects are understudied. We aimed to assess the independent effects of diabetes and hypertension on LV remodeling in Black adults. Methods and Results The\u00a0JHS (Jackson Heart Study) participants (n=4143 Black adults) with echocardiographic measures from baseline exam were stratified into 4 groups: neither diabetes nor hypertension (n=1643), only diabetes (n=152), only hypertension (n=1669), or both diabetes and hypertension (n=679). Echocardiographic measures of LV structure and function among these groups were evaluated by multivariable regression adjusting for covariates. Mean age of the participants was 52\u00b11\u2009years, and 63.7% were women. LV mass index was not different in participants with only diabetes compared with participants with neither diabetes nor hypertension (P=0.8). LV mass index was 7.9% (6.0\u2009g/m2) higher in participants with only hypertension and 10.8% (8.1\u2009g/m2) higher in participants with both diabetes and hypertension compared with those with neither (P<0.001). LV wall thickness (relative, posterior, and septal) and brain natriuretic peptide levels in participants with only diabetes were not significantly higher than participants with neither (P>0.05). However, participants with both diabetes and hypertension demonstrated higher LV wall thickness and brain natriuretic peptide levels than participants with neither (P<0.05). Conclusions In this cross-sectional analysis, diabetes was not associated with altered LV structure or function in Black adults unless participants also had hypertension.

However, data have demonstrated that BP may substantially differ when measured in the office than when measured outside the office setting. Higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are validated approaches for out-of-office BP measurement. In the 2015 and 2021 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reports on screening for hypertension, ABPM was recommended as the reference standard for out-of-office BP monitoring and for confirming an initial diagnosis of hypertension. This recommendation was based on data from more published studies of ABPM vs. HBPM on the predictive value of out-of-office BP independent of office BP. Therefore, HBPM was recommended as an alternative approach when ABPM was not available or well tolerated. The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline recommended ABPM as the preferred initial approach for detecting white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension among adults not taking antihypertensive medication. In contrast, HBPM was recommended as the preferred initial approach for detecting the white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension among adults taking antihypertensive medication.

Loss or disruption of the blood pressure circadian rhythm has been linked to adverse health outcomes, for example, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and chronic kidney disease. However, the current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches lack sufficient attention to the circadian rhythmicity of blood pressure. Sleep patterns, hormone release, eating habits, digestion, body temperature, renal and cardiovascular function, and other important host functions as well as gut microbiota exhibit circadian rhythms, and influence circadian rhythms of blood pressure. Potential benefits of nonpharmacologic interventions such as meal timing, and pharmacologic chronotherapeutic interventions, such as the bedtime administration of antihypertensive medications, have recently been suggested in some studies. However, the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm-mediated blood pressure regulation and the efficacy of chronotherapy in hypertension remain unclear.

neoformans infective endocarditis is rarely reported. In this report, we present a case of infective endocarditis secondary to Cryptococcus neoformans in a lung-transplant recipient and review the relevant literature. A 65-year-old man was hospitalized with hypoxemic respiratory failure and underwent left-sided single lung transplantation. In the setting of worsening hypoxemia, blood cultures were drawn, which grew C. neoformans. Lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF PCR was also positive for Cryptococcus. Further exposure history revealed that he had raised chickens while living in Peru. Transesophageal echocardiography showed an aortic valve vegetation, and he was diagnosed with cryptococcal infective endocarditis. He received liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine for two weeks and was later transitioned to fluconazole.

Most of the evidence supporting its benefits has been derived from outcome trials with morning dosing of medications. Accumulating evidence suggests an adverse prognosis associated with night-time hypertension, nondipping blood pressure (BP) profile and morning BP surge, with increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the first few morning hours. These observations provide justification for complete 24-h BP control as being the primary goal of antihypertensive treatment. Bedtime administration of antihypertensive drugs has also been proposed as a potentially more effective treatment strategy than morning administration. This Position Paper by the International Society of Hypertension reviewed the published evidence on the clinical relevance of the diurnal variation in BP and the timing of antihypertensive drug treatment, aiming to provide consensus recommendations for clinical practice. Eight published outcome hypertension studies involved bedtime dosing of antihypertensive drugs, and all had major methodological and/or other flaws and a high risk of bias in testing the impact of bedtime compared to morning treatment. Three ongoing, well designed, prospective, randomized controlled outcome trials are expected to provide high-quality data on the efficacy and safety of evening or bedtime versus morning drug dosing. Until that information is available, preferred use of bedtime drug dosing of antihypertensive drugs should not be routinely recommended in clinical practice. Complete 24-h control of BP should be targeted using readily available, long-acting antihypertensive medications as monotherapy or combinations administered in a single morning dose.", "Keywords": [],

The aims of the Better BP Study are to (1) test if unattended office BP is closer to awake BP on ABPM compared with attended office BP, (2) assess if sleep BP assessed by home BP monitoring (HBPM) agrees with sleep BP from a full night of ABPM and (3) compare the strengths of associations of unattended versus attended office BP, unattended office BP versus awake BP on ABPM and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with markers of end-organ damage.", "Keywords": ["cardiac epidemiology", "hypertension", "public health"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Cross-Over Studies", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Sleep", "Wakefulness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Cepeda", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Demetria", "Last Name": "Hubbard", "Affiliation": "Epidemiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Oparil", "Affiliation": "Medicine, Cardiovascular Disease, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph E", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Byron C", "Last Name": "Jaeger", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shakia T", "Last Name": "Hardy", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Medina", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ligong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Epidemiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Muntner", "Affiliation": "Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA ds2231@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "BMJ open", "PubDate": "2022Jun06"}, {"PMID": "35665802", "Title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Masked Hypertension Screening and Treatment in US Adults With Suspected Masked Hypertension: A Simulation Study.", "Abstract": "Recent US blood pressure (BP) guidelines recommend using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring (HBPM) to screen adults for masked hypertension.

"Abstract": "Background Oral microbiota are thought to influence blood pressure (BP) regulation. However, epidemiological data supporting this hypothesis are limited. We examined associations between oral microbiota, BP, and incident hypertension in postmenopausal women. Methods and Results Baseline (1997-2001) examinations were completed on 1215 women (mean age, 63 years) during which subgingival plaque was collected, BP was measured, and medical and lifestyle histories and medication inventory were obtained. Microbiome composition of subgingival plaque was measured using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Baseline measured BP was defined as normotensive (systolic <120 mm Hg and diastolic <80 mm Hg, no BP medication use; n=429); elevated (systolic \u2265120 mm Hg or diastolic \u226580 mm Hg, no medication use; n=306); or prevalent treated hypertension (history of physician diagnosis treated with medications; n=480). Incident hypertension (375 cases among 735 without baseline treated hypertension) was defined as newly physician-diagnosed hypertension treated with medication reported on annual health surveys (mean follow-up, 10.4\u00a0years). Cross-sectional analysis identified 47 bacterial species (of 245 total) that differed significantly according to baseline BP status (P<0.05). Prospective analysis identified 15 baseline bacterial species significantly (P<0.05) associated with incident hypertension: 10 positively (age-adjusted hazard ratios [HRs], 1.10-1.16 per SD in bacterial abundance) and 5 inversely (HRs, 0.82-0.91) associated. Associations were materially unchanged after further adjustment for demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors; were similar when analysis was restricted to the normotensive group; and were of consistent magnitudes between strata of baseline age, smoking, body mass index, and BP categories. Conclusions Specific oral bacteria are associated with baseline BP status and risk of hypertension development among postmenopausal women. Research to confirm these observations and elucidate mechanisms is needed.", "Keywords": ["epidemiology", "hypertension", "menopause", "microbiome", "women\u2019s health"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteria", "Blood Pressure", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Microbiota", "Middle Aged", "Postmenopause", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "LaMonte", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health University at Buffalo-SUNY Buffalo NY."}, {"First Name": "Joshua H", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health University at Buffalo-SUNY Buffalo NY."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Diaz-Moreno", "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Biology and Buffalo Microbiome Center University at Buffalo-SUNY Buffalo NY."}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI."}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen M", "Last Name": "Hovey", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health University at Buffalo-SUNY Buffalo NY."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Buck", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Center for Biological and Life Sciences Core Laboratory University at Buffalo-SUNY Buffalo NY."}, {"First Name": "J", "Last Name": "Wactawski-Wende", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health University at Buffalo-SUNY Buffalo NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "PubDate": "2022Mar15"}, {"PMID": "35183128", "Title": "Rare coding variants in RCN3 are associated with blood pressure.", "Abstract": "While large genome-wide association studies have identified nearly one thousand loci associated with variation in blood pressure, rare variant identification is still a challenge.

Several guidelines and scientific statements now endorse the use of out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring with ambulatory BP monitoring or home BP monitoring to confirm or exclude hypertension status based on office BP measurement. Current ambulatory or home BP monitoring devices have been reliant on the placement of a BP cuff, typically on the upper arm, to measure BP. There are numerous limitations to this approach. Cuff-based BP may not be well-tolerated for repeated measurements as is utilized with ambulatory BP monitoring. Furthermore, improper technique, including incorrect cuff placement or use of the wrong cuff size, may lead to erroneous readings, affecting diagnosis and management of hypertension. Compared with devices that utilize a cuff, cuffless BP devices may overcome challenges related to technique, tolerability, and overall utility in the outpatient setting. However, cuffless devices have several potential limitations that limit its routine use for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. The review discusses the different approaches for determining BP using various cuffless devices including engineering aspects of cuffless device technologies, validation protocols to test accuracy of cuffless devices, potential barriers to widespread implementation, and future areas of research.

Yet the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has invested only 0.17% of its budget on AsA and NHPI research between 1992 and 2018. More than 40 ethnic subgroups are included within AsA and NHPI (with no majority subpopulation), which are highly diverse culturally, demographically, linguistically, and socioeconomically. However, data for these groups are often aggregated, masking critical health disparities and their drivers. To address these issues, in March 2021, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in partnership with 8 other NIH institutes, convened a multidisciplinary workshop to review current research, knowledge gaps, opportunities, barriers, and approaches for prevention research for AsA and NHPI populations. The workshop covered 5 domains: 1) sociocultural, environmental, psychological health, and lifestyle dimensions; 2) metabolic disorders; 3) cardiovascular and lung diseases; 4) cancer; and 5) cognitive function and healthy aging. Two recurring themes emerged: Very limited data on the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes for most conditions are available, and most existing data are not disaggregated by subgroup, masking variation in risk factors, disease occurrence, and trajectories. Leveraging the vast phenotypic differences among AsA and NHPI groups was identified as a key opportunity to yield novel clues into etiologic and prognostic factors to inform prevention efforts and intervention strategies. Promising approaches for future research include developing collaborations with community partners, investing in infrastructure support for cohort studies, enhancing existing data sources to enable data disaggregation, and incorporating novel technology for objective measurement.

Neighborhood violence was measured as the homicide frequency in a child's Census block group in the five years before study entry. Fasting blood was drawn at study entry and two years later (in eighth and tenth grade). The blood was used to quantify protein biomarkers of systemic inflammatory activity and perform genome-wide expression profiling of isolated monocytes. Neighborhood violence was associated with higher systemic inflammatory activity at both assessments. It also was associated with a monocyte transcriptional profile indicative of increased signaling along the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) control pathways, which are key orchestrators of pro-inflammatory effector functions. Neighborhood violence also was associated with transcriptional indications of higher beta-adrenergic and lower glucocorticoid signaling, which could function as neuroendocrine conduits linking threatening experiences with inflammatory activity. Neighborhood violence was not associated with two-year changes in protein biomarkers, although it did presage a transcriptional profile indicative of increasing AP-1 and declining glucocorticoid signaling over follow-up.

The primary exposure was the count of social vulnerabilities defined across economic, education, health and health care, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context domains. Among 5425 participants of mean age 64\u00b110 SD years of which 24% were Black participants, 1468 (31%) had 1 vulnerability and 717 (15%) had \u22652 vulnerabilities. Compared with participants without vulnerabilities, the adjusted relative risk ratio for developing hypertension was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.99-1.36) and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.20-1.85) for individuals with 1 and \u22652 vulnerabilities, respectively. The adjusted relative risk ratio for death was 1.55 (95% CI, 1.24-1.93) and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.75-3.04) for individuals with 1 and \u22652 vulnerabilities, respectively. A greater proportion of Black participants developed hypertension and died than did White participants (hypertension, 38% versus 31%; death, 25% versus 20%). The vulnerability count association was strongest in White participants (P value for vulnerability count\u00d7race interaction: hypertension=0.046, death=0.015). Overall, a greater number of socially determined vulnerabilities was associated with progressively higher risk of developing hypertension, and an even higher risk of dying over 10 years.", "Keywords": ["cardiovascular diseases", "hypertension", "mortality", "public health", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Blood Pressure", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Social Determinants of Health", "Social Vulnerability", "Survival Rate"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jordan B", "Last Name": "King", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Utah (J.B.K., A.P.B.)."}, {"First Name": "Laura C", "Last Name": "Pinheiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University (L.C.P., J.B.R., M.M.S.)."}, {"First Name": "Joanna", "Last Name": "Bryan Ringel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University (L.C.P., J.B.R., M.M.S.)."}, {"First Name": "Adam P", "Last Name": "Bress", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Utah (J.B.K., A.P.B.)."}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine (D.S.), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Muntner", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology (P.M.), School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham."}, {"First Name": "Kristi", "Last Name": "Reynolds", "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California (K.R.)."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Cushman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont (M.C.)."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Howard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics (G.H.), School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology (J.J.M.), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Monika M", "Last Name": "Safford", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University (L.C.P., J.B.R., M.M.S.)."}], "Journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "PubDate": "2022Jan"}, {"PMID": "34751170", "Title": "Elucidation of obstructive sleep apnoea related blood pressure surge using a novel continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring system.", "Abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) episode related blood pressure (BP) surge may mediate the association of OSA with cardiovascular disease.

Obesity accounts for much of the risk for primary hypertension through several mechanisms, including neurohormonal activation, inflammation, and kidney dysfunction. As the prevalence of obesity continues to increase, hypertension and associated cardiorenal diseases will also increase unless more effective strategies to prevent and treat obesity are developed. Lifestyle modification, including diet, reduced sedentariness, and increased physical activity, is usually recommended for patients with obesity; however, the long-term success of these strategies for reducing adiposity, maintaining weight loss, and reducing blood pressure has been limited. Effective pharmacotherapeutic and procedural strategies, including metabolic surgeries, are additional options to treat obesity and prevent or attenuate obesity hypertension, target organ damage, and subsequent disease. Medications can be useful for short- and long-term obesity treatment; however, prescription of these drugs is limited. Metabolic surgery is effective for producing sustained weight loss and for treating hypertension and metabolic disorders in many patients with severe obesity. Unanswered questions remain related to the mechanisms of obesity-related diseases, long-term efficacy of different treatment and prevention strategies, and timing of these interventions to prevent obesity and hypertension-mediated target organ damage. Further investigation, including randomized controlled trials, is essential to addressing these questions, and emphasis should be placed on the prevention of obesity to reduce the burden of hypertensive cardiovascular and kidney diseases and subsequent mortality.", "Keywords": ["AHA Scientific Statements", "blood pressure", "metabolic surgery", "obesity"], "MeSH terms": ["American Heart Association", "Anti-Obesity Agents", "Appetite Depressants", "Bariatric Surgery", "Exercise", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Obesity", "Orlistat", "Phentermine", "United States", "Weight Loss"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordana B", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jamy D", "Last Name": "Ard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brent M", "Last Name": "Egan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John E", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carl J", "Last Name": "Lavie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chiadi E", "Last Name": "Ndumele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip R", "Last Name": "Schauer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "American Heart Association Council on Hypertension; Council on Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology; Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; and Stroke Council", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "PubDate": "2021Nov"}, {"PMID": "34381194", "Title": "Number and timing of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measurements.", "Abstract": "Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) may cause sleep disturbances.

COVID-19 mitigation strategies have unintended consequences on managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and health disparities in the United States. During the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, the combination of observed racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 deaths and social unrest reinvigorated a national conversation about systemic racism in health care and society. The 4th Annual University of Utah Translational Hypertension Symposium gathered frontline clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to discuss the intersection of these 2 critical social and public health phenomena and to highlight preexisting disparities in hypertension treatment and control exacerbated by COVID-19. The discussion underscored environmental and socioeconomic factors that are deeply embedded in US health care and research that impact inequities in hypertension. Structural racism plays a central role at both the health system and individual levels. At the same time, virtual healthcare platforms are being accelerated into widespread use by COVID-19, which may widen the divide in healthcare access across levels of wealth, geography, and education.

This study investigated the effect of PC4d on platelet function, as a mechanistic link to arterial thrombosis. In a cohort of 150 SLE patients, 13 events had occurred within five years of enrollment. Patients with arterial events had higher PC4d levels (13.6 [4.4-24.0] vs. 4.0 [2.5-8.3] net MFI), with PC4d 10 being the optimal cutoff for event detection. The association of arterial events with PC4d remained significant after adjusting for antiphospholipid status, smoking, and prednisone use (p\u00a0=\u00a00.045). PC4d levels correlated with lower platelet counts (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), larger platelet volumes (r\u00a0=\u00a00.22, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and increased platelet aggregation: the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentration to achieve 50% maximal aggregation (EC50) was lower in patients with PC4d 10 compared with PC4d\u00a0<\u00a010 (1.6 vs. 3.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.038, respectively).

The 2018 American Heart Association Scientific Statement on Resistant Hypertension recommends healthy lifestyle habits and thiazide-like diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for adults with resistant hypertension. The term apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (aTRH) is used when pseudoresistance cannot be excluded. We estimated the use of healthy lifestyle factors and recommended antihypertensive medication classes among US Black adults with aTRH. Data were pooled for Black participants in the JHS (Jackson Heart Study) in 2009 to 2013 (n=2496) and the REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) in 2013 to 2016 (n=3786). Outcomes included lifestyle factors (not smoking, not consuming alcohol, \u226575 minutes of vigorous-intensity or \u2265150 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week, and body mass index <25 kg/m2) and recommended antihypertensive medications (thiazide-like diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). Overall, 28.3% of participants who reported taking antihypertensive medication had aTRH. Among participants with aTRH, 14.5% and 1.2% had ideal levels of 3 and 4 of the lifestyle factors, respectively. Also, 5.9% of participants with aTRH reported taking a thiazide-like diuretic, and 9.8% reported taking a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In conclusion, evidence-based lifestyle factors and recommended pharmacological treatment are underutilized in Black adults with aTRH. Increased use of lifestyle recommendations and antihypertensive medication classes specifically recommended for aTRH may improve blood pressure control and reduce cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality among US Black adults.

We used office and daytime BP to assess the proportion of participants with white-coat effect (standard target: office BP \u2265140/90 mm\u2009Hg and daytime BP <135/85 mm\u2009Hg versus intensive target: office BP \u2265120/80 mm\u2009Hg and daytime BP <120/80 mm\u2009Hg) and masked uncontrolled hypertension (standard target: office BP <140/90 mm\u2009Hg and daytime BP \u2265135/85 mm\u2009Hg versus intensive target: office BP <120/80 mm\u2009Hg and daytime BP \u2265120/80 mm\u2009Hg) in each treatment arm. The prevalence of white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension was 9% and 34%, in both treatment groups. Among participants with uncontrolled office BP, white-coat effect was present in 20% and 23% in the intensive and standard groups, respectively. Among participants with controlled office BP, masked uncontrolled hypertension was present in 62% and 56% in the intensive and standard groups, respectively. In conclusion, a more intensive BP target resulted in a similar proportion of patients with white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension compared with a standard target.", "Keywords":

heart rate, brain morphology, and cognition is limited. We examined the associations of resting heart rate (RHR), visit-to-visit heart rate variation (VVHRV), brain volumes and cognitive impairment. The study sample consisted of postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study and its ancillary MRI sub-studies (WHIMS-MRI 1 and WHIMS-MRI 2) without a history of cardiovascular disease, including 493 with one and 299 women with 2 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. HR readings were acquired annually starting from baseline visit (1996-1998). RHR was calculated as the mean and VVHRV as standard deviation of all available HR readings. Brain MRI scans were performed between 2005 and 2006 (WHIMS-MRI 1), and approximately 5 years later (WHIMS-MRI 2). Cognitive impairment was defined as incident mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia until December 30, 2017. An elevated RHR was associated with greater brain lesion volumes at the first MRI exam (7.86 cm3 [6.48, 9.24] vs 4.78 cm3 [3.39, 6.17], p-value <0.0001) and with significant increases in lesion volumes between brain MRI exams (6.20 cm3 [4.81, 7.59] vs 4.28 cm3 [2.84, 5.73], p-value\u202f=\u202f0.0168).

BP may differ considerably when measured in the office and when measured outside of the office setting, and higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Self-measured BP monitoring, the measurement of BP by an individual outside of the office at home, is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement. Several national and international hypertension guidelines endorse self-measured BP monitoring. Indications include the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension and the identification of white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Other indications include confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension and detecting morning hypertension. Validated self-measured BP monitoring devices that use the oscillometric method are preferred, and a standardized BP measurement and monitoring protocol should be followed. Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials indicates that self-measured BP monitoring is associated with a reduction in BP and improved BP control, and the benefits of self-measured BP monitoring are greatest when done along with cointerventions. The addition of self-measured BP monitoring to office BP monitoring is cost-effective compared with office BP monitoring alone or usual care among individuals with high office BP. The use of self-measured BP monitoring is commonly reported by both individuals and providers. Therefore, self-measured BP monitoring has high potential for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the United States. Randomized controlled trials examining the impact of self-measured BP monitoring on cardiovascular outcomes are needed. To adequately address barriers to the implementation of self-measured BP monitoring, financial investment is needed in the following areas: improving education and training of individuals and providers, building health information technology capacity, incorporating self-measured BP readings into clinical performance measures, supporting cointerventions, and enhancing reimbursement.", "Keywords": ["AHA Scientific Statements", "blood pressure", "cardiovascular disease", "hypertension", "prevention and control"], "MeSH terms": ["American Heart Association", "American Medical Association", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Prevalence", "Public Health Surveillance", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nancy T", "Last Name": "Artinian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jan N", "Last Name": "Basile", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence R", "Last Name": "Krakoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen L", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael K", "Last Name": "Rakotz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Wozniak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "American Heart Association and the American Medical Association", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Circulation", "PubDate": "2020Jul28"}, {"PMID": "32323119", "Title": "Testing the cross-stressor hypothesis under real-world conditions: exercise as a moderator of the association between momentary anxiety and cardiovascular responses.", "Abstract": "The cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis of exercise training has not been investigated under real-life conditions. Using ecological momentary assessment, we tested whether usual exercise level moderates the relationship of self-reported anxiety to concurrent ambulatory heart rate (HR) and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP). Participants (N\u2009=\u2009832) completed 24-h ambulatory monitoring of HR/BP, using a brachial BP cuff that took readings at 28-min intervals. Anxiety levels were concurrently reported on a visual analog scale (VAS) using a Palm Pilot. Usual exercise behavior was assessed by a self-report questionnaire. Random coefficients linear regression models predicting momentary HR/BP readings from time-matched anxiety scores were estimated, yielding the average within-person effect (slope) of anxiety. The interaction of exercise level (i.e., no weekly exercise, 1-149, and \u2265\u2009150\u00a0min/week; a between-person factor) with anxiety was added to the model in order to estimate the average anxiety slope for participants in each exercise category.

We examined the association between perceived stress levels assessed annually for up to 13\u00a0years and incident hypertension in the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based cohort of blacks. Methods and Results Analyses included 1829 participants without hypertension at baseline (Exam 1, 2000-2004). Incident hypertension was defined as blood pressure\u2265140/90\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg or antihypertensive medication use at Exam 2 (2005-2008) or Exam 3 (2009-2012). Each follow-up interval at risk of hypertension was categorized as low, moderate, or high perceived stress based on the number of annual assessments between exams in which participants reported \"a lot\" or \"extreme\" stress over the previous year (low, 0 high stress ratings; moderate, 1 high stress rating; high, \u22652 high stress ratings). During follow-up (median, 7.0\u00a0years), hypertension incidence was 48.5%. Hypertension developed in 30.6% of intervals with low perceived stress, 34.6% of intervals with moderate perceived stress, and 38.2% of intervals with high perceived stress. Age-, sex-, and time-adjusted risk ratios (95% CI) associated with moderate and high perceived stress versus low perceived stress were 1.19 (1.04-1.37) and 1.37 (1.20-1.57), respectively (P trend<0.001). The association was present after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors and baseline stress (P trend=0.001). Conclusions In a community-based cohort of blacks, higher perceived stress over time was associated with an increased risk of developing hypertension. Evaluating stress levels over time and intervening when high perceived stress is persistent may reduce hypertension risk.", "Keywords": ["Blacks", "Jackson Heart Study", "blood pressure", "chronic stress", "hypertension"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Black or African American", "Diagnostic Self Evaluation", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Incidence", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Stress, Psychological", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tanya M", "Last Name": "Spruill", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health New York University School of Medicine New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Mark J", "Last Name": "Butler", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health New York University School of Medicine New York NY."}, {"First Name": "S Justin", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry University of Alabama at Birmingham AL."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel S", "Last Name": "Tajeu", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Services Administration and Policy Temple University Philadelphia PA."}, {"First Name": "Jolaade", "Last Name": "Kalinowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health New York University School of Medicine New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Sheila F", "Last Name": "Casta\u00f1eda", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Public Health San Diego State University San Diego CA."}, {"First Name": "Aisha T", "Last Name": "Langford", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health New York University School of Medicine New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Marwah", "Last Name": "Abdalla", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Chad", "Last Name": "Blackshear", "Affiliation": "Department of Data Science University of Mississippi Medical Center Jackson MS."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Allison", "Affiliation": "Department of Family Medicine and Public Health University of California at San Diego CA."}, {"First Name": "Gbenga", "Last Name": "Ogedegbe", "Affiliation": "Department of Population Health New York University School of Medicine New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine University of Mississippi Medical Center Jackson MS."}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "PubDate": "2019Nov05"}, {"PMID": "31592937", "Title": "Longer Sleep Duration and Endothelial Cell Health Among a Multiethnic Sample of Adolescents.", "Abstract": "Adverse endothelial cell health, an early pathogenic process underlying atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, is evident in childhood and adolescence.

While blood pressure was measured in both surveys, an auscultatory mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure blood pressure in clinics in 2004, and an oscillometric LifeSource UA-789AC monitor was used in homes in 2013-2014. To assess comparability of blood pressure results across both surveys, we undertook a randomized study comparing blood pressure (BP) readings by the two devices. Blood pressure measuring protocols followed the 2013 Association for the Advancement in Medical instrumentation guidelines for non-invasive blood pressure device. Data from 167 volunteers were analyzed for this purpose.Paired t tests were used to test for significant difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure between devices for overall and by mid-arm circumference categories. To test for systematic differences between the two devices, we generated Bland-Altman graphs. Sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa statistics were calculated to assess between-device agreement for high (\u2265\u2009130/80\u00a0mmHg) and not high (<\u2009130/80\u00a0mmHg) blood pressure, with mercury set as the reference.Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured by LifeSource UA-789AC were on average 2.0 and 1.1\u00a0mmHg higher, respectively, than those of the mercury sphygmomanometer systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Sensitivity was 81%, specificity was 96%, and the Kappa coefficient was 75%. The Bland-Altman graphs showed that the between-device difference did not vary as a function of the average of the two devices for systolic blood pressure and was larger in the lower and upper ends for diastolic blood pressure. Given the observed differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings between the two blood pressure measurement approaches, we calibrated NYC HANES 2013-2014 blood pressure data by predicting mercury blood pressure values from LifeSource blood pressure values. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in NYC HANES 2013-2014 were lower when data were calibrated.", "Keywords": ["Blood pressure", "Calibration", "Cardiovascular disease", "Hypertension",

The purpose of this study was to compare the association of both television viewing and occupational sitting with CVD events and all-cause mortality in blacks. Methods and Results Participants included 3592 individuals enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study, a community-based study of blacks residing in Jackson, Mississippi. Television viewing (<2, 2-4, and >4\u00a0h/day) and occupational sitting (never/seldom, sometimes, often/always) were self-reported. Over a median follow-up of 8.4\u00a0years, there were 129 CVD events and 205 deaths. The highest category of television viewing (>4\u00a0h/day) was associated with a greater risk for a composite CVD events/all-cause mortality end point compared with the lowest category (<2\u00a0h/day; hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI , 1.13-1.97). In contrast, the highest category of occupational sitting (often/always) was not associated with risk for a composite CVD events/all-cause mortality end point compared with the lowest category (never/seldom; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI , 0.69-1.18). Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity moderated the association of television viewing with CVD events/all-cause mortality such that television viewing was not associated with greater risk among those with high moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels. Conclusions Television viewing was associated with greater risk of CVD events and all-cause mortality, while occupational sitting had no association with these outcomes. These findings suggest that minimizing television viewing may be more effective for reducing CVD and mortality risk in blacks compared with reducing occupational sedentary behavior.", "Keywords": ["all\u2010cause mortality", "black", "cardiovascular disease", "moderate\u2010to\u2010vigorous physical activity", "occupational sedentary behavior", "television viewing"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Black or African American", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Coronary Disease", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Leisure Activities", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Occupations", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk Factors", "Sedentary Behavior", "Self Report", "Stroke", "Television", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeanette M", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Education and Human Services University of Central Florida Orlando FL."}, {"First Name": "Andrea T", "Last Name": "Duran", "Affiliation": "2 Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Joseph E", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "2 Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}, {"First Name": "John N", "Last Name": "Booth", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Epidemiology School of Public Health University of Alabama Birmingham AL."}, {"First Name": "Steven P", "Last Name": "Hooker", "Affiliation": "5 San Diego State University College of Health and Human Services San Diego State University CA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua Z", "Last Name": "Willey", "Affiliation": "6 Department of Neurology Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Ying Kuen", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "7 Department of Biostatistics Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Chorong", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "8 Department of Population Health New York University School of Medicine New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Stephen K", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "8 Department of Population Health New York University School of Medicine New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "9 Department of Medicine University of Mississippi Medical Center Jackson MS."}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "2 Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Keith M", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "2 Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health Columbia University Medical Center New York NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Heart Association", "PubDate": "2019Jul02"}, {"PMID": "31230550", "Title": "Proportion of US Adults Recommended Out-of-Clinic Blood Pressure Monitoring According to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.", "Abstract": "The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend out-of-clinic BP monitoring to screen for white coat and masked hypertension among adults not taking antihypertensive medication and white coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension among adults taking antihypertensive medication.

This article provides an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on BP measurement in humans. In the office setting, many oscillometric devices have been validated that allow accurate BP measurement while reducing human errors associated with the auscultatory approach. Fully automated oscillometric devices capable of taking multiple readings even without an observer being present may provide a more accurate measurement of BP than auscultation. Studies have shown substantial differences in BP when measured outside versus in the office setting. Ambulatory BP monitoring is considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment, with home BP monitoring being an alternative when ambulatory BP monitoring is not available or tolerated. Compared with their counterparts with sustained normotension (ie, nonhypertensive BP levels in and outside the office setting), it is unclear whether adults with white-coat hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels in the office but not outside the office) have increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas those with masked hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels outside the office but not in the office) are at substantially increased risk.

We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) data obtained through the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program on 395 Cleveland Family Study (CFS) European Americans (CFS-EA). By analyzing functional coding variants and non-coding rare variants with CADD score\u2009>\u200910 residing within the chromosomal region in families with linkage evidence, we observed 25 genes with nominal statistical evidence (burden or SKAT p\u2009<\u20090.05). One of the genes is RBFOX1, an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates tissue-specific alternative splicing that we previously reported to be associated with BP using exome array data in CFS. After follow-up analysis of the 25 genes in ten independent TOPMed studies with individuals of European, African, and East Asian ancestry, and Hispanics (N\u2009=\u200929,988), we identified variants in SLX4 (p\u2009=\u20092.19\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4) to be significantly associated with BP traits when accounting for multiple testing. We also replicated the associations previously reported for RBFOX1 (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Follow-up analysis with GTEx eQTL data shows SLX4 variants are associated with gene expression in coronary artery, multiple brain tissues, and right atrial appendage of the heart. Our study demonstrates that linkage analysis of family data can provide an efficient approach for detecting rare variants associated with complex traits in WGS data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

This variability makes an unequivocal determination of the anti-inflammatory effects of aerobic training elusive. Methods and Results We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 12\u00a0weeks of aerobic exercise training or a wait list control condition followed by 4\u00a0weeks of sedentary deconditioning on lipopolysaccharide (0, 0.1, and 1.0\u00a0ng/mL)-inducible tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and on toll-like receptor 4 in 119 healthy, sedentary young adults. Aerobic capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise testing was measured at study entry (T1) and after training (T2) and deconditioning (T3). Despite a 15% increase in maximal oxygen consumption, there were no changes in inflammatory markers. Additional analyses revealed a differential longitudinal aerobic exercise training effect by lipopolysaccharide level in inducible TNF -\u03b1 ( P=0.08) and IL-6 ( P=0.011), showing T1 to T2 increases rather than decreases in inducible (lipopolysaccharide 0.1, 1.0 versus 0.0\u00a0ng/mL) TNF- \u03b1 (51% increase, P=0.041) and IL-6 (42% increase, P=0.11), and significant T2 to T3 decreases in inducible TNF- \u03b1 (54% decrease, P=0.007) and IL-6 (55% decrease, P<0.001). There were no significant changes in either group at the 0.0\u00a0ng/mL lipopolysaccharide level for TNF- \u03b1 or IL-6. Conclusions The failure to support the primary hypotheses and the unexpected post hoc findings of an exercise-training-induced proinflammatory response raise questions about whether and under what conditions exercise training has anti-inflammatory effects.

We analyzed data from 333 community-dwelling adults not taking antihypertensive medication with clinic BP <140/90 mm Hg in the IDH study (Improving the Detection of Hypertension).

Although psychological stress has previously been established as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is unclear whether stress influences cardiovascular risk differently in men versus women. Gender disparities exist in the prevalence of stress as well as in the prevalence and prognosis of CVD; therefore, associations between stress and CVD risk and mortality may vary by sex. The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence from recent and landmark studies on gender differences in the associations of stress with CVD risk factors and end points and to highlight clinical and public health implications as well as future research directions in this field. Taken together, research to date indicates that while stress is associated with poorer cardiovascular health metrics in both men and women, the influence of stress on measures of glucose regulation and dyslipidemia and on overall CVD risk may be stronger among women. However, men may be more susceptible to the influence of stress on body adiposity, blood pressure, and CVD mortality. In terms of behavioral risk factors for CVD, associations between stress and diet quantity and quality appear to be stronger among women, but the influence of stress on sedentary behaviors and sleep may be stronger among men.

We used data over 8 examinations spanning 25 years collected in the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) of black and white adults (age, 18-30 years) started in 1985 to 1986. Visit-to-visit BP variability was defined as by SDBP and average real variability (ARVBP, defined as the absolute differences of BP between successive BP measurements). Hippocampal tissue volume standardized by intracranial volume (%) and integrity assessed by fractional anisotropy were measured by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging at the year-25 examination (n=545; mean age, 51 years; 54% women and 34% African Americans). Mean systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP levels were 110/69 mm\u2009Hg at year 0 (baseline), 117/73 mm\u2009Hg at year 25, and ARVSBP and SDSBP were 7.7 and 7.9 mm\u2009Hg, respectively. In multivariable-adjusted linear models, higher ARVSBP was associated with lower hippocampal volume (unstandardized regression coefficient [standard error] with 1-SD higher ARVSBP: -0.006 [0.003]), and higher SDSBP with lower hippocampal fractional anisotropy (-0.02 [0.01]; all P<0.05), independent of cumulative exposure to SBP during follow-up. Conversely, cumulative exposure to SBP and diastolic BP was not associated with hippocampal volume. There was no interaction by sex or race between ARVSBP or SDSBP with hippocampal volume or integrity. In conclusion, visit-to-visit BP variability during young adulthood may be useful in assessing the potential risk for reductions in hippocampal volume and integrity in midlife.", "Keywords": ["blood pressure", "brain", "hippocampus", "humans", "young adult"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aging", "Blood Pressure", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Incidence", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Office Visits", "Organ Size", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuichiro", "Last Name": "Yano", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson (Y.Y.);

Many older adults have indicators of frailty, which may increase their risk for falls. We contrasted the association of systolic BP, diastolic BP, number of antihypertensive medication classes taken, and indicators of frailty with risk for serious fall injuries among 5236 REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Difference in Stroke) participants \u226565 years taking antihypertensive medication at baseline with Medicare fee-for-service coverage. Systolic BP and diastolic BP were measured, and antihypertensive medication classes being taken assessed through a pill bottle review during a study visit. Indicators of frailty included low body mass index, cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, exhaustion, impaired mobility, and history of falls. Serious fall injuries were defined as fall-related fractures, brain injuries, or joint dislocations using Medicare claims through December 31, 2014. Over a median of 6.4 years, 802 (15.3%) participants had a serious fall injury. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for a serious fall injury among participants with 1, 2, or \u22653 indicators of frailty versus no frailty indicators was 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.40), 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.87), and 2.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.67), respectively. Systolic BP, diastolic BP, and number of antihypertensive medication classes being taken at baseline were not associated with risk for serious fall injuries after multivariable adjustment. In conclusion, indicators of frailty, but not BP or number of antihypertensive medication classes, were associated with increased risk for serious fall injuries among older adults taking antihypertensive medication.", "Keywords": ["aged", "blood pressure", "hypertension", "polypharmacy"], "MeSH terms": ["Accidental Falls", "Aged", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Frail Elderly", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Medicare", "Polypharmacy", "Risk Adjustment", "Risk Factors", "Statistics as Topic", "Trauma Severity Indices", "United States", "Wounds and Injuries"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samantha G", "Last Name": "Bromfield", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Epidemiology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA (S.G.B.);

Determining race and sex disparities in ABPM measures among HIV+ individuals may improve strategies to diagnose and treat hypertension in this high-risk population. We compared ABPM measures between 24 African-American and 25 white HIV+ adults (36 men and 13 women). Awake systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were similar in African-Americans and whites. After multivariable adjustment, sleep SBP and DBP were 9.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 4.7, 14.8) and 8.4 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.3, 12.5) higher, respectively, among African-Americans compared with whites. After multivariable adjustment, SBP and DBP dipping ratios were 5.2% (95% CI: 1.7%, 8.7%) and 6.1% (95% CI 2.0%, 10.3%) smaller among African-Americans compared with whites. After multivariable adjustment, awake and sleep SBP and DBP were higher in men compared to women. There was no difference in SBP or DBP dipping ratios comparing men and women. The prevalence of awake masked hypertension was 42% in men versus 17% in women, and the prevalence of sleep masked hypertension was 57% among African-Americans versus 18% among whites.

however the role of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a marker of endothelial cell repair, and circulating endothelial cells (CECs), a marker of endothelial cell injury, in COPD and its subphenotypes is unresolved. We hypothesized that endothelial progenitor cell populations would be decreased in COPD and emphysema and that circulating endothelial cells would be increased. Associations with other subphenotypes were examined. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis COPD Study recruited smokers with COPD and controls age 50-79 years without clinical cardiovascular disease. Endothelial progenitor cell populations (CD34+KDR+ and CD34+KDR+CD133+ cells) and circulating endothelial cells (CD45dimCD31+CD146+CD133-) were measured by flow cytometry. COPD was defined by standard spirometric criteria. Emphysema was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively on CT. Full pulmonary function testing and expiratory CTs were measured in a subset. Among 257 participants, both endothelial progenitor cell populations, and particularly CD34+KDR+ endothelial progenitor cells, were reduced in COPD. The CD34+KDR+CD133+ endothelial progenitor cells were associated inversely with emphysema extent. Both endothelial progenitor cell populations were associated inversely with extent of panlobular emphysema and positively with diffusing capacity. Circulating endothelial cells were not significantly altered in COPD but were inversely associated with pulmonary microvascular blood flow on MRI. There was no consistent association of endothelial progenitor cells or circulating endothelial cells with measures of gas trapping. These data provide evidence that endothelial repair is impaired in COPD and suggest that this pathological process is specific to emphysema.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Emphysema", "Endothelial Progenitor Cells", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Plethysmography", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Margaret F", "Last Name": "Doyle", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Russell P", "Last Name": "Tracy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Megha A", "Last Name": "Parikh", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John H M", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Katja", "Last Name": "Hueper", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jens", "Last Name": "Vogel-Claussen", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Joao", "Last Name": "Lima", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Antoinette", "Last Name": "Gomes", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Karol", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Kawut", "Affiliation": "Penn Cardiovascular Institute Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Division, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28285829", "Title": "Clinic and ambulatory blood pressure in a population-based sample of African Americans: the Jackson Heart Study.", "Abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) can differ substantially when measured in the clinic versus outside of the clinic setting.

Our goal was to examine the contribution of longitudinal patterns of blood pressure change to incidence of heart failure, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease mortality. Latent class growth models were used to identify patterns of change in blood pressure across 4 clinical examinations (1987-1998) among 9845 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort participants (mean age, 53.7 [SD 5.7] years). Patterns of change in systolic blood pressure included slowly and steeply increasing, a decreasing and a sustained elevated blood pressure. Changes in diastolic and mid-blood pressure (\u00bd systolic+\u00bd diastolic) were less pronounced. The association of blood pressure pattern group membership with incidence of clinical outcomes was examined in follow-up from the fourth clinical examination (1996-1998) to December 31, 2011, using Poisson regression models adjusted for demographic and metabolic characteristics, and hypertension medication use. A gradient of rates of all events was observed across the identified patterns. Associations were attenuated after adjustment for covariates. Cumulative systolic blood pressure load, rather than the temporal pattern of change in systolic blood pressure itself, plays a role in determining the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular, of heart failure and cardiovascular disease mortality, independent of blood pressure level measured at one point in time.", "Keywords": ["blood pressure", "cardiovascular diseases", "coronary disease", "heart failure", "hypertension", "stroke"], "MeSH terms": ["Age Distribution", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Incidence", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Assessment", "Sex Distribution", "Survival Rate", "Systole", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Petruski-Ivleva", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Epidemiology (N.P.-I., C.L.A.), Department of Family Medicine and Hypertension Research Program (A.J.V.), Department of Biostatistics (D.C.), and Cecil G.

After an average follow-up period of 7 years (2000-2010), the authors found that blood pressure at a mean age of 36 years predicted change in arterial stiffening by a mean age of 43 years, but not the reverse. Essential hypertension results from a mosaic of pathological mechanisms. It has been theorized that biological pathways involving increased sympathetic tone, insulin resistance, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activation, and inflammation lead to hyperkinetic circulation, volume overload, and vascular remodeling. The resultant accelerated vascular aging may be assessed by determining the degree of arterial stiffness. The findings of Chen et al. add important empirical information to the literature but do not solve the dilemma regarding the origins of essential hypertension, partly because there are many techniques for estimating the many aspects of arterial stiffness which are not fully understood. Mathematical features of estimates might not be uniform across the age range. There is a need for tracking blood pressure and different aspects of arterial stiffness from childhood onward, with an aim of preventing hypertension in adult life.", "Keywords": ["arterial elasticity", "arterial stiffness", "blood pressure", "cohort studies", "hypertension", "middle age"], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Pressure", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Vascular Stiffness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Duprez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of epidemiology", "PubDate": "2016Apr01"}, {"PMID": "26928285", "Title": "Sedentary behavior and subclinical atherosclerosis in African Americans: cross-sectional analysis of the Jackson heart study.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have reported conflicting results as to whether an association exists between sedentary time and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among African Americans.

Blood pressure may differ considerably when measured inside versus outside of the clinic setting. Over the past several decades, evidence has accumulated on the following 2 approaches for measuring blood pressure outside of the clinic: ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). Both of these methods have a stronger association with cardiovascular disease outcomes than clinic blood pressure measurement. Controversy exists about whether ABPM or HBPM is superior for estimating risk for cardiovascular disease and under what circumstances these methods should be used in clinical practice for assessing blood pressure outside of the clinic. This review describes ABPM and HBPM procedures, the blood pressure phenotypic measurements that can be ascertained, and the evidence that supports the use of each approach to measuring blood pressure outside of the clinic. It also describes barriers to the successful implementation of ABPM and HBPM in clinical practice, proposes core competencies for the conduct of these procedures, and highlights important areas for future research.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Risk Factors", "Self Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marwah", "Last Name": "Abdalla", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Louise", "Last Name": "Falzon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raymond R", "Last Name": "Townsend", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Muntner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annals of internal medicine", "PubDate": "2015Nov03"}, {"PMID": "26450780", "Title": "Relations among depressive symptoms, electrocardiographic hypertrophy, and cardiac events in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome patients.", "Abstract": "Cardiac outcomes after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are worse in patients with depression, but identifying which depressed patients are at increased risk, and by what means, remains difficult.", "Keywords": ["Electrocardiography", "acute coronary syndrome", "depression", "hypertrophy"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Depression", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Whang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, USA ww42@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Karina W", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas O", "Last Name": "Palmeri", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anupama B", "Last Name": "Bhatt", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Peacock", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, USA."}, {"First Name": "William F", "Last Name": "Chaplin", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, St John's University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald E", "Last Name": "Edmondson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, USA."}], "Journal": "European heart journal.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) complements clinic blood pressure by measuring blood pressure in the out-of-clinic setting. ABPM can be used to identify white coat hypertension, defined as elevated clinic blood pressure and non-elevated ambulatory blood pressure.

A prior diagnosis of hypertension was more common among those with versus without an ABPM claim (77.7% vs. 47.0%). Among hypertensive beneficiaries, 95.2% of those with an ABPM claim were taking antihypertensive medication. Age 75-84 versus 65-74 years, having coronary heart disease, having chronic kidney disease, having multiple prior hypertension diagnoses, and having filled multiple classes of antihypertensive medication were associated with an increased odds for an ABPM claim among hypertensive beneficiaries.

Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and trait anxiety symptoms by using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; both were categorized according to uppermost quartile. T-wave inversions in ECG leads other than V1 to V3 were obtained from electrocardiograms obtained at rest during the baseline examination. Participants with major intraventricular conduction abnormalities and those taking antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, and/or antipsychotics were excluded. Logistic regression models were estimated with multivariable adjustment for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 5,906 participants, elevated depressive symptoms were associated with increased odds of T-wave inversion after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 3.06, p = 0.001), whereas greater trait anxiety was associated with reduced odds of T-wave inversion (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.77, p = 0.003). The divergent associations of depressive symptoms and trait anxiety with ECG T-wave inversions were similar in men and women, and these associations were present across the racial and ethnic subgroups (non-Hispanic white, African-American, Hispanic, and Chinese).

Medical databases were searched through June 4, 2014, for studies meeting the following eligibility criteria: adult participants; BP measurements at \u22653 visits; follow-up for CVD, coronary heart disease, stroke, or mortality outcomes; events confirmed via database, death certificate, or event ascertainment committee; and adjustment for confounders.

Few studies provided sufficient data for pooling risk estimates.

We studied participants (n=2043) from the population-based Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm Hg despite the use of 3 antihypertensive medication classes or the use of \u22654 classes of antihypertensive medication regardless of blood pressure control).

A greater number of healthy lifestyle factors were associated with lower risk for cardiovascular events (n=360) during a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios [HR (95% confidence interval)] for cardiovascular events comparing individuals with 2, 3, and 4 to 6 versus 0 to 1 healthy lifestyle factors were 0.91 (0.68-1.21), 0.80 (0.57-1.14), and 0.63 (0.41-0.95), respectively (P-trend=0.020).

We analyzed data from participants with two clinic visits separated by a median of 17\u00a0days in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n\u00a0=\u00a0808). Ten-year CVD risk was calculated with SBP obtained at each visit using the Pooled Cohort Equations. The mean age of participants was 46.1\u00a0years, and 47.3% were male. The median SBP difference between the two visits was -1\u00a0mm Hg (1st to 99th percentiles: -23 to 32\u00a0mm Hg). The median estimated 10-year CVD risk was 2.5% and 2.4% at the first and second visit, respectively (1st to 99th percentiles -5.2% to +7.1%). Meaningful risk reclassification (ie, across the guideline recommended 7.5% threshold for statin initiation) occurred in 12 (11.3%) of 106 participants whose estimated CVD risk was between 5% and 10%, but only in two (0.3%) of 702 participants who had a 10-year estimated CVD risk of <5% or >10%.

Refractory hypertension was defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, \u2265140/90 mm Hg) on \u22655 antihypertensive drug classes. Participants with resistant hypertension (systolic/diastolic, \u2265140/90 mm Hg on \u22653 or <140/90 mm Hg on \u22654 antihypertensive classes) and all participants treated for hypertension served as comparator groups. Of 14 809 REGARDS participants receiving antihypertensive treatment, 78 (0.5%) had refractory hypertension. The prevalence of refractory hypertension was 3.6% among participants with resistant hypertension (n=2144) and 41.7% among participants on \u22655 antihypertensive drug classes. Among all participants with hypertension, black race, male sex, living in the stroke belt or buckle, higher body mass index, lower heart rate, reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, diabetes mellitus, and history of stroke and coronary heart disease were associated with refractory hypertension.

Clinicians currently rely on intuition to identify medication nonadherence. The visit-to-visit variability (VVV) of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol might represent an opportunity to identify statin nonadherence with greater accuracy. We examined the clinical and pharmacy data from 782 members of the Boston Medical Center Health Plan, seen at either the Boston Medical Center or its affiliated community health centers, who were taking statins and had \u22653 LDL cholesterol measurements from 2008 to 2011. The LDL cholesterol VVV (defined by the within-patient SD) was categorized into quintiles. Multivariate logistic regression models were generated with statin nonadherence (defined by the standard 80% pharmacy refill-based medication possession ratio threshold) as the dependent variable. The proportion of statin nonadherence increased across the quintiles of LDL cholesterol VVV (64.3%, 71.2%, 89.2%, 92.3%, 91.7%). Higher quintiles of LDL cholesterol VVV had a strong positive association with statin nonadherence, with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.4 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 7.1) in the highest versus lowest quintile of LDL cholesterol VVV. The age- and gender-adjusted model had poor discrimination (C-statistic 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.67), but the final adjusted model (age, gender, race, mean LDL cholesterol) demonstrated good discrimination (C-statistic 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.79) between the adherent and nonadherent patients. In conclusion, the VVV of LDL cholesterol demonstrated a strong association with statin nonadherence in a clinic setting. Furthermore, a VVV of LDL cholesterol-based model had good discrimination characteristics for statin nonadherence.

The aim of this study was to determine whether leukocyte telomere length is independently associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in the general population. Telomere length was measured using a polymerase chain reaction method for participants enrolled in the 1995 Nova Scotia Health Survey (NSHS95; n = 1,917). The primary end point was the first occurrence of a fatal or nonfatal CHD event. During a mean follow-up period of 8.7 years, 164 fatal or nonfatal CHD events occurred. Compared with participants in the longest tertile of telomere length, those in the middle and shortest tertiles had increased incidence of CHD events (6.2, 11.2, and 12.2 per 1,000 person-years, respectively). After adjustment for demographics, traditional risk factors, and inflammatory markers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, those in the middle tertile had significantly elevated risk for incident CHD (hazard ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.51, p = 0.02) compared with the longest tertile, whereas the risk for those in the shortest tertile was nonsignificantly elevated (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.90, p = 0.30).

We also confirmed 10 previously known loci associated with SBP, DBP, MAP or PP (ADRB1, ATP2B1, SH2B3/ATXN2, CSK, CYP17A1, FURIN, HFE, LSP1, MTHFR, SOX6) at array-wide significance (P < 2.4 \u00d7 10(-6)). We then replicated these associations in an independent set of 65 886 individuals of European ancestry. The findings from expression QTL (eQTL) analysis showed associations of SNPs in the MDM4 region with MDM4 expression. We did not find any evidence of association of the two novel SNPs in MDM4 and HRH1 with sequelae of high BP including coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or stroke.

Women may have more atypical ACS symptoms compared to men, but few data are available on differences in gender and ACS symptoms in calling 911. In this study, patient interviews and structured chart reviews were conducted to determine gender differences in calling 911. Calls to 911 were assessed by self-report and validated by medical chart review. Of the 476 patients studied, 292 (61%) were diagnosed with unstable angina and 184 (39%) with myocardial infarctions (MIs). Overall, only 23% of patients called 911. Similar percentages of women and men with unstable angina called 911 (15% and 13%, respectively, p = 0.59). In contrast, women with MIs were significantly more likely to call 911 than men (57% vs 28%, p <0.001). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, health insurance status, history of MI, the left ventricular ejection fraction, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, and ACS symptoms, women were 1.79 times more likely to call 911 during an MI than men (prevalence ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.64, p <0.01). In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that initiatives to increase calls to 911 are needed for women and men.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Coronary Syndrome", "Aged", "Emergency Medical Services", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Survival Rate", "Time-to-Treatment", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Newman", "Affiliation": "Center for Cardiovascular Behavioral Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karina W", "Last Name": "Davidson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Siqin", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Shaffer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daichi", "Last Name": "Shimbo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Muntner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The American journal of cardiology", "PubDate": "2013Jan01"}, {"PMID": "22886783", "Title": "C-reactive protein level and the incidence of eligibility for statin therapy: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.", "Abstract": "Given the results of the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial, statin initiation may be considered for individuals with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
