We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, until January 31, 2023, and included articles reporting seizure activity-related events in PwE receiving COVID-19 vaccination.

The pooled incidence proportion of increased seizure frequency (16 studies-3245 PwE) was 5% (95% CI: 3%-7%, I2 \u2009=\u200952%). Regarding increased seizure frequency, no significant difference was observed between mRNA and viral vector (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.49-2.52, I2 \u2009=\u20090%), and between mRNA and inactivated virus (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 0.27-9.37; I2 \u2009=\u20090%).

A timely evaluation for surgical candidacy can be life-saving for patients who are identified as appropriate surgical candidates, and may also enhance the care of nonsurgical candidates through improvement in diagnosis, optimization of therapy, and treatment of comorbidities. Yet, referral for surgical evaluations is often delayed while palliative options are pursued, with significant adverse consequences due to increased morbidity and mortality associated with intractable epilepsy. The Surgical Therapies Commission of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) sought to address these clinical gaps and clarify when to initiate a surgical evaluation. We conducted a Delphi consensus process with 61 epileptologists, epilepsy neurosurgeons, neurologists, neuropsychiatrists, and neuropsychologists with a median of 22\u2009years in practice, from 28 countries in all six ILAE world regions. After three rounds of Delphi surveys, evaluating 51 unique scenarios, we reached the following Expert Consensus Recommendations: (1) Referral for a surgical evaluation should be offered to every patient with drug-resistant epilepsy (up to 70\u2009years of age), as soon as drug resistance is ascertained, regardless of epilepsy duration, sex, socioeconomic status, seizure type, epilepsy type (including epileptic encephalopathies), localization, and comorbidities (including severe psychiatric comorbidity like psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [PNES] or substance abuse) if patients are cooperative with management; (2) A surgical referral should be considered for older patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who have no surgical contraindication, and for patients (adults and children) who are seizure-free on 1-2 antiseizure medications (ASMs) but have a brain lesion in noneloquent cortex; and (3) referral for surgery should not be offered to patients with active substance abuse who are noncooperative with management.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) COVID-19 and Telemedicine Task Forces examined, through surveys to people with epilepsy (PWE), caregivers, and health care professionals, how the pandemic has affected the well-being, care, and services for PWE. The ILAE included a link on their website whereby PWE and/or their caregivers could fill out a survey (in 11\u00a0languages) about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including access to health services and impact on mental health, including the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. An anonymous link was also provided whereby health care providers could report cases of new-onset seizures or an exacerbation of seizures in the context of COVID-19. Finally, a separate questionnaire aimed at exploring the utilization of telehealth by health care professionals since the pandemic began was available on the ILAE website and also disseminated to its members. Seventeen case reports were received; data were limited and therefore no firm conclusions could be drawn. Of 590 respondents to the well-being survey (422 PWE, 166 caregivers), 22.8% PWE and 27.5% caregivers reported an increase in seizure frequency, with difficulty in accessing medication and health care professionals reported as barriers to care. Of all respondents, 57.1% PWE and 21.5% caregivers had severe psychological distress (k score >13), which was significantly higher among PWE than caregivers (p<0.01). An increase in telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by health care professionals, with 40% of consultations conducted by this method. Although 74.9% of health care providers thought that this impacted positively, barriers to care were also identified.

Patients are afflicted primarily with progressive central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Studies in mice, cats, and sheep have indicated safety and widespread distribution of Hex in the CNS after intracranial vector infusion of AAVrh8 vectors encoding species-specific Hex \u03b1- or \u03b2-subunits at a 1:1 ratio. Here, a safety study was conducted in cynomolgus macaques (cm), modeling previous animal studies, with bilateral infusion in the thalamus as well as in left lateral ventricle of AAVrh8 vectors encoding cm Hex \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits. Three doses (3.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091012 vg [n\u2009=\u20093]; 3.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091011 vg [n\u2009=\u20092]; or 1.1\u2009\u00d7\u20091011 vg [n\u2009=\u20092]) were tested, with controls infused with vehicle (n\u2009=\u20091) or transgene empty AAVrh8 vector at the highest dose (n\u2009=\u20092). Most monkeys receiving AAVrh8-cmHex\u03b1/\u03b2 developed dyskinesias, ataxia, and loss of dexterity, with higher dose animals eventually becoming apathetic. Time to onset of symptoms was dose dependent, with the highest-dose cohort producing symptoms within a month of infusion. One monkey in the lowest-dose cohort was behaviorally asymptomatic but had magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in the thalami. Histopathology was similar in all monkeys injected with AAVrh8-cmHex\u03b1/\u03b2, showing severe white and gray matter necrosis along the injection track, reactive vasculature, and the presence of neurons with granular eosinophilic material. Lesions were minimal to absent in both control cohorts.

We sought to determine the association of surgical timing with outcomes for subdural hematoma. A retrospective review was performed of 522 consecutive patients admitted to a single center from 2006-2012 who underwent emergent craniectomy for acute subdural hematoma. After excluding patients with unknown time of injury, penetrating trauma, concurrent cerebrovascular injury, epidural hematoma, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage greater than 30 mL, there remained 45 patients identified for analysis. Using a multiple regression model, we examined the effect of surgical timing, in addition to other variables on in-hospital mortality (primary outcome), as well as the need for tracheostomy or gastrostomy (secondary outcome). We found that increasing injury severity score (odds ratio [OR] 1.146; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.035-1.270; p=0.009) and age (OR1.066; 95%CI 1.006-1.129; p=0.031) were associated with in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis. In this model, increasing time to surgery was not associated with mortality, and in fact had a significant effect in decreasing mortality (OR 0.984; 95%CI 0.971-0.997; p=0.018). Premorbid aspirin use was associated with a paradoxical decrease in mortality (OR 0.019; 95%CI 0.001-0.392; p=0.010).

To determine long-term seizure outcomes following surgical resection of supratentorial cavernous malformations, the predictive value of characteristics including seizure duration and number, presence of generalized seizures, and lesion multiplicity and size on seizure control rate was evaluated.", "Keywords": ["Cavernous malformation", "Epilepsy", "Multivariate analysis", "Seizure", "Surgery"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Seizures", "Time", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Churl-Su", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.

The goal of this study was to evaluate dye-enhanced multimodal confocal imaging for discriminating gliomas from nonglial brain tumors and from normal brain tissue for diagnostic use. We investigated a total of 37 samples including glioma (13), meningioma (7), metastatic tumors (9) and normal brain removed for nontumoral indications (8). Tissue was stained in 0.05\u2009mg/mL aqueous solution of methylene blue (MB) for 2-5 minutes and multimodal confocal images were acquired using a custom-built microscope. After imaging, tissue was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for standard neuropathologic evaluation. Thirteen pathologists provided diagnoses based on the multimodal confocal images. The investigated tumor types exhibited distinctive and complimentary characteristics in both the reflectance and fluorescence responses. Images showed distinct morphological features similar to standard histology. Pathologists were able to distinguish gliomas from normal brain tissue and nonglial brain tumors, and to render diagnoses from the images in a manner comparable to haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides.
