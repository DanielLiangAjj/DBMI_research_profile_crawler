[{"PMID": "38811657", "Title": "Cerebrovascular disease emerges with age and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome.", "Abstract": "Adults with Down syndrome have a genetic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evidence of cerebrovascular disease across the AD continuum, despite few systemic vascular risk factors. The onset and progression of AD in Down syndrome is highly age-dependent, but it is unknown at what age cerebrovascular disease emerges and what factors influence its severity. In the Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome study (ABC-DS; n\u2009=\u2009242; age\u2009=\u200925-72), we estimated the age inflection point at which MRI-based white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), microbleeds, and infarcts emerge in relation to demographic data, risk factors, amyloid and tau, and AD diagnosis. Enlarged PVS and infarcts appear to develop in the early 30s, while microbleeds, WMH, amyloid, and tau emerge in the mid to late 30s. Age-residualized WMH were higher in women, in individuals with dementia, and with lower body mass index. Participants with hypertension and APOE-\u03b54 had higher age-residualized PVS and microbleeds, respectively. Lifespan trajectories demonstrate a dramatic cerebrovascular profile in adults with Down syndrome that appears to evolve developmentally in parallel with AD pathophysiology approximately two decades prior to dementia symptoms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Down Syndrome", "Alzheimer Disease", "Female", "Male", "Adult", "Aged", "Middle Aged", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Risk Factors", "White Matter", "Age Factors", "Aging", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Gertrude H.

Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD)\u00a0=\u00a076.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vascular pathologies in memory loss in older adults and suggest that future studies should further examine the neural mechanisms of these relationships in longitudinal samples.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Cerebrovascular disease", "Hippocampus", "Long-term memory", "Small vessel disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Aged", "White Matter", "Temporal Lobe", "Alzheimer Disease", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Long-Term", "Atrophy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Batool", "Last Name": "Rizvi", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mithra", "Last Name": "Sathishkumar", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Freddie", "Last Name": "M\u00e1rquez", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven J", "Last Name": "Granger", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Myra S", "Last Name": "Larson", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Blake A", "Last Name": "Miranda", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martina K", "Last Name": "Hollearn", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liv", "Last Name": "McMillan", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Nan", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Statistics, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas J", "Last Name": "Tustison", "Affiliation": "Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA; Department of Radiology and Medical Imaging, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

They are typically attributed to small vessel cerebrovascular disease in the context of aging. Among older adults, WMH are associated with risk of cognitive decline and dementia, stroke, and various other health outcomes. There has been increasing interest in incorporating quantitative WMH measurement as outcomes in clinical trials, observational research, and clinical settings. Here, we present a novel, fully automated, unsupervised detection algorithm for WMH segmentation and quantification. The algorithm uses a robust preprocessing pipeline, including brain extraction and a sample-specific mask that incorporates spatial information for automatic false positive reduction, and a half Gaussian mixture model (HGMM). The method was evaluated in 24 participants with varying degrees of WMH (4.9-78.6\u00a0cm3) from a community-based study of aging and dementia with dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, correlation, and bias relative to the ground truth manual segmentation approach performed by two expert raters. Results were compared with those derived from commonly used available WMH segmentation packages, including SPM lesion probability algorithm (LPA), SPM lesion growing algorithm (LGA), and Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (BIANCA). The HGMM algorithm derived WMH values that had a dice score of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.89, and specificity of 0.99 compared to ground truth. White matter hyperintensity volumes derived with HGMM were strongly correlated with ground truth values (r\u00a0=\u00a00.97, p\u00a0=\u00a03.9e-16), with no observable bias (-1.1 [-2.6, 0.44], p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.16).

The current gold standard for detecting and rating cerebral microbleeds in a research context is visual inspection by trained raters, a process that is both time consuming and subject to poor reliability. We present here a novel method to automate microbleed detection on GRE and SWI images. We demonstrate in a community-based cohort of older adults that the method is highly sensitive (greater than 92% of all microbleeds accurately detected) across both modalities, with reasonable precision (fewer than 20 and 10 false positives per scan on GRE and SWI, respectively). We also demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to identify microbleeds over longitudinal scans with a higher level of sensitivity than visual ratings (50% of longitudinal microbleeds correctly labeled by the algorithm, while manual ratings was 30% or lower). Further, the algorithm identifies the anatomical localization of microbleeds based on brain atlases, and greatly reduces time spent completing visual ratings (43% reduction in visual rating time).

However, the extent to which cerebrovascular disease represents an independent pathognomonic feature of Alzheimer's disease or directly promotes Alzheimer's pathology is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between white matter hyperintensities and plasma levels of tau and to determine if white matter hyperintensities and tau levels interact to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To confirm that cerebrovascular disease promotes tau pathology, we examined tau fluid biomarker concentrations and pathology in a mouse model of ischaemic injury. Three hundred ninety-one participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (74.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1\u2009years of age) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Participants had measurements of plasma total-tau, cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid, and white matter hyperintensities, and were diagnosed clinically as Alzheimer's disease (n\u2009=\u200997), mild cognitive impairment (n\u2009=\u2009186) or cognitively normal control (n\u2009=\u2009108). We tested the relationship between plasma tau concentration and white matter hyperintensity volume across diagnostic groups. We also examined the extent to which white matter hyperintensity volume, plasma tau, amyloid positivity status and the interaction between white matter hyperintensities and plasma tau correctly classifies diagnostic category. Increased white matter hyperintensity volume was associated with higher plasma tau concentration, particularly among those diagnosed clinically with Alzheimer's disease. Presence of brain amyloid and the interaction between plasma tau and white matter hyperintensity volume distinguished Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment participants from controls with 77.6% and 63.3% accuracy, respectively. In 63 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants who came to autopsy (82.33\u2009\u00b1\u20097.18 age at death), we found that higher degrees of arteriosclerosis were associated with higher Braak staging, indicating a positive relationship between cerebrovascular disease and neurofibrillary pathology. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model, aged mice that received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, but not sham surgery, had increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid tau concentrations, induced myelin loss, and hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cerebral hemisphere. These findings demonstrate a relationship between cerebrovascular disease, operationalized as white matter hyperintensities, and tau levels, indexed in the plasma, suggesting that hypoperfusive injury promotes tau pathology. This potential causal association is supported by the demonstration that transient cerebral artery occlusion induces white matter damage, increases biofluidic markers of tau, and promotes cerebral tau hyperphosphorylation in older-adult mice.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "cerebrovascular disease", "plasma biomarkers", "tau", "white matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krystal K", "Last Name": "Laing", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, G.H.

The extent to which diminished microstructure precedes or results from macrostructural white matter damage is poorly understood. This study evaluated the hypothesis that white matter areas with normatively lower microstructure in young adults are most susceptible to develop WMH in older adults. Forty-nine younger participants (age = 25.8 \u00b1 2.8 years) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 557 older participants (age = 73.9 \u00b1 5.7 years) underwent DWI and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In older adults, WMH had a mostly periventricular distribution with higher frequency in frontal regions. We found lower FA in areas of frank WMH compared to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in older adults. Then, to determine if areas of normatively lower white matter microstructure spatially overlap with areas that frequently develop macrostructural damage in older age, we created a WMH frequency map in which each voxel represented the percentage of older adults with a WMH in that voxel. We found lower normative FA in young adults with regions frequently segmented as WMH in older adults. We conclude that low white matter microstructure is observed in areas of white matter macrostructural damage, but white matter microstructure is also normatively low (i.e., at ages 20-30) in regions with high WMH frequency, prior to white matter macrostructural damage.", "Keywords": ["across the lifespan", "diffusion-weighted imaging", "white matter hyperintensity", "white matter macrostructure", "white matter microstructure"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Vorburger", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Narkhede", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yunglin", "Last Name": "Gazes", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kay C", "Last Name": "Igwe", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Juliet", "Last Name": "Col\u00f3n", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Erica", "Last Name": "Amarante", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa A", "Last Name": "Guzman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Briana S", "Last Name": "Last", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "34368788", "Title": "Brain areas with normatively greater cerebral perfusion in early life may be more susceptible to beta amyloid deposition in late life.", "Abstract": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis characterizes the stereotyped progression of pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) beginning with beta amyloid deposition, but does not address the reasons for amyloid deposition.

Cardiac sympathetic neurodegeneration can be mimicked in animals using systemic dosing of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). As in PD, 6-OHDA-induced neuronal loss is associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress. To assess the feasibility of detecting changes over time in cardiac catecholaminergic innervation, inflammation, and oxidative stress, myocardial positron emission tomography with the radioligands [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine (MHED), [11C]PBR28 (PBR28), and [61Cu]diacetyl-bis(N(4))-methylthiosemicarbazone (ATSM) was performed in 6-OHDA-intoxicated adult, male rhesus macaques (n\u2009=\u200910; 50\u2009mg/kg i.v.). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) agonist pioglitazone, which is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress properties, was administered to five animals (5\u2009mg/kg, PO); the other five were placebo-treated. One week after 6-OHDA, cardiac MHED uptake was significantly reduced in both groups (placebo, 86% decrease; pioglitazone, 82%); PBR28 and ATSM uptake increased in both groups but were attenuated in pioglitazone-treated animals (PBR28 Treatment\u2009\u00d7\u2009Level ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.002; ATSM Mann-Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.032). At 12 weeks, partial recovery of MHED uptake was significantly greater in the pioglitazone-treated group, dependent on left ventricle circumferential region and axial level (Treatment\u2009\u00d7\u2009Region\u2009\u00d7\u2009Level ANOVA p\u2009=\u20090.034); 12-week MHED uptake significantly correlated with tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity across cardiac anatomy (p\u2009<\u20090.000002). PBR28 and ATSM uptake returned to baseline levels by 12 weeks.

This idea, however, is primarily based on lesion studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging, without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency, including overlapping and different regions, in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging.

Due to morphological differences in brain structure in the DS population, special consideration must be given to processing pipelines and the use of normative atlases developed for the non-DS population. Further, the use of typical MRI to MRI template spatial normalization is less desirable in this cohort due to a greater presence of motion artefacts in MRI images. The diffuse nature of PiB uptake and comparatively lower spatial resolution of the PET image permits the purposing of this modality as a template for spatial normalization, which can substantially improve the robustness of this procedure in the cases of MRI images with motion. The aim of this work was to establish standardized methods for spatial normalization and tissue type segmentation using DS specific templates in order to perform voxel-wise analyses. A total of 72 adults with DS underwent [11C]PiB PET to assess brain amyloid burden and volumetric MRI imaging. A DS specific PiB template for spatial normalization and a set of DS specific prior probability templates were created with two-pass methods. With implementation of this DS specific PiB template, no participants were excluded due to poor spatial normalization, thus maximizing the sample size for PiB analyses in standardized space. In addition, difference images between prior probability templates created from the general population and the DS population reflected known morphological differences, particularly in the frontal cortex. In conclusion, DS specific templates that account for unique challenges improve spatial normalization and tissue type segmentation, and provide a framework for reliable voxel-wise analysis of AD biomarkers in this atypical population.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Brain template", "Down syndrome", "MRI", "PET"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Down Syndrome", "Female",

Increased global amyloid-\u03b2 was related to decline in verbal episodic memory, visual episodic memory, executive functioning, and fine motor processing speed. Participants who were consistently PiB+ demonstrated worsening of episodic memory, whereas participants who were consistently PiB- evidenced stable or improved performance. Amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation may be a contributor to or biomarker of declining cognitive functioning in preclinical AD in DS.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid-\u03b2", "Dementia", "Down syndrome", "Mild cognitive impairment", "PiB"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Aniline Compounds", "Brain", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Down Syndrome", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Middle Aged", "Phenanthrolines", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Thiazoles", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sigan L", "Last Name": "Hartley", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Development & Family Studies, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA; University of Wisconsin-Madison, Waisman Center, Madison, WI, USA.

Additionally, reference tissue distribution volume ratio (DVR) estimation methods and SUV ratio (SUVR) timing windows were evaluated to determine the optimal strategy for specific binding quantification. Methods: Twenty-eight subjects (mean age \u00b1 SD, 71 \u00b1 7 y) underwent either dynamic 90-min 18F-THK-5317 or 18F-THK-5351 PET scans. Bland-Altman plots were used to compare the simplified reference tissue method, multilinear reference tissue method (MRTM2), and Logan reference tissue DVR estimates and to assess temporal stability of SUVR windows using cerebellar gray matter as a reference region. In vivo kinetics and DVR estimates were directly compared for 10 subjects who underwent both 18F-THK-5317 and 18F-THK-5351 PET scans. Results: THK-5351 exhibited faster cerebellar gray matter clearance, faster cortical white matter clearance, and higher DVR estimates in AD tau-associated regions of interest than THK-5317. The MRTM2 method produced the most reliable DVR estimates for both tracers, particularly when scan duration was shortened to 60 min. SUVR stability was observed 50-70 min after injection for both tracers. Parametric images revealed differences between MRTM2, Logan, and SUVR binding in white matter regions for THK-5317. Conclusion: THK-5317 and THK-5351 show promise for in vivo detection of AD tau.

The goal of this work was to use PET imaging to evaluate alterations of in vivo \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) binding induced by the AChEIs physostigmine (PHY) and galanthamine (GAL). The \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR-specific radioligand [(18)F]nifene was used to examine the effects of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg PHY, 5 mg/kg GAL, and saline in three separate experiments all performed on each of two rat subjects. A 60-min bolus-infusion protocol was used with drug administered after 30 min. Data from the thalamus and cortex were analyzed with a graphical model accounting for neurotransmitter activation using the cerebellum as a reference region to test for transient competition with bound [(18) F]nifene. Significant [(18) F]nifene displacement was detected in both regions during one PHY and both GAL studies, while no significant competition was observed in both saline studies. This preliminary work indicates the viability of [(18) F]nifene in detecting increases in synaptic ACh induced by AChEIs.", "Keywords": ["PET", "[18F]nifene", "acetylcholinesterase inhibitors", "galanthamine", "nicotinic acetylcholine receptor", "physostigmine"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "Female", "Galantamine", "Physostigmine", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Pyridines", "Pyrroles", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Nicotinic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ansel T", "Last Name": "Hillmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, 53705; Waisman Brain Imaging Laboratory, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, 53705."}, {"First Name": "Dustin W", "Last Name": "Wooten", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohammed", "Last Name": "Farhoud", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew T", "Last Name": "Higgins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Todd E", "Last Name": "Barnhart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jogeshwar", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bradley T", "Last Name": "Christian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Synapse (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}]
