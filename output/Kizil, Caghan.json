The majority of the vascular transcriptional changes were in pericytes. Of the vascular molecular targets predicted to interact with astrocytic ligands, SMAD3, upregulated in Alzheimer's disease pericytes, has the highest number of ligands including VEGFA, downregulated in Alzheimer's disease astrocytes. We validated these findings with external datasets comprising 4,730 pericyte and 150,664 astrocyte nuclei. Blood SMAD3 levels are associated with\u00a0Alzheimer's disease-related neuroimaging outcomes. We determined inverse relationships between pericytic SMAD3 and astrocytic VEGFA in human iPSC and zebrafish models. Here, we detect vast transcriptome changes in Alzheimer's disease at the gliovascular-unit, prioritize perturbed pericytic SMAD3-astrocytic VEGFA interactions, and validate these in cross-species models to provide a molecular mechanism of blood-brain-barrier disintegrity in Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Humans", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Smad3

Traditional therapies aimed at single targets have fallen short owing to the complex, multifactorial nature of AD that necessitates simultaneous targeting of various disease mechanisms for clinical success.

The identification of new disease targets beyond the classical hallmarks of AD offers a fertile ground for the design of new multi-target drugs (MTDs), and building on existing compounds have the potential to yield in successful disease modifying therapies. This review discusses the evolving landscape of MTDs, focusing on their potential as AD therapeutics.

This is relevant not only from a representation standpoint but also because of admixed populations' unique features, including being enriched for rare variants, for which effect sizes are disproportionately larger than common polymorphisms. Furthermore, results from these populations may be generalizable to other populations. The South African Cape Coloured (SACC) population is genetically admixed, with one of the highest prevalences of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) worldwide. We profiled its admixture and examined associations between ancestry profiles and FASD outcomes using two longitudinal birth cohorts ( N =308 mothers, 280 children) designed to examine effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on development. Participants were genotyped via MEGA-ex array to capture common and rare variants. Rare variants were overrepresented in our SACC cohorts, with numerous polymorphisms being monomorphic in other reference populations (e.g., \u223c30,000 and \u223c221,000 variants in gnomAD European and Asian populations, respectively). The cohorts showed global African (51%; Bantu and San); European (26%; Northern/Western); South Asian (18%); and East Asian (5%; largely Southern regions) ancestries. The cohorts exhibited high rates of homozygosity (6%), with regions of homozygosity harboring more deleterious variants when lying within African local-ancestry genomic segments. Both maternal and child ancestry profiles were associated with FASD risk and altered severity of prenatal alcohol exposure-related cognitive deficits in the child.

Elderly cognitively healthy individuals with APOE\u03b54 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOE\u03b54; however, these mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOE\u03b54 carriers without dementia might carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOE\u03b54-mediated AD pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in the National\u00a0Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD\u00a0FBS), Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOE\u03b54 carriers. In homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain (COL6A2) and are known to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and in vivo functional studies. An independent analysis in a large cohort of 7185 APOE\u03b54 homozygous carriers found that rs140926439 variant in FN1 was protective of AD (OR\u2009=\u20090.29; 95% CI [0.11, 0.78], P\u2009=\u20090.014) and delayed age at onset of disease by 3.37 years (95% CI [0.42, 6.32], P\u2009=\u20090.025). The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels were increased at the BBB in APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD. Brain expression of cognitively unaffected homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers had significantly lower FN1 deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOE\u03b54-mediated AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b-the ortholog for human FN1. We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced gliovascular remodeling, and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting that pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance, which is ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests that vascular deposition of FN1 is related to the pathogenicity of APOE\u03b54, and LOF variants in FN1 may reduce APOE\u03b54-related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential therapeutic interventions targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Animals", "Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Fibronectins", "Genetic Variation", "Gliosis", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamil Iniyan", "Last Name": "Gunasekaran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Belloy", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes-Dumeyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "D\u00f6rthe", "Last Name": "J\u00fclich", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fcseyin", "Last Name": "Tayran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elanur", "Last Name": "Yilmaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bengisu", "Last Name": "Turgutalp", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gauthaman", "Last Name": "Sukumar", "Affiliation": "Henry M.

Using different model systems including HMC3 cells, iPSC-derived microglia and cerebral organoids, we characterize the effect of these compounds in mimicking human microglial subtypes in vitro.

vertebrates, olfactory receptors localize on multiple cilia elaborated on dendritic knobs of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Although olfactory cilia dysfunction can cause anosmia, how their differentiation is programmed at the transcriptional level has remained largely unexplored. We discovered in zebrafish and mice that Foxj1, a forkhead domain-containing transcription factor traditionally linked with motile cilia biogenesis, is expressed in OSNs and required for olfactory epithelium (OE) formation. In keeping with the immotile nature of olfactory cilia, we observed that ciliary motility genes are repressed in zebrafish, mouse, and human OSNs. Strikingly, we also found that besides ciliogenesis, Foxj1 controls the differentiation of the OSNs themselves by regulating their cell type-specific gene expression, such as that of olfactory marker protein (omp) involved in odor-evoked signal transduction. In line with this, response to bile acids, odors detected by OMP-positive OSNs, was significantly diminished in foxj1 mutant zebrafish. Taken together, our findings establish how the canonical Foxj1-mediated motile ciliogenic transcriptional program has been repurposed for the biogenesis of immotile olfactory cilia, as well as for the development of the OSNs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Zebrafish", "Cilia", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Olfactory Receptor Neurons", "Olfactory Mucosa"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dheeraj", "Last Name": "Rayamajhi", "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Mert", "Last Name": "Ege", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Kirill", "Last Name": "Ukhanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Christa", "Last Name": "Ringers", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Yiliu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Inyoung", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Percival P", "Last Name": "D'Gama", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Summer Shijia", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore."}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hae-Chul", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Korea University, Ansan, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Emre", "Last Name": "Yaksi", "Affiliation": "Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey R", "Last Name": "Martens", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Brody", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nathalie", "Last Name": "Jurisch-Yaksi", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Sudipto", "Last Name": "Roy", "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan"}, {"PMID": "38260431", "Title": "Rare genetic variation in Fibronectin 1 ( FN1 ) protects against APOEe4 in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly increases in individuals carrying the APOE\u03b54 allele. Elderly cognitively healthy individuals with APOE\u03b54 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOE\u03b54 ; however, these mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOE\u03b54 carriers without dementia might carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOE\u03b54- mediated AD pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD FBS), Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOE\u03b54 carriers. In homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain ( COL6A2 ) and are known to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and in vivo functional studies. The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels were increased at the BBB in APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD. Brain expression of cognitively unaffected homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers had significantly lower FN1 deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOE\u03b54 -mediated AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b - the ortholog for human FN1 . We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced gliovascular remodeling and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting that pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance, which is ameliorated with FN1 LOF.

However, the molecular mechanisms promoting pro-neurogenic astroglial fate despite AD pathology are unknown. In this study, we used APP/PS1dE9 mouse model and induced Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) expression in the hippocampus. Ngfr, which promotes neurogenic fate of astroglia during the amyloid pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish brain, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcomes. Histological analyses of the changes in proliferation and neurogenesis, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies showed that the induced expression of Ngfr reduced the reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), which we found was sufficient to reduce neurogenesis in astroglia. Anti-neurogenic effects of Lcn2 was mediated by Slc22a17, blockage of which recapitulated the pro-neurogenicity by Ngfr. Long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Postmortem human AD hippocampi and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with reactive gliosis and reduced neurogenesis. Comparing transcriptional changes in mouse, zebrafish, and human AD brains for cell intrinsic differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression networks revealed common altered downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, such as PFKP, which can enhance proliferation and neurogenesis in vitro when blocked. Our study suggests that the reactive non-neurogenic astroglia in AD can be coaxed to a pro-neurogenic fate and AD pathology can be alleviated with Ngfr.

The identification of RNA-modifying enzymes has opened the possibility of investigating the role epitranscriptomic changes play in the disease process. NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 (NSun2) is one of the few known brain-enriched methyltransferases able to methylate mammalian non-coding RNAs. NSun2 loss of function due to autosomal-recessive mutations has been associated with neurological abnormalities in humans. Here, we show NSun2 is expressed in adult human neurons in the hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex. Strikingly, we unravel decreased NSun2 protein expression and an increased ratio of pTau/NSun2 in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as demonstrated by Western blotting and immunostaining, respectively. In a well-established Drosophila melanogaster model of tau-induced toxicity, reduction of NSun2 exacerbated tau toxicity, while overexpression of NSun2 partially abrogated the toxic effects. Conditional ablation of NSun2 in the mouse brain promoted a decrease in the miR-125b m6A levels and tau hyperphosphorylation. Utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal cultures, we confirmed NSun2 deficiency results in tau hyperphosphorylation. We also found that neuronal NSun2 levels decrease in response to amyloid-beta oligomers (A\u03b2O). Notably, A\u03b2O-induced tau phosphorylation and cell toxicity in human neurons could be rescued by overexpression of NSun2.

An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates.

Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is significantly more frequent in Hispanics than in non-Hispanic Whites. Ancestry may explain these differences across ethnic groups. To this end, we studied a large cohort of Caribbean Hispanics (CH, N\u2009=\u20098813) and tested the association between Local Ancestry (LA) and LOAD (\"admixture mapping\") to identify LOAD-associated ancestral blocks, separately for ancestral components (European [EUR], African [AFR], Native American[NA]) and jointly (AFR\u2009+\u2009NA). Ancestral blocks significant after permutation were fine-mapped employing multi-ethnic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify rare variants associated with LOAD (SKAT-O) and replicated in the UK Biobank WES dataset. Candidate genes were validated studying (A) protein expression in human LOAD and control brains; (B) two animal AD models, Drosophila and Zebrafish. In the joint AFR\u2009+\u2009NA model, we identified four significant ancestral blocks located on chromosomes 1 (p value\u2009=\u20098.94E-05), 6 (p value\u2009=\u20098.63E-05), 21 (p value\u2009=\u20094.64E-05) and 22 (p value\u2009=\u20091.77E-05). Fine-mapping prioritized the GCAT gene on chromosome 22 (SKAT-O p value\u2009=\u20093.45E-05) and replicated in the UK Biobank (SKAT-O p value\u2009=\u20090.05). In LOAD brains, a decrease of 28% in GCAT protein expression was observed (p value\u2009=\u20090.038), and GCAT knockdown in Amyloid-\u03b242 Drosophila exacerbated rough eye phenotype (68% increase, p value\u2009=\u20094.84E-09). In zebrafish, gcat expression increased after acute amyloidosis (34%, p value\u2009=\u20090.0049), and decreased upon anti-inflammatory Interleukin-4 (39%, p value\u2009=\u20092.3E-05).

To study the mechanisms of pathology-induced neuro-regeneration in vertebrate brains, zebrafish is an excellent model due to its extensive neural regeneration capacity. Here, we report that Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan, negatively regulates neural stem cell (NSC) plasticity in adult zebrafish brain through its receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (Ahr2). The production of KYNA is suppressed after amyloid-toxicity through reduction of the levels of Kynurenine amino transferase 2 (KAT2), the key enzyme producing KYNA. NSC proliferation is enhanced by an antagonist for Ahr2 and is reduced with Ahr2 agonists or KYNA. A subset of Ahr2-expressing zebrafish NSCs do not express other regulatory receptors such as il4r or ngfra, indicating that ahr2-positive NSCs constitute a new subset of neural progenitors that are responsive to amyloid-toxicity. By performing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in three late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) brain autopsy cohorts, we also found that several genes that are components of KYNA metabolism or AHR signaling are differentially expressed in LOAD, suggesting a strong link between KYNA/Ahr2 signaling axis to neurogenesis in LOAD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "kynurenic acid", "neural stem cell", "neurogenesis", "plasticity", "proliferation", "regeneration", "transcriptome-wide association study", "zebrafish"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Brain", "Cell Proliferation", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Kynurenic Acid", "Models, Biological", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon", "Signal Transduction", "Transcriptome", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tohid", "Last Name": "Siddiqui", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stanislava", "Last Name": "Popova", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sanjeev", "Last Name": "Sariya", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yixin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "B-CUBE, Center for Molecular Bioengineering, TU Dresden, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) within Helmholtz Association, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2021Oct14"}, {"PMID": "34610312", "Title": "Diversity and function of motile ciliated cell types within ependymal lineages of the zebrafish brain.", "Abstract": "Motile cilia defects impair cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and can cause brain and spine disorders.

We recently identified Interleukin-4/STAT6 signaling as a neuron-glia crosstalk mechanism that enables glial proliferation and neurogenesis in adult zebrafish brain and 3D cultures of human astroglia, which manifest neurogenic properties. In this study, by using single cell sequencing in the APP/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD, we found that IL4 receptor (Il4r) is not expressed in mouse astroglia and IL4 signaling is not active in these cells. We tested whether activating IL4/STAT6 signaling would enhance cell proliferation and neurogenesis in healthy and disease conditions. Lentivirus-mediated expression of IL4R or constitutively active STAT6VT impaired the survival capacity of mouse astroglia in vivo but not in vitro. These results suggest that the adult mouse brain generates a non-permissive environment that dictates a negative effect of IL4 signaling on astroglial survival and neurogenic properties in contrast to zebrafish brains and in vitro mammalian cell cultures.

According to this tendency, Alzheimer's disease is increasingly being conceived of a disease where not only neurons but also multiple cell types synchronously partake to manifest the pathology. Knowledge on every cell type adds an alternative approach and hope for the efforts towards the treatment. Neural stem cells and their neurogenic ability are making an appearance as a new aspect of the disease manifestation based on the recent findings that neurogenesis reduces dramatically in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy individuals. Therefore, understanding how neural stem cells can form new neurons in Alzheimer's disease brains holds an immense potential for clinics.

Outside the stem cell niches, however, these glial cells are not neurogenic. Although injuries in the mammalian central nervous system lead to profound proliferation of astrocytes, which cluster at the lesion site to form a gliotic scar, neurogenesis does not take place. Therefore, a plausible regenerative therapeutic option is to coax the endogenous reactive astrocytes to a pre-neurogenic progenitor state and use them as an endogenous reservoir for repair. However, little is known on the mechanisms that promote the neural progenitor state after injuries in humans. Gata3 was previously found to be a mechanism that zebrafish brain uses to injury-dependent induction of neural progenitors.

Therefore, in this report, we investigated how overexpression of GATA3 in primary human astrocytes would affect the neurogenic potential before and after injury in 2D and 3D cultures. We found that primary human astrocytes are unable to induce GATA3 after injury. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression of GATA3 significantly increased the number of GFAP/SOX2 double positive astrocytes and expression of pro-neural factor ASCL1, but failed to induce neurogenesis, suggesting that GATA3 is required for enhancing the neurogenic potential of primary human astrocytes and is not sufficient to induce neurogenesis alone.", "Keywords": ["GATA3", "SOX2", "neural progenitors", "neurogenic potential", "primary human astrocytes", "scratch injury"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hilal", "Last Name": "Celikkaya", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Christos", "Last Name": "Papadimitriou", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stanislava", "Last Name": "Popova", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Srijeeta Nag", "Last Name": "Biswas", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tohid", "Last Name": "Siddiqui", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Wistorf", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Isabel", "Last Name": "Nevado-Alcalde", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Naumann", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Violeta", "Last Name": "Mashkaryan", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kerstin", "Last Name": "Brandt", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Uwe", "Last Name": "Freudenberg", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Carsten", "Last Name": "Werner", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30773488", "Title": "Dual Inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 and CDK5 Protects the Cytoskeleton of Neurons from Neuroinflammatory-Mediated Degeneration In\u00a0Vitro and In\u00a0Vivo.", "Abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of neurological disorders and is accompanied by the production of neurotoxic agents such as nitric oxide.

AD entails chronic inflammation, impaired synaptic integrity and reduced neurogenesis. The clinical and molecular onsets of the disease do not temporally overlap and the initiation phase of the cellular changes might start with a complex causativeness between chronic inflammation, reduced neural stem cell plasticity and neurogenesis. Although the immune and neuronal aspects in AD are well studied, the neural stem cell-related features are far less investigated. An intriguing question is, therefore, whether a stem cell can ever be made proliferative and neurogenic during the prevalent AD in the brain. Recent findings affirm this hypothesis and thus a plausible way to circumvent the AD phenotypes could be to mobilize the endogenous stem cells by enhancing their proliferative and neurogenic capacity as well as to provide the newborn neurons the potential to survive and integrate into the existing circuitry.

Comparative analysis of deep-sequencing reads from fractionated and un-fractionated 0-1 h and 7-8 h embryos revealed development-specific co-sedimentation pattern of small RNAs with the cellular translation machinery. Although most micro RNAs (miRNAs) did not have a specific preference for any state of the translational machinery, we detected fraction-specific enrichment of a few miRNAs such as dme-miR-1-3p, -184-3p, 5-5p and 263-5p. More interestingly, we observed changes in the subcellular location of a subset of miRNAs in fractionated embryos despite no measurable difference in their amount in unfractionated embryos. Transposon-derived endo small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were over-expressed in 7-8 h embryos and associated mainly with the mRNP fraction. In contrast, transposon-derived PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNA), which were more abundant in 0-1 h embryos, co-sedimented primarily with the polysome fractions.

Humans cannot regenerate lost neurons in the case of AD in part due to impaired proliferative capacity of the neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and reduced neurogenesis. Therefore, efficient regenerative therapies should also enhance the proliferation and neurogenic capacity of NSPCs. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a regenerative organism, and we can learn the basic molecular programs with which we could design therapeutic approaches to tackle AD. For this reason, the generation of an AD-like model in zebrafish was necessary. Using our methodology, we can introduce synthetic derivatives of A\u03b242 peptide with tissue penetrating capability into the adult zebrafish brain, and analyze the disease pathology and the regenerative response. The advantage over the existing methods or animal models is that zebrafish can teach us how a vertebrate brain can naturally regenerate, and thus help us to treat human neurodegenerative diseases better by targeting endogenous NSPCs. Therefore, the amyloid-toxicity model established in the adult zebrafish brain may open new avenues for research in the field of neuroscience and clinical medicine.

Interestingly, we found that although chronic and abundant expression of TAUP301L starting from early embryonic development led to hyperphosphorylation, TAUP301L did not form oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles, and did not cause elevated apoptosis and microglial activation, which are classical symptoms of tauopathies in mammals.

Aquatic vertebrates such as zebrafish have widespread ability to renew their brains upon damage, while mammals have--if not none--very limited overall regenerative competence. Underlying cause of such a disparity is not fully evident; however, one of the reasons could be activation of peculiar molecular programs, which might have specific roles after injury or damage, by the organisms that regenerate. If this hypothesis is correct, then there must be genes and pathways that (a) are expressed only after injury or damage in tissues, (b) are biologically and functionally relevant to restoration of neural tissue, and (c) are not detected in regenerating organisms. Presence of such programs might circumvent the initial detrimental effects of the damage and subsequently set up the stage for tissue redevelopment to take place by modulating the plasticity of the neural stem/progenitor cells. Additionally, if transferable, those \"molecular mechanisms of regeneration\" could open up new avenues for regenerative therapies of humans in clinical settings.

The hallmark of canonical Wnt signaling is the translocation of \u03b2-catenin into the nucleus where it activates gene transcription. However, the mechanisms regulating \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization are poorly understood. We show that Simplet/Fam53B (Smp) is required for Wnt signaling by positively regulating \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization. In the zebrafish embryo, the loss of smp blocks the activity of two \u03b2-catenin-dependent reporters and the expression of Wnt target genes, and prevents nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin. Conversely, overexpression of smp increases \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization and transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo. Expression of mutant Smp proteins lacking either the nuclear localization signal or the \u03b2-catenin interaction domain reveal that the translocation of Smp into the nucleus is essential for \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization and Wnt signaling in vivo. We also provide evidence that mammalian Smp is involved in regulating \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization: the protein colocalizes with \u03b2-catenin-dependent gene expression in mouse intestinal crypts; siRNA knockdown of Smp reduces \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization and transcriptional activity; human SMP mediates \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner; and the human SMP protein interacts with human \u03b2-catenin primarily in the nucleus.
