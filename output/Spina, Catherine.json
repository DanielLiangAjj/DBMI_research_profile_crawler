We further demonstrate that MYCN messenger RNA levels in amplified disease are exceptionally high and sufficient to sponge let-7, which reconciles the dispensability of LIN28B. We found that genetic loss of let-7 is common in neuroblastoma, inversely associated with MYCN amplification, and independently associated with poor outcomes, providing a rationale for chromosomal loss patterns in neuroblastoma.

Testosterone's promyogenic effects are mediated through upregulation of follistatin. We show here that the administration of recombinant follistatin (rFst) increased muscle mass in mice, but had no effect on prostate mass. Consistent with the results of rFst administration, follistatin transgenic mice with constitutively elevated follistatin levels displayed greater muscle mass than controls, but had similar prostate weights. To elucidate signaling pathways regulated differentially by testosterone and rFst in prostate and muscle, we performed microarray analysis of mRNAs from prostate and levator ani of castrated male mice treated with vehicle, testosterone, or rFst. Testosterone and rFst shared the regulation of many transcripts in levator ani; however, in prostate, 593 transcripts in several growth-promoting pathways were differentially expressed after testosterone treatment, while rFst showed a negligible effect with only 9 transcripts differentially expressed. Among pathways that were differentially responsive to testosterone in prostate, we identified ornithine decarboxylase (Odc1), an enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, as a testosterone-responsive gene that is unresponsive to rFst. Accordingly, we administered testosterone with and without \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an Odc1 inhibitor, to castrated mice. DFMO selectively blocked testosterone's effects on prostate, but did not affect testosterone's anabolic effects on muscle.

It has been suggested that bactericidal antibiotics induce the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacteria. We show that clinically relevant doses of bactericidal antibiotics-quinolones, aminoglycosides, and \u03b2-lactams-cause mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS overproduction in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that these bactericidal antibiotic-induced effects lead to oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and membrane lipids. Mice treated with bactericidal antibiotics exhibited elevated oxidative stress markers in the blood, oxidative tissue damage, and up-regulated expression of key genes involved in antioxidant defense mechanisms, which points to the potential physiological relevance of these antibiotic effects. The deleterious effects of bactericidal antibiotics were alleviated in cell culture and in mice by the administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine or prevented by preferential use of bacteriostatic antibiotics. This work highlights the role of antibiotics in the production of oxidative tissue damage in mammalian cells and presents strategies to mitigate or prevent the resulting damage, with the goal of improving the safety of antibiotic treatment in people.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Aminoglycosides", "Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Cell Line", "Cells, Cultured", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative Stress", "Quinolones", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Superoxides", "beta-Lactams"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sameer", "Last Name": "Kalghatgi", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine S", "Last Name": "Spina", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Costello", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Liesa", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118."}, {"First Name": "J Ruben", "Last Name": "Morones-Ramirez", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shimyn", "Last Name": "Slomovic", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Molina", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118."}, {"First Name": "Orian S", "Last Name": "Shirihai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118."}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2013Jul03"}, {"PMID": "23785037", "Title": "Silver enhances antibiotic activity against gram-negative bacteria.", "Abstract": "A declining pipeline of clinically useful antibiotics has made it imperative to develop more effective antimicrobial therapies, particularly against difficult-to-treat Gram-negative pathogens. Silver has been used as an antimicrobial since antiquity, yet its mechanism of action remains unclear. We show that silver disrupts multiple bacterial cellular processes, including disulfide bond formation, metabolism, and iron homeostasis. These changes lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species and increased membrane permeability of Gram-negative bacteria that can potentiate the activity of a broad range of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria in different metabolic states, as well as restore antibiotic susceptibility to a resistant bacterial strain. We show both in vitro and in a mouse model of urinary tract infection that the ability of silver to induce oxidative stress can be harnessed to potentiate antibiotic activity. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in two different mouse models of peritonitis that silver sensitizes Gram-negative bacteria to the Gram-positive-specific antibiotic vancomycin, thereby expanding the antibacterial spectrum of this drug. Finally, we used silver and antibiotic combinations in vitro to eradicate bacterial persister cells, and show both in vitro and in a mouse biofilm infection model that silver can enhance antibacterial action against bacteria that produce biofilms. This work shows that silver can be used to enhance the action of existing antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, thus strengthening the antibiotic arsenal for fighting bacterial infections.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Biofilms", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disulfides", "Drug Synergism", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections", "Humans", "Hydroxyl Radical", "Iron", "Mice", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Microbial Viability", "Silver"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "J Ruben", "Last Name": "Morones-Ramirez", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Winkler", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine S", "Last Name": "Spina", "Affiliation": "Boston University School of Medicine, 715 Albany Street, Boston, MA 02118, USA."}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Center of Synthetic Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2013Jun19"}, {"PMID": "23748443", "Title": "Antibiotic treatment expands the resistance reservoir and ecological network of the phage metagenome.", "Abstract": "The mammalian gut ecosystem has considerable influence on host physiology, but the mechanisms that sustain this complex environment in the face of different stresses remain obscure. Perturbations to the gut ecosystem, such as through antibiotic treatment or diet, are at present interpreted at the level of bacterial phylogeny. Less is known about the contributions of the abundant population of phages to this ecological network. Here we explore the phageome as a potential genetic reservoir for bacterial adaptation by sequencing murine faecal phage populations following antibiotic perturbation. We show that antibiotic treatment leads to the enrichment of phage-encoded genes that confer resistance via disparate mechanisms to the administered drug, as well as genes that confer resistance to antibiotics unrelated to the administered drug, and we demonstrate experimentally that phages from treated mice provide aerobically cultured naive microbiota with increased resistance. Systems-wide analyses uncovered post-treatment phage-encoded processes related to host colonization and growth adaptation, indicating that the phageome becomes broadly enriched for functionally beneficial genes under stress-related conditions. We also show that antibiotic treatment expands the interactions between phage and bacterial species, leading to a more highly connected phage-bacterial network for gene exchange. Our work implicates the phageome in the emergence of multidrug resistance, and indicates that the adaptive capacity of the phageome may represent a community-based mechanism for protecting the gut microflora, preserving its functional robustness during antibiotic stress.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aerobiosis", "Ampicillin", "Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteriophages", "Ciprofloxacin", "Drug Resistance, Microbial", "Feces", "Female", "Gene Transfer, Horizontal", "Genes, Viral", "Genome, Viral", "Host Specificity", "Metagenome", "Mice", "Symbiosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheetal R", "Last Name": "Modi", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine S", "Last Name": "Spina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Jul11"}, {"PMID": "23292609", "Title": "Potentiating antibacterial activity by predictably enhancing endogenous microbial ROS production.", "Abstract": "The ever-increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant infections combined with a weak pipeline of new antibiotics has created a global public health crisis. Accordingly, novel strategies for enhancing our antibiotic arsenal are needed. As antibiotics kill bacteria in part by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), we reasoned that targeting microbial ROS production might potentiate antibiotic activity. Here we show that ROS production can be predictably enhanced in Escherichia coli, increasing the bacteria's susceptibility to oxidative attack. We developed an ensemble approach of genome-scale, metabolic models capable of predicting ROS production in E. coli. The metabolic network was systematically perturbed and its flux distribution analyzed to identify targets predicted to increase ROS production. Targets that were predicted in silico were experimentally validated and further shown to confer increased susceptibility to oxidants. Validated targets also increased susceptibility to killing by antibiotics. This work establishes a systems-based method to tune ROS production in bacteria and demonstrates that increased microbial ROS production can potentiate killing by oxidants and antibiotics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Escherichia coli", "Humans", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Oxidants", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark P", "Last Name": "Brynildsen", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Winkler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine S", "Last Name": "Spina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "I Cody", "Last Name": "MacDonald", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature biotechnology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
