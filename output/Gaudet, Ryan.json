[{"PMID": "37438530", "Title": "PLSCR1 is a cell-autonomous defence factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "Abstract": "Understanding protective immunity to COVID-19 facilitates preparedness for future pandemics and combats new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging in the human population. Neutralizing antibodies have been widely studied; however, on the basis of large-scale exome sequencing of protected versus severely ill patients with COVID-19, local cell-autonomous defence is also crucial1-4. Here we identify phospholipid scramblase\u20091 (PLSCR1) as a potent cell-autonomous restriction factor against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in parallel genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens of human lung epithelia and hepatocytes before and after stimulation with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3). IFN\u03b3-induced PLSCR1 not only restricted SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, but was also effective against the Delta B.1.617.2 and Omicron BA.1 lineages. Its robust activity extended to other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, was functionally conserved in bats and mice, and interfered with the uptake of SARS-CoV-2 in both the endocytic and the TMPRSS2-dependent fusion routes. Whole-cell 4Pi single-molecule switching nanoscopy together with bipartite nano-reporter assays found that PLSCR1 directly targeted SARS-CoV-2-containing vesicles to prevent spike-mediated fusion and viral escape. A PLSCR1 C-terminal \u03b2-barrel domain-but not lipid scramblase activity-was essential for this fusogenic blockade. Our mechanistic studies, together with reports that COVID-associated PLSCR1 mutations are found in some susceptible people3,4, identify an anti-coronavirus protein that interferes at a late entry step before viral RNA is released into the host-cell cytosol.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibodies, Viral", "Chiroptera", "COVID-19", "Exome Sequencing", "Hepatocytes", "Interferon-gamma", "Lung", "Membrane Fusion", "Phospholipid Transfer Proteins", "SARS-CoV-2", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dijin", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Weiqian", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lizhen", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan G", "Last Name": "Gaudet", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eui-Soon", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maohan", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sudheer Kumar", "Last Name": "Cheppali", "Affiliation": "Yale Nanobiology Institute, West Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nagarjuna R", "Last Name": "Cheemarla", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pradeep", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pradeep D", "Last Name": "Uchil", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan R", "Last Name": "Grover", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellen F", "Last Name": "Foxman", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chelsea M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK."}, {"First Name": "Phillip J", "Last Name": "Stansfeld", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK."}, {"First Name": "Joerg", "Last Name": "Bewersdorf", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Walther", "Last Name": "Mothes", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erdem", "Last Name": "Karatekin", "Affiliation": "Yale Nanobiology Institute, West Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig B", "Last Name": "Wilen", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "MacMicking", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT, USA. john.macmicking@yale.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "34437126", "Title": "A human apolipoprotein L with detergent-like activity kills intracellular pathogens.", "Abstract": "Activation of cell-autonomous defense by the immune cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is critical to the control of life-threatening infections in humans.

As a consequence, many successful fungal pathogens have evolved elegant strategies to interact with host immune cells. For example, Candida albicans undergoes a morphogenetic switch coupled to cell wall remodeling upon phagocytosis by macrophages and then induces macrophage pyroptosis, an inflammatory cell death program. To elucidate the genetic circuitry through which C.\u00a0albicans orchestrates this host response, we performed the first large-scale analysis of C.\u00a0albicans interactions with mammalian immune cells. We identified 98 C.\u00a0albicans genes that enable macrophage pyroptosis without influencing fungal cell morphology in the macrophage, including specific determinants of cell wall biogenesis and the Hog1 signaling cascade. Using these mutated genes, we discovered that defects in the activation of pyroptosis affect immune cell recruitment during infection. Examining host circuitry required for pyroptosis in response to C.\u00a0albicans infection, we discovered that inflammasome priming and activation can be decoupled. Finally, we observed that apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) oligomerization can occur prior to phagolysosomal rupture by C.\u00a0albicans hyphae, demonstrating that phagolysosomal rupture is not the inflammasome activating signal. Taking the data together, this work defines genes that enable fungal cell wall remodeling and activation of macrophage pyroptosis independently of effects on morphogenesis and identifies macrophage signaling components that are required for pyroptosis in response to C.\u00a0albicans infection.IMPORTANCECandida albicans is a natural member of the human mucosal microbiota that can also cause superficial infections and life-threatening systemic infections, both of which are characterized by inflammation. Host defense relies mainly on the ingestion and destruction of C.\u00a0albicans by innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. Although some C.\u00a0albicans cells are killed by macrophages, most undergo a morphological change and escape by inducing macrophage pyroptosis. Here, we investigated the C.\u00a0albicans genes and host factors that promote macrophage pyroptosis in response to intracellular fungi. This work provides a foundation for understanding how host immune cells interact with C.\u00a0albicans and may lead to effective strategies to modulate inflammation induced by fungal infections.", "Keywords": ["Candida", "cell wall remodelling", "functional genomics", "fungal morphogenesis", "fungal pathogenesis", "host-pathogen interaction", "pyroptosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Candida albicans", "Female", "Genes, Fungal", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Immune Evasion", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Phagocytosis", "Pyroptosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Teresa R", "Last Name": "O'Meara", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kwamaa", "Last Name": "Duah", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia X", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michelle E", "Last Name": "Maxson", "Affiliation": "Program in Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ryan G", "Last Name": "Gaudet", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kristy", "Last Name": "Koselny", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Wellington", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Powers", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessie", "Last Name": "MacAlpine", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "O'Meara", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda O", "Last Name": "Veri", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sergio", "Last Name": "Grinstein", "Affiliation": "Program in Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne M", "Last Name": "Noble", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA."}, {"First Name": "Damian", "Last Name": "Krysan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott D", "Last Name": "Gray-Owen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Leah E", "Last Name": "Cowen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada leah.cowen@utoronto.ca."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2018Aug21"}, {"PMID": "28811347", "Title": "TIFA Signaling in Gastric Epithelial Cells Initiates the cag Type 4 Secretion System-Dependent Innate Immune Response to Helicobacter pylori Infection.", "Abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that colonizes the human stomach, causing inflammation which, in some cases, leads to gastric ulcers and cancer. The clinical outcome of infection depends on a complex interplay of bacterial, host genetic, and environmental factors. Although H.\u00a0pylori is recognized by both the innate and adaptive immune systems, this rarely results in bacterial clearance. Gastric epithelial cells are the first line of defense against H.\u00a0pylori and alert the immune system to bacterial presence. Cytosolic delivery of proinflammatory bacterial factors through the cag type 4 secretion system (cag-T4SS) has long been appreciated as the major mechanism by which gastric epithelial cells detect H.\u00a0pylori Classically attributed to the peptidoglycan sensor NOD1, recent work has highlighted the role of NOD1-independent pathways in detecting H.\u00a0pylori; however, the bacterial and host factors involved have remained unknown. Here, we show that bacterially derived heptose-1,7-bisphosphate (HBP), a metabolic precursor in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, is delivered to the host cytosol through the cag-T4SS, where it activates the host tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-interacting protein with forkhead-associated domain (TIFA)-dependent cytosolic surveillance pathway. This response, which is independent of NOD1, drives robust NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammation within hours of infection and precedes NOD1 activation. We also found that the CagA toxin contributes to the NF-\u03baB-driven response subsequent to TIFA and NOD1 activation. Taken together, our results indicate that the sequential activation of TIFA, NOD1, and CagA delivery drives the initial inflammatory response in gastric epithelial cells, orchestrating the subsequent recruitment of immune cells and leading to chronic gastritis.IMPORTANCEH.\u00a0pylori is a globally prevalent cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers and cancer. H.\u00a0pylori antibiotic resistance is rapidly increasing, and a vaccine remains elusive. The earliest immune response to H.\u00a0pylori is initiated by gastric epithelial cells and sets the stage for the subsequent immunopathogenesis. This study revealed that host TIFA and H.\u00a0pylori-derived HBP are critical effectors of innate immune signaling that account for much of the inflammatory response to H.\u00a0pylori in gastric epithelial cells. HBP is delivered to the host cell via the cag-T4SS at a time point that precedes activation of the previously described NOD1 and CagA inflammatory pathways. Manipulation of the TIFA-driven immune response in the host and/or targeting of ADP-heptose biosynthesis enzymes in H.\u00a0pylori may therefore provide novel strategies that may be therapeutically harnessed to achieve bacterial clearance.", "Keywords": ["CagA", "Helicobacter pylori", "NOD1", "TIFA"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cytosol", "Epithelial Cells", "Gastric Mucosa", "Gastritis", "Genomic Islands", "Helicobacter pylori", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Lipopolysaccharides", "NF-kappa B", "Nod1 Signaling Adaptor Protein", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins", "Type IV Secretion Systems"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alevtina", "Last Name": "Gall", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan G", "Last Name": "Gaudet", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Scott D", "Last Name": "Gray-Owen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Nina R", "Last Name": "Salama", "Affiliation": "Human Biology Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA nsalama@fredhutch.org."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2017Aug15"}, {"PMID": "28514661", "Title": "Innate Recognition of Intracellular Bacterial Growth Is Driven by the TIFA-Dependent Cytosolic Surveillance Pathway.", "Abstract": "Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) act as sentinels for incoming pathogens.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea, is particularly adept at driving HIV-1 expression, but the molecular determinants of this relationship remain undefined. N. gonorrhoeae liberates a soluble factor that potently induces expression from the HIV-1 LTR in coinfected cluster of differentiation 4-positive (CD4(+)) T lymphocytes, but this factor is not a previously described innate effector. A genome-wide mutagenesis approach was undertaken to reveal which component(s) of N. gonorrhoeae induce HIV-1 expression in CD4(+) T lymphocytes. A mutation in the ADP-heptose biosynthesis gene, hldA, rendered the bacteria unable to induce HIV-1 expression. The hldA mutant has a truncated lipooligosaccharide structure, contains lipid A in its outer membrane, and remains bioactive in a TLR4 reporter-based assay but did not induce HIV-1 expression. Mass spectrometry analysis of extensively fractionated N. gonorrhoeae-derived supernatants revealed that the LTR-inducing fraction contained a compound having a mass consistent with heptose-monophosphate (HMP). Heptose is a carbohydrate common in microbes but is absent from the mammalian glycome. Although ADP-heptose biosynthesis is common among Gram-negative bacteria, and heptose is a core component of most lipopolysaccharides, N. gonorrhoeae is peculiar in that it effectively liberates HMP during growth. This N. gonorrhoeae-derived HMP activates CD4(+) T cells to invoke an NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional response that drives HIV-1 expression and viral production. Our study thereby shows that heptose is a microbial-specific product that is sensed as an innate immune agonist and unveils the molecular link between N. gonorrhoeae and HIV-1.", "Keywords": ["coinfection", "inflammation", "microbial-associated molecular pattern", "pathogen-associated molecular pattern", "sexually transmitted disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Proteins", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Coinfection", "Female", "Gonorrhea", "HIV Infections", "HIV Long Terminal Repeat", "HIV-1", "Heptoses", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Male", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Toll-Like Receptor 5"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca J", "Last Name": "Malott", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 1A8."}, {"First Name": "Bernd O", "Last Name": "Keller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ryan G", "Last Name": "Gaudet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shannon E", "Last Name": "McCaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine C L", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wendy N", "Last Name": "Dobson-Belaire", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Leigh", "Last Name": "Hobbs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "St Michael", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Cox", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Trevor F", "Last Name": "Moraes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott D", "Last Name": "Gray-Owen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Jun18"}]
