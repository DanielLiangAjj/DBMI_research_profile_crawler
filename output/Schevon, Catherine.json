[{"PMID": "38343792", "Title": "Aberrant fast spiking interneuronal activity precedes seizure transitions in humans.", "Abstract": "There is active debate regarding how GABAergic function changes during seizure initiation and propagation, and whether interneuronal activity drives or impedes the pathophysiology. Here, we track cell-type specific firing during spontaneous human seizures to identify neocortical mechanisms of inhibitory failure. Fast-spiking interneuron activity was maximal over 1 second before equivalent excitatory increases, and showed transitions to out-of-phase firing prior to local tissue becoming incorporated into the seizure-driving territory. Using computational modeling, we linked this observation to transient saturation block as a precursor to seizure invasion, as supported by multiple lines of evidence in the patient data. We propose that transient blocking of inhibitory firing due to selective fast-spiking interneuron saturation-resulting from intense excitatory synaptic drive-is a novel mechanism that contributes to inhibitory failure, allowing seizure propagation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward M", "Last Name": "Merricks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarita S", "Last Name": "Deshpande", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander H", "Last Name": "Agopyan-Miu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elliot H", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily D", "Last Name": "Schlafly", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert R", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sameer A", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bradley", "Last Name": "Greger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emad N", "Last Name": "Eskandar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph R", "Last Name": "Madsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sydney S", "Last Name": "Cash", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Trevelyan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wim", "Last Name": "van Drongelen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024Jan26"}, {"PMID": "38293120", "Title": "Glioma-Induced Alterations in Excitatory Neurons are Reversed by mTOR Inhibition.", "Abstract": "Gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors characterized by poor prognosis and composed of diffusely infiltrating tumor cells that intermingle with non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, including neurons. Neurons are increasingly appreciated as important reactive components of the glioma microenvironment, due to their role in causing hallmark glioma symptoms, such as cognitive deficits and seizures, as well as their potential ability to drive glioma progression. Separately, mTOR signaling has been shown to have pleiotropic effects in the brain tumor microenvironment, including regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability. However, the local cellular-level effects of mTOR inhibition on glioma-induced neuronal alterations are not well understood. Here we employed neuron-specific profiling of ribosome-bound mRNA via 'RiboTag,' morphometric analysis of dendritic spines, and in vivo calcium imaging, along with pharmacological mTOR inhibition to investigate the impact of glioma burden and mTOR inhibition on these neuronal alterations. The RiboTag analysis of tumor-associated excitatory neurons showed a downregulation of transcripts encoding excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins and dendritic spine development, and an upregulation of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal proteins involved in dendritic spine turnover. Light and electron microscopy of tumor-associated excitatory neurons demonstrated marked decreases in dendritic spine density. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in tumor-associated excitatory neurons revealed progressive alterations in neuronal activity, both at the population and single-neuron level, throughout tumor growth. This in vivo calcium imaging also revealed altered stimulus-evoked somatic calcium events, with changes in event rate, size, and temporal alignment to stimulus, which was most pronounced in neurons with high-tumor burden. A single acute dose of AZD8055, a combined mTORC1/2 inhibitor, reversed the glioma-induced alterations on the excitatory neurons, including the alterations in ribosome-bound transcripts, dendritic spine density, and stimulus evoked responses seen by calcium imaging. These results point to mTOR-driven pathological plasticity in neurons at the infiltrative margin of glioma - manifested by alterations in ribosome-bound mRNA, dendritic spine density, and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity. Collectively, our work identifies the pathological changes that tumor-associated excitatory neurons experience as both hyperlocal and reversible under the influence of mTOR inhibition, providing a foundation for developing therapies targeting neuronal signaling in glioma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander R", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation":

In both brain regions, variability in pre-trial firing rates predicted subsequent reaction time (RT) on conflict trials. In dlPFC, ensemble firing rate patterns suggested the existence of domain-specific initial states, while in dACC, firing patterns were more consistent with a domain-general initial state.

In particular, the pattern of interneuronal firing at seizure onset remains under debate, with some studies demonstrating increased firing and others suggesting reductions. Previous study of neocortical sites suggests that seizure recruitment occurs upon failure of inhibition, with intact feedforward inhibition in non-recruited territories. We investigated whether the same principle applies in limbic structures. We analysed simultaneous electrocorticography (ECoG) and neuronal recordings of 34 seizures in a cohort of 19 patients (10 male, 9 female) undergoing surgical evaluation for pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. A clustering approach with five quantitative metrics computed from ECoG and multiunit data was used to distinguish three types of site-specific activity patterns during seizures, which at times co-existed within seizures. Overall, 156 single units were isolated, subclassified by cell-type and tracked through the seizure using our previously published methods to account for impacts of increased noise and single-unit waveshape changes caused by seizures. One cluster was closely associated with clinically defined seizure onset or spread. Entrainment of high-gamma activity to low-frequency ictal rhythms was the only metric that reliably identified this cluster at the level of individual seizures (P < 0.001). A second cluster demonstrated multi-unit characteristics resembling those in the first cluster, without concomitant high-gamma entrainment, suggesting feedforward effects from the seizure. The last cluster captured regions apparently unaffected by the ongoing seizure. Across all territories, the majority of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons reduced (69.2%) or ceased firing (21.8%). Transient increases in interneuronal firing rates were rare (13.5%) but showed evidence of intact feedforward inhibition, with maximal firing rate increases and waveshape deformations in territories not fully recruited but showing feedforward activity from the seizure, and a shift to burst-firing in seizure-recruited territories (P = 0.014). This study provides evidence for entrained high-gamma activity as an accurate biomarker of ictal recruitment in limbic structures. However, reduced neuronal firing suggested preserved inhibition in mesial temporal structures despite simultaneous indicators of seizure recruitment, in contrast to the inhibitory collapse scenario documented in neocortex. Further study is needed to determine if this activity is ubiquitous to hippocampal seizures or indicates a 'seizure-responsive' state in which the hippocampus is not the primary driver. If the latter, distinguishing such cases may help to refine the surgical treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.", "Keywords": ["ictal recruitment", "ictal territories", "inhibition", "interneurons", "single unit"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Male", "Female", "Electroencephalography", "Seizures", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Neurons", "Neocortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander H", "Last Name": "Agopyan-Miu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward M", "Last Name": "Merricks", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elliot H", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sameer A", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Feldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Trevelyan", "Affiliation": "Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, NewYork, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2023Dec01"}, {"PMID": "37336643", "Title": "Long-term outcomes of mesial temporal laser interstitial thermal therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy and subsequent surgery for seizure recurrence: a multi-centre cohort study.", "Abstract": "Magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a minimally invasive alternative to surgical resection for drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE).

averaging reveals symmetry of temporal and spatial components of the spike-LFP relationship during human focal seizures.", "Abstract": "The electrographic manifestation of neural activity can reflect the relationship between the faster action potentials of individual neurons and the slower fluctuations of the local field potential (LFP). This relationship is typically examined in the temporal domain using the spike-triggered average. In this study, we add a spatial component to this relationship. Here we first derive a theoretical model of the spike-LFP relationship across a macroelectrode. This mathematical derivation showed a special symmetry in the spike-LFP relationship wherein a sinc function in the temporal domain predicts a sinc function in the spatial domain. We show that this theoretical result is observed in a real-world system by characterizing the spike-LFP relationship using microelectrode array (MEA) recordings of human focal seizures. To do this, we present a approach, termed the spatiotemporal spike-centered average (st-SCA), that allows for visualization of the spike-LFP relationship in both the temporal and spatial domains. We applied this method to 25 MEA recordings obtained from seven patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy.

While cortical sleep-like activities accompany loss of consciousness during focal impaired awareness seizures, the mechanisms of loss of consciousness during focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures remain unclear. Quantifying differences in markers of cortical activation and ictal recruitment between focal impaired awareness and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures may also help us to understand their different consequences for clinical outcomes and to optimize neuromodulation therapies. We quantified clinical signs of loss of consciousness and intracranial EEG activity during 129 focal impaired awareness and 50 focal to bilateral tonic-clonic from 41 patients. We characterized intracranial EEG changes both in the seizure onset zone and in areas remote from the seizure onset zone with a total of 3386 electrodes distributed across brain areas. First, we compared the dynamics of intracranial EEG sleep-like activities: slow-wave activity (1-4 Hz) and beta/delta ratio (a validated marker of cortical activation) during focal impaired awareness versus focal to bilateral tonic-clonic. Second, we quantified differences between focal to bilateral tonic-clonic and focal impaired awareness for a marker validated to detect ictal cross-frequency coupling: phase-locked high gamma (high-gamma phased-locked to low frequencies) and a marker of ictal recruitment: the epileptogenicity index. Third, we assessed changes in intracranial EEG activity preceding and accompanying behavioural generalization onset and their correlation with electromyogram channels. In addition, we analysed human cortical multi-unit activity recorded with Utah arrays during three focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Compared to focal impaired awareness, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were characterized by deeper loss of consciousness, even before generalization occurred. Unlike during focal impaired awareness, early loss of consciousness before generalization was accompanied by paradoxical decreases in slow-wave activity and by increases in high-gamma activity in parieto-occipital and temporal cortex. After generalization, when all patients displayed loss of consciousness, stronger increases in slow-wave activity were observed in parieto-occipital cortex, while more widespread increases in cortical activation (beta/delta ratio), ictal cross-frequency coupling (phase-locked high gamma) and ictal recruitment (epileptogenicity index). Behavioural generalization coincided with a whole-brain increase in high-gamma activity, which was especially synchronous in deep sources and could not be explained by EMG. Similarly, multi-unit activity analysis of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic revealed sustained increases in cortical firing rates during and after generalization onset in areas remote from the seizure onset zone. Overall, these results indicate that unlike during focal impaired awareness, the neural signatures of loss of consciousness during focal to bilateral tonic-clonic consist of paradoxical increases in cortical activation and neuronal firing found most consistently in posterior brain regions. These findings suggest differences in the mechanisms of ictal loss of consciousness between focal impaired awareness and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic and may account for the more negative prognostic consequences of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic.", "Keywords": ["consciousness", "epileptic seizures", "generalization", "ictal rhythms", "responsiveness"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Seizures", "Epilepsies, Partial", "Brain", "Electroencephalography", "Unconsciousness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elsa", "Last Name": "Juan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53719, USA."}, {"First Name": "Urszula", "Last Name": "G\u00f3rska", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53719, USA."}, {"First Name": "Csaba", "Last Name": "Kozma", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53719, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Papantonatos", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Bugnon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53719, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Denis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vaclav", "Last Name": "Kremen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA."}, {"First Name": "Greg", "Last Name": "Worrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aaron F", "Last Name": "Struck", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53705, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward M", "Last Name": "Merricks", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hal", "Last Name": "Blumenfeld", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06519, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giulio", "Last Name": "Tononi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53719, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Boly", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53719, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2023Jan05"}, {"PMID": "35906069", "Title": "Multiple Sources of Fast Traveling Waves during Human Seizures: Resolving a Controversy.", "Abstract": "During human seizures, organized waves of voltage activity rapidly sweep across the cortex. Two contradictory theories describe the source of these fast traveling waves: either a slowly advancing narrow region of multiunit activity (an ictal wavefront) or a fixed cortical location.

Here we address this disagreement by combining the methods and microelectrode array recordings (N = 11 patients, 2 females, N = 31 seizures) from previous human studies to analyze the traveling wave source. We find, inconsistent with both existing theories, a transient relationship between the ictal wavefront and traveling waves, and multiple stable directions of traveling waves in many seizures. Using a computational model that combines elements of both existing theories, we show that interactions between an ictal wavefront and fixed source reproduce the traveling wave dynamics observed in vivo We conclude that combining both existing theories can generate the diversity of ictal traveling waves.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The source of voltage discharges that propagate across cortex during human seizures remains unknown. Two candidate theories exist, each proposing a different discharge source. Support for each theory consists of observations from a small number of human subject recordings, analyzed with separately developed methods.

To resolve these differences, we combine the unique, human microelectrode array recordings collected separately for each theory and analyze these combined data with a unified approach.

Although the spread of field potentials has garnered great interest, little is known about the spatial reach of phase synchronization, or neuronal coherence. Functional connectivity between different brain regions is known to occur across long distances, but the locality of synchronization across the neocortex is understudied. Here we used simultaneous recordings from electrocorticography (ECoG) grids and high-density microelectrode arrays to estimate the spatial reach of neuronal coherence and spike-field coherence (SFC) across frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices during cognitive tasks in humans. We observed the strongest coherence within a 2-3 cm distance from the microelectrode arrays, potentially defining an effective range for local communication. This range was relatively consistent across brain regions, spectral frequencies, and cognitive tasks. The magnitude of coherence showed power law decay with increasing distance from the microelectrode arrays, where the highest coherence occurred between ECoG contacts, followed by coherence between ECoG and deep cortical local field potential (LFP), and then SFC (i.e., ECoG > LFP > SFC). The spectral frequency of coherence also affected its magnitude. Alpha coherence (8-14 Hz) was generally higher than other frequencies for signals nearest the microelectrode arrays, whereas delta coherence (1-3 Hz) was higher for signals that were farther away. Action potentials in all brain regions were most coherent with the phase of alpha oscillations, which suggests that alpha waves could play a larger, more spatially local role in spike timing than other frequencies. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the spatial and spectral dynamics of neuronal synchronization, further advancing knowledge about how activity propagates across the human brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Coherence is theorized to facilitate information transfer across cerebral space by providing a convenient electrophysiological mechanism to modulate membrane potentials in spatiotemporally complex patterns. Our work uses a multiscale approach to evaluate the spatial reach of phase coherence and spike-field coherence during cognitive tasks in humans. Locally, coherence can reach up to 3 cm around a given area of neocortex. The spectral properties of coherence revealed that alpha phase-field and spike-field coherence were higher within ranges <2 cm, whereas lower-frequency delta coherence was higher for contacts farther away.

A prominent signal in these recordings is broadband high-frequency activity (approx. 70-150\u00a0Hz), generally considered to reflect neuronal excitation. Here we explored the use of this broadband signal to track, on a single-trial basis, the temporal and spatial distribution of task-engaged areas involved in decision-making. We additionally focused on the alpha rhythm (8-14\u00a0Hz), thought to regulate the (dis)engagement of neuronal populations based on task demands. Using these signals, we characterized activity across cortex using intracranial recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy performing the Multi-Source Interference Task, a Stroop-like decision-making paradigm. We analyzed recordings both from grid electrodes placed over cortical areas including frontotemporal and parietal cortex, and depth electrodes in prefrontal regions, including cingulate cortex. We found a widespread negative relationship between alpha power and broadband activity, substantiating the gating role of alpha in regions beyond sensory/motor cortex. Combined, these signals reflect the spatio-temporal pattern of task-engagement, with alpha decrease signifying task-involved regions and broadband increase temporally locking to specific task aspects, distributed over cortical sites. We report sites that only respond to stimulus presentation or to the decision report and, interestingly, sites that reflect the time-on-task. The latter predict the subject's reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis. A smaller subset of sites showed modulation with task condition.

These analyses, however, invariably using extracellular recordings, are greatly hindered by various phenomena that are well established in animal studies: changes in local ionic concentration, changes in ionic conductance, and intense, hypersynchronous firing. The first two alter the action potential waveform, whereas the third increases the \"noise\"; all three factors confound attempts to detect and classify single neurons. To address these analytical difficulties, we developed a novel template-matching-based spike sorting method, which enabled identification of 1239 single neurons in 27 patients (13 female) with intractable focal epilepsy, that were tracked throughout multiple seizures. These new analyses showed continued neuronal firing with widespread intense activation and stereotyped action potential alterations in tissue that was invaded by the seizure: neurons displayed increased waveform duration (p < 0.001) and reduced amplitude (p < 0.001), consistent with prior animal studies. By contrast, neurons in \"penumbral\" regions (those receiving intense local synaptic drive from the seizure but without neuronal evidence of local seizure invasion) showed stable waveforms. All neurons returned to their preictal waveforms after seizure termination. We conclude that the distinction between \"core\" territories invaded by the seizure versus \"penumbral\" territories is evident at the level of single neurons. Furthermore, the increased waveform duration and decreased waveform amplitude are neuron-intrinsic hallmarks of seizure invasion that impede traditional spike sorting and could be used as defining characteristics of local recruitment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Animal studies consistently show marked changes in action potential waveform during epileptic discharges, but acquiring similar evidence in humans has proven difficult. Assessing neuronal involvement in ictal events is pivotal to understanding seizure dynamics and in defining clinical localization of epileptic pathology. Using a novel method to track neuronal firing, we analyzed microelectrode array recordings of spontaneously occurring human seizures, and here report two dichotomous activity patterns. In cortex that is recruited to the seizure, neuronal firing rates increase and waveforms become longer in duration and shorter in amplitude as the neurons are recruited to the seizure, while penumbral tissue shows stable action potentials, in keeping with the \"dual territory\" model of seizure dynamics.", "Keywords": ["action potential", "epilepsy", "human", "seizure", "single neuron", "single unit"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Adult", "Brain Waves", "Cerebral Cortex", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurons", "Recruitment, Neurophysiological", "Seizures", "Wavelet Analysis", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward M", "Last Name": "Merricks", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Elliot H", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ronald G", "Last Name": "Emerson", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York, 10065."}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Robert R", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, New York, 10075."}, {"First Name": "Sameer A", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030."}, {"First Name": "Bradley", "Last Name": "Greger", "Affiliation": "School of Biology and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, 85287."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "Intermountain Healthcare, Murray, Utah, 84107."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Trevelyan", "Affiliation": "Newcastle University Biosciences Institute, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, NE2 4HH."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032 cas2044@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021Jan27"}, {"PMID": "33154490", "Title": "Dual mechanisms of ictal high frequency oscillations in human rhythmic onset seizures.", "Abstract": "High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are bursts of neural activity in the range of 80\u00a0Hz or higher, recorded from intracranial electrodes during epileptiform discharges.

However, recordings from humans have indicated that hippocampal theta oscillations are lower in frequency and less prevalent than in rodents, suggesting interspecies differences in theta's function. To characterize human hippocampal theta, we examine the properties of theta oscillations throughout the anterior-posterior length of the hippocampus as neurosurgical subjects performed a virtual spatial navigation task. During virtual movement, we observe hippocampal oscillations at multiple frequencies from 2 to 14\u2009Hz. The posterior hippocampus prominently displays oscillations at ~8-Hz and the precise frequency of these oscillations correlates with the speed of movement, implicating these signals in spatial navigation.

We review ongoing seizure activity at the mesoscopic scale that can be observed with microelectrode arrays as well as at the macroscale of standard clinical EEG. We provide clinical, experimental, and modeling data to support the hypothesis that paroxysmal depolarization (PD) is a critical component of the ictal machinery. We present dual-patch recordings in cortical cultures showing reduced synaptic transmission associated with presynaptic occurrence of PD, and we find that the PD threshold is cell size related. We further find evidence that optically evoked PD activity in parvalbumin neurons can promote propagation of neuronal excitation in neocortical networks in vitro. Spike sorting results from microelectrode array measurements around ictal wave propagation in human focal seizures demonstrate a strong increase in putative inhibitory firing with an approaching excitatory wave, followed by a sudden reduction of firing at passage. At the macroscopic level, we summarize evidence that this excitatory ictal wave activity is strongly correlated with oscillatory activity across a centimeter-sized cortical network. We summarize Wilson-Cowan-type modeling showing how inhibitory function is crucial for this behavior. Our findings motivated us to develop a network motif of neurons in silico, governed by a reduced version of the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, to show how feedforward, feedback, PD, and local failure of inhibition contribute to observed dynamics across network scales.

To unravel this relationship, we analyzed eight multiscale recordings of spontaneous seizures from four patients with epilepsy. During seizures, multiunit spike activity organizes into a submillimeter-sized wavefront, and this activity correlates significantly with low-frequency rhythms from electrocorticographic recordings across a 10-cm-sized neocortical network. Notably, this correlation effect is specific to the ictal wavefront and is absent interictally or from action potential activity outside the wavefront territory. To examine the multiscale interactions, we created a model using a multiscale, nonlinear system and found evidence for a dual role for feedforward inhibition in seizures: while inhibition at the wavefront fails, allowing seizure propagation, feedforward inhibition of the surrounding centimeter-scale networks is activated via long-range excitatory connections. Bifurcation analysis revealed that distinct dynamical pathways for seizure termination depend on the surrounding inhibition strength. Using our model, we found that the mesoscopic, local wavefront acts as the forcing term of the ictal process, while the macroscopic, centimeter-sized network modulates the oscillatory seizure activity.", "Keywords": ["epilepsy", "feedforward inhibition", "multiscale interactions", "nonlinear dynamics", "seizures"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Brain Waves", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsies, Partial", "Humans", "Neocortex", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tahra L", "Last Name": "Eissa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; teissa@uchicago.edu koen.dijkstra@utwente.nl."}, {"First Name": "Koen", "Last Name": "Dijkstra", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Mathematics, MIRA Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Technical Medicine, University of Twente, Enschede 7500AE, The Netherlands; teissa@uchicago.edu koen.dijkstra@utwente.nl."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Brune", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Mathematics, MIRA Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Technical Medicine, University of Twente, Enschede 7500AE, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Ronald G", "Last Name": "Emerson", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Michel J A M", "Last Name": "van Putten", "Affiliation": "Deptartment of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiolgy, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede 7500AE, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Robert R", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Wim", "Last Name": "van Drongelen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637."}, {"First Name": "Stephan A", "Last Name": "van Gils", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Mathematics, MIRA Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Technical Medicine, University of Twente, Enschede 7500AE, The Netherlands."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2017Oct03"}, {"PMID": "28681378", "Title": "Update on the mechanisms and roles of high-frequency oscillations in seizures and epileptic disorders.", "Abstract": "High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a type of brain activity that is recorded from brain regions capable of generating seizures. Because of the close association of HFOs with epileptogenic tissue and ictogenesis, understanding their cellular and network mechanisms could provide valuable information about the organization of epileptogenic networks and how seizures emerge from the abnormal activity of these networks. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances in the field of HFOs and provide a critical evaluation of new observations within the context of already established knowledge. Recent improvements in recording technology and the introduction of optogenetics into epilepsy research have intensified experimental work on HFOs. Using advanced computer models, new cellular substrates of epileptic HFOs were identified and the role of specific neuronal subtypes in HFO genesis was determined. Traditionally, the pathogenesis of HFOs was explored mainly in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and in animal models mimicking this condition. HFOs have also been reported to occur in other epileptic disorders and models such as neocortical epilepsy, genetically determined epilepsies, and infantile spasms, which further support the significance of HFOs in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. It is increasingly recognized that HFOs are generated by multiple mechanisms at both the cellular and network levels. Future studies on HFOs combining novel high-resolution in\u00a0vivo imaging techniques and precise control of neuronal behavior using optogenetics or chemogenetics will provide evidence about the causal role of HFOs in seizures and epileptogenesis.

In the past decade, the idea that focal seizures instead arise from coordinated activity across large-scale epileptic networks has become widely accepted. Understanding the network model's applicability is critical, due to its increasing influence on clinical research and surgical treatment paradigms. In this review, we examine the origins of the concept of epileptic networks as the nidus for recurring seizures. We summarize analytical and methodological elements of epileptic network studies and discuss findings from recent detailed electrophysiological investigations. Our review highlights the strengths and limitations of the epileptic network theory as a metaphor for the complex interactions that occur during seizures.

However, the effects of the spatiotemporal dynamics of seizure on HG power generation are not well understood. Here, we studied HG generation and propagation, using a three-step, multiscale signal analysis and modeling approach. First, we analyzed concurrent neuronal and microscopic network HG activity in neocortical slices from seven intractable epilepsy patients. We found HG activity in these networks, especially when neurons displayed paroxysmal depolarization shifts and network activity was highly synchronized. Second, we examined HG activity acquired with microelectrode arrays recorded during human seizures (n = 8). We confirmed the presence of synchronized HG power across microelectrode records and the macroscale, both specifically associated with the core region of the seizure. Third, we used volume conduction-based modeling to relate HG activity and network synchrony at different network scales. We showed that local HG oscillations require high levels of synchrony to cross scales, and that this requirement is met at the microscopic scale, but not within macroscopic networks. Instead, we present evidence that HG power at the macroscale may result from harmonics of ongoing seizure activity.

Object naming is the task most widely used to identify language cortex, and sites where stimulation elicits naming difficulty are typically spared from resection. In clinical practice, sites classified as positive undergo no further testing regarding the underlying cause of naming failure. Word production is a complex function involving multiple mechanisms that culminate in the identification of the target word. Two main mechanisms, i.e., semantic and phonological, underlie the retrieval of stored information regarding word meaning and word sounds, and naming can be hampered by disrupting either of these. These two mechanisms are likely mediated by different brain areas, and therefore, stimulation-identified naming sites might not be functionally equivalent. We investigated whether further testing at stimulation-identified naming sites would reveal an anatomical dissociation between these two mechanisms. In 16 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with implanted subdural electrodes, we tested whether, despite inability to produce an item name, patients could reliably access semantic or phonological information regarding objects during cortical stimulation. We found that stimulation at naming sites in superior temporal cortex tended to impair phonological processing yet spared access to semantic information. By contrast, stimulation of inferior temporal naming sites revealed a greater proportion of sites where semantic access was impaired and a dissociation between sites where stimulation spared or disrupted semantic or phonological processing. These functional-anatomical dissociations reveal the more specific contribution to naming provided by these cortical areas and shed light on the often profound, interictal word-finding deficit observed in temporal lobe epilepsy.

It is important therefore to characterize both the stability of these recordings and also their context. A critical consideration is where the units are located with respect to the focus of the pathology. Recent analyses of neuronal spiking activity, recorded over extended spatial areas using microelectrode arrays, have demonstrated the importance of considering seizure activity in terms of two distinct spatial territories: the ictal core and penumbral territories. The pathological information in these two areas, however, is likely to be very different. We investigated, therefore, whether units could be followed reliably over prolonged periods of times in these two areas, including during seizure epochs. We isolated unit recordings from several hundred neurons from four patients undergoing video-telemetry monitoring for surgical evaluation of focal neocortical epilepsies. Unit stability could last in excess of 40 h, and across multiple seizures. A key finding was that in the penumbra, spike stereotypy was maintained even during the seizure. There was a net tendency towards increased penumbral firing during the seizure, although only a minority of units (10-20%) showed significant changes over the baseline period, and notably, these also included neurons showing significant reductions in firing. In contrast, within the ictal core territories, regions characterized by intense hypersynchronous multi-unit firing, our spike sorting algorithms failed as the units were incorporated into the seizure activity. No spike sorting was possible from that moment until the end of the seizure, but recovery of the spike shape was rapid following seizure termination: some units reappeared within tens of seconds of the end of the seizure, and over 80% reappeared within 3 min (\u03c4recov = 104 \u00b1 22 s). The recovery of the mean firing rate was close to pre-ictal levels also within this time frame, suggesting that the more protracted post-ictal state cannot be explained by persistent cellular neurophysiological dysfunction in either the penumbral or the core territories. These studies lay the foundation for future investigations of how these recordings may inform clinical practice.See Kimchi and Cash (doi:10.1093/awv264) for a scientific commentary on this article.", "Keywords": ["EEG", "epilepsy", "ictal core", "ictal penumbra", "spike sorting"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Brain Waves", "Electrodes", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neocortex", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward M", "Last Name": "Merricks", "Affiliation": "1 Institute of Neuroscience, Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Elliot H", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert R", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Neurosurgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald G", "Last Name": "Emerson", "Affiliation": "5 Department of Neurology, Cornell University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA cas2044@cumc.columbia.edu andrew.trevelyan@ncl.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Trevelyan", "Affiliation": "1 Institute of Neuroscience, Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK cas2044@cumc.columbia.edu andrew.trevelyan@ncl.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "26147431", "Title": "Intracranial recordings reveal transient response dynamics during information maintenance in human cerebral cortex.", "Abstract": "Despite an extensive body of work, it is still not clear how short term maintenance of information is implemented in the human brain. Most prior research has focused on \"working memory\"-typically involving the storage of a number of items, requiring the use of a phonological loop and focused attention during the delay period between encoding and retrieval. These studies largely support a model of enhanced activity in the delay interval as the central mechanism underlying working memory. However, multi-item working memory constitutes only a subset of storage phenomena that may occur during daily life. A common task in naturalistic situations is short term memory of a single item-for example, blindly reaching to a previously placed cup of coffee. Little is known about such single-item, effortless, storage in the human brain. Here, we examined the dynamics of brain responses during a single-item maintenance task, using intracranial recordings implanted for clinical purpose in patients (ECoG). Our results reveal that active electrodes were dominated by transient short latency visual and motor responses, reflected in broadband high frequency power increases in occipito-temporal, frontal, and parietal cortex. Only a very small set of electrodes showed activity during the early part of the delay period. Interestingly, no cortical site displayed a significant activation lasting to the response time. These results suggest that single item encoding is characterized by transient high frequency ECoG responses, while the maintenance of information during the delay period may be mediated by mechanisms necessitating only low-levels of neuronal activations.", "Keywords": ["ECoG", "delayed activity", "gamma", "iEEG", "maintenance", "short term memory", "working memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Mental Processes", "Mental Recall", "Motor Skills", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Photic Stimulation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reaction Time", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Niv", "Last Name": "Noy", "Affiliation": "The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Bickel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hofstra North Shore LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elana", "Last Name": "Zion-Golumbic", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michal", "Last Name": "Harel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Golan", "Affiliation": "The Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Ido", "Last Name": "Davidesco", "Affiliation": "The Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Robert R", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles E", "Last Name": "Schroeder", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ashesh D", "Last Name": "Mehta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hofstra North Shore LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Malach", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel."}], "Journal": "Human brain mapping", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "26035671", "Title": "Seizure Prediction 6: [LINE SEPARATOR]From Mechanisms to Engineered Interventions for Epilepsy.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Epilepsy", "Forecasting", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Neurosciences"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bruce J", "Last Name": "Gluckman", "Affiliation": "*Center For Neural Engineering, Departments of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Neurosurgery, and Biomedical Engineering, the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. \u2020Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "25972493", "Title": "Seizure localization using ictal phase-locked high gamma: A retrospective surgical outcome study.", "Abstract": "To determine whether resection of areas with evidence of intense, synchronized neural firing during seizures is an accurate indicator of postoperative outcome.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Electrodes, Implanted", "Electroencephalography", "Gamma Rhythm", "Humans", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Retrospective Studies", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shennan A", "Last Name": "Weiss", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Neurology (R.C., L.M.B., R.G.E., C.A.S.), Neurological Surgery (G.P.B., G.M.M., R.R.G.), and Radiology (B.Z., C.G.F.), Columbia University, New York;

We have identified two distinct seizure territories that cannot be easily distinguished by traditional EEG analysis. The ictal core exhibits synchronized neuronal burst firing, while the surrounding ictal penumbra exhibits asynchronous and relatively sparse neuronal activity. In the ictal core large amplitude rhythmic ictal discharges produce large electric fields that correspond with highly synchronous neuronal firing. In the penumbra rhythmic ictal discharges are smaller in amplitude, but large enough to influence spike timing, yet neuronal synchrony is not observed. These in homine observations are in accord with decades of animal studies supporting a role of field effects in neuronal synchronization during seizures, yet also highlight how field effects may be negated in the presence of strong synaptic inhibition in the penumbra.", "Keywords": ["ephaptic conduction", "epilepsy", "field effect", "seizures", "synchrony"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shennan A", "Last Name": "Weiss", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Schevon Lab, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald G", "Last Name": "Emerson", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Schevon Lab, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Trevelyan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Newcastle University Newcastle, UK."}, {"First Name": "Marom", "Last Name": "Bikson", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering, The City College of The City University of New York New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Schevon Lab, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in human neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Dec05"}, {"PMID": "24176977", "Title": "Ictal high frequency oscillations distinguish two types of seizure territories in humans.", "Abstract": "High frequency oscillations have been proposed as a clinically useful biomarker of seizure generating sites. We used a unique set of human microelectrode array recordings (four patients, 10 seizures), in which propagating seizure wavefronts could be readily identified, to investigate the basis of ictal high frequency activity at the cortical (subdural) surface. Sustained, repetitive transient increases in high gamma (80-150 Hz) amplitude, phase-locked to the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm, correlated with strong multi-unit firing bursts synchronized across the core territory of the seizure. These repetitive high frequency oscillations were seen in recordings from subdural electrodes adjacent to the microelectrode array several seconds after seizure onset, following ictal wavefront passage. Conversely, microelectrode recordings demonstrating only low-level, heterogeneous neural firing correlated with a lack of high frequency oscillations in adjacent subdural recording sites, despite the presence of a strong low-frequency signature. Previously, we reported that this pattern indicates a failure of the seizure to invade the area, because of a feedforward inhibitory veto mechanism. Because multi-unit firing rate and high gamma amplitude are closely related, high frequency oscillations can be used as a surrogate marker to distinguish the core seizure territory from the surrounding penumbra. We developed an efficient measure to detect delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations based on cross-frequency coupling between high gamma amplitude and the low-frequency (1-25 Hz) ictal rhythm. When applied to the broader subdural recording, this measure consistently predicted the timing or failure of ictal invasion, and revealed a surprisingly small and slowly spreading seizure core surrounded by a far larger penumbral territory. Our findings thus establish an underlying neural mechanism for delayed-onset, sustained ictal high frequency oscillations, and provide a practical, efficient method for using them to identify the small ictal core regions.

Recent evidence showed that epileptiform phenomena, particularly seizures, result from complex interactions between neuronal networks characterized by heterogeneity of neuronal firing and dynamical evolution of synchronization. Desynchronization is often observed preceding seizures or during their early stages; in contrast, high levels of synchronization observed towards the end of seizures may facilitate termination. In this review we discuss cellular and network mechanisms responsible for such complex changes in synchronization. Recent work has identified cell-type-specific inhibitory and excitatory interactions, the dichotomy between neuronal firing and the non-local measurement of local field potentials distant to that firing, and the reflection of the neuronal dark matter problem in non-firing neurons active in seizures. These recent advances have challenged long-established views and are leading to a more rigorous and realistic understanding of the pathophysiology of epilepsy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Premysl", "Last Name": "Jiruska", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Epileptology, Institute of Physiology, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, Prague 4-Krc, Czech Republic. jiruskapremysl@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "de Curtis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John G R", "Last Name": "Jefferys", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven J", "Last Name": "Schiff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kaspar", "Last Name": "Schindler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of physiology", "PubDate": "2013Feb15"}, {"PMID": "22722026", "Title": "How inhibition influences seizure propagation.", "Abstract": "Inhibitory neuron behaviour is of fundamental importance to epileptic pathophysiology. When inhibition is compromised, such as by GABAergic blockade (Curtis et al., 1970; Connors, 1984; Traub and Miles, 1991) or by shifts in GABAergic reversal potential (Huberfeld et al., 2007), epileptiform discharges occur far more readily. Other studies have shown enhanced inhibition in vivo in the surrounding cortical territories associated with both focal pathological and physiological activity (Prince and Wilder, 1967; Dichter and Spencer, 1969a,b; Goldensohn and Salazar, 1986; Traub and Miles, 1991; Liang and Jones, 1997; Liang et al., 1998; Schwartz and Bonhoeffer, 2001). This gave rise to the concept of an \"inhibitory restraint\". This concept can explain the often confusing anatomical reorganizations seen in chronically epileptic brains (Sloviter, 1987; Cossart et al., 2001), indicating which changes might be pro-epileptic, and which oppose the epileptic state. It also may explain key electrophysiological features of epileptic seizures. Here we describe current knowledge about the restraint, gleaned mainly from acute pharmacological experiments in animals, both in vivo and in vitro, and speculate how this may alter our understanding of human seizure activity in clinical practice.
