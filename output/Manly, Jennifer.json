Yet the effects of different BP control strategies across the life course on AD/ADRD are unknown. Randomized trials may be infeasible due to prolonged follow-up and large sample sizes. Simulation analysis is a practical approach to estimating these effects using the best available existing data. However, existing simulation frameworks cannot estimate the effects of BP control on both dementia and cardiovascular disease. This manuscript describes the design principles, implementation details, and population-level validation of a novel population-health microsimulation framework, the MIchigan ChROnic Disease SIMulation (MICROSIM), for The Effect of Lower Blood Pressure over the Life Course on Late-life Cognition in Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites (BP-COG) study of the effect of BP levels over the life course on dementia and cardiovascular disease. MICROSIM is an agent-based Monte Carlo simulation designed using computer programming best practices. MICROSIM estimates annual vascular risk factor levels and transition probabilities in all-cause dementia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality in a nationally representative sample of US adults 18+ using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). MICROSIM models changes in risk factors over time, cognition and dementia using changes from a pooled dataset of individual participant data from 6 US prospective cardiovascular cohort studies. Cardiovascular risks were estimated using a widely used risk model and BP treatment effects were derived from meta-analyses of randomized trials. MICROSIM is an extensible, open-source framework designed to estimate the population-level impact of different BP management strategies and reproduces US population-level estimates of BP and other vascular risk factors levels, their change over time, and incident all-cause dementia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Michigan", "Chronic Disease", "Computer Simulation", "Male", "Dementia", "Aged", "Female", "Risk Factors", "Monte Carlo Method", "Blood Pressure", "Middle Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Aged, 80 and over"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James F", "Last Name": "Burke", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Luciana L", "Last Name": "Copeland", "Affiliation": "Independent Software Developer, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy B", "Last Name": "Sussman", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Cognitive Health Services Research Program, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rodney A", "Last Name": "Hayward", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Cognitive Health Services Research Program, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alden L", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Brice\u00f1o", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Cognitive Health Services Research Program, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rachael", "Last Name": "Whitney", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Cognitive Health Services Research Program, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bruno J", "Last Name": "Giordani", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry & Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Center, U-M, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca F", "Last Name": "Gottesman", "Affiliation": "Stroke Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Bethesda, MD, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Darrell J", "Last Name": "Gaskin", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Sidney", "Affiliation": "Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, Oakland, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kristine", "Last Name": "Yaffe", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry, Neurology and Epidemiology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ralph L", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Susan R", "Last Name": "Heckbert", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Timothy M", "Last Name": "Hughes", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrzej T", "Last Name": "Galecki", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Cognitive Health Services Research Program, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Deborah A", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Cognitive Health Services Research Program, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38665381", "Title": "\"Hang Ups, Let Downs, Bad Breaks, Setbacks\": Impact of Structural Socioeconomic Racism and Resilience on Cognitive Change Over Time for Persons Racialized as Black.", "Abstract": "Older adults racialized as Black experience higher rates of dementia than those racialized as White.

However, our understanding of the biopsychosocial mechanisms by which SDOH affect neurologic disease remains in its infancy. The most robust epidemiologic research has been on the associations between education, schooling, and place-based social determinants on cognition, dementia, and cerebrovascular disease later in life. Further research is needed to more deeply understand the complex interplay of SDOH on neurologic disease. Few SDOH screening tools have been validated in populations with neurologic disease. In addition, comparison across studies and populations is hampered by lack of standardized common data elements. Experiences of populations historically underrepresented in research should be centered in future research studies, and changes should be made in recruitment expectations and measurement choices. For research on inequities, it is critical to support and incentivize institutional infrastructure to foster meaningful engagement with populations affected by research. Finally, it remains to be seen whether individual-level health or behavioral interventions or place-level, systemic or policy interventions to reduce population burden will be most effective in reducing inequities in neurologic disease and outcomes. Although numerous clinical trials have focused on addressing downstream SDOH such as health literacy and health behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, physical activity, diet), few have addressed upstream, structural determinants which may have a more profound impact on addressing inequities in neurologic disease. Ultimately, further research is needed to determine which specific SDOH should be targeted and how, when, and by whom they should be addressed to improve neurologic outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Social Determinants of Health", "Nervous System Diseases", "Educational Status", "Behavior Therapy", "Cognition"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amytis", "Last Name": "Towfighi", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Neurology and Population and Public Health Sciences (A.T.), University of Southern California, Los Angeles;

In Alzheimer's disease dementia, both semantic and episodic memory become impaired early in the disease process. Given the need to develop sensitive and accessible cognitive markers for early detection of dementia, we investigated among older adults without dementia whether item-level metrics of semantic fluency related to episodic memory decline above and beyond existing neuropsychological measures and total fluency score. Participants were drawn from the community-based Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project cohort (N = 583 English speakers, Mage = 76.3 \u00b1 6.8) followed up to five visits across up to 11 years. We examined the association of semantic fluency metrics with subsequent declines in memory performance using latent growth curve models covaried for age and recruitment wave. Results showed that item-level metrics (e.g., lexical frequency, age of acquisition, and semantic neighborhood density) were associated with a decline in episodic memory-even when covarying for other cognitive tests-while the standard total score was not. Moderation analyses showed that the relationship of semantic fluency metrics with memory decline did not differ across race, sex/gender, or education. In conclusion, item-level data hold a wealth of information with potential to reveal subtle semantic memory impairment, which tracks with episodic memory impairment, among older adults without dementia beyond existing neuropsychological measures. Implementation of psycholinguistic metrics may point to cognitive tools that have better prognostic value or are more sensitive to cognitive change in the context of clinical trials or observational studies.

An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p\u2009=\u20096.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates. Therefore, in AD cerebrovascular risk factors promote cerebrovascular pathology which in turn, interacts with FMNL2 altering the normal astroglial-vascular mechanisms underlying the clearance of amyloid and tau increasing their deposition in brain.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Blood\u2013brain-barrier", "Cerebrovascular risk factors", "FMNL2", "GWAS", "Gliovascular

C4R links this pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) phenotyping to information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute and postacute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the United States. C4R ascertains SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey conducted via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations and high-quality event surveillance. Extensive prepandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these data will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings. This resource will allow evaluation of risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including postacute sequelae, and assessment of the social and behavioral impact of the pandemic

Yet, the influence of structural racism and racial residential segregation on brain aging is less understood. In this study, we investigated the association between cumulative exposure to racial residential segregation over 25 years (1985-2010) in young adulthood, as measured by the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, and year 25 measures of brain volume (cerebral, gray matter, white matter, and hippocampal volumes) in midlife. We studied 290 Black participants with available brain imaging data who were enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a prospective cohort study. CARDIA investigators originally recruited 2,637 Black participants aged 18-30 years from 4 field centers across the United States. We conducted analyses using marginal structural models, incorporating inverse probability of treatment weighting and inverse probability of censoring weighting. We found that compared with low/medium segregation, greater cumulative exposure to a high level of racial residential segregation throughout young adulthood was associated with smaller brain volumes in general (e.g., for cerebral volume, \u03b2 = -0.08, 95% confidence interval: -0.15, -0.02) and with a more pronounced reduction in hippocampal volume, though results were not statistically significant.

They are typically attributed to small vessel cerebrovascular disease in the context of aging. Among older adults, WMH are associated with risk of cognitive decline and dementia, stroke, and various other health outcomes. There has been increasing interest in incorporating quantitative WMH measurement as outcomes in clinical trials, observational research, and clinical settings. Here, we present a novel, fully automated, unsupervised detection algorithm for WMH segmentation and quantification. The algorithm uses a robust preprocessing pipeline, including brain extraction and a sample-specific mask that incorporates spatial information for automatic false positive reduction, and a half Gaussian mixture model (HGMM). The method was evaluated in 24 participants with varying degrees of WMH (4.9-78.6\u00a0cm3) from a community-based study of aging and dementia with dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, correlation, and bias relative to the ground truth manual segmentation approach performed by two expert raters. Results were compared with those derived from commonly used available WMH segmentation packages, including SPM lesion probability algorithm (LPA), SPM lesion growing algorithm (LGA), and Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm (BIANCA). The HGMM algorithm derived WMH values that had a dice score of 0.87, sensitivity of 0.89, and specificity of 0.99 compared to ground truth. White matter hyperintensity volumes derived with HGMM were strongly correlated with ground truth values (r\u00a0=\u00a00.97, p\u00a0=\u00a03.9e-16), with no observable bias (-1.1 [-2.6, 0.44], p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.16). Our novel algorithm uniquely uses a robust preprocessing pipeline and a half-Gaussian mixture model to segment WMH with high agreement with ground truth for large scale studies of brain aging.", "Keywords": ["Automated segmentation", "Half Gaussian mixture model", "Mixture model", "Small vessel cerebrovascular disease", "White matter hyperintensity"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Brain", "Humans", "Leukoaraiosis", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Stroke", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kay C", "Last Name": "Igwe", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Gertrude H.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of selection by dropout and death on the association between sex/gender and cognitive decline. We first compared the statistical methods most frequently used for longitudinal data, targeting either population estimands (marginal models fitted by generalized estimating equations) or subject-specific estimands (mixed/joint models fitted by likelihood maximization) in 8 studies of aging: 6 population-based studies (the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) Study (1996-2009), Personnes \u00c2g\u00e9es QUID (PAQUID; 1988-2014), the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study (2003-2016), the Three-City Study (Bordeaux only; 1999-2016), the Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP; 1992-2017), and the Whitehall II Study (2007-2016)) and 2 clinic-based studies (the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; 2004-2017) and a nationwide French cohort study, MEMENTO (2011-2016)). We illustrate differences in the estimands of the association between sex/gender and cognitive decline in selected examples and highlight the critical role of differential selection by dropout and death. Using the same estimand, we then contrast the sex/gender-cognitive decline associations across cohorts and cognitive measures suggesting a residual differential sex/gender association depending on the targeted cognitive measure (memory or animal fluency) and the initial cohort selection.

While sparse, studies investigating research participation disparities have predominantly focused on individual-level factors and behavioral change, overlooking the influence of study design, structural factors, and social determinants of health on participation. This is also reflected in conventional practices that consistently fail to address established participation barriers, such as study requirements that impose financial, transportation, linguistic, and/or logistical barriers that disproportionately burden participants belonging to minoritized populations. These shortcomings not only risk exacerbating distrust toward research and researchers, but also introduce significant selection biases, diminishing our ability to detect differential mechanisms of risk, resilience, and response to interventions across subpopulations. This forum article examines the intersecting factors that drive both health inequities in aging and disparate participation in aging research among minoritized populations. Using an intersectional, social justice, and emancipatory lens, we characterize the role of social determinants, historical contexts, and contemporaneous structures in shaping research accessibility and inclusion. We also introduce frameworks to accelerate transformative theoretical approaches to fostering equitable inclusion of minoritized populations in aging research.", "Keywords": ["Chronic illness", "Disparities (health, racial)", "Diversity and ethnicity", "Research participation"], "MeSH terms": ["Ethnicity", "Geroscience", "Health Equity", "Humans", "Intersectional Framework", "Social Justice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Gilmore-Bykovskyi", "Affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Health Disparities Research, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raina", "Last Name": "Croff", "Affiliation": "NIA Layton Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA."}, {"First Name": "Crystal M", "Last Name": "Glover", "Affiliation": "Division of Behavioral Sciences, Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "Community Access, Recruitment, & Engagement (CARE) Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Resendez", "Affiliation": "UsAgainstAlzheimer's, Washington, District of Columbia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adriana", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Zuelsdorff", "Affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Health Disparities Research, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gina", "Last Name": "Green-Harris", "Affiliation": "University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Nursing, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "The Gerontologist", "PubDate": "2022May26"}, {"PMID": "34285097", "Title": "Association of Glycemia, Lipids, and Blood Pressure With Cognitive Performance in People With Type 2 Diabetes in the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE).", "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for cognitive impairment.

Psychosocial factors, such as discrimination and perceived control, also differ across racial/ethnic groups, and emerging literature highlights their potential role in contributing to cognitive disparities in addition to socioeconomic status. Method: 1,463 older adults (51% Hispanic, 27% non-Hispanic Black, and 22% non-Hispanic White) in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project completed cognitive and psychosocial measures, including a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, Everyday and Major Experiences of Lifetime Discrimination scales, and the Perceived Control scale. Mediation models quantified separate indirect effects of Black race and Hispanic ethnicity on global cognitive composite scores through education, income, discrimination, and external perceived control. Results: Educational attainment, income, and perceived control each mediated racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition. Socioeconomic indicators (i.e., lower education and lower income) explained approximately 50% of the Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in global cognition, and more external perceived control explained an additional 5%-8%. Hispanics reported the lowest levels of discrimination, while non-Hispanic Blacks reported the highest levels. However, neither everyday nor major lifetime discrimination was associated with global cognition. Significant racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition remained after accounting for the included socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. Conclusions: This study suggests that psychosocial factors may explain racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging above and beyond socioeconomic indicators. More external perceived control, which could reflect chronic exposure to interpersonal and institutional marginalization, may be a particularly salient psychosocial risk factor for poorer cognitive aging among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults.

Such practices are emblematic of the entrenched systems of structural racism and pernicious presence of anti-Black oppression within psychology and beyond. This article brings into focus one glaring example: the inclusion of a noose as an item in one of the most widely used standardized tests in neuropsychology-the Boston Naming Test. The deeply offensive nature of this item has gone publicly unaddressed in the psychological literature for decades despite over 27,000 published articles with this test as a primary keyword. Herein, we review the history of the racialized weaponization of the noose in the United States; the potential psychological harm and test performance degradation imposed by including racist stimuli in assessment materials; and the ethical and cultural competency implications of exposing examinees to racist stimuli during psychological assessments. Finally, we call out the professional complicity underlying this item's persistence in psychology, urging psychologists, test publishers, and members of editorial boards to put an end to the complicit support and take clear corrective action in response to this offense. We also charge our colleagues and community to critically review other psychological assessment measures, language, and procedures in their respective subdisciplines to make the changes that will align professional practice with the antiracist values required to undo the effects of structural racism in psychology.

C4R will link this pre-COVID phenotyping to information on SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute and post-acute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and broadly reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the US. C4R is ascertaining severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations, and high-quality events surveillance. Extensive pre-pandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are being harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings.

Cognitive measures of memory and verbal fluency were administered every 2 years for up to 12 years. Latent growth curve models evaluated the association of CRP on cognitive trajectories, adjusting for relevant demographic and health factors. We found that higher CRP was associated with worse memory (B = -.039, 95% CI [-.065,-.014]) and verbal fluency at baseline (B = -.195, 95% CI [-.219,-.170]), but not with rate of cognitive decline. After covariate adjustment, the association of CRP on memory was attenuated (B = -.005, 95% CI [-.031,-.021]). The association with verbal fluency at baseline, but not over time, remained (B = -.042, 95% CI [-.067,-.017]). Race did not modify the association between CRP and cognition. Findings suggest that levels of CRP at age 45+, are a marker of cognitive impairment but may not be suitable for risk prediction for cognitive decline.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American", "Aged", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "United States", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Arce Renter\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sarah R", "Last Name": "Gillett", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Leslie A", "Last Name": "McClure", "Affiliation": "Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Virginia G", "Last Name": "Wadley", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Glasser", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Virginia J", "Last Name": "Howard", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Brett M", "Last Name": "Kissela", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Frederick W", "Last Name": "Unverzagt", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nancy S", "Last Name": "Jenny", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Cushman", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33292897", "Title": "Mediators and Moderators of the Association Between Perceived Stress and Episodic Memory in Diverse Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Stress is a risk factor for numerous negative health outcomes, including cognitive impairment in late-life.

Language, memory, and visuospatial abilities were assessed at baseline and at 18- and 24-month follow-ups for up to six visits. Inferential analyses assessed the differential effects of sex/gender and race/ethnicity for each family tie. Results: Independent of all covariates, contact with more relatives was associated with better initial memory (b = .01) and language functioning (b = .01) across race/ethnicity and sex/gender.

Recent work has implicated WMH in the pathogenesis and symptom presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized clinically primarily by a deficit in memory. The severity of WMH volume is typically quantified globally or by lobe, whereas white matter itself is organized by tracts and fiber classes. We derived WMH volumes within white matter tract classes, including association, projection, and commissural tracts, in 519 older adults and tested whether WMH volume within specific fiber classes is related to memory performance. We found that increased association and projection tract defined WMH volumes were related to worse memory function but not to a global cognition summary score that excluded memory.

While the majority of the literature has focused on years of educational attainment or degree attainment, fewer studies examine the role of educational quality in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We tested the hypothesis that average state-level educational quality was associated with CVD, linking state-level data on educational quality with individual demographic and health data from multiple waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N\u202f=\u202f34,770). We examined thirteen CVD-related outcomes-including blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart attack-to understand the multiple pathways through which educational quality may influence CVD. The primary predictor was a composite index of educational quality, combining state-level measures of student-teacher ratios, per-pupil expenditures, and school term length. We fit multivariable models, regressing each outcome on the educational quality composite index and adjusting for individual- and state-level covariates. We also assessed whether the association between state educational quality and CVD differed for less educated individuals. Overall, higher educational quality was associated with less smoking (OR\u202f=\u202f0.86, 95%CI: 0.77, 0.97), but there was no statistically significant association for the other 12 outcomes. Interaction tests indicated that less educated individuals benefited less from higher educational quality relative to those with more education for several outcomes. Our study suggests that state-level educational quality is not strongly associated with CVD, and that this null association overall may mask heterogeneous benefits that accrue disproportionately to those with higher levels of education.", "Keywords": ["Cardiovascular disease", "Educational attainment", "Policy evaluation", "Socioeconomic status"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cholesterol", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Educational Status", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Nutrition Surveys", "Risk Factors", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Hamad", "Affiliation": "Philip R.

A community sample of older adults received a neuropsychological test battery, including the 12-item, 6-trial Selective Reminding Test (SRT). The UPSIT was administered at baseline and follow-up that occurred between 1 and 4 years after baseline. UPSIT scores of participants who were cognitively intact and did not decline cognitively were examined for test-retest reliability. In 92 older adults with mean age 77.6 years followed for 2.79 (standard deviation [SD] 0.69) years, mean UPSIT score declined from 30.29 (SD 5.83) to 27.80 (SD 5.50). In linear mixed models that adjusted for time, age, sex, and education, intraclass correlation coefficients for UPSIT were 0.65, SRT delayed recall 0.59, and SRT total immediate recall 0.49. Among 4 possible response combinations, the largest proportion of participants had correct responses at both visits for 35 out of 40 items. Consistency of item responses ranged from 50% to 90% across the 2 time points. The long-term test-retest reliability of the UPSIT was moderately strong without practice effects over long periods of time in older adults.

In a large national cohort with moderate loss to follow-up, we contrasted racial differences in 2 stroke risk factors, incident hypertension and incident left ventricular hypertrophy, estimated by complete-case analyses, inverse probability of attrition weighting, and the survivor average causal effect. We used data on 12,497 black and 17,660 white participants enrolled in the United States (2003-2007) and collected incident risk factor data approximately 10 years after baseline. At follow-up, 21.0% of white participants and 23.0% of black participants had died; additionally 22.0% of white participants and 28.4% of black participants had withdrawn.

What is the association between sleep and subjective cognitive decline? Cross-sectional design, from two studies of older adults: the WHICAP in the USA and the HELIAD in Greece. A total of 1,576 WHICAP and 1,456 HELIAD participants, without mild cognitive impairment, dementia or severe depression/anxiety, were included. Participants were mostly women, with 12 (WHICAP) and 8 (HELIAD) mean years of education. Sleep problems were estimated using the Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study. Subjective cognitive decline was assessed using a structured complaint questionnaire that queries for subjective memory and other cognitive symptoms. Multinomial or logistic regression models were used to examine whether sleep problems were associated with complaints about general cognition, memory, naming, orientation and calculations. Age, sex, education, sleep medication, use of medications affecting cognition, co-morbidities, depression and anxiety were used as co-variates. Objective cognition was also estimated by summarizing neuropsychological performance into composite z-scores. Sleep problems were associated with two or more complaints: WHICAP: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001; HELIAD: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.83), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001. Sleep problems were associated with complaints in all the cognitive subcategories, except orientation for the WHICAP. The associations were noted regardless of objective cognition. At any given level of objective cognition, sleep disturbance is accompanied by subjective cognitive impairment. The replicability in two ethnically, genetically and culturally different cohorts adds validity to our results. The results have implications for the correlates, and potential aetiology of subjective cognitive decline, which should be considered in the assessment and treatment of older adults with cognitive complaints.", "Keywords": ["elderly", "healthy ageing", "sleep problems", "subjective cognitive decline"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Sleep Wake Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Tsapanou", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division and the Taub Institute, Gertrude H.

This revision will have substantial implications for future Alzheimer's research, and the changes should be rigorously evaluated before widespread adoption. We propose three principles for evaluating any revision to diagnostic frameworks for AD: (1) does the revision improve the validity of the diagnosis; (2) does the revision improve the reliability or reduce the expense of the diagnosis; and (3) will the revision foster innovative and rigorous research across populations. The new diagnostic framework is unlikely to achieve any of these goals. Instead, it has the potential to handicap future researchers, and slow progress towards identifying effective strategies to prevent or treat AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Dementia", "Diagnostic criteria", "Reliability", "Validity"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Reproducibility of Results"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Medellena Maria", "Last Name": "Glymour", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, 550 16th Street, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. mglymour@epi.ucsf.edu."}, {"First Name": "Adam Mark", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mika", "Last Name": "Kivimaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth Rose", "Last Name": "Mayeda", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, 550 16th Street, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Genevi\u00e8ve", "Last Name": "Ch\u00eane", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1219-Bordeaux Population Health and CIC1401-EC, ISPED-Bordeaux School of Public Health, INSERM, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Carole", "Last Name": "Dufouil", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1219-Bordeaux Population Health and CIC1401-EC, ISPED-Bordeaux School of Public Health, INSERM, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer Jaie", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "European journal of epidemiology", "PubDate": "2018Jul"}, {"PMID": "29893804", "Title": "Letter and Category Fluency Performance Correlates with Distinct Patterns of Cortical Thickness in Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Verbal fluency tasks are generally thought to be mediated by frontal brain regions for letter fluency and temporal regions for category fluency. This idea, however, is primarily based on lesion studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging, without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency, including overlapping and different regions, in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging. The evidence for the anatomical substrates of letter and category fluency, each recruiting slightly different language and cognitive processes, can serve both clinical applications as well as a deeper theoretical understanding of the organization of the cerebral cortex.", "Keywords": ["frontal", "inferior frontal gyrus", "phonemic fluency", "semantic fluency", "temporal"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Verbal Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jet M J", "Last Name": "Vonk", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Batool", "Last Name": "Rizvi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick J", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Budge", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)", "PubDate": "2019Jun01"}, {"PMID": "29328963", "Title": "The effect of white matter hyperintensities on cognition is mediated by cortical atrophy.", "Abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) have been linked to cognitive dysfunction and dementia, although the reasons are unclear. One possibility is that WMH promote neurodegeneration, which, in turn, affects cognition. We examined whether cortical thickness, a marker of neurodegeneration, mediates the relationship between WMH and cognition among 519 older adults. Using conditional process analysis modeling techniques, we examined the association between WMH volume and global cognition and tested whether cortical thickness mediates this relationship statistically. We also tested specific regional hypotheses to determine whether cortical thickness or volume in the medial temporal lobe mediates the relationship between WMH volume and memory. Increased total WMH volume was associated with poorer global cognition and memory. Global cortical thickness and medial temporal lobe thickness/volume mediated the relationship of WMH volume on global cognition and memory functioning. The mediating relationship was similar across racial and ethnic groups and across diagnostic groups (i.e., mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease). The findings suggest that WMH promote atrophy, which, in turn, drives cognitive decline and highlight a potential pathway in which small vessel cerebrovascular disease affects cognition by promoting neurodegenerative changes directly.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cognition", "Cortical thickness", "Memory", "White matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Memory", "Organ Size", "Racial Groups", "Temporal Lobe", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Batool", "Last Name": "Rizvi", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Narkhede", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Briana S", "Last Name": "Last", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Budge", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

High-resolution structural MRI was collected on 680 non-demented elderly (mean age 80.1years) participants of a community-based, multiethnic cohort. Approximately three quarters of these participants also had peripheral inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL6, and ACT) measured using ELISA. Structural measures including brain volumes and cortical thickness (with both global and regional measures) were derived from MRI scans, and repeated MRI measures were obtained after 4.5years. Mean fractional anisotropy was used as the indicator of white matter integrity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging. We examined the association of inflammatory biomarkers with brain volume, cortical thickness, and white matter integrity using regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, education, APOE genotype, and intracranial volume. A doubling in CRP (b=-2.48, p=0.002) was associated with a smaller total gray matter volume, equivalent to approximately 1.5years of aging. A doubling in IL6 was associated with smaller total brain volume (b=-14.96, p<0.0001), equivalent to approximately 9years of aging. Higher IL6 was also associated with smaller gray matter (b=-6.52, p=0.002) and white matter volumes (b=-7.47, p=0.004). The volumes of most cortical regions including frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal, as well as subcortical regions including pallidum and thalamus were associated with IL6. In a model additionally adjusted for depression, vascular factors, BMI, and smoking status, the association between IL6 and brain volumes remained, and a doubling in ACT was marginally associated with 0.054 (p=0.001) millimeter thinner mean cortical thickness, equivalent to that of approximately 2.7years of aging. None of the biomarkers was associated with mean fractional anisotropy or longitudinal change of brain volumes and thickness. Among older adults, increased circulating inflammatory biomarkers were associated with smaller brain volume and cortical thickness but not the white matter tract integrity. Our preliminary findings suggest that peripheral inflammatory processes may be involved in the brain atrophy in the elderly.", "Keywords": ["Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin", "Brain atrophy", "Brain morphometry", "C-reactive protein", "Cortical thickness", "Interleukin-6", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Neuroepidemiology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrophy", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "White Matter", "alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yian", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; The Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

Understanding sources of cognitive disparities at different ages can inform policies and interventions. Data were obtained for non-Hispanic Black and White respondents to The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States from 3 age groups: 28-44 (N = 1210; 20% Black); 45-64 (N = 2693; 15% Black); and 65-85 (N = 1298; 11% Black). Moderated mediation models characterized direct and indirect effects of race on episodic memory and executive function composite scores through economic, health, and psychosocial variables as a function of age group. Education, income, chronic health conditions, and external locus of control mediated cognitive disparities across the life course, although income was a stronger mediator at younger ages. Perceived discrimination was a weaker mediator among young adults due to an absence of racial differences in perceived discrimination in that group. Despite multiple indirect effects, there were still significant unexplained effects of race on cognition that were not moderated by age group. Interventional work is needed to determine whether increasing educational attainment and income, and reducing chronic health conditions and perceived constraints among Blacks, reduce cognitive disparities. Targeting income inequality and discrimination (or buffering the impact of those variables) may be differently effective at reducing cognitive disparities at different stages of the adult life course.

First, we discuss the purpose of using intelligence tests in South Africa and beyond in order to clarify the reference group on which norms will be based. Next, we discuss the psychometric consequences of Pearson's decisions to not adapt their measure of intellectual functioning to the cultural background of the majority of South Africans, and to use a population-matched normative sample in which the disadvantaged group is in the majority. We echo Professor Shuttleworth-Edwards's call for large-scale empirical studies of cognitive test performance in a multicultural context.

We conducted a pilot study of metformin, a medication efficacious in treating and preventing diabetes while reducing hyperinsulinemia, among persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with the goal of collecting preliminary data on feasibility, safety, and efficacy. Participants were 80 men and women aged 55 to 90 years with aMCI, overweight or obese, without treated diabetes. We randomized participants to metformin 1000\u200amg twice a day or matching placebo for 12 months. The co-primary clinical outcomes were changes from baseline to 12 months in total recall of the Selective Reminding Test (SRT) and the score of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The secondary outcome was change in relative glucose uptake in the posterior cingulate-precuneus in brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Change in plasma A\u03b242 was an exploratory outcome. The mean age of participants was 65 years. Fifty percent of participants were women. The only baseline variable that was different between the arms was the ADAS-Cog. Metformin could not be tolerated by 7.5% of participants; 15% tolerated 500\u200amg/day, 35% tolerated 1000\u200amg/day, 32.5% tolerated 1500\u200amg/day, and only 10% tolerated the maximum dose. There were no serious adverse events related to metformin. The 7.5% of persons who did not tolerate metformin reported gastrointestinal symptoms. After adjusting for baseline ADAS-cog, changes in total recall of the SRT favored the metformin group (9.7\u00b18.5 versus 5.3\u00b18.5; p\u200a=\u200a0.02).

We modeled cognitive change over age for cognitive outcomes by race, education, and study. We adjusted models for sex, dementia status, and study-specific characteristics. The results found that for baseline levels of overall cognitive performance, memory, and executive function, differences in race and education tended to be larger than between-study differences and consistent across studies. This pattern did not hold for rate of cognitive decline: effects of education and race/ethnicity on cognitive change were not consistently observed across studies, and when present were small, with racial/ethnic minorities and those with lower education declining at faster rates. In this diverse set of datasets, non-Hispanic Whites and those with higher education had substantially higher baseline cognitive test scores.

Drawing on a lifecourse perspective, we examine whether state of school attendance affects cognitive outcomes in older adults and partially contributes to persistent racial disparities. Using data from older African American and white participants in the national Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the New York based Washington Heights Inwood Cognitive Aging Project (WHICAP), we estimated age-and gender-adjusted multilevel models with random effects for states predicting years of education and cognitive outcomes (e.g., memory and vocabulary). We summarized the proportion of variation in outcomes attributable to state of school attendance and compared the magnitude of racial disparities across states. Among WHICAP African Americans, state of school attendance accounted for 9% of the variance in years of schooling, 6% of memory, and 12% of language. Among HRS African Americans, state of school attendance accounted for 13% of the variance in years of schooling and also contributed to variance in cognitive function (7%), memory (2%), and vocabulary (12%). Random slope models indicated state-level African American and white disparities in every Census region, with the largest racial differences in the South. State of school attendance may contribute to racial disparities in cognitive outcomes among older Americans. Despite tremendous within-state heterogeneity, state of school attendance also accounted for some variability in cognitive outcomes.

A longitudinal application.", "Abstract": "Cognitive reserve describes the mismatch between brain integrity and cognitive performance. Older adults with high cognitive reserve are more resilient to age-related brain pathology. Traditionally, cognitive reserve is indexed indirectly via static proxy variables (e.g., years of education). More recently, cross-sectional studies have suggested that reserve can be expressed as residual variance in episodic memory performance that remains after accounting for demographic factors and brain pathology (whole brain, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes). The present study extends these methods to a longitudinal framework in a community-based cohort of 244 older adults who underwent two comprehensive neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging sessions over 4.6 years. On average, residual memory variance decreased over time, consistent with the idea that cognitive reserve is depleted over time. Individual differences in change in residual memory variance predicted incident dementia, independent of baseline residual memory variance. Multiple-group latent difference score models revealed tighter coupling between brain and language changes among individuals with decreasing residual memory variance. These results suggest that changes in residual memory variance may capture a dynamic aspect of cognitive reserve and could be a useful way to summarize individual cognitive responses to brain changes. Change in residual memory variance among initially non-demented older adults was a better predictor of incident dementia than residual memory variance measured at one time-point.", "Keywords": ["Brain atrophy", "Cognitive ageing", "Cognitive reserve", "Dementia: structural MR imaging", "Memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aging", "Brain", "Cognitive Reserve", "Dementia", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Organ Size", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura B", "Last Name": "Zahodne", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and The Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States.

Decliners had more brain atrophy and higher rates of conversion to dementia. This study highlights the heterogeneity in cognitive aging and provides evidence that most elderly maintain memory function as they age. Associations with dementia and imaging measures validate subgroups of older adults identified with GMM based on their memory trajectories. Future research should use these memory trajectory phenotypes to determine whether dementia risk and protective factors differ for individuals following different memory trajectories.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Cognitive aging", "MRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Atrophy", "Dementia", "Disease Progression", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "New York City"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura B", "Last Name": "Zahodne", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie M", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Schupf", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA. amb2139@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2015Nov"}, {"PMID": "26221954", "Title": "Brain Amyloid Deposition and Longitudinal Cognitive Decline in Nondemented Older Subjects: Results from a Multi-Ethnic Population.", "Abstract": "We aimed to whether the abnormally high amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) level in the brain among apparently healthy elders is related with subtle cognitive deficits and/or accelerated cognitive decline.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Aniline Compounds", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Brain", "Cognition Disorders", "Cognitive Aging", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiography", "Stilbenes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yian", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Qolamreza R", "Last Name": "Razlighi", "Affiliation": "The Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Laura B", "Last Name": "Zahodne", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sarah C", "Last Name": "Janicki", "Affiliation": "The Gertrude H.

The current study extends these findings to a nationally representative sample of men and women aged 30 to 85 and explores which cognitive domains are most strongly associated with self-efficacy, educational attainment, and their interaction. Data were obtained from 1032 adult (30-85) participants in the United States norming study for the NIH Toolbox. Self-efficacy, executive functioning, working memory, processing speed, episodic memory, and vocabulary were assessed with the NIH Toolbox. Multivariate analysis of covariance and follow-up regressions tested the hypothesis that self-efficacy would be more strongly related to cognitive performance among individuals with lower education, controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, reading level, testing language, and depressive symptoms. Higher education was associated with higher self-efficacy and better performance on all cognitive tests. Higher self-efficacy was associated with better set-switching and attention/inhibition. Significant self-efficacy by education interactions indicated that associations between self-efficacy and executive abilities were stronger for individuals with lower education. Specifically, individuals with low education but high self-efficacy performed similarly to individuals with high education. This study provides evidence that self-efficacy beliefs buffer against the negative effects of low educational attainment on executive functioning. These results have implications for future policy and/or intervention work aimed at reducing the deleterious effects of educational disadvantage on later cognitive health.", "Keywords": ["Adult", "Cognition", "Psychological resilience", "Psychosocial factors", "Reading", "Socioeconomic factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Databases, Factual", "Educational Status", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Middle Aged", "Models, Psychological", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Self Efficacy", "Sex Factors", "United States", "Vocabulary"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura B", "Last Name": "Zahodne", "Affiliation": "1Cognitive Neuroscience Division,Department of Neurology and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and The Aging Brain,Columbia University,New York,New York."}, {"First Name": "Cindy J", "Last Name": "Nowinski", "Affiliation": "2Department of Medical Social Sciences,Northwestern University,Evanston,Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Richard C", "Last Name": "Gershon", "Affiliation": "2Department of Medical Social Sciences,Northwestern University,Evanston,Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "1Cognitive Neuroscience Division,Department of Neurology and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and The Aging Brain,Columbia University,New York,New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}, {"PMID": "25748319", "Title": "Cerebral autoregulation, beta amyloid, and white matter hyperintensities are interrelated.", "Abstract": "Emerging studies link vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular health to the prevalence and rates of progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Bootstrap algorithms have been introduced to provide a non-parametric method to estimate the uncertainty of the measured diffusion parameters. To quantify the variability of the principal diffusion direction, bootstrap-derived metrics such as the cone of uncertainty have been proposed. However, bootstrap-derived metrics are not independent of the underlying diffusion profile. A higher mean diffusivity causes a smaller signal-to-noise ratio and, thus, increases the measurement uncertainty. Moreover, the goodness of the tensor model, which relies strongly on the complexity of the underlying diffusion profile, influences bootstrap-derived metrics as well. The presented simulations clearly depict the cone of uncertainty as a function of the underlying diffusion profile. Since the relationship of the cone of uncertainty and common diffusion parameters, such as the mean diffusivity and the fractional anisotropy, is not linear, the cone of uncertainty has a different sensitivity. In vivo analysis of the fornix reveals the cone of uncertainty to be a predictor of memory function among older adults. No significant correlation occurs with the common diffusion parameters. The present work not only demonstrates the cone of uncertainty as a function of the actual diffusion profile, but also discloses the cone of uncertainty as a sensitive predictor of memory function.

In the present study, we sought to determine whether the longitudinal regional progression of WMH predicts incident AD above-and-beyond traditional radiological markers of neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal atrophy and cortical thickness). Three hundred three nondemented older adults (mean age = 79.24 \u00b1 5.29) received high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and then again 4.6 years (standard deviation = 1.01) later. Over the follow-up interval 26 participants progressed to AD. Using structural equation modeling, we calculated latent difference scores of parietal and nonparietal WMH, hippocampus volumes, and cortical thickness values in AD-related regions. Within the structural equation modeling framework, we determined whether baseline or change scores or both predicted AD conversion, while controlling for several time-invariant relevant variables. Smaller baseline hippocampus volume, change in hippocampus volume (i.e., atrophy), higher baseline parietal lobe WMH, and increasing parietal lobe WMH volume but not WMH in other regions or measures of cortical thickness, independently predicted progression to AD.

In the Plan, the term Alzheimer disease includes not only Alzheimer disease (AD) proper, but also several specified related dementias, namely, frontotemporal, Lewy body, vascular, and mixed dementia. In response to a specific action item in the 2012 National Plan, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, in collaboration with the National Institute on Aging, convened panels of experts and conducted a 2-day public conference to develop research priorities and timelines for addressing Alzheimer disease-related dementias (ADRD) in 5 topic areas: multiple etiology dementias, health disparities, Lewy body dementias including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, frontotemporal dementia and related tauopathies, and vascular contributions to ADRD. By design, the product was up to 8 prioritized research recommendations in each topic area including estimated timelines from when work on a recommendation is started to completion or to full implementation of an ongoing activity, and recognition of shared research themes across recommendations. These included increased education and training of both researchers and health care professionals, addressing health disparities, fundamental neurobiology research, advanced diagnostics, collaborative biosample repositories, and a focus on developing effective interventions to prevent or treat ADRD by the year 2025 as targeted by the National Plan.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Dementia", "Humans", "Research", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Montine", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Pathology (T.J.M.), University of Washington, Seattle;

Because of its essential role in early childhood development, in educational achievement and in subsequent life adaptation, language was included as one of the subdomains in the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB). There are many different components of language functioning, including syntactic processing (i.e., morphology and grammar) and lexical semantics. For purposes of the NIHTB-CB, two tests of language--a picture vocabulary test and a reading recognition test--were selected by consensus based on literature reviews, iterative expert input, and a desire to assess in English and Spanish. NIHTB-CB's picture vocabulary and reading recognition tests are administered using computer adaptive testing and scored using item response theory. Data are presented from the validation of the English versions in a sample of adults ages 20-85 years (Spanish results will be presented in a future publication). Both tests demonstrated high test-retest reliability and good construct validity compared to corresponding gold-standard measures.

In the Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test (TORRT), participants see a letter or word onscreen and must pronounce or identify it.

The CB is one of four modules that measure cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor health across the lifespan. The CB is unique in its continuity across childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, and old age, and in order to help create a common currency among disparate studies, it is also available at low cost to researchers for use in large-scale longitudinal and epidemiologic studies. This chapter describes the evolution of the CB; methods for selecting cognitive subdomains and instruments; the rationale for test design; and a validation study in children and adolescents, ages 3-15 years. Subsequent chapters feature detailed discussions of each test measure and its psychometric properties (Chapters 2-6), the factor structure of the test battery (Chapter 7), the effects of age and education on composite test scores (Chapter 8), and a final summary and discussion (Chapter 9).

Efforts to explore reserve have been hindered by measurement difficulties. Reed et al. (2010) proposed quantifying reserve as residual variance in episodic memory performance that remains after accounting for demographic factors and brain pathology (whole brain, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes). This residual variance represents the discrepancy between an individual\u2019s predicted and actual memory performance. The goals of the present study were to extend these methods to a larger, community-based sample and to investigate whether the residual reserve variable is explained by age, predicts longitudinal changes in language, and predicts dementia conversion independent of age. Results support this operational measure of reserve. The residual reserve variable was associated with higher reading ability, lower likelihood of meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment, lower odds of dementia conversion in dependent of age, and less decline in language abilities over 3 years. Finally, the residual reserve variable moderated the negative impact of memory variance explained by brain pathology on language decline.

The 12 articles summarized in this review made important contributions to the field of Alzheimer's disease in the last 5 years. Four of the articles established the Mediterranean diet as a food consumption pattern that may prevent Alzheimer's disease in addition to physical activity. Two of the articles advanced our knowledge of predictors of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Four of the articles provided important knowledge of risk factors for the progression of Alzheimer's disease and its complications.
