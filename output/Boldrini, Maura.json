[{"PMID": "38821194", "Title": "Omics approaches to investigate the pathogenesis of suicide.", "Abstract": "Suicide is the second leading cause of death in U.S. adolescents and young adults, and generally associated with a psychiatric disorder. Suicidal behavior has a complex etiology and pathogenesis. Moderate heritability suggests genetic causes. Associations between childhood and recent life adversity indicate contributions from epigenetic factors. Genomic contributions to suicide pathogenesis remain largely unknown. This paper is based on a workshop held to design strategies to identify molecular drivers of suicide neurobiology that would be putative new treatment targets. The panel determined that, while bulk tissue studies provide comprehensive information, single-nucleus approaches identifying cell-type specific changes are needed. While single nuclei techniques lack information on cytoplasm, processes, spines, and synapses, spatial multiomic technologies on intact tissue detect cell alterations specific to brain tissue layers and subregions. Because suicide has genetic and environmental drivers, multiomic approaches combining cell-type specific epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome provide a more complete picture of pathogenesis. To determine the direction of effect of suicide risk gene variants on RNA and protein expression, and how these interact with epigenetic marks, single nuclei and spatial multiomics quantitative trait loci maps should be integrated with whole genome sequencing and genome-wide association databases. The workshop concluded with the recommendation for the formation of an international suicide biology consortium that will bring together brain banks and investigators with expertise in cutting-edge omics technologies to delineate the biology of suicide and identify novel potential treatment targets to be tested in cellular and animal models for drug and biomarkers discovery, to guide suicide prevention.", "Keywords": ["Multiomics", "human brain", "postmortem", "suicide"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Boldrini", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY; Division of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY.

In rodents, neurogenesis is very active during adolescence, when is particularly vulnerable to stress. Whether stress-related neurogenesis changes influence adolescence onset of psychiatric symptoms remains largely unknown. A systematic review was conducted on studies investigating changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions, and behaviour, occurring after adolescence stress exposure in mice both acutely (at post-natal days 21-65) and in adulthood. A total of 37 studies were identified in the literature. Seven studies showed reduced hippocampal cell proliferation, and out of those two reported increased depressive-like behaviours, in adolescent rodents exposed to stress. Three studies reported a reduction in the number of new-born neurons, which however were not associated with changes in cognition or behaviour. Sixteen studies showed acutely reduced hippocampal neuroplasticity, including pre- and post-synaptic plasticity markers, dendritic spine length and density, and long-term potentiation after stress exposure. Cognitive impairments and depressive-like behaviours were reported by 11 of the 16 studies. Among studies who looked at adolescence stress exposure effects into adulthood, seven showed that the negative effects of stress observed during adolescence on either cell proliferation or hippocampal neuroplasticity, cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviour, had variable impact in adulthood. Treating adolescent mice with antidepressants, glutamate receptor inhibitors, glucocorticoid antagonists, or healthy diet enriched in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin A, prevented or reversed those detrimental changes. Future research should investigate the translational value of these preclinical findings. Developing novel tools for measuring hippocampal neurogenesis in live humans, would allow assessing neurogenic changes following stress exposure, investigating relationships with psychiatric symptom onset, and identifying effects of therapeutic interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Brain", "Cognition", "Hippocampus", "Neurogenesis", "Rodentia", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Borsini", "Affiliation": "Stress, Psychiatry and Immunology Laboratory, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, London, UK. alessandra.borsini@kcl.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Juliette", "Last Name": "Giacobbe", "Affiliation": "Stress, Psychiatry and Immunology Laboratory, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Gargi", "Last Name": "Mandal", "Affiliation": "Stress, Psychiatry and Immunology Laboratory, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Department of Psychological Medicine, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Boldrini", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology Division, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "36922587", "Title": "Spatial epigenome-transcriptome co-profiling of mammalian tissues.", "Abstract": "Emerging spatial technologies, including spatial transcriptomics and spatial epigenomics, are becoming powerful tools for profiling of cellular states in the tissue context1-5. However, current methods capture only one layer of omics information at a time, precluding the possibility of examining the mechanistic relationship across the central dogma of molecular biology. Here, we present two technologies for spatially resolved, genome-wide, joint profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome by cosequencing chromatin accessibility and gene expression, or histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K27ac or H3K4me3) and gene expression on the same tissue section at near-single-cell resolution. These were applied to embryonic and juvenile mouse brain, as well as adult human brain, to map how epigenetic mechanisms control transcriptional phenotype and cell dynamics in tissue. Although highly concordant tissue features were identified by either spatial epigenome or spatial transcriptome we also observed distinct patterns, suggesting their differential roles in defining cell states. Linking epigenome to transcriptome pixel by pixel allows the uncovering of new insights in spatial epigenetic priming, differentiation and gene regulation within the tissue architecture.

To address this question, we used immunofluorescence on control healthy hippocampus and surgical resections from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), plus neural stem-cell cultures and multi-electrode recordings of ex vivo hippocampal slices. We found that a longer duration of epilepsy is associated with a sharp decline in neuronal production and persistent numbers in astrogenesis. Further, immature neurons in MTLE are mostly inactive, and are not observed in cases with local epileptiform-like activity. However, immature astroglia are present in every MTLE case and their location and activity are dependent on epileptiform-like activity. Immature astroglia, rather than newborn neurons, therefore represent a potential target to continually modulate adult human neuronal hyperactivity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Epilepsy",

Anterior GCL glial number did not differ between groups. Anterior/mid GCL volume was smaller in unmedicated-MDDs vs controls (p=0.008) and larger in MDD*SSRIs vs unmedicated-MDDs (p<0.001), MDD*TCAs (p<0.001), and controls (p<0.001). Anterior GCL volume and GN number (r=0.594, p=0.001), and mid DG volume and GN number (r=0.398, p=0.044) were correlated. Anterior DG capillary density correlated with GN number (p=0.027), and with GCL (p=0.024) and DG (r=0.400, p=0.047) volumes. Posterior DG volume and GN number did not differ between groups. Fewer GNs in unmedicated-MDD without fewer neuronal progenitor cells, as previously reported, suggests a cell maturation or survival defect, perhaps related to MDD duration. This may contribute to a smaller hippocampus and is potentially reversed by SSRIs. Postmortem studies are correlative and animal studies are needed to test implied causal relationships.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antidepressive Agents", "Cell Count", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "Dentate Gyrus", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurons", "Organ Size", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Boldrini", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. mb928@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Adrienne N", "Last Name": "Santiago", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Dwork", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gorazd B", "Last Name": "Rosoklija", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hadassah", "Last Name": "Tamir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Victoria", "Last Name": "Arango", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J", "Last Name": "John Mann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2013May"}]
