Here, we used computational methods in combination with functional neuroimaging to provide evidence that the aesthetic value of a visual stimulus is computed in a hierarchical manner via a weighted integration over both low and high level stimulus features contained in early and late visual cortex, extending into parietal and lateral prefrontal cortices. Feature representations in parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex may in turn be utilized to produce an overall aesthetic value in the medial prefrontal cortex. Such brain-wide computations are not only consistent with a feature-based mechanism for value construction, but also resemble computations performed by a deep convolutional neural network. Our findings thus shed light on the existence of a general neurocomputational mechanism for rapidly and flexibly producing value judgements across an array of complex novel stimuli and situations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Visual Cortex", "Esthetics", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kiyohito", "Last Name": "Iigaya", "Affiliation": "Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA. ki2151@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sanghyun", "Last Name": "Yi", "Affiliation": "Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iman A", "Last Name": "Wahle", "Affiliation": "Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandy", "Last Name": "Tanwisuth", "Affiliation": "Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA."}, {"First Name": "Logan", "Last Name": "Cross", "Affiliation": "Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "O'Doherty", "Affiliation": "Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA. jdoherty@caltech.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2023Jan24"}, {"PMID": "35252481", "Title": "The hierarchical construction of value.", "Abstract": "Here we argue that the assignment of subjective value to potential outcomes at the time of decision-making is an active process, in which individual features of a potential outcome of varying degrees of abstraction are represented hierarchically and integrated in a weighted fashion to produce an overall value judgment.

In two fMRI studies (the second a pre-registered replication of the first), we identify a neuro-computational mechanism underlying arbitration between choice imitation and goal emulation. Computational modeling, combined with a behavioral task that dissociated the two strategies, revealed that control over behavior was adaptively and dynamically weighted toward the most reliable strategy.

Such behavioral deviations are interpreted as a failure of the subject; however, here we instead suggest that they reflect an adaptive strategy, suitable for uncertain, non-stationary environments. To prove it, we analyzed the behavior of primates that perform a dynamic foraging task. In such nonstationary environment, learning on both fast and slow timescales is beneficial: fast learning allows the animal to react to sudden changes, at the price of large fluctuations (variance) in the estimates of task relevant variables. Slow learning reduces the fluctuations but costs a bias that causes systematic behavioral deviations.

This provides an inferential foundation for the cognitive (judgement) bias task, now widely-used for assessing affective states in non-human animals. In the task, information about affect is extracted from the optimistic or pessimistic manner in which participants resolve ambiguities in sensory input. Here, we report a novel variant of the task aimed at dissecting the effects of affect manipulations on perceptual and value computations for decision-making under ambiguity in humans. Participants were instructed to judge which way a Gabor patch (250ms presentation) was leaning. If the stimulus leant one way (e.g. left), pressing the REWard key yielded a monetary WIN whilst pressing the SAFE key failed to acquire the WIN. If it leant the other way (e.g. right), pressing the SAFE key avoided a LOSS whilst pressing the REWard key incurred the LOSS. The size (0-100 UK pence) of the offered WIN and threatened LOSS, and the ambiguity of the stimulus (vertical being completely ambiguous) were varied on a trial-by-trial basis, allowing us to investigate how decisions were affected by differing combinations of these factors. Half the subjects performed the task in a 'Pleasantly' decorated room and were given a gift (bag of sweets) prior to starting, whilst the other half were in a bare 'Unpleasant' room and were not given anything. Although these treatments had little effect on self-reported mood, they did lead to differences in decision-making. All subjects were risk averse under ambiguity, consistent with the notion of loss aversion. Analysis using a Bayesian decision model indicated that Unpleasant Room subjects were ('pessimistically') biased towards choosing the SAFE key under ambiguity, but also weighed WINS more heavily than LOSSes compared to Pleasant Room subjects. These apparently contradictory findings may be explained by the influence of affect on different processes underlying decision-making, and the task presented here offers opportunities for further dissecting such processes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affect", "Algorithms", "Bayes Theorem", "Choice Behavior", "Cognition", "Computer Simulation", "Decision Making", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reward", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kiyohito", "Last Name": "Iigaya", "Affiliation": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL, London W1T 4JG, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Aurelie", "Last Name": "Jolivald", "Affiliation": "Centre for Behavioural Biology, School of Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, Langford, BS40 5DU, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Wittawat", "Last Name": "Jitkrittum", "Affiliation": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL, London W1T 4JG, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Iain D", "Last Name": "Gilchrist", "Affiliation": "School of Experimental Psychology, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TU, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Dayan", "Affiliation": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL, London W1T 4JG, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "Centre for Behavioural Biology, School of Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, Langford, BS40 5DU, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Mendl", "Affiliation": "Centre for Behavioural Biology, School of Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, Langford, BS40 5DU, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27504806", "Title": "Adaptive learning and decision-making under uncertainty by metaplastic synapses guided by a surprise detection system.", "Abstract": "Recent experiments have shown that animals and humans have a remarkable ability to adapt their learning rate according to the volatility of the environment.

According to the matching law, organisms distribute their behavior across available response alternatives in the same proportion that reinforcers are distributed across those alternatives. Recently a few biophysically plausible neural network models have been proposed to explain the matching behavior observed in the experiments. Here we study systematically the learning dynamics of these networks while performing a matching task on the concurrent variable interval (VI) schedule. We found that the model neural network can operate in one of three qualitatively different regimes depending on the parameters that characterize the synaptic dynamics and the reward schedule: (1) a matching behavior regime, in which the probability of choosing an option is roughly proportional to the baiting fractional probability of that option; (2) a perseverative regime, in which the network tends to make always the same decision; and (3) a tristable regime, in which the network can either perseverate or choose the two targets randomly approximately with the same probability. Different parameters of the synaptic dynamics lead to different types of deviations from the matching law, some of which have been observed experimentally. We show that the performance of the network depends on the number of stable states of each synapse and that bistable synapses perform close to optimal when the proper learning rate is chosen.
