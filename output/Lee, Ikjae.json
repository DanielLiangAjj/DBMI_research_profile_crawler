We performed a case-control study to examine the association between ALS diagnosis and serum levels of bile acids. Sporadic and familial ALS patients, age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and presymptomatic gene carriers who donated blood samples were included. Non-fasted serum samples stored at -80\u00b0C were used for the analysis. Serum bile acid levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Concentrations of 15 bile acids were obtained, 5 non-conjugated and 10 conjugated, and compared between ALS versus control groups (presymptomatic gene carriers + healthy controls) using the Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum test. In total, 80 participants were included: 31 ALS (17 sporadic and 14 familial ALS); 49 controls (22 gene carriers, 27 healthy controls). The mean age was 50\u2009years old and 50% were male. In the ALS group, 45% had familial disease with a pathogenic variant in C9orf72 (29%), TARDBP (10%), FUS (3%), and CHCHD10 (3%) genes. In the control group, 43% carried pathogenic variants: C9orf72 (27%), SOD1 (10%), and FUS (6%). The serum levels of UDCA, TUDCA, and GUDCA trended higher in the ALS group compared to controls (median 27 vs. 7\u2009nM, 4 vs. 3\u2009nM, 110 vs. 47\u2009nM, p-values 0.04, 0.06, 0.04, respectively).

A lack of standardization in the performance of outcome measures leads to confusion among site research teams and is a source of variability in clinical trial data. MGNet, the NIH-supported Rare Disease Clinical Research Network for MG, views standardization of MG outcome measures as a critical need. To address this issue, a group of experts summarized key outcome measures used in MG clinical trials and a symposium was convened to address issues contributing to outcome measure variability. Consensus recommendations resulted in changes to outcome measure instructions and, in some cases, modifications to specific instruments. Recommended changes were posted for public commentary before finalization. Changes to the MG-Activities of Daily Living, MG-Quality of Life-15r, and MG-Impairment Index were limited to adding details to the administration instructions. Recommendations for proper positioning of participants and how to score items that could not be performed because of non-MG reasons were provided for the MG Composite. The Quantitative MG (QMG) score required the most attention, and changes were made both to the instructions and the performance of certain items resulting in the QMG-Revised. The Postintervention Status was believed to have a limited role in clinical trials, except for the concept of minimal manifestation status. As a next step, training materials and revised source documents, which will be freely available to study teams, will be created and posted on the MGNet website.

Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is exceedingly rare and has been an enigmatic disease. Recent progress has drastically changed this perception, with early biomarkers being investigated and potential medications for PLS emerging at the preclinical stage. The aim of this paper is to describe a study of PLS natural history and discuss the limitations and proposed solutions to the study of a rare and slowly progressive disease. Methods. The PLS Natural History Study is a 30-site, 24-month, prospective study that is supported by multiple funding sources. The study aims to enroll 50 early PLS (disease duration \u22644 years) and 50 definite PLS (disease duration 4 to 15 years) participants using modified PLS Diagnostic Criteria. Smartphone-based assessments including semi-quantitative and quantitative measures and patient-reported outcomes are utilized. In-person quantitative measures are also completed during site visits. The change in the PLS Functional Rating Scale score is the primary outcome. The study utilizes the NeuroBANK\u00ae patient-centric data capture and management platform. The biostatistical analysis plan has been developed. Results. In one year, 28 participants have been recruited. Enrollment has been much slower than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rarity of PLS, and potential study competition for internal resources from ALS clinical trials. Discussion. We discuss the need for more innovative methods to enroll and study individuals with such rare diseases and propose a number of mechanisms by which more efficient enrollment could be facilitated.",
