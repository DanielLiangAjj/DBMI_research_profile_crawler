Indeed, dose adjustments are made in the setting of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy or when prioritizing tumor coverage during treatment planning. Despite guidelines, in many patients, RT to the cochlea may still cause sensorineural hearing loss through progressive degeneration and ossification of the inner ear. There are several audiologic and otolaryngologic interventions for incident RT-induced hearing loss, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, or, in the context of vestibular schwannoma due to neurofibromatosis type 2, auditory brain stem implantation. Cochlear implants are the most effective at restoring hearing and improving quality of life for those with an intact cochlear nerve. An early multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimally manage RT-induced hearing loss, and this topic discussion serves as a guide for radiation oncologists on cochlear dosimetric considerations as well as how to address potential RT-induced adverse effects.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural", "Radiation Injuries", "Radiotherapy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Ishak", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Gallitto", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Justin S", "Last Name": "Golub", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Sisti", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Tony J C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York.

Our objective is to assess how much patients value minimizing pain and numbness relative to other postoperative otologic outcomes.

Patients were instructed to rate how much they value various outcomes when undergoing hypothetical ear surgery on a scale of 0 (not important) to 10 (very important). Results: 102 patients responded. Ten percent of survey respondents were Spanish-speaking. Outcomes of the highest importance included hearing (mean 9.3; SD 1.9), staff friendliness (8.9; 1.8), numbness (8.3; 2.4), and pain (8.1; 2.5). Outcomes of moderate importance included time spent under anesthesia (7.0; 3.2), scar visibility (6.3; 3.5), incision size (5.5; 3.4), incision hidden in the ear canal (5.4, 3.9), and surgery cost to the hospital (5.1; 3.9). In linear regression analysis, increasing age was associated with decreased value placed on incision size (p < 0.001) and scar visibility (p < 0.001).

DSS was significantly associated with race and SES ( p \u2009<\u20090.01). Asian/Pacific Islander patients exhibited increased survival when controlling for other variables (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.73, p \u2009<\u20090.01). Although Black patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease (Black odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.47, p \u2009<\u20090.01), Black patients were also less likely to receive multimodal therapy; however, this relationship lost statistical significance once SES was incorporated into the multivariable analysis. DSS was decreased among the lowest (first) and middle (second) tertiles of SES (first HR\u2009=\u20091.34, p \u2009<\u20090.01; second HR\u2009=\u20091.20, p \u2009<\u20090.01) compared with the highest (third). Conclusion \u2003Our results indicate that race, ethnicity, and SES significantly affect survival, stage at diagnosis, and treatment of NPC. An interplay of tumor biology and inequalities in access to care likely drives these disparities.", "Keywords": ["health outcomes", "nasopharyngeal carcinoma", "racial disparity", "socioeconomic status"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashley O", "Last Name": "London", "Affiliation": "Division of Rhinology and Anterior Skull Base Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Liam W", "Last Name": "Gallagher", "Affiliation": "Division of Rhinology and Anterior Skull Base Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rahul K", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Division of Rhinology and Anterior Skull Base Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Spielman", "Affiliation": "Division of Rhinology and Anterior Skull Base Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Justin S", "Last Name": "Golub", "Affiliation": "Division of Rhinology and Anterior Skull Base Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan B", "Last Name": "Overdevest", "Affiliation": "Division of Rhinology and Anterior Skull Base Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carol H", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "DeConde", "Affiliation": "Division of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California, United States."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Gudis", "Affiliation": "Division of Rhinology and Anterior Skull Base Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurological surgery.

However, research examining the neural circuits and behavioral mechanisms by which age-related hearing loss leads to depression is at an early phase. It is known that hearing loss has adverse structural and functional brain consequences, is associated with reduced social engagement and loneliness, and often results in tinnitus, which can independently affect cognitive control and emotion processing circuits. While pathways leading from these sequelae of hearing loss to affective dysregulation and depression are intuitive to hypothesize, few studies have yet been designed to provide conclusive evidence for specific pathophysiological mechanisms.

Several mechanisms have been offered to explain both individual links. Causal and common mechanisms have been theorized for the relationship between ARHL and impaired cognition, including dementia. The causal mechanisms include increased cognitive load, social isolation, and structural brain changes. Common mechanisms include neurovascular disease as well as other known or as-yet undiscovered neuropathologic processes. Behavioral mechanisms have been used to explain the potentially causal association of ARHL with depression. Behavioral mechanisms include social isolation, loneliness, as well as decreased mobility and impairments of activities of daily living, all of which can increase the risk of depression. The mechanisms underlying the associations between hearing loss and impaired cognition, as well as hearing loss and depression, are likely not mutually exclusive. ARHL may contribute to both impaired cognition and depression through overlapping mechanisms. Furthermore, ARHL may contribute to impaired cognition which may, in turn, contribute to depression. Because ARHL is highly prevalent and greatly undertreated, targeting this condition is an appealing and potentially influential strategy to reduce the risk of developing two potentially devastating diseases of later life.

Study Design Case series with planned data collection. Setting Tertiary academic medical center. Subjects and Methods Individuals with HAs between 2007 and 2016 were included (N = 431; mean, 74.6 years; 95% CI, 73.1-76.0). Data-logging technology intrinsic to new-generation HAs was enabled to track usage and sound exposure. With multivariable linear regression, age, sex, number of audiology visits, duration of audiologic follow-up, pure tone average, and HA side were assessed as predictors of usage (hours/day) and aided sound exposure (dB-hours/day; ie, \"dose\" of sound per day). Results Mean follow-up was 319 days (95% CI, 277-360). Mean HA usage was 8.4 hours/day (95% CI, 8.0-8.8; N = 431). Mean aided sound exposure was 440 dB-hours/day (95% CI, 385-493; n = 110). HA use (\u03b2 < 0.001, P = .45) and aided sound exposure (\u03b2 = -0.006, P = .87) were both stable over time. HA usage was associated only with hearing loss level (pure tone average; \u03b2 = 0.030, P = .04). Aided sound exposure was associated only with duration of audiologic follow-up (\u03b2 = 0.100, P = .02). Conclusion While measurement of HA use has traditionally relied on subjective reporting, data logging offers an objective tool to longitudinally track HA use and sound exposure. We demonstrate the feasibility of using this potentially powerful research tool. Usage and sound exposure were stable among patients throughout the study period. Use was greater among subjects with greater hearing loss.

The data linking hearing impairment to incident late-life depression are more mixed but suggest that diminished hearing does increase risk for depression. Behavioral mechanisms may explain these associations, such as the withdrawal of older adults from situations in which they may have difficulty hearing and communicating, which may contribute to the development of social isolation, loneliness, and consequent cognitive decline and depression. At a neural level, chronic hearing loss leads to reduced activation in central auditory pathways, resulting in compensatory increased activation in the cognitive control network, dysfunctional auditory-limbic connectivity, and deafferentation-induced atrophy in frontal brain regions. These pathologic changes decrease cognitive performance and increase depression risk by reducing cognitive reserve, increasing executive dysfunction, and disrupting normative emotion reactivity and regulation. Based on the available data and informed by this model, evidence-based suggestions are proposed for clinicians treating older adults, and a research agenda is advanced to facilitate the development of rationally designed and age-appropriate psychiatric treatments for older adults with age-related hearing loss. First and foremost, treating hearing loss should be investigated as a means of improving cognitive and depressive outcomes in well-designed studies incorporating comprehensive psychiatric assessments, randomization, objective documentation of compliance, and analyses of treatment mediators that will facilitate further therapeutic development. Multimodal neuroimaging studies integrating audiometric, neuropsychological, and clinical assessments also are needed to further evaluate the model proposed.

Some relax-selected populations have had sport fish, including rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, introduced within the past several decades (reverse-selected). We examined the behavioural responses of stickleback from three populations of each type to simulated attacks by trout and birds to determine whether relaxed and reversed selection has led to divergence in behaviour, and whether this divergence was predator specific. Fish from trout-free populations showed weak responses to trout, as predicted, but these responses were similar to those of oceanic (ancestral) populations. Fish from populations that co-occur with trout, whether native or introduced, showed elevated antipredator responses, indicating that in freshwater, trout predation selects for enhanced antipredator responses, which can evolve extremely rapidly. Comparison of laboratory-reared and wild-caught individuals suggests a combination of learned and genetic components to this variation. Responses to a model bird flyover were weakly linked to predation environment, indicating that the loss of predation by trout may partially influence the evolution of responses to birds. Our results reject the hypothesis that the consistent presence of predatory birds has been sufficient to maintain responses to piscivorous fish under periods of relaxed selection.", "Keywords": ["Gasterosteus", "antipredator behaviour", "relaxed selection", "reversed selection", "stickleback", "trout"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew A", "Last Name": "Wund", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, The College of New Jersey, Ewing, NJ, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Clark University, Worcester, MA, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Justin L", "Last Name": "Golub", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, North Adams, MA, U.S.A."}, {"First Name": "Susan A", "Last Name": "Foster", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Clark University, Worcester, MA, U.S.A."}], "Journal": "Animal behaviour", "PubDate": "2015Aug01"}, {"PMID": "26048419", "Title": "Feasibility of the Ultrasonic Bone Aspirator in Retrosigmoid Vestibular Schwannoma Removal.", "Abstract": "Postoperative headache is an undesirable consequence of retrosigmoid vestibular schwannoma (VS) removal.

In this paper we demonstrate that canal-specific two-dimensionally (2D) measured eye velocities are elicited from intermittent brief 2 s biphasic pulse electrical stimulation in four human subjects implanted with a vestibular prosthesis. The 2D measured direction of the slow phase eye movements changed with the canal stimulated. Increasing pulse current over a 0-400 \u03bcA range typically produced a monotonic increase in slow phase eye velocity. The responses decremented or in some cases fluctuated over time in most implanted canals but could be partially restored by changing the return path of the stimulation current. Implantation of the device in Meniere's patients produced hearing and vestibular loss in the implanted ear. Electrical stimulation was well tolerated, producing no sensation of pain, nausea, or auditory percept with stimulation that elicited robust eye movements. There were changes in slow phase eye velocity with current and over time, and changes in electrically evoked compound action potentials produced by stimulation and recorded with the implanted device. Perceived rotation in subjects was consistent with the slow phase eye movements in direction and scaled with stimulation current in magnitude. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of the vestibular end organ in human subjects provided controlled vestibular inputs over time, but in Meniere's patients this apparently came at the cost of hearing and vestibular function in the implanted ear.", "Keywords": ["Meniere's", "human", "implant", "vestibular"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Biophysics", "Cochlear Implantation", "Electric Stimulation", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Hearing", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Meniere Disease", "Middle Aged", "Reflex, Vestibulo-Ocular", "Rotation", "Semicircular Canals", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James O", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; and Virginia Merrill Bloedel Hearing Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington jop@u.washington.edu."}, {"First Name": "Leo", "Last Name": "Ling", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; and."}, {"First Name": "Kaibao", "Last Name": "Nie", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Virginia Merrill Bloedel Hearing Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Elyse", "Last Name": "Jameyson", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington;"}, {"First Name": "Christopher M", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; and."}, {"First Name": "Amy L", "Last Name": "Nowack", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; and."}, {"First Name": "Justin S", "Last Name": "Golub", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington;"}, {"First Name": "Jay T", "Last Name": "Rubinstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-HNS, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; and Virginia Merrill Bloedel Hearing Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "PubDate": "2015Jun01"}, {"PMID": "25550223", "Title": "Analysis of an online match discussion board: improving the otolaryngology-head and neck surgery match.", "Abstract": "\"The Match\" has become the accepted selection process for graduate medical education.
