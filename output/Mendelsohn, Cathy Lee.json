Using this approach, we present the sequence of alterations around RB1 in the development of bladder cancer. We show that RB1 is not involved in initial expansion of the preneoplastic clone. Instead, we found a set of contiguous genes that we term \"forerunner\" genes whose silencing is associated with the development of plaque-like field effects initiating carcinogenesis. Specifically, we identified five candidate forerunner genes (ITM2B, LPAR6, MLNR, CAB39L, and ARL11) mapping near RB1. Two of these genes, LPAR6 and CAB39L, are preferentially downregulated in the luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer, respectively. Their loss of function dysregulates urothelial differentiation, sensitizing the urothelium to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine-induced cancers, which recapitulate the luminal and basal subtypes of human bladder cancer.", "Keywords": ["CP: Cancer", "bladder cancer", "field carcinogenesis", "field effects", "forerunner genes", "mucosal microenvironment", "urothelial differentiation"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Carcinogenesis", "Cell Differentiation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Urothelium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sangkyou", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jolanta", "Last Name": "Bondaruk", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yishan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huiqin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "June Goo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tadeusz", "Last Name": "Majewski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel D", "Last Name": "Mullen", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Cogdell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiansong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ziqiao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pawel", "Last Name": "Kus", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology and Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Joon", "Last Name": "Jeong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ilkyun", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Woonyoung", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins Greenberg Bladder Cancer Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neema", "Last Name": "Navai", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Dinney", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keith", "Last Name": "Baggerly", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Genetics & Development and Pathology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "McConkey", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins Greenberg Bladder Cancer Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard R", "Last Name": "Behringer", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marek", "Last Name": "Kimmel", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bogdan", "Last Name": "Czerniak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

We identified complex proteomic and metabolomic dysregulations in microscopically normal areas of bladder mucosa adjacent to dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. The mutational landscape developed in a background of complex defects of protein homeostasis which included dysregulated nucleocytoplasmic transport, splicesome, ribosome biogenesis, and peroxisome. These changes were combined with altered urothelial differentiation which involved lipid metabolism and protein degradations controlled by PPAR. The complex alterations of proteome were accompanied by dysregulation of gluco-lipid energy-related metabolism. The analysis of mutational landscape identified three types of mutations based on their geographic distribution and variant allele frequencies. The most common were low frequency \u03b1 mutations restricted to individual mucosal samples. The two other groups of mutations were associated with clonal expansion. The first of this group referred to as \u03b2 mutations occurred at low frequencies across the mucosa. The second of this group called \u03b3 mutations increased in frequency with disease progression. Modeling of the mutations revealed that carcinogenesis may span nearly 30 years and can be divided into dormant and progressive phases. The \u03b1 mutations developed gradually in the dormant phase. The progressive phase lasted approximately five years and was signified by the advent of \u03b2 mutations, but it was driven by \u03b3 mutations which developed during the last 2-3 years of disease progression to invasive cancer.

Pparg is a likely driver of LP BC and has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor in BASQ tumors, where it is likely suppressed by MEK-dependent phosphorylation. Here we tested the effects of rosiglitazone, a Pparg agonist, in a mouse model of BBN-induced muscle invasive BC. Rosiglitazone activated Pparg signaling in suprabasal epithelial layers of tumors but not in basal-most layers containing highly proliferative invasive cells, reducing proliferation but not affecting tumor survival. Addition of trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, induced Pparg signaling throughout all tumor layers, and eradicated 91% of tumors within 7-days of treatment. The 2-drug combination also activated a luminal differentiation program, reversing squamous metaplasia in the urothelium of tumor-bearing mice. Paired ATAC-RNA-seq analysis revealed that tumor apoptosis was most likely linked to down-regulation of Bcl-2 and other pro-survival genes, while the shift from BASQ to luminal differentiation was associated with activation of the retinoic acid pathway and upregulation of Kdm6a, a lysine demethylase that facilitates retinoid-signaling. Our data suggest that rosiglitazone, trametinib, and retinoids, which are all FDA approved, may be clinically active in BASQ tumors in patients.

In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression. Mechanistically, NSD1 loss results in silencing of innate immunity genes, including the type III interferon receptor IFNLR1, through depletion of H3K36 di-methylation (H3K36me2) and gain of H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3).

Furthermore, we discuss pathways and signaling mechanisms involved in urothelial differentiation, and consider the relevance of this knowledge to stem cell biology and tissue regeneration.", "Keywords": ["Basal cells", "Progenitors", "Retinoids", "Urothelial development", "Urothelium"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Differentiation", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Stem Cells", "Urinary Bladder", "Urothelium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gregory B", "Last Name": "Wiessner", "Affiliation": "Departments of Urology, Genetics and Development, Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative and Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sakina A", "Last Name": "Plumber", "Affiliation": "Departments of Urology, Genetics and Development, Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative and Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tina", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "Departments of Urology, Genetics and Development, Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative and Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cathy L", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "Departments of Urology, Genetics and Development, Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative and Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Development (Cambridge, England)", "PubDate": "2022May01"}, {"PMID": "35078784", "Title": "Targeting S100A9-ALDH1A1-Retinoic Acid Signaling to Suppress Brain Relapse in EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer.", "Abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) osimertinib has significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, including those with brain metastases. However, despite striking initial responses, osimertinib-treated patients eventually develop lethal metastatic relapse, often to the brain. Although osimertinib-refractory brain relapse is a major clinical challenge, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using metastatic models of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we show that cancer cells expressing high intracellular S100A9 escape osimertinib and initiate brain relapses. Mechanistically, S100A9 upregulates ALDH1A1 expression and activates the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway in osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. We demonstrate that the genetic repression of S100A9, ALDH1A1, or RA receptors (RAR) in cancer cells, or treatment with a pan-RAR antagonist, dramatically reduces brain metastasis. Importantly, S100A9 expression in cancer cells correlates with poor PFS in osimertinib-treated patients. Our study, therefore, identifies a novel, therapeutically targetable S100A9-ALDH1A1-RA axis that drives brain relapse.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family", "Aniline Compounds", "Brain", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "ErbB Receptors", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Retinal Dehydrogenase", "Signal Transduction", "Tretinoin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anup Kumar", "Last Name": "Biswas", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Seoyoung", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yifan", "Last Name": "Tai", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Wanchao", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Coker", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "S Aidan", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ahmad Rushdi", "Last Name": "Shakri", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Timothy James", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hanna", "Last Name": "Scholze", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Galina G", "Last Name": "Lagos", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Mela", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Katia", "Last Name": "Manova-Todorova", "Affiliation": "Molecular Cytology Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "de Stanchina", "Affiliation": "Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo A", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Helena A", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paul K", "Last Name": "Paik", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anjali", "Last Name": "Saqi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Shu", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mark G", "Last Name": "Kris", "Affiliation": "Thoracic Oncology Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Massague", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Swarnali", "Last Name": "Acharyya", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2022Apr01"}, {"PMID": "34697317", "Title": "Pparg signaling controls bladder cancer subtype and immune exclusion.", "Abstract": "Pparg, a nuclear receptor, is downregulated in basal subtype bladder cancers that tend to be muscle invasive and amplified in luminal subtype bladder cancers that tend to be non-muscle invasive.

However, individual cellular and mechanistic contributions to tumor heterogeneity are controversial. We examined potential mechanisms of FOXA1 and PTEN inactivation in bladder cancer and their contribution to tumor heterogeneity. These analyses were complemented with inactivation of FOXA1 and PTEN in intermediate and luminal mouse urothelium. We show inactivation and reduced expression of FOXA1 and PTEN is prevalent in human disease, where PTEN and FOXA1 are downregulated by allelic loss and site-specific DNA hypermethylation, respectively. Conditional inactivation of both Foxa1 and Pten in intermediate/luminal cells in mice results in development of bladder cancer exhibiting squamous features as well as enhanced sensitivity to a bladder-specific carcinogen. In addition, FOXA1 is hypermethylated in basal bladder cancer cell lines, and this is reversed by treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. By integrating human correlative and in vivo studies, we define a critical role for PTEN loss and epigenetic silencing of FOXA1 in heterogeneous human disease and show genetic targeting of luminal/intermediate cells in mice drives squamous differentiation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha", "Humans", "Loss of Heterozygosity", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Muscle Neoplasms", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Prognosis", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vasty", "Last Name": "Osei-Amponsa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jenna M", "Last Name": "Buckwalter", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Shuman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zongyu", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hironobu", "Last Name": "Yamashita", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vonn", "Last Name": "Walter", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Wildermuth", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Justine", "Last Name": "Ellis-Mohl", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua I", "Last Name": "Warrick", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa M", "Last Name": "Shantz", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert P", "Last Name": "Feehan", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hikmat", "Last Name": "Al-Ahmadie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jay D", "Last Name": "Raman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Klaus H", "Last Name": "Kaestner", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xue-Ru", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Urology and Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "DeGraff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA. ddegraff@pennstatehealth.psu.edu."}], "Journal": "Oncogene", "PubDate": "2020Feb"}, {"PMID": "31597917", "Title": "Pparg promotes differentiation and regulates mitochondrial gene expression in bladder epithelial cells.", "Abstract": "The urothelium is an epithelial barrier lining the bladder that protects against infection, fluid exchange and damage from toxins. The nuclear receptor\u00a0Pparg promotes urothelial differentiation in vitro, and Pparg mutations are associated with bladder cancer.

Here we show that Pparg is critical in urothelial cells for mitochondrial biogenesis, cellular differentiation and regulation of inflammation in response to urinary tract infection (UTI). Superficial cells, which are critical for maintaining the urothelial barrier, fail to mature in Pparg mutants and basal cells undergo squamous-like differentiation. Pparg mutants display persistent inflammation after UTI, and Nf-KB, which is transiently activated in response to infection in the wild type urothelium, persists for months.

Superficial cells are critical for production and transport of uroplakins, a family of proteins that assemble into a waterproof crystalline plaque that helps protect against infection and toxic substances. Adult urothelium is nearly quiescent, but rapidly regenerates in response to injury. Yet the mechanism by which binucleated, polyploid, superficial cells are produced remains unclear. Here, we show that superficial cells are likely to be derived from a population of binucleated intermediate cells, which are produced from mononucleated intermediate cells via incomplete cytokinesis. We show that binucleated intermediate and superficial cells increase DNA content via endoreplication, passing through S phase without entering mitosis. The urothelium can be permanently damaged by repetitive or chronic injury or disease.

We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 202 case subjects with RHD and identified diagnostic mutations in genes known to be associated with RHD in 7/202 case subjects. In an additional affected individual with RHD and a congenital heart defect, we found a homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) variant in SLIT3, recapitulating phenotypes reported with Slit3 inactivation in the mouse. To identify genes associated with RHD, we performed an exome-wide association study with 195 unresolved case subjects and 6,905 control subjects. The top signal resided in GREB1L, a gene implicated previously in Hoxb1 and Shha signaling in zebrafish. The significance of the association, which was p = 2.0\u00a0\u00d7 10-5 for novel LOF, increased to p = 4.1\u00a0\u00d7 10-6 for LOF and deleterious missense variants combined, and augmented further after accounting for segregation and de novo inheritance of rare variants (joint p = 2.3\u00a0\u00d7 10-7).

Our understanding of and approach to treating urothelial carcinoma is undergoing rapid advancement. Preclinical models of bladder cancer have been leveraged to increase our basic and mechanistic understanding of the disease. With the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma, the treatment approach for these patients has quickly changed. In this light, molecularly-defined subtypes of bladder cancer and appropriate pre-clinical models are now essential to the further advancement and appropriate application of these therapeutic improvements. The optimal collection and processing of clinical urothelial carcinoma tissues samples will also be critical in the development of predictive biomarkers for therapeutic selection. Technological advances in other areas including optimal imaging technologies and micro/nanotechnologies are being applied to bladder cancer, especially in the localized setting, and hold the potential for translational impact in the treatment of bladder cancer patients. Taken together, advances in several basic science and clinical areas are now converging in bladder cancer.

The goal of the present study was to extend our investigations of bladder repair to the murine model, to harness the power of mouse genetics to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed robust bladder regrowth. Female C57 black mice underwent STC, and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-STC, bladder repair and function were assessed via cystometry, ex vivo pharmacologic organ bath studies, and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histology was also performed to measure bladder wall thickness. We observed a time-dependent increase in bladder capacity (BC) following STC, such that 8 and 12 weeks post-STC, BC and micturition volumes were indistinguishable from those of age-matched non-STC controls and significantly higher than observed at 4 weeks. MRI studies confirmed that bladder volume was indistinguishable within 3 months (11 weeks) post-STC. Additionally, bladders emptied completely at all time points studied (i.e., no increases in residual volume), consistent with functional bladder repair. At 8 and 12 weeks post-STC, there were no significant differences in bladder wall thickness or in the different components (urothelium, lamina propria, or smooth muscle layers) of the bladder wall compared with age-matched control animals. The maximal contractile response to pharmacological activation and electrical field stimulation increased over time in isolated tissue strips from repaired bladders but remained lower at all time points compared with controls.

Both experimental and clinical data support a role for FOXA1 and FOXA2 in urothelial carcinoma. FOXA1 is expressed in embryonic and adult urothelium and its expression is altered in urothelial carcinomas and across disparate molecular bladder cancer subtypes. FOXA2 is normally absent from the adult urothelium, but developmental studies identified FOXA2 as a marker of a transient urothelial progenitor cell population during bladder development.

For urinary tract infection (UTI), a history of two or more episodes is an independent risk factor for acute infection. However, mechanistic knowledge of UTI pathogenesis has come almost exclusively from studies in naive mice. Here we show that, in mice, an initial Escherichia coli UTI, whether chronic or self-limiting, leaves a long-lasting molecular imprint on the bladder tissue that alters the pathophysiology of subsequent infections, affecting host susceptibility and disease outcome. In bladders of previously infected versus non-infected, antibiotic-treated mice, we found (1) an altered transcriptome and defects in cell maturation, (2) a remodelled epithelium that confers resistance to intracellular bacterial colonization, and (3) changes to cyclooxygenase-2-dependent inflammation. Furthermore, in mice with a history of chronic UTI, cyclooxygenase-2-dependent inflammation allowed a variety of clinical E. coli isolates to circumvent intracellular colonization resistance and cause severe recurrent UTI, which could be prevented by cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition or vaccination.

However, human anatomical terms do not always superimpose on the mouse, and the lack of accurate and standardised nomenclature is hampering the utility of such animal models. We previously developed an anatomical ontology for the murine urogenital system. Here, we present a comprehensive update of this ontology pertaining to mouse LUT, genital tubercle and associated reproductive structures (E10.5 to adult). Ontology changes were based on recently published insights into the cellular and gross anatomy of these structures, and on new analyses of epithelial cell types present in the pelvic urethra and regions of the bladder.

Whether these distinct characteristics reflect different cell types of origin is unknown. Here we show using lineage tracing in a murine model of carcinogenesis that intermediate cells give rise primarily to papillary lesions, whereas K5-basal cells are likely progenitors of CIS, muscle-invasive lesions and SCC depending on the genetic background.

While recent studies have shed some light on the importance of the stroma during renal development, many of the signals generated in the stroma, the genetic pathways and interaction networks involving the stroma are yet to be identified. Our previous studies demonstrate that retinoids are crucial for branching of the ureteric bud and for patterning of the cortical stroma. In the present study we demonstrate that autocrine retinoic acid (RA) signaling in stromal cells is critical for their survival and patterning, and show that Extracellular matrix 1, Ecm1, a gene that in humans causes irritable bowel syndrome and lipoid proteinosis, is a novel RA-regulated target in the developing kidney, which is secreted from the cortical stromal cells surrounding the cap mesenchyme and ureteric bud. Our studies suggest that Ecm1 is required in the ureteric bud for regulating the distribution of Ret which is normally restricted to the tips, as inhibition of Ecm1 results in an expanded domain of Ret expression and reduced numbers of branches. We propose a model in which retinoid signaling in the stroma activates expression of Ecm1, which in turn down-regulates Ret expression in the ureteric bud cleft, where bifurcation normally occurs and normal branching progresses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Flow Cytometry", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "In Situ Hybridization", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microarray Analysis", "Models, Biological", "Morphogenesis", "Oligopeptides", "Stromal Cells", "Ureter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Suneeta S", "Last Name": "Paroly", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Fengwei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lee", "Last Name": "Spraggon", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Merregaert", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Biochemistry, University of Antwerp, Wilrijk, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Ekatherina", "Last Name": "Batourina", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Tycko", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics & Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kai M", "Last Name": "Schmidt-Ott", "Affiliation": "Max-Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine Robert-Roessle-Str.

Fate mapping, however, reveals that intermediate cells rather than K5-BCs are progenitors in the adult regenerating urothelium, that P cells, a transient population, are progenitors in the embryo, and that retinoids are critical in P cells and intermediate cells, respectively, for their specification during development and regeneration.

tail mouse.", "Abstract": "Danforth's short tail mutant (Sd) mouse, first described in 1930, is a classic spontaneous mutant exhibiting defects of the axial skeleton, hindgut, and urogenital system. We used meiotic mapping in 1,497 segregants to localize the mutation to a 42.8-kb intergenic segment on chromosome 2. Resequencing of this region identified an 8.5-kb early retrotransposon (ETn) insertion within the highly conserved regulatory sequences upstream of Pancreas Specific Transcription Factor, 1a (Ptf1a). This mutation resulted in up to tenfold increased expression of Ptf1a as compared to wild-type embryos at E9.5 but no detectable changes in the expression levels of other neighboring genes. At E9.5, Sd mutants exhibit ectopic Ptf1a expression in embryonic progenitors of every organ that will manifest a developmental defect: the notochord, the hindgut, and the mesonephric ducts. Moreover, at E 8.5, Sd mutant mice exhibit ectopic Ptf1a expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, tail bud mesenchyme, and in the notochord, preceding the onset of visible defects such as notochord degeneration. The Sd heterozygote phenotype was not ameliorated by Ptf1a haploinsufficiency, further suggesting that the developmental defects result from ectopic expression of Ptf1a. These data identify disruption of the spatio-temporal pattern of Ptf1a expression as the unifying mechanism underlying the multiple congenital defects in Danforth's short tail mouse. This striking example of an enhancer mutation resulting in profound developmental defects suggests that disruption of conserved regulatory elements may also contribute to human malformation syndromes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Embryonic Development", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Mesoderm", "Mice", "Mutagenesis, Insertional", "Pancreas", "Retroelements", "Spinal Cord", "Tail", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Lugani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ripla", "Last Name": "Arora", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Papeta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ami", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zongyu", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roel", "Last Name": "Sterken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruth A", "Last Name": "Singer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gianluca", "Last Name": "Caridi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lori", "Last Name": "Sussel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Virginia E", "Last Name": "Papaioannou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ali G", "Last Name": "Gharavi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2013"}]
