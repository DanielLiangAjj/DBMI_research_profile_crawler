Sex differences offer insights, with females more protected from DA neurodegeneration. The mammalian vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 and Drosophila ortholog dVGLUT have been implicated as modulators of DA neuron resilience. However, the mechanisms by which VGLUT2/dVGLUT protects DA neurons remain unknown. We discovered DA neuron dVGLUT knockdown increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in a sexually dimorphic manner in response to depolarization or paraquat-induced stress, males being especially affected. DA neuron dVGLUT also reduced ATP biosynthetic burden during depolarization. RNA sequencing of VGLUT+ DA neurons in mice and flies identified candidate genes that we functionally screened to further dissect VGLUT-mediated DA neuron resilience across PD models. We discovered transcription factors modulating dVGLUT-dependent DA neuroprotection and identified dj-1\u03b2 as a regulator of sex-specific DA neuron dVGLUT expression. Overall, VGLUT protects DA neurons from PD-associated degeneration by maintaining mitochondrial health.", "Keywords": ["Drosophila", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "RNAseq", "VGLUT2", "dVGLUT",

increases adult dopamine function, impulsivity, and aggression.", "Abstract": "Sensitive developmental periods shape neural circuits and enable adaptation. However, they also engender vulnerability to factors that can perturb developmental trajectories. An understanding of sensitive period phenomena and mechanisms separate from sensory system development is still lacking, yet critical to understanding disease etiology and risk. The dopamine system is pivotal in controlling and shaping adolescent behaviors, and it undergoes heightened plasticity during that time, such that interference with dopamine signaling can have long-lasting behavioral consequences. Here we sought to gain mechanistic insight into this dopamine-sensitive period and its impact on behavior. In mice, dopamine transporter (DAT) blockade from postnatal (P) day 22 to 41 increases aggression and sensitivity to amphetamine (AMPH) behavioral stimulation in adulthood. Here, we refined this sensitive window to P32-41 and identified increased firing of dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo as a neural correlate to altered adult behavior. Aggression can result from enhanced impulsivity and cognitive dysfunction, and dopamine regulates working memory and motivated behavior. Hence, we assessed these behavioral domains and found that P32-41 DAT blockade increases impulsivity but has no effect on cognition, working memory, or motivation in adulthood. Lastly, using optogenetics to drive dopamine neurons, we find that increased VTA but not SNc dopaminergic activity mimics the increase in impulsive behavior in the Go/NoGo task observed after adolescent DAT blockade. Together our data provide insight into the developmental origins of aggression and impulsivity that may ultimately improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for related neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Dopamine", "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Amphetamine", "Impulsive Behavior", "Aggression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Deepika", "Last Name": "Suri", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giulia", "Last Name": "Zanni", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darshini", "Last Name": "Mahadevia", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nao", "Last Name": "Chuhma", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rinki", "Last Name": "Saha", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Spivack", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicol\u00f2", "Last Name": "Pini", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory S", "Last Name": "Stevens", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "Ziolkowski-Blake", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eleanor H", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Balsam", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Rayport", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark S", "Last Name": "Ansorge", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ma2362@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2023Aug"}, {"PMID": "36867530", "Title": "The dopamine neuron synaptic map in the striatum.", "Abstract": "Dopamine neurons project to the striatum to control movement, cognition, and motivation via slower volume transmission as well as faster dopamine, glutamate, and GABA synaptic actions capable of conveying the temporal information in dopamine neuron firing.

This revealed that inhibitory postsynaptic currents are widespread, while excitatory postsynaptic currents are localized to the medial nucleus accumbens and the anterolateral-dorsal striatum, and that all synaptic actions are weak in the posterior striatum. Synaptic actions in cholinergic interneurons are the strongest, variably mediating inhibition throughout the striatum and excitation in the medial accumbens, capable of controlling their activity.

While DA neurons modulate the activity of striatal (Str) cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) with regional heterogeneity, how AMPH affects ChI activity has not been elucidated. Here, we applied quantitative fluorescence imaging approaches to map the dose-dependent effects of a single dose of AMPH on ChI activity at 2.5 and 24 h after injection across the mouse Str using the activity-dependent marker phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-rpS6240/244). AMPH did not affect the distribution or morphology of ChIs in any Str subregion.

Yet, the functional roles of dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission and their implications for therapeutic use are just emerging. This review article encompasses the current body of evidence investigating the functions of dopamine neurons of the ventral midbrain that cotransmit glutamate. Since its discovery in dopamine neuron cultures, further work in vivo confirmed dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission across species. From there, growing interest has led to research related to neural functioning including roles in synaptic signaling, development, and behavior. Functional connectome mapping reveals robust connections in multiple forebrain regions to various cell types, most notably to cholinergic interneurons in both the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens and the lateral dorsal striatum. Glutamate markers in dopamine neurons reach peak levels during embryonic development and increase in response to various toxins, suggesting dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission may serve neuroprotective roles. Findings from behavioral analyses reveal prominent roles for dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission in responses to psychostimulants, in positive valence and cognitive systems and for subtle roles in negative valence systems. Insight into dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission informs the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, schizophrenia and Parkinson Disease, with therapeutic implications.", "Keywords": ["Parkinson disease", "VGLUT2", "VMAT2", "addiction", "glutaminase", "psychostimulant", "schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": ["Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Glutamic Acid", "Nucleus Accumbens", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Eskenazi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Malave", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Susana", "Last Name": "Mingote", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Leora", "Last Name": "Yetnikoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, College of Staten Island, City University of New York, Staten Island, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samira", "Last Name": "Ztaou", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Vlad", "Last Name": "Velicu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Rayport", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nao", "Last Name": "Chuhma", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neural circuits", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "32950210", "Title": "Vulnerable and Resilient Phenotypes in a Mouse Model of Anorexia Nervosa.", "Abstract": "Increased physical activity is a common feature of anorexia nervosa (AN).

We find that, while inhibition of both glutaminase isoforms (Gls1 and Gls2) in tumours considerably delays tumourigenesis, glutamine catabolism continues, owing to the action of amidotransferases. Synergistic inhibition of both glutaminases and compensatory amidotransferases is required to block glutamine catabolism and proliferation of mouse and human tumour cells in vitro and in vivo. Gls1 deletion is also compensated for by glycolysis. Thus, co-inhibition of Gls1 and hexokinase 2 significantly affects Krebs cycle activity and tumour formation. Finally, the inhibition of biosynthesis of either serine (Psat1-KO) or fatty acid (Fasn-KO) is compensated for by uptake of circulating nutrients, and dietary restriction of both serine and glycine or fatty acids synergistically suppresses tumourigenesis.

In the NAc dorsal medial Shell, all of the DA neuron terminals arise from DA-GLU neurons, while in the lateral NAc Shell, DA neuron terminals arise from both DA-GLU neurons and DA-only neurons, without VGLUT2. DA-GLU neurons make excitatory connections to the three major cells types, spiny projection neurons, fast-spiking interneuron and cholinergic interneurons (ChIs). The strongest DA-GLU neuron excitatory connections are to ChIs. Photostimulation of DA-GLU neuron terminals in the slice drives ChIs to burst fire.

Several studies point to the possibility of visualizing fluctuations in glutamate release by changes in affinity of the mGluR5 radioligand [11C]ABP688. These studies use pharmacological challenges to alter glutamate levels, and so probe release, but have not measured chronic alterations in receptor occupancy due to altered neurotransmission relevant to chronic neuropsychiatric disorders or their treatment. In this regard, the GLS1 heterozygous mouse has known reductions in activity of the glutamate-synthetic enzyme glutaminase, brain glutamate levels and release. We imaged this model to elucidate glutamatergic systems. Dynamic [11C]ABP688 microPET scans were performed for mGluR5. Western blot was used as an ex vivo validation. No significant differences were found in BPND between WT and GLS1 Hets. SPM showed voxel-wise increased in BPND in GLS1 Hets compared to WT consistent with lower synaptic glutamate. This was not due to alterations in mGluR5 levels, as western blot results showed lower mGluR5 levels in GLS1 Hets. We conclude that because of the chronic glutaminase deficiency and subsequent decrease in glutamate, the mGluR5 protein levels are lowered. Due to these decreased endogenous glutamate levels, however, there is increased [11C]ABP688 binding to the allosteric site in selected regions. We speculate that lower endogenous glutamate leads to less conformational change to the receptors, and thus higher availability of the binding site.

Here we show in mice that SSRIs impair motor function by acting on 5-HT2C receptors in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), which in turn inhibits nigra pars compacta (SNc) DAergic neurons. SSRI-induced motor deficits can be reversed by systemic or SNr-localized 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. SSRIs induce SNr hyperactivity and SNc hypoactivity that can also be reversed by systemic 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. Optogenetic inhibition of SNc DAergic neurons mimics the motor deficits due to chronic SSRI treatment, whereas local SNr 5-HT2C receptor antagonism or optogenetic activation of SNc DAergic neurons reverse SSRI-induced motor deficits. Lastly, we find that 5-HT2C receptor antagonism potentiates the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of SSRIs.

Strikingly, mice deficient in the glutamate synthetic enzyme glutaminase have CA1 hypoactivity and a SCZ-resilience profile, implicating glutamate-metabolizing enzymes. To address this further, we examined mice with a brain-wide deficit in the glutamate-metabolizing enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), encoded by Glud1, which should lead to glutamate excess due to reduced glutamate metabolism in astrocytes. We found that Glud1-deficient mice have behavioral abnormalities in the 3 SCZ symptom domains, with increased baseline and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion as a positive symptom proxy, nest building and social preference as a negative symptom proxy, and reversal/extradimensional set shifting in the water T-maze and contextual fear conditioning as a cognitive symptom proxy. Neuroimaging of cerebral blood volume revealed hippocampal hyperactivity in CA1, which was associated with volume reduction. Parameters of hippocampal synaptic function revealed excess glutamate release and an elevated excitatory/inhibitory balance in CA1. Finally, in a direct clinical correlation using imaging-guided microarray, we found a significant SCZ-associated postmortem reduction in GLUD1 expression in CA1.

Optogenetic studies have revealed that dopamine neurons release dopamine in a synaptic signal mode, and that the neurons also release glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid as cotransmitters, with striking regional variation. Fast glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid cotransmission convey discrete patterns of dopamine neuron activity to striatal neurons.

Here for the first time, we have implemented this strategy to address the potential therapeutic value of a glutamate-based pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia involving inhibition of the glutamate recycling enzyme phosphate-activated glutaminase. Mice constitutively heterozygous for GLS1, the gene encoding glutaminase, manifest a schizophrenia resilience phenotype, a key dimension of which is an attenuated locomotor response to propsychotic amphetamine challenge. If resilience is due to glutaminase deficiency in adulthood, then glutaminase inhibitors should have therapeutic potential. However, this has been difficult to test given the dearth of neuroactive glutaminase inhibitors. So, we used genetic pharmacotherapy to ask whether adult induction of GLS1 heterozygosity would attenuate amphetamine responsiveness. We generated conditional floxGLS1 mice and crossed them with global CAG(ERT2cre\u2215+) mice to produce GLS1 iHET mice, susceptible to tamoxifen induction of GLS1 heterozygosity. One month after tamoxifen treatment of adult GLS1 iHET mice, we found a 50% reduction in GLS1 allelic abundance and glutaminase mRNA levels in the brain. While GLS1 iHET mice showed some recombination prior to tamoxifen, there was no impact on mRNA levels. We then asked whether induction of GLS heterozygosity would attenuate the locomotor response to propsychotic amphetamine challenge. Before tamoxifen, control and GLS1 iHET mice did not differ in their response to amphetamine. One month after tamoxifen treatment, amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was blocked in GLS1 iHET mice. The block was largely maintained after 5 months. Thus, a genetically induced glutaminase reduction-mimicking pharmacological inhibition-strongly attenuated the response to a propsychotic challenge, suggesting that glutaminase may be a novel target for the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. These results demonstrate how genetic pharmacotherapy can be implemented to test a CNS target in advance of the development of specific neuroactive inhibitors.

To visualize dopamine neuron forebrain projections and to enable photostimulation of their axons independent of transmitter status, we virally transfected VTA neurons with channelrhodopsin-2 fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-EYFP) and used DAT(IREScre) mice to restrict expression to dopamine neurons. ChR2-EYFP-expressing neurons almost invariably stained for tyrosine hydroxylase, identifying them as dopaminergic. Dopamine neuron axons visualized by ChR2-EYFP fluorescence projected most densely to the striatum, moderately to the amygdala and entorhinal cortex (ERC), sparsely to prefrontal and cingulate cortices, and rarely to the hippocampus. Guided by ChR2-EYFP fluorescence, we recorded systematically from putative principal neurons in target areas and determined the incidence and strength of glutamatergic connections by activating all dopamine neuron terminals impinging on recorded neurons with wide-field photostimulation. This revealed strong glutamatergic connections in the NAc, OT, and ERC; moderate strength connections in the central amygdala; and weak connections in the cingulate cortex. No glutamatergic connections were found in the dorsal striatum, hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, or prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that VTA dopamine neurons elicit widespread, but regionally distinct, glutamatergic signals in the forebrain and begin to define the dopamine neuron excitatory functional connectome.", "Keywords": ["cotransmission", "entorhinal cortex", "glutamate", "nucleus accumbens", "optogenetics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Channelrhodopsins", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Female", "Glutamic Acid", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nerve Net", "Neural Pathways", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Phosphopyruvate Hydratase", "Prosencephalon", "Transduction, Genetic", "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase", "Ventral Tegmental Area"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Susana", "Last Name": "Mingote", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, and Department of Molecular Therapeutics, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Nao", "Last Name": "Chuhma", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, and Department of Molecular Therapeutics, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Sheila V", "Last Name": "Kusnoor", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232."}, {"First Name": "Bianca", "Last Name": "Field", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, and Department of Molecular Therapeutics, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Ariel Y", "Last Name": "Deutch", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Rayport", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, and Department of Molecular Therapeutics, NYS Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, and stephen.rayport@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2015Dec09"}, {"PMID": "26390244", "Title": "Metabolic reprogramming induces resistance to anti-NOTCH1 therapies in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.", "Abstract": "Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are common in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

In mice harboring P493 tumor xenografts, BPTES treatment inhibited tumor cell growth; however, P493 xenografts expressing a BPTES-resistant GLS mutant (GLS-K325A) or overexpressing GLS were not affected by BPTES treatment. Moreover, a customized Vivo-Morpholino that targets human GLS mRNA markedly inhibited P493 xenograft growth without affecting mouse Gls expression.

Dopamine neurons drive a burst-pause firing sequence in cholinergic interneurons in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, mixed actions in the accumbens core, and a pause in the dorsal striatum. This heterogeneity is due mainly to regional variation in dopamine-neuron glutamate cotransmission.

We have found a remarkable anatomical plasticity in the basal ganglia of adult mice that is regulated by dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs). By modulating neuronal excitability, striatal D2Rs bidirectionally control the density of direct pathway collaterals in the globus pallidus that bridge the direct pathway with the functionally opposing indirect pathway. An increase in bridging collaterals is associated with enhanced inhibition of pallidal neurons in vivo and disrupted locomotor activation after optogenetic stimulation of the direct pathway. Chronic blockade with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia, decreases the extent of bridging collaterals and rescues the locomotor imbalance.
