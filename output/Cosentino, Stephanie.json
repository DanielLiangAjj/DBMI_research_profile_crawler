These advances have highlighted the need to adapt ingrained notions of these clinical syndromes to include both the full phenotypic continuum - from clinically silent, to prodromal, to clinically manifest - and the expanded phenotypic spectrum that includes ALS, frontotemporal dementia and some movement disorders. The updated clinical paradigms should also align with our understanding of the biology of these disorders, reflected in measurable biomarkers. The Miami Framework, emerging from discussions at the Second International Pre-Symptomatic ALS Workshop in Miami (February 2023; a full list of attendees and their affiliations appears in the Supplementary Information) proposes a classification system built on: first, three parallel phenotypic axes - motor neuron, frontotemporal and extrapyramidal - rather than the unitary approach of combining all phenotypic elements into a single clinical entity; and second, biomarkers that reflect different aspects of the underlying pathology and biology of neurodegeneration. This framework decouples clinical syndromes from biomarker evidence of disease and builds on experiences from other neurodegenerative diseases to offer a unified approach to specifying the pleiotropic clinical manifestations of disease and describing the trajectory of emergent biomarkers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Phenotype", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Biomarkers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Benatar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA. mbenatar@miami.edu."}, {"First Name": "Joanne", "Last Name": "Wuu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward D", "Last Name": "Huey", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Corey T", "Last Name": "McMillan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald C", "Last Name": "Petersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Postuma", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "McHutchison", "Affiliation": "Human Cognitive Neuroscience, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}, {"First Name": "Laynie", "Last Name": "Dratch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jalayne J", "Last Name": "Arias", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Policy & Behavioral Sciences, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anita", "Last Name": "Crawley", "Affiliation": ", Buffalo, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Houlden", "Affiliation": "UCL Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xueya", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "ALS Association, Arlington, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Boxer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bradley F", "Last Name": "Boeve", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Penny", "Last Name": "Dacks", "Affiliation": "Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, King of Prussia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Abrahams", "Affiliation": "Human Cognitive Neuroscience, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Shneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Lingor", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Klinikum rechts der Isar der Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Shefner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter M", "Last Name": "Andersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Science, Neurosciences, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Ammar", "Last Name": "Al-Chalabi", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Martin R", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Attendees of the Second International Pre-Symptomatic ALS Workshop", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

Although it is often regarded as a personal health concern, most individuals with SCD do not seek help from a health care professional. Help-seeking (HS) is a complex, individualized process with significant life-course implications, and older adults often face several barriers to HS across personal, socioeconomic, and cultural domains. The pandemic exacerbated these barriers by imposing additional limitations on in-person care. In response, virtual assessment became a popular method to conduct remote care. We provide a narrative review of the challenges and triumphs that came with the transition from in-person, pen-paper cognitive assessments to virtual cognitive assessments. In addition, we address the impact virtual assessment had in tackling barriers that previously limited individuals with SCD from formal HS. We argue that virtual cognitive assessment helps alleviate health access barriers to HS (e.g., cost, transportation, and physician availability) and allows individuals with different coping styles to undergo assessment within more convenient environments. We hope the findings presented in this review inform health care practice, public education, and future research targeted towards the use of virtual assessment to facilitate HS in older adults with SCD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Aged", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Alzheimer Disease"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael R", "Last Name": "Kann", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, G.H.

The current paper presents a subset of data from the FTD Insights Survey, chronicling the diagnostic journey, symptoms, and the impact of FTD on distress, quality of life, and independence, in the mild to moderate stages of the disease. Survey respondents included 219 individuals diagnosed with FTD and 437 current care partners, representing a range of FTD diagnoses. Around half of survey respondents reported seeing three or more doctors before an FTD diagnosis was given, and a range of prior diagnoses were noted. Most frequently endorsed symptoms tended to be consistent with clinical characteristics of the specific diagnosis, though there was significant variability in symptoms reported within diagnostic categories as well as considerable overlap in symptoms between diagnostic categories. Cognitive and language symptoms of FTD were generally most distressing to the person diagnosed, and a loss of independence was endorsed as affecting quality of life. The distinct perspectives of diagnosed persons and care partners regarding disease impact differed notably for bvFTD/Pick's disease. Participating independently in a range of activities, within the home, outside the home, and with other people, were reported as challenging for people living with FTD, underscoring the degree to which the lives of these individuals are affected even at the mild and moderate stages of disease.

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are two broad, brief measures that are widely used to monitor cognitive impairment in various neurological disorders. We sought to determine the relative ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline in elderly patients with ET. Methods We administered a neuropsychological battery to an ET cohort every 18\u2009months over 4.5\u2009years. We defined the gold standard for change in cognition as the change in neuropsychological test scores over consecutive evaluations and applied the Reliable Change Method to detect meaningful increases/decreases in test scores. We performed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to quantify the area under the curve (AUC) and compare the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline. Results The AUCs for the MoCA and the MMSE did not differ significantly at any interval or when all intervals were pooled for analysis. Across all intervals, the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline was consistently fair or poor. Conclusions We found that the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline in ET patients over 18-month intervals is inadequate. Unchanged scores on the MoCA and the MMSE in ET over time should be approached with caution.

As part of our analysis, we consider questions surrounding ET diagnosis and the possibility of comorbid disease as potential factors that, upon closer examination, appear to strengthen the argument in favor of ET as a risk factor for dementia. Importantly, we also consider the clinical relevance of cognitive impairment in ET. While ET is not universally characterized by significant cognitive deficits, the data from epidemiological, cognitive, neuroimaging, and postmortem neuropathologic studies converge to reveal an increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia among individuals with ET.

Since motor neuron degeneration is incremental and cumulative over time, it stands to reason that the clinical syndrome of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is probably preceded by a prodromal state characterized by minor motor abnormalities that are initially insufficient to permit a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This prodromal period, however, is usually missed, given the invariably long delays between symptom onset and diagnostic evaluation. The Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS Study, a cohort study of pre-symptomatic gene mutation carriers, offers a unique opportunity to observe what is typically unseen. Here we describe the clinical characterization of 20 pre-symptomatic mutation carriers (in SOD1, FUS and C9orf72) whose phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease has been prospectively studied. In so doing, we observed a prodromal phase of mild motor impairment in 11 of 20 phenoconverters. Among the n = 12 SOD1 A4V mutation carriers, phenoconversion was characterized by abrupt onset of weakness, with a short (1-3.5 months) prodromal period observable in a small minority (n = 3); the observable prodrome invariably involved the lower motor neuron axis. By contrast, in all n = 3 SOD1 I113T mutation carriers, diffuse lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron signs evolved insidiously during a prodromal period that extended over a period of many years; prodromal manifestations eventually coalesced into a clinical syndrome that is recognizable as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Similarly, in all n = 3 C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation carriers, focal or multifocal manifestations of disease evolved gradually over a prodromal period of 1-2 years. Clinically manifest ALS also emerged following a prodromal period of mild motor impairment, lasting >4 years and \u223c9 months, respectively, in n = 2 with other gene mutations (SOD1 L106V and FUS c.521del6). On the basis of this empirical evidence, we conclude that mild motor impairment is an observable state that precedes clinically manifest disease in three of the most common genetic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD1, FUS, C9orf72), and perhaps in all genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; we also propose that this might be true of non-genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As a diagnostic label, mild motor impairment provides the language to describe the indeterminate (and sometimes intermediate) transition between the unaffected state and clinically manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recognizing mild motor impairment as a distinct clinical entity should generate fresh urgency for developing biomarkers reflecting the earliest events in the degenerative cascade, with potential to reduce the diagnostic delay and to permit earlier therapeutic intervention.", "Keywords": ["phenoconversion", "pre-symptomatic", "prodromal disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "C9orf72 Protein", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Superoxide Dismutase-1", "Cohort Studies", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Motor Disorders", "Mutation", "Biomarkers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Benatar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Volkan", "Last Name": "Granit", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter M", "Last Name": "Andersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Science, Neurosciences, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Laure", "Last Name": "Grignon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "McHutchison", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Malaspina", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Joanne", "Last Name": "Wuu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2022Oct21"}, {"PMID": "35466941", "Title": "The Boston Process Approach and Digital Neuropsychological Assessment: Past Research and Future Directions.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychological assessment using the Boston Process Approach (BPA) suggests that an analysis of the strategy or the process by which tasks and neuropsychological tests are completed, and the errors made during test completion convey much information regarding underlying brain and cognition and are as important as overall summary scores.

Nonetheless, BPA methods can be labor intensive to deploy. However, the recent availability of digital platforms for neuropsychological test administration and scoring now enables reliable, rapid, and objective data collection. Further, digital technology can quantify highly nuanced data previously unobtainable to define neurocognitive constructs with high accuracy. In this paper, a brief review of the BPA is provided. Studies that demonstrate how digital technology translates BPA into specific neurocognitive constructs using the Clock Drawing Test, Backward Digit Span Test, and a Digital Pointing Span Test are described. Implications for using data driven artificial intelligence-supported analytic approaches enabling the creation of more sensitive and specific detection/diagnostic algorithms for putative neurodegenerative illness are also discussed.", "Keywords": ["Backward digit span test", "Boston Process Approach", "clock drawing test", "cognitive vital signs", "digit span test", "digital assessment", "digital neuropsychological assessment"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Artificial Intelligence", "Boston", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Libon", "Affiliation": "New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging, Rowan University, School of Osteopathic Medicine, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rod", "Last Name": "Swenson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Lamar", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center and the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine C", "Last Name": "Price", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ganesh", "Last Name": "Baliga", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alvaro", "Last Name": "Pascual-Leone", "Affiliation": "Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research and Deanna and Sidney Wolk Center for Memory Health, Hebrew Senior Life, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rhoda", "Last Name": "Au", "Affiliation": "Departments of Anatomy & Neurobiology and Neurology; Framingham Heart Study, Slone Epidemiology Center and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute and Sergievsky Center, Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stacy L", "Last Name": "Andersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35421780", "Title": "Depressive symptoms predict memory decline in Essential Tremor.", "Abstract": "Essential tremor (ET), a common movement disorder, is characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms.

However, the neuroanatomical basis of emotional symptoms is not well defined; this stands in contrast to the relatively well-understood neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive and motor symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, psychiatric diagnostic categories, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), may have limited applicability in patients with late-onset psychiatric symptoms in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. In this clinical review, we suggest that early-onset and late-onset psychiatric symptoms have distinct etiologies, and that late-onset changes in emotional processing are likely underpinned by neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, we suggest that an improved understanding of the neuroanatomical correlates of emotional changes in neurodegenerative disease may facilitate diagnosis and future treatment development. Finally, we propose a novel clinical approach, in a preliminary attempt to incorporate late-onset emotional symptoms alongside cognitive and motor symptoms into a clinical \"algorithm,\" with a focus on the neuroanatomy implicated when particular combinations of emotional, cognitive, and motor features are present.

Thus, we sought to develop and validate a proposed set of research criteria for prodromal bvFTD, termed 'mild behavioural and/or cognitive impairment in bvFTD' (MBCI-FTD). Participants included 72 participants deemed to have prodromal bvFTD; this comprised 55 carriers of a pathogenic mutation known to cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and 17 individuals with autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration. All had mild behavioural and/or cognitive changes, as judged by an evaluating clinician. Based on extensive clinical workup, the prodromal bvFTD group was divided into a Development Group (n\u2009=\u200922) and a Validation Group (n\u2009=\u200950). The Development Group was selected to be the subset of the prodromal bvFTD group for whom we had the strongest longitudinal evidence of conversion to bvFTD, and was used to develop the MBCI-FTD criteria. The Validation Group was the remainder of the prodromal bvFTD group and was used as a separate sample on which to validate the criteria. Familial non-carriers were included as healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009165). The frequencies of behavioural and neuropsychiatric features, neuropsychological deficits, and social cognitive dysfunction in the prodromal bvFTD Development Group and healthy controls were assessed. Based on sensitivity and specificity analyses, seven core features were identified: apathy without moderate-severe dysphoria, behavioural disinhibition, irritability/agitation, reduced empathy/sympathy, repetitive behaviours (simple and/or complex), joviality/gregariousness, and appetite changes/hyperorality. Supportive features include a neuropsychological profile of impaired executive function or naming with intact orientation and visuospatial skills, reduced insight for cognitive or behavioural changes, and poor social cognition. Three core features or two core features plus one supportive feature are required for the diagnosis of possible MBCI-FTD; probable MBCI-FTD requires imaging or biomarker evidence, or a pathogenic genetic mutation. The proposed MBCI-FTD criteria correctly classified 95% of the prodromal bvFTD Development Group, and 74% of the prodromal bvFTD Validation Group, with a false positive rate of <10% in healthy controls. Finally, the MBCI-FTD criteria were tested on a cohort of individuals with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and the false positive rate of diagnosis was 11-16%. Future research will need to refine the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria, and incorporate emerging biomarker evidence.", "Keywords": ["behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia",

Statistically appropriate criteria for establishing cognitive impairment (CI) in ALS are lacking. We evaluate quantile regression (QR), that accounts for age and education, relative to a traditional two standard deviation (SD) cutoff for defining CI. Methods: QR of cross-sectional data from a multi-center North American Control (NAC) cohort of 269 healthy adults was used to model the 5th percentile of cognitive scores on the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS). The QR approach was compared to traditional two SD cutoff approach using the same NAC cohort (2SD-NAC) and to existing UK-based normative data derived using the 2SD approach (2SD-UK) to assess the impact of cohort selection and statistical model in identifying CI in 182 ALS patients. Results: QR-NAC models revealed that age and education impact cognitive performance on the ECAS. Based on QR-NAC normative cutoffs, the frequency of CI in the 182 PENN ALS patients was 15.9% for ALS specific, 12.6% for ALS nonspecific, and 15.4% for ECAS total. This frequency of CI is substantially more conservative in comparison to the 2SD-UK (20.3%-34.6%) and modestly more conservative to the 2SD-NAC (14.3%-16.5%) approaches for estimating CI. Conclusions: The choice of normative cohort has a substantial impact and choice of statistical method a modest impact on defining CI in ALS.

Although investigators have quantified the prevalence of ET plus in cross-sectional studies, patients with ET plus have not been tracked longitudinally; hence, there is no understanding of its stability over time. Methods: We present prospective, longitudinal phenotypic data on an ET cohort that was followed regularly at 18-month intervals (T1, T2, T3, T4) for up to 64 months. We assigned an ET or ET plus diagnosis to each case at each time interval. Results: There were 201 participants at baseline. The proportion with ET plus increased from 58.7% at baseline to 72.1% at T4 (p = 0.046). Of 172 (85.6%) who received a diagnosis of ET plus at one or more time intervals, the diagnosis was unstable (e.g., with reversion) in 62 (36.0%). We also assessed the stability of the clinical features of ET plus. Rest tremor was the most unstable clinical feature of ET plus; it was present in 59 participants, among whom it reverted from present to absent in 23 (39.0%). By contrast, for \"memory impairment\" (i.e., either mild cognitive impairment or dementia), the proportion who reverted from present to absent was only 21.3%.

While much is still unknown, advances in other neurodegenerative diseases offer valuable insights. Indeed, it is increasingly clear that the well-recognized clinical syndromes of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and frontotemporal dementia are also each preceded by a pre-symptomatic or prodromal period of varying duration, during which the underlying disease process unfolds, with associated compensatory changes and loss of inherent system redundancy. Key insights from these diseases highlight opportunities for discovery in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The development of biomarkers reflecting amyloid and tau has led to a shift in defining Alzheimer's disease based on inferred underlying histopathology. Parkinson's disease is unique among neurodegenerative diseases in the number and diversity of non-genetic biomarkers of pre-symptomatic disease, most notably REM sleep behaviour disorder. Huntington's disease benefits from an ability to predict the likely timing of clinically manifest disease based on age and CAG-repeat length alongside reliable neuroimaging markers of atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy clinical trials have highlighted the transformational value of early therapeutic intervention, and studies in frontotemporal dementia illustrate the differential role of biomarkers based on genotype. Similar advances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would transform our understanding of key events in pathogenesis, thereby dramatically accelerating progress towards disease prevention. Deciphering the biology of pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis relies on a clear conceptual framework for defining the earliest stages of disease. Clinically manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may emerge abruptly, especially among those who harbour genetic mutations associated with rapidly progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the disease may also evolve more gradually, revealing a prodromal period of mild motor impairment preceding phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Similarly, cognitive and behavioural impairment, when present, may emerge gradually, evolving through a prodromal period of mild cognitive impairment or mild behavioural impairment before progression to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Biomarkers are critically important to studying pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and essential to efforts to intervene therapeutically before clinically manifest disease emerges. The use of non-genetic biomarkers, however, presents challenges related to counselling, informed consent, communication of results and limited protections afforded by existing legislation. Experiences from pre-symptomatic genetic testing and counselling, and the legal protections against discrimination based on genetic data, may serve as a guide.

The novel describes a world where oversaturation of external stimulation leads to the perception of mind and body of self of an individual as prosthetic parts, malleable and deformed, wherein the mind fails to feel bodily sensations and characters experience a complete disconnectedness from the self and others. Indeed, the disembodiment of characters and sensations of disconnection leads them to a compulsive quest for connectedness through the use of masks, made-up feelings, mind-body hybrid pain, corporeal malleability, and prostheses. These portrayals of the disordered and disconnectedness between body and mind or self will be described and compared to clinical conditions characterized by a disconnection between mind and body and impaired body self-awareness.

Surprisingly, predictors of cognitive decline in ET remain largely unidentified, as longitudinal studies are rare. In the general population, however, lower physical activity has been linked to cognitive decline. Objectives: To determine whether baseline physical activity level is a predictor of cognitive decline in ET. Methods: One hundred and twenty-seven ET cases (78.1 \u00b1 9.5 years, range = 55-95), enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal study of cognition. At baseline, each completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), a validated, self-rated assessment of physical activity. Cases underwent an extensive battery of motor-free neuropsychological testing at baseline, 1.5 years, and 3 years, which incorporated assessments of cognitive subdomains. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to assess the predictive utility of baseline physical activity for cognitive change. Results: Mean follow-up was 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 years (range = 1.3-3.5). In cross-sectional analyses using baseline data, lower physical activity was associated with lower overall cognitive function as well as lower cognitive scores in numerous cognitive domains (memory, language, executive function, visuospatial function and attention, all p < 0.05). In adjusted GEE models, lower baseline physical activity level significantly predicted overall cognitive decline over time (p=0.047), and declines in the subdomains of memory (p = 0.001) and executive function (p = 0.03). Conclusions: We identified reduced physical activity as a predictor of greater cognitive decline in ET. The identification of risk factors often assists clinicians in determining which patients are at higher risk of cognitive decline over time. Interventional studies, to determine whether increasing physical activity could modify the risk of developing cognitive decline in ET, may be warranted.", "Keywords": ["cerebellar diseases", "cognitive aging", "essential tremor", "movement disorders", "physical activity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Keith H", "Last Name": "Radler", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Chapman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maria Anna", "Last Name": "Zdrodowska", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hollie N", "Last Name": "Dowd", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xinhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edward D", "Last Name": "Huey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34026322", "Title": "Baseline Infection Burden and Cognitive Function in Elders with Essential Tremor.", "Abstract": "Patients with essential tremor (ET) have an increased risk of cognitive impairment, yet little is known about the predictors of cognitive decline in these patients.

In a cohort of mutation carriers with mild behavioral and/or cognitive symptoms consistent with prodromal bvFTD, we aimed to investigate patterns of performance on an abbreviated list learning task, with a particular focus on recognition memory. We further aimed to characterize the cognitive prodromes associated with the three major genetic causes of frontotemporal dementia, as emerging evidence suggests there may be subtle differences in cognitive profiles among carriers of different genetic mutations. Participants included 57 carriers of a pathogenic mutation in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, N\u00a0=\u00a023), or progranulin (GRN, N\u00a0=\u00a015), or a or a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72, N\u00a0=\u00a019), with mild cognitive and/or behavioral symptoms consistent with prodromal bvFTD. Familial non-carriers were included as controls (N\u00a0=\u00a0143). All participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological examination, including an abbreviated list learning test assessing episodic memory recall and recognition. MAPT mutation carriers performed worse than non-carriers in terms of list recall, and had difficulty discriminating targets from distractors on the recognition memory task, primarily due to the endorsement of distractors as targets. MAPT mutation carriers also showed nonverbal episodic memory and semantic memory dysfunction (object naming). GRN mutation carriers were variable in performance and overall the most dysexecutive. Slowed psychomotor speed was evident in C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers. Identifying the earliest cognitive indicators of bvFTD is of critical clinical and research importance. List learning may be a sensitive cognitive marker for incipient dementia in MAPT and potentially a subset of GRN carriers.

Gait and balance impairments in ET are often mild, but they can be severe and are, in some cases, associated with functional sequelae in terms of increased fall risk and reduced balance confidence. Previous research on gait and balance in ET has been limited to cross-sectional comparisons. There have been no longitudinal studies or prospective studies. As such, our understanding of natural history and possible predictors of declines in ET-related gait and balance impairments is incomplete. Objectives: We (1) present natural history data on the change in gait and balance measures over time, (2) provide estimates of annual rate of change in each gait and balance metric, and (3) examine the relationship between baseline clinical predictors and changes in gait and balance over time. Methods: 149 ET participants (mean age 78.7 years), enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal, clinical-pathological study, underwent an extensive evaluation of cognition, tremor, and gait and balance at three distinct intervals performed every 18 months. Gait and balance measures included a combination of performance-based tests (e.g., tandem gait, tandem stance) and self-reported assessments (e.g., number of falls, use of a walking aid). Results: Between the baseline and final assessments, numerous balance and gait measures showed evidence of decline and annual rates of change were quantified for each. We examined the predictive utility of clinical variables at baseline for five gait and balance outcomes, with global cognition and executive function standing out as the most consistent predictors. Conclusions: We present a much-needed look into the course of disease for elderly patients with ET, focusing on changes observed in gait and balance and the predictors of these changes. These results also add another dimension to the relevance of cognitive impairment observed in ET; such impairment can now be viewed as predictive of poorer gait and balance over time in ET. These findings are a useful tool for clinicians, patients, and their families to better understand and plan for changing disease-features over time.", "Keywords": ["Essential Tremor", "balance", "clinical", "gait", "longitudinal"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hollie", "Last Name": "Dowd", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maria Anna", "Last Name": "Zdrodowska", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Keith H", "Last Name": "Radler", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tess E K", "Last Name": "Cersonsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ashwini K", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine (Program in Physical Therapy), Gertrude H.

In this study, we examined the extent to which temporal monitoring or orbitofrontal reality filtering (e.g., ability to monitor the temporal relevance of a memory) and source monitoring (e.g., the ability to distinguish which memories stem from internal as opposed to external sources) are associated with awareness of memory deficits.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Agnosia", "Awareness", "Cognition", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Memory Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reaction Time", "Self Concept", "Stroke", "Time Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Chapman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths University of London."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Section of the Gertrude H.

We used Bayesian model-based clustering to group 5064 participants of the Long Life Family Study (ages 49-110\u00a0years) into clusters characterized by distinct trajectories of cognitive change in the domains of episodic memory, attention, processing speed, and verbal fluency. For each domain, we identified 4 or 5 large clusters with representative patterns of change ranging from rapid decline to exceptionally slow change. We annotated the clusters by their correlation with genetic and molecular biomarkers, non-genetic risk factors, medical history, and other markers of aging to discover correlates of cognitive changes and neuroprotection. The annotation analysis discovered both predictors of multi-domain cognitive change such as gait speed and predictors of domain-specific cognitive change such as IL6 and NTproBNP that correlate only with change of processing speed or APOE genotypes that correlate only with change of processing speed and logical memory. These patterns also suggest that cognitive decline starts at young age and that maintaining good physical function correlates with slower cognitive decline. To better understand the agreement of cognitive changes across multiple domains, we summarized the results of the cluster analysis into a score of cognitive function change. This score showed that extreme patterns of change affecting multiple cognitive domains simultaneously are rare in this study and that specific signatures of biomarkers of inflammation and metabolic disease predict severity of cognitive changes. The substantial heterogeneity of change patterns within and between cognitive domains and the net of correlations between patterns of cognitive aging and other aging traits emphasizes the importance of measuring a wide range of cognitive functions and the need for studying cognitive aging in concert with other aging traits.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Biomarker", "Cognition", "Neuropsychology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Bayes Theorem", "Cognition", "Cognitive Aging", "Humans", "Memory"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Sebastiani", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA, 02118, USA. sebas@bu.edu."}, {"First Name": "Stacy L", "Last Name": "Andersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Geriatrics Section, Boston University School of Medicine, Robinson 2400, 72 E Concord St, Boston, MA, 02118, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Sweigart", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA, 02118, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mengtian", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA, 02118, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, and the Gertrude H.

However, it is unclear if and how older adults with CI modify their activities (i.e., Do individuals continue, monitor, seek help with, change their approach to, or stop different activities?). In the current study, we examined if older adults with CI are concerned about their ability to carry out complex activities, if and how they modify activities based on their concern, and the factors associated with activity modification. We hypothesized that older adults with CI will more frequently be concerned about, and modify, everyday activities than cognitively healthy (HE) older adults, and that higher awareness of memory loss in the CI group would relate to more frequent modification. The sample included 81 older adults (51 HEs; mean age 70.02 (7.34) and 30 CI; mean age 75.97 (8.12)). Compared to HEs, the CI group reported having more concern about, F(3,77) = 5.50, p = 0.02, and modifying a greater number of activities, F(3,77) = 5.02, p = 0.03. Medication management (30%) and completing taxes (33.3%) were among the most frequently modified activities for the CI and HE groups, respectively. In the CI group, higher memory awareness was associated with more concern (r = .53, p = .005) and activity modification (r = 0.55, p = .003). Findings provide novel information about how cognitively diverse older adults navigate complex activities in daily life.

Although in the past it was considered a benign condition, recent research has demonstrated increased risk of mortality. To date, however, no studies have examined predictors of mortality in ET. Methods: In a longitudinal, prospective study of 141 elders with ET, we used Cox proportional-hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for death. Results: The mean baseline age was 81.1 \u00b1 8.8 years. During the follow-up interval, 27 (19.1%) died. Average time from baseline to death was 12.3 \u00b1 8.7 months (range = 0.3-31.2). In univariate Cox regression models, older age (HR = 1.16, p < 0.001), lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (HR = 0.88, p = 0.004), higher Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score (HR = 4.53, p < 0.001), higher score on the Geriatric Depression scale (GDS) (HR = 1.07, p = 0.048), less balance confidence (HR = 0.98, p = 0.006), more falls (HR = 1.11, p = 0.003), and more tandem mis-steps (HR = 1.53, p = 0.004) were associated with increased risk of mortality. In the final multivariate Cox model, older age (HR = 1.14, p = 0.005), higher CDR score (HR = 3.80, p = 0.002) and higher GDS (HR = 1.11, p = 0.01) were independently associated with increased risk of mortality. Conclusions: This study highlights several independent predictors of mortality in elderly ET; clinicians should consider screening for depressive symptoms, assessing cognition and tracking CDR scores, and assessing balance while evaluating patients with ET.", "Keywords": ["cognitive aging", "cognitive impairment", "dementia", "depression", "essential tremor", "mortality"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adeel", "Last Name": "Zubair", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tess E K", "Last Name": "Cersonsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Kellner", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edward D", "Last Name": "Huey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elan D", "Last Name": "Louis", "Affiliation": "Division of Movement Disorders, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "30531365", "Title": "Reduced Awareness of Memory Deficit is Associated With Increased Medicare Home Health Care Use in Dementia.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine whether reduced awareness of memory deficits in individuals with dementia is associated with more frequent need for Medicare home health care services.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Awareness", "Caregivers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia", "Female", "Home Care Services", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Medicare", "Memory Disorders", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brittany", "Last Name": "DeFeis", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and the G.H.

What is the association between sleep and subjective cognitive decline? Cross-sectional design, from two studies of older adults: the WHICAP in the USA and the HELIAD in Greece. A total of 1,576 WHICAP and 1,456 HELIAD participants, without mild cognitive impairment, dementia or severe depression/anxiety, were included. Participants were mostly women, with 12 (WHICAP) and 8 (HELIAD) mean years of education. Sleep problems were estimated using the Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study. Subjective cognitive decline was assessed using a structured complaint questionnaire that queries for subjective memory and other cognitive symptoms. Multinomial or logistic regression models were used to examine whether sleep problems were associated with complaints about general cognition, memory, naming, orientation and calculations. Age, sex, education, sleep medication, use of medications affecting cognition, co-morbidities, depression and anxiety were used as co-variates. Objective cognition was also estimated by summarizing neuropsychological performance into composite z-scores. Sleep problems were associated with two or more complaints: WHICAP: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001; HELIAD: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.83), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001. Sleep problems were associated with complaints in all the cognitive subcategories, except orientation for the WHICAP. The associations were noted regardless of objective cognition.

The current study examined this question by analyzing the relationship between anosognosia for memory loss, memory monitoring, and motor monitoring in 35 individuals with mild to moderate AD. Anosognosia was assessed via clinical interview before participants completed a metamemory task to measure memory monitoring, and a computerized agency task to measure motor monitoring. Cognitive and psychological measures included memory, executive functions, and mood. Memory monitoring was associated with motor monitoring; however, anosognosia was associated only with memory monitoring, and not motor monitoring. Cognition and mood related differently to each measure of self-awareness.

To examine the extent to which SM is associated with subjective perceptions of health more broadly, the current study investigated the link between SM and subjective physical functioning (independent of depressive affect, and objective cognitive and physical function) in an ethnically diverse sample of 471 older adults enrolled in the population-based Northern Manhattan Aging Project. 199 (42%) participants endorsed no difficulty on a 5-point SM index while 272 (58%) endorsed some degree of difficulty. As hypothesized, SM correlated with both depression and subjective physical function, but not with age, education, global cognition, or objective physical function. When objective and subjective physical function were entered in two separate, adjusted linear regressions predicting SM, only subjective physical function and depressive affect independently predicted SM.

There is a high prevalence of embarrassment among individuals with ET, which may be a result of the outwardly visible nature of tremor. Studies in populations with outwardly visible disability have shown that perception by caregivers of a care-recipient's social distress can contribute to caregiver burden. We hypothesize that in ET, perception by caregivers of ET participant embarrassment is a predictor for caregiver burden. Data were collected from 57 ET participants and their caregivers. We measured ET participant embarrassment using the Essential Tremor Embarrassment Assessment (ETEA), and measured perception by caregivers of ET participant embarrassment using a modified version of the ETEA. The Zarit Burden Interview was used to measure caregiver burden. Perceived embarrassment was associated with ET participant embarrassment. In linear regression models, perceived embarrassment was a stronger predictor for caregiver burden than measures of ET participant cognitive and physical impairment.

The metacognitive errors which characterize anosognosia in AD, however, have not been fully articulated. The current study examined metamemory performance as a function of clinically defined awareness groups using different task conditions to examine the extent to which specific metacognitive deficits (i.e., detecting, integrating, or being explicitly aware of errors) contribute to anosognosia in AD (n\u00a0=\u00a049).

It is well-known that education has a protective role against dementia in individuals without a pre-existing neurologic disorder, but evidence regarding the maintenance of this effect during the premotor and motor phases of ET is unknown. Our aim was to determine the influence of education on the risk of dementia in a population-based cohort of ET patients and controls. In a prospective study (Neurological Disorders in Central Spain), participants \u226565 years old were evaluated twice: at baseline (1994-1995) and at follow-up (1997-1998). There were 3 groups: premotor (i.e., participants first diagnosed with incident ET at follow-up), prevalent ET (i.e., participants diagnosed with ET at baseline and at follow-up), and controls. Participants were stratified into lower education (\u2264primary studies) versus higher education (\u2265secondary studies) categories. Dementia risk was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards models (higher education control group = reference category). Among the participants, 3878 had a mean duration of follow-up of 3.2 years. Eight (16.7%) of 48 lower education premotor ET patients developed incident dementia versus 1 (3.3%) of 30 higher education premotor ET patients, 9 (7.1%) of 126 lower education prevalent ET patients, 7 (8.8%) of 80 higher education prevalent ET patients, and 92 (4.9%) of 1892 lower education controls (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). In comparison to the higher education controls, the adjusted hazard ratios for incident dementia were 5.84 (lower education premotor ET, P\u200a<\u200a0.001); 1.36 (higher education premotor ET, P = 0.76); 2.13 (lower education prevalent ET, P = 0.04); 2.79 (higher education prevalent ET, P = 0.01); and 1.66 (lower education controls, P = 0.01).

In 1994 we described an Irish-American family with frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17 associated with extensive tau pathology. We named this disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex. We subsequently identified mutations in the MAPT gene. Eleven MAPT gene splice site stem loop mutations were identified over time except for 5' splice site of exon 10. We recently identified another Irish family with autosomal dominant early amnesia and behavioural change or parkinsonism associated with the 'missing' +15 mutation at the intronic boundary of exon 10. We performed a clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging study on the proband and four siblings, including two affected siblings. We sequenced MAPT and performed segregation analysis. We looked for a biological effect of the tau variant by performing real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of RNA extracted from human embryonic kidney cells transfected with exon trapping constructs. We found a c.915+15A>C exon 10/intron 10 stem loop mutation in all affected subjects but not in the unaffected. The c.915+15A>C variant caused a shift in tau splicing pattern to a predominantly exon 10+ pattern presumably resulting in predominant 4 repeat tau and little 3 repeat tau. This strongly suggests that the c.915+15A>C variant is a mutation and that it causes frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17 in this pedigree by shifting tau transcription and translation to +4 repeat tau. Tau (MAPT) screening should be considered in families where amnesia or atypical parkinsonism coexists with behavioural disturbance early in the disease process. We describe the final missing stem loop tau mutation predicted 15 years ago. Mutations have now been identified at all predicted sites within the 'stem' when the stem-loop model was first proposed and no mutations have been found within the 'loop' region as expected. Therefore we 'close the tau loop' having 'opened the loop' 21 years ago.", "Keywords": ["FTDP-17", "MAPT", "dementia", "frontotemporal", "stem loop"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Family Health", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation, Missense", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Allan", "Last Name": "McCarthy", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Roisin", "Last Name": "Lonergan", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Diana A", "Last Name": "Olszewska", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "O'Dowd", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Gemma", "Last Name": "Cummins", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Centre for Brain Repair, Forvie Site, Robinson Way, Cambridge, CB2 0PY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Magennis", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Emer M", "Last Name": "Fallon", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Niall", "Last Name": "Pender", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Psychology, Beaumont Hospital, Beaumont Rd, Dublin 9, Ireland, Department of Psychology, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Edward D", "Last Name": "Huey", "Affiliation": "4 Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, University Medical Centre, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "5 Cognitive Neuroscience Section, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Centre, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Killian", "Last Name": "O'Rourke", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Brendan D", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "6 Department of Psychiatry, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 63 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "O'Connell", "Affiliation": "7 Department of Radiology, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, North Circular Road, Dublin 7, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Delon", "Affiliation": "8 Medical Genetics Service, Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Addenbrooke's Treatment Centre, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Farrell", "Affiliation": "9 Department of Neuropathology, Beaumont Hospital, Beaumont Road, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Maria Grazia", "Last Name": "Spillantini", "Affiliation": "10 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Clifford Allbutt Building, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Lewis P", "Last Name": "Rowland", "Affiliation": "11 The Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032-3784, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Fahn", "Affiliation": "11 The Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032-3784, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Craig", "Affiliation": "12 Eli Lilly, Erl Wood Manor, Windlesham, Surrey, GU20 6PH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Hutton", "Affiliation": "12 Eli Lilly, Erl Wood Manor, Windlesham, Surrey, GU20 6PH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "1 The Dublin Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, 57 Eccles Street, Dublin 7, Ireland tlynch@dni.ie."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "26049091", "Title": "The right insula contributes to memory awareness in cognitively diverse older adults.", "Abstract": "Unawareness of memory loss is a challenging characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related neurodegenerative conditions at their earliest stages, adversely affecting important outcomes such as patient decision making and safety.

The subjectivity of traditional measurements of self-awareness in dementia has likely limited the rigor with which its neuroanatomic correlates can be established. Here we objectively measure memory awareness (metamemory) using a Feeling of Knowing (FOK) task in a group of cognitively diverse older adults, including 14 with mild AD and 20 cognitively healthy older adults. Performance on the metamemory task was examined in relation to the structural integrity of 14 bilateral neuroanatomic regions hypothesized to support self-awareness.

Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate an association between ET (particularly with onset after age 65) and increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. Although existing studies have generally conceptualized cognitive changes in ET as consistent with a 'frontosubcortical' or 'corticocerebellar' profile, results from these same studies suggest that cognitive impairment in ET may in fact be heterogeneous. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Cognitive changes could be a byproduct of the cerebellar dysfunction of ET itself; alternately, they may be a feature of concomitant neurodegenerative diseases that have been associated in several studies with ET, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy. While the study of cognitive dysfunction in ET has received research attention in recent years, the results of these studies have not been translated into the clinical domain and clinical practice. This review first summarizes the current literature on the potential relationships between ET and cognitive change. We then suggest areas of further clinical evaluation and treatment; these suggestions are directed at physicians caring for ET patients who may demonstrate or complain of cognitive impairment. As we discuss, clinicians should ideally screen ET patients for possible signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment in addition to assessing for psychiatric comorbidity and quality of life. These recommendations are in contrast to most current clinical practice, which does not routinely include such assessment among ET patients. To our knowledge, there have been no pharmacotherapeutic trials to date of any agent for cognitive change associated with ET. We believe that studies for this indication are now called for. Future efforts in this direction will also need to take into account the pathobiology of cognitive changes in ET, which itself is an area that is ripe for future investigations.", "Keywords": ["clinical", "cognition", "essential tremor"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah C", "Last Name": "Janicki", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, G.H.
