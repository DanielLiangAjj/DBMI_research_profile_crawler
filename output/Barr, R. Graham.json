[{"PMID": "38935874", "Title": "Dysanapsis Genetic Risk Predicts Lung Function Across the Lifespan.", "Abstract": "Rationale Dysanapsis refers to a mismatch between airway tree caliber and lung size arising early in life. Dysanapsis assessed by computed tomography (CT) is evident by early adulthood and associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk later in life. Objective By examining the genetic factors associated with CT-assessed dysanapsis, we aimed to elucidate its molecular underpinnings and physiological significance across the lifespan. Methods We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CT-assessed dysanapsis in 11,951 adults, including individuals from two population-based and two COPD-enriched studies. We applied colocalization analysis to integrate GWAS and gene expression data from whole blood and lung. Genetic variants associated with dysanapsis were combined into a genetic risk score that was applied to examine association with lung function in children from a population-based birth cohort (n=1,278) and adults from the UK Biobank (n=369,157). Measurements and Main Results CT-assessed dysanapsis was associated with genetic variants from 21 independent signals in 19 gene regions, implicating HHIP, DSP, and NPNT as potential molecular targets based on colocalization of their expression. Higher dysanapsis genetic risk score was associated with obstructive spirometry among 5 year old children and among adults in the 5th, 6th and 7th decades of life. Conclusions CT-assessed dysanapsis is associated with variation in genes previously implicated in lung development and dysanapsis genetic risk is associated with obstructive lung function from early life through older adulthood. Dysanapsis may represent an endo-phenotype link between the genetic variations associated with lung function and COPD.", "Keywords": ["COPD", "airflow obstruction", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "lung growth &amp;

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the relationships with vascular and airway pathophysiology remain unclear. Objectives: We sought to determine if indices of peripheral (segmental and beyond) pulmonary arterial dilation measured on computed tomography (CT) are associated with a 1-year index of emphysema (EI; percentage of voxels <-950 Hounsfield units) progression. Methods: Five hundred ninety-nine former and never-smokers (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages 0-3) were evaluated from the SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study) cohort: rapid emphysema progressors (RPs; n\u2009=\u2009188, 1-year \u0394EI\u2009>\u20091%), nonprogressors (n\u2009=\u2009301, 1-year \u0394EI\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5%), and never-smokers (n\u2009=\u2009110). Segmental pulmonary arterial cross-sectional areas were standardized to associated airway luminal areas (segmental pulmonary artery-to-airway ratio [PAARseg]). Full-inspiratory CT scan-derived total (arteries and veins) pulmonary vascular volume (TPVV) was compared with small vessel volume (radius smaller than 0.75\u2009mm). Ratios of airway to lung volume (an index of dysanapsis and COPD risk) were compared with ratios of TPVV to lung volume. Results: Compared with nonprogressors, RPs exhibited significantly larger PAARseg (0.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29 vs. 0.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23; P\u2009=\u20090.001), lower ratios of TPVV to lung volume (3.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42% vs. 3.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38%; P\u2009=\u20095.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-12), lower ratios of airway to lung volume (0.031\u2009\u00b1\u20090.003 vs. 0.034\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004; P\u2009=\u20096.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-13), and larger ratios of small vessel volume to TPVV (37.91\u2009\u00b1\u20094.26% vs. 35.53\u2009\u00b1\u20094.89%; P\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). In adjusted analyses, an increment of 1 standard deviation in PAARseg was associated with a 98.4% higher rate of severe exacerbations (95% confidence interval, 29-206%; P\u2009=\u20090.002) and 79.3% higher odds of being in the RP group (95% confidence interval, 24-157%; P\u2009=\u20090.001). At 2-year follow-up, the CT-defined RP group demonstrated a significant decline in postbronchodilator percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009second.

We investigated whether airway tree caliber heterogeneity was associated with airflow obstruction and COPD. Two community-based cohorts (MESA Lung, CanCOLD) and a longitudinal case-control study of COPD (SPIROMICS) performed spirometry and computed tomography measurements of airway lumen diameters at standard anatomical locations (trachea-to-subsegments) and total lung volume. Percent-predicted airway lumen diameters were calculated using sex-specific reference equations accounting for age, height, and lung volume. The association of airway tree caliber heterogeneity, quantified as the standard deviation (SD) of percent-predicted airway lumen diameters, with baseline forced expired volume in 1-second (FEV1), FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) and COPD, as well as longitudinal spirometry, were assessed using regression models adjusted for age, sex, height, race-ethnicity, and mean airway tree caliber.

Observations in CanCOLD and SPIROMICS were consistent. Among older adults, airway tree caliber heterogeneity was associated with airflow obstruction and COPD at baseline but was not associated with longitudinal changes in spirometry.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, by leveraging two community-based samples and a case-control study of heavy smokers, we show that among older adults, airway tree caliber heterogeneity quantified by CT is associated with airflow obstruction and COPD independent of age, sex, height, race-ethnicity, and dysanapsis.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood in patients, in part because of the inaccessibility of the pulmonary vasculature. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) interact with the pulmonary endothelium. Objectives: To test the association between gene expression in PBMCs and pulmonary microvascular perfusion in COPD. Methods: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study recruited two independent samples of COPD cases and controls with \u2a7e10 pack-years of smoking history. In both samples, pulmonary microvascular blood flow, pulmonary microvascular blood volume, and mean transit time were assessed on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and PBMC gene expression was assessed by microarray. Additional replication was performed in a third sample with pulmonary microvascular blood volume measures on contrast-enhanced dual-energy computed tomography. Differential expression analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, height, weight, smoking status, and pack-years of smoking. Results: The 79 participants in the discovery sample had a mean age of 69\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u2009years, 44% were female, 25% were non-White, 34% were current smokers, and 66% had COPD.

Many of the identified genes are involved in inflammatory processes, including nuclear factor-\u03baB and chemokine signaling pathways.

Objectives: We hypothesized that smaller airway caliber would be associated with emphysema progression and would increase susceptibility to air pollutant-associated emphysema progression. Methods: MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) is a general population cohort of adults 45-84\u2009years old from six U.S. communities. Airway tree caliber was quantified as the mean of airway lumen diameters measured from baseline cardiac computed tomography (CT) (2000-2002). Percentage emphysema, defined as percentage of lung pixels below -950 Hounsfield units, was assessed up to five times per participant via cardiac CT scan (2000-2007) and equivalent regions on lung CT scan (2010-2018). Long-term outdoor air pollutant concentrations (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u2a7d2.5 \u03bcm, oxides of nitrogen, and ozone) were estimated at the residential address with validated spatiotemporal models. Linear mixed models estimated the association between airway tree caliber and emphysema progression; modification of pollutant-associated emphysema progression was assessed using multiplicative interaction terms.

In adjusted analyses, 10-year emphysema progression rate was 0.75 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.96%) higher in the smallest compared with largest airway tree caliber quartile.

The interpretation of age iQTLs, however, warrants caution because the moderation effect of age on the genotype and molecular phenotype association could be mediated by changes in cell-type composition. Finally, we show that cell-type iQTLs contribute to cell-type-specific enrichment of diseases that, in combination with additional functional data, could guide future functional studies. Overall, this study highlights the use of iQTLs to gain insights into the context specificity of regulatory effects.", "Keywords": ["DNA methylation", "cell-type composition", "gene expression", "gene-environment interaction", "interaction QTL"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genotype", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Silva", "Last Name": "Kasela", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Concerns include identification of an important health issue for individuals, accuracy of research test results, public health impact, potential emotional distress for participants, and need for IRB permissions. Blood RNA-sequencing analysis for non-human RNA in 3984 participants from the COPDGene study identified 228 participants with evidence suggestive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We hypothesized that incidentally discovered HCV results could be effectively returned to COPDGene participants with attention to the identified concerns. In conjunction with a COPDGene Participant Advisory Panel, we developed and obtained IRB approval for a process of returning HCV research results and an HCV Follow-Up Study questionnaire to capture information about previous HCV diagnosis and treatment information and participant reactions to return of HCV results. During phone calls following the initial HCV notification letter, 84 of 124 participants who could be contacted (67.7%) volunteered that they had been previously diagnosed with HCV infection. Thirty-one of these 124 COPDGene participants were enrolled in the HCV Follow-Up Study. Five of the 31 HCV Follow-Up Study participants did not report a previous diagnosis of HCV. For four of these participants, subsequent clinical HCV testing confirmed HCV infection. Thus, 30/31 Follow-Up Study participants had confirmed HCV diagnoses, supporting the accuracy of the HCV research test results. However, the limited number of participants in the Follow-Up Study precludes an accurate assessment of the false-positive and false-negative rates of the research RNA sequencing evidence for HCV. Most HCV Follow-Up Study participants (29/31) were supportive of returning HCV research results, and most participants found the process for returning HCV results to be informative and not upsetting. Newly diagnosed participants were more likely to be pleased to learn about a potentially curable infection (p\u2009=\u20090.027) and showed a trend toward being more frightened by the potential health risks of HCV (p\u2009=\u20090.11). We conclude that HCV results identified incidentally during transcriptomic research studies can be successfully returned to research study participants with a carefully designed process.", "Keywords":

Samples cluster strongly by ancestry in the shared space, even in the absence of genetic information, while private spaces frequently capture dataset-specific technical variation. Finally, we integrated genetic data by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of our inferred factors, observing that several factors are enriched for GWAS hits and trans-expression quantitative trait loci.

The predictive power of common variants outside the MUC5B locus for IPF and interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) is unknown. Objectives: We tested the predictive value of IPF polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with and without the MUC5B region on IPF, ILA, and ILA progression. Methods: We developed PRSs that included (PRS-M5B) and excluded (PRS-NO-M5B) the MUC5B region (500-kb window around rs35705950-T) using an IPF genome-wide association study. We assessed PRS associations with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) metrics for IPF, ILA, and ILA progression. Measurements and Main Results: We included 14,650 participants (1,970 IPF; 1,068 ILA) from six multi-ancestry population-based and case-control cohorts. In cases excluded from genome-wide association study, the PRS-M5B (odds ratio [OR] per SD of the score, 3.1; P\u2009=\u20097.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910-95) and PRS-NO-M5B (OR per SD, 2.8; P\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-87) were associated with IPF. Participants in the top PRS-NO-M5B quintile had \u223csevenfold odds for IPF compared with those in the first quintile. A clinical model predicted IPF (AUC, 0.61); rs35705950-T and PRS-NO-M5B demonstrated higher AUCs (0.73 and 0.7, respectively), and adding both genetic predictors to a clinical model yielded the highest performance (AUC, 0.81). The PRS-NO-M5B was associated with ILA (OR, 1.25) and ILA progression (OR, 1.16) in European ancestry participants.

with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease morbidity, but it is unclear whether they contribute to disease progression. Objectives: We aimed to determine whether indoor particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are associated with lung function decline among current and former smokers. Methods: Of the 2,382 subjects with a history of smoking in SPIROMICS AIR, 1,208 participants had complete information to estimate indoor PM and NO2, using individual-based prediction models, in relation to measured spirometry at two or more clinic visits. We used a three-way interaction model between time, pollutant, and smoking status and assessed the indoor pollutant-associated difference in FEV1 decline separately using a generalized linear mixed model. Measurements and Main Results: Participants had an average rate of FEV1 decline of 60.3\u2009ml/yr for those currently smoking compared with 35.2\u2009ml/yr for those who quit. The association of indoor PM with FEV1 decline differed by smoking status. Among former smokers, every 10\u2009\u03bcg/m3 increase in estimated indoor PM was associated with an additional 10\u2009ml/yr decline in FEV1 (P\u2009=\u20090.044). Among current smokers, FEV1 decline did not differ by indoor PM. The results of indoor NO2 suggest trends similar to those for PM \u2a7d2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter. Conclusions: Former smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who live in homes with high estimated PM have accelerated lung function loss, and those in homes with low PM have lung function loss similar to normal aging. In-home PM exposure may contribute to variability in lung function decline in people who quit smoking and may be a modifiable exposure.", "Keywords": ["chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "indoor particulate matter", "lung function decline"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Smokers", "Air Pollution, Indoor", "Nitrogen Dioxide", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Particulate Matter", "Lung", "Environmental Pollutants", "Air Pollutants", "Air Pollution"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nadia N", "Last Name": "Hansel", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Han", "Last Name": "Woo", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Kirsten", "Last Name": "Koehler", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Gassett", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences and."}, {"First Name": "Laura M", "Last Name": "Paulin", "Affiliation": "Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Geisel School of Medicine, Hanover, New Hampshire."}, {"First Name": "Neil E", "Last Name": "Alexis", "Affiliation": "Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology, Division of Allergy and Immunology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Nirupama", "Last Name": "Putcha", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Lorizio", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Ashraf", "Last Name": "Fawzy", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Belz", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Coralynn", "Last Name": "Sack", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Fernando J", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "MeiLan K", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, Michigan."}, {"First Name": "Prescott", "Last Name": "Woodruff", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, and Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl", "Last Name": "Pirozzi", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Paine", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Barjaktarevic", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California;

Omega-3 fatty acids have antiinflammatory properties and may benefit lung health. Objectives: To investigate associations of omega-3 fatty acids with lung function decline and incident airway obstruction in a diverse sample of adults from general-population cohorts. Methods: Complementary study designs: 1) longitudinal study of plasma phospholipid omega-3 fatty acids and repeated FEV1 and FVC measures in the NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study and 2) two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study of genetically predicted omega-3 fatty acids and lung function parameters. Measurements and Main Results: The longitudinal study found that higher omega-3 fatty acid levels were associated with attenuated lung function decline in 15,063 participants, with the largest effect sizes for the most metabolically downstream omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). An increase in DHA of 1% of total fatty acids was associated with attenuations of 1.4 ml/yr for FEV1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8) and 2.0 ml/yr for FVC (95% CI, 1.6-2.4) and a 7% lower incidence of spirometry-defined airway obstruction (95% CI, 0.89-0.97). DHA associations persisted across sexes and smoking histories and in Black, White, and Hispanic participants, with associations of the largest magnitude in former smokers and Hispanic participants.

Our understanding of systemic protein biomarkers associated with COPD remains incomplete. Objectives: To determine what proteins and pathways are associated with impaired pulmonary function in a diverse population. Methods: We studied 6,722 participants across six cohort studies with both aptamer-based proteomic and spirometry data (4,566 predominantly White participants in a discovery analysis and 2,156 African American cohort participants in a validation). In linear regression models, we examined protein associations with baseline forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC). In linear mixed effects models, we investigated the associations of baseline protein levels with rate of FEV1 decline (ml/yr) in 2,777 participants with up to 7\u2009years of follow-up spirometry. Results: We identified 254 proteins associated with FEV1 in our discovery analyses, with 80 proteins validated in the Jackson Heart Study. Novel validated protein associations include kallistatin serine protease inhibitor, growth differentiation factor 2, and tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (discovery \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.0561, Q\u2009=\u20094.05\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10; \u03b2\u2009\u2009=\u20090.0421, Q\u2009=\u20091.12\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3; and \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.0358, Q\u2009=\u20091.67\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3, respectively). In longitudinal analyses within cohorts with follow-up spirometry, we identified 15 proteins associated with FEV1 decline (Q\u2009<\u20090.05), including elafin leukocyte elastase inhibitor and mucin-associated TFF2 (trefoil factor 2; \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-4.3\u2009ml/yr, Q\u2009=\u20090.049; \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-6.1\u2009ml/yr, Q\u2009=\u20090.032, respectively). Pathways and processes highlighted by our study include aberrant extracellular matrix remodeling, enhanced innate immune response, dysregulation of angiogenesis, and coagulation. Conclusions: In this study, we identify and validate novel biomarkers and pathways associated with lung function traits in a racially diverse population. In addition, we identify novel protein markers associated with FEV1 decline. Several protein findings are supported by previously reported genetic signals, highlighting the plausibility of certain biologic pathways.

and death. Prognostic insights into mechanisms and markers of progression could facilitate development of disease-modifying therapies. Although individual biomarkers exhibit some predictive value, performance is modest and their univariate nature limits network-level insights. To overcome these limitations and gain insights into early pathways associated with rapid progression, we measured 1305 peripheral blood and 48 bronchoalveolar lavage proteins in individuals with COPD [n\u2009=\u200945, mean initial forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 75.6\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4% predicted]. We applied a data-driven analysis pipeline, which enabled identification of protein signatures that predicted individuals at-risk for accelerated lung function decline (FEV1 decline\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0mL/year)\u2009~\u20096\u00a0years later, with high accuracy. Progression signatures suggested that early dysregulation in elements of the complement cascade is associated with accelerated decline.

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk.", "Abstract": "Lung-function impairment underlies chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and predicts mortality. In the largest multi-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of lung function to date, comprising 580,869 participants, we identified 1,020 independent association signals implicating 559 genes supported by \u22652 criteria from a systematic variant-to-gene mapping framework. These genes were enriched in 29 pathways. Individual variants showed heterogeneity across ancestries, age and smoking groups, and collectively as a genetic risk score showed strong association with COPD across ancestry groups. We undertook phenome-wide association studies for selected associated variants as well as trait and pathway-specific genetic risk scores to infer possible consequences of intervening in pathways underlying lung function. We highlight new putative causal variants, genes, proteins and pathways, including those targeted by existing drugs. These findings bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms underlying lung function and COPD, and should inform functional genomics experiments and potentially future COPD therapies.", "Keywords":

"Abstract": "Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been hypothesized to be a risk factor in interstitial lung disease (ILD) and is associated with radiological markers that may represent the earlier stages of ILD. Prior studies have been limited by their cross-sectional design and potential confounding by body habitus. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that OSA severity is associated with more high-attenuation areas (HAAs) on computed tomography and worse lung function over time among older community-dwelling adults. Methods: We used data from participants in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) who had apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) measured from polysomnography (2010-2013), high attenuation areas (HAAs, -600 to -250 Hounsfield units, n\u2009=\u2009784), assessments from exams 5 (2010-2012) and 6 (2016-2018) full-lung computed tomography scans, and spirometry assessments (n\u2009=\u2009677). Linear mixed-effects models with random intercept were used to examine associations of OSA severity (i.e., AHI and hypoxic burden) with changes in HAAs, total lung volumes, and forced vital capacity (FVC) between exams 5 and 6. Potential confounders were adjusted for in the model, including age, sex, smoking history, height, and weight. Results: Among those with a higher AHI there were more men and a higher body mass index. Participants with AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u200915 events/h and in the highest hypoxic burden quartile each had increases in HAAs of 11.30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.74-19.35%) and 9.85% (95% CI, 1.40-19.01%) per 10 years, respectively. There was a more rapid decline in total lung volumes imaged and FVC among those with AHI\u2009\u2a7e\u200915 events/h of 220.2 ml (95% CI, 47.8-392.5 ml) and 3.63% (95% CI, 0.43-6.83%) per 10 years, respectively. Conclusions: A greater burden of hypoxia related to obstructive events during sleep was associated with increased lung densities over time and a more rapid decline in lung volumes regardless of body habitus. Our findings suggest OSA may be a contributing factor in the early stages of ILD.", "Keywords": ["hypoxia", "interstitial lung disease", "nocturnal oxygen saturation", "sleep apnea"], "MeSH terms":

To overcome this limitation, we aggregated genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, whole-genome sequences and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from diverse ancestries. We developed a new approach, TESLA (multi-ancestry integrative study using an optimal linear combination of association statistics), to integrate an eQTL dataset with a multi-ancestry GWAS. By exploiting shared phenotypic effects between ancestries and accommodating potential effect heterogeneities, TESLA improves power over other TWAS methods. When applied to tobacco use phenotypes, TESLA identified 273 new genes, up to 55% more compared with alternative TWAS methods. These hits and subsequent fine mapping using TESLA point to target genes with biological relevance. In silico drug-repurposing analyses highlight several drugs with known efficacy, including dextromethorphan and galantamine, and new drugs such as muscle relaxants that may be repurposed for treating nicotine addiction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Transcriptome", "Drug Repositioning", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Tobacco Use", "Biology", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",

Associated with Common Genetic Variants and Limited Rare Variants.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, irreversible, and progressive disease of the lungs. Common genetic variants, in addition to nongenetic factors, have been consistently associated with IPF. Rare variants identified by candidate gene, family-based, and exome studies have also been reported to associate with IPF. However, the extent to which rare variants, genome-wide, may contribute to the risk of IPF remains unknown. Objectives: We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the role of rare variants, genome-wide, on IPF risk. Methods: As part of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program, we sequenced 2,180 cases of IPF. Association testing focused on the aggregated effect of rare variants (minor allele frequency \u2a7d0.01) within genes or regions. We also identified individual rare variants that are influential within genes and estimated the heritability of IPF on the basis of rare and common variants. Measurements and Main Results: Rare variants in both TERT and RTEL1 were significantly associated with IPF. A single rare variant in each of the TERT and RTEL1 genes was found to consistently influence the aggregated test statistics. There was no significant evidence of association with other previously reported rare variants. The SNP heritability of IPF was estimated to be 32% (SE\u2009=\u20093%). Conclusions: Rare variants within the TERT and RTEL1 genes and well-established common variants have the largest contribution to IPF risk overall. Efforts in risk profiling or the development of therapies for IPF that focus on TERT, RTEL1, common variants, and environmental risk factors are likely to have the largest impact on this complex disease.", "Keywords": ["TOPMed", "genetic association studies", "interstitial lung disease", "telomerase", "whole-genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Whole Genome Sequencing", "Exome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna L", "Last Name": "Peljto", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Rachel Z", "Last Name": "Blumhagen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Avram D", "Last Name": "Walts", "Affiliation": "National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Cardwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Powers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Tamera J", "Last Name": "Corte", "Affiliation": "Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Joanne L", "Last Name": "Dickinson", "Affiliation": "Menzies Institute of Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Glaspole", "Affiliation": "Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology Clinic, Alfred Health, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Yuben P", "Last Name": "Moodley", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Martina Koziar", "Last Name": "Vasakova", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Thomayer Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth", "Last Name": "Bendstrup", "Affiliation": "Center for Rare Lung Diseases, Department of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Jesper R", "Last Name": "Davidsen", "Affiliation": "South Danish Center for Interstitial Lung Diseases, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Borie", "Affiliation": "Service de Pneumologie A and."}, {"First Name": "Bruno", "Last Name": "Crestani", "Affiliation": "Service de Pneumologie A and."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Dieude", "Affiliation": "Service de Rhumatologie, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Bonella", "Affiliation": "Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases, Ruhrlandklinik University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "Costabel", "Affiliation": "Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases, Ruhrlandklinik University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Gudmundsson", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Seamas C", "Last Name": "Donnelly", "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Jim", "Last Name": "Egan", "Affiliation": "National Lung Transplantation Centre, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Henry", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Keane", "Affiliation": "St. Vincent's University Hospital, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Marcus P", "Last Name": "Kennedy", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Cormac", "Last Name": "McCarthy", "Affiliation": "St. Vincent's University Hospital, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Aoife N", "Last Name": "McElroy", "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Olaniyi", "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Katherine M A", "Last Name": "O'Reilly", "Affiliation": "Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Richeldi", "Affiliation": "Fondazione Policlinico A.

alcohol use.", "Abstract": "Tobacco and alcohol use are heritable behaviours associated with 15% and 5.3% of worldwide deaths, respectively, due largely to broad increased risk for disease and injury1-4. These substances are used across the globe, yet genome-wide association studies have focused largely on individuals of European ancestries5. Here we leveraged global genetic diversity across 3.4 million individuals from four major clines of global ancestry (approximately 21% non-European) to power the discovery and fine-mapping of genomic loci associated with tobacco and alcohol use, to inform function of these loci via ancestry-aware transcriptome-wide association studies, and to evaluate the genetic architecture and predictive power of polygenic risk within and across populations. We found that increases in sample size and genetic diversity improved locus identification and fine-mapping resolution, and that a large majority of the 3,823 associated variants (from 2,143 loci) showed consistent effect sizes across ancestry dimensions. However, polygenic risk scores developed in one ancestry performed poorly in others, highlighting the continued need to increase sample sizes of diverse ancestries to realize any potential benefit of polygenic prediction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Risk

This study investigated the robustness of image-registration-based local biomechanical properties of the lung in individuals with COPD as a function of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage. Image registration was used to estimate the pointwise correspondences between the inspiration (total lung capacity) and expiration (residual volume) computed tomography (CT) images of the lung for each subject. In total, three biomechanical measures were computed from the correspondence map: the Jacobian determinant; the anisotropic deformation index (ADI); and the slab-rod index (SRI). CT scans from 245 subjects with varying GOLD stages were analyzed from the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). Results show monotonic increasing or decreasing trends in the three biomechanical measures as a function of GOLD stage for the entire lung and on a lobe-by-lobe basis. Furthermore, these trends held across all five image registration algorithms. The consistency of the five image registration algorithms on a per individual basis is shown using Bland-Altman plots.", "Keywords": ["COPD", "SPIROMICS", "biomechanics", "image registration", "lung"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad F A", "Last Name": "Chaudhary", "Affiliation": "The Roy J.

We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA levels and its potential role in human disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals",

Here we explore the potential for hyperpolarized (HP) 3He MRI to characterize lung structure and function in a large-scale population-based study. Participants (n = 54) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study, a nested case-control study of COPD among participants with 10+ packyears underwent HP 3He MRI measuring pAO2, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and ventilation. HP MRI measures were compared to full-lung CT and pulmonary function testing. High ADC values (>0.4 cm2/s) correlated with emphysema and heterogeneity in pAO2 measurements. Strong correlations were found between the heterogeneity of global pAO2 as summarized by its standard deviation (SD) (p < 0.0002) and non-physiologic pAO2 values (p < 0.0001) with percent emphysema on CT. A regional study revealed a strong association between pAO2 SD and visual emphysema severity (p < 0.003) and an association with the paraseptal emphysema subtype (p < 0.04) after adjustment for demographics and smoking status. HP noble gas pAO2 heterogeneity and the fraction of non-physiological pAO2 results increase in mild to moderate COPD.

Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DlCO) is a potential predictor of mortality that reflects physiology distinct from that in the BODE index. Objectives: This study evaluated DlCO as a predictor of mortality using participants from the COPDGene study. Methods: We performed time-to-event analyses of individuals with COPD (former or current smokers with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity\u2009<\u20090.7) and DlCO measurements from the COPDGene phase 2 visit. Cox proportional hazard methods were used to model survival, adjusting for age, sex, pack-years, smoking status, BODE index, computed tomography (CT) percent emphysema (low attenuation areas below -950 Hounsfield units), CT airway wall thickness, and history of cardiovascular or kidney diseases. C statistics for models with DlCO and BODE scores were used to compare discriminative accuracy. Results: Of 2,329 participants, 393 (16.8%) died during the follow-up period (median = 4.9 yr). In adjusted analyses, for every 10% decrease in DlCO percent predicted, mortality increased by 28% (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.41, P\u2009<\u20090.001). When compared with other clinical predictors, DlCO percent predicted performed similarly to BODE (C statistic DlCO\u2009=\u20090.68; BODE\u2009=\u20090.70), and the addition of DlCO to BODE improved its discriminative accuracy (C statistic\u2009=\u20090.71). Conclusions: Diffusing capacity, a measure of gas transfer, strongly predicted all-cause mortality in individuals with COPD, independent of BODE index and CT evidence of emphysema and airway wall thickness.

models to humans may give rise to novel approaches of targeting multiple aging-related diseases simultaneously and increasing health span. Here, for the first time, we use transcriptomic signatures of monocytes to identify biological aging pathways underlying multiple aging-related diseases in humans. The ordinal logistic regression was used to cross-sectionally investigate transcriptomics of the comorbidity index in 1264 community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) adults, 47% Caucasian, 32% Hispanic, 21% African American, and 51% female, aged 55-94\u00a0years. The comorbidity index was defined as the number of prevalent aging-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cancer, dementia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hip fracture. We identified 708 gene transcripts associated with the comorbidity index (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and study site. In a weighted gene co-expression network analysis, as postulated, aging-related declines in apoptosis/autophagy (OR\u2009=\u20091.21 per SD increment, p\u2009=\u20090.0006) and ribosome/mitochondrion (OR\u2009=\u20090.90 per SD increment, p\u2009=\u20090.05) were positively associated with the comorbidity index. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, we identified 10 comorbidity-associated modules (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), including the module of apoptosis/autophagy. There were three inter-correlated modules of these 10 involved in the complement subcomponent C1q, Fc gamma receptor I, and Fc gamma receptor III of the immune system, respectively. Aging-related upregulation of these three modules was positively associated with the comorbidity index. The odds of comorbidity increased with more of these modules acting together in a dose-response fashion. In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis of human immune cells may identify biomarker panels indicative of comprehensive biological mechanisms, especially immune signaling pathways, contributing to health aging.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Comorbidity", "Monocyte", "Transcriptomic"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Male", "Monocytes", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Receptors, IgG", "Aging",

Lung microbiota and metabolites collectively may impact COPD pathophysiology, but relationships to clinical outcomes in milder disease are unclear. Objectives: Identify components of the lung microbiome and metabolome collectively associated with clinical markers in milder stage COPD. Methods: We analyzed paired microbiome and metabolomic data previously characterized from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in 137 participants in the SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study), or (GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage 0-2). Datasets used included 1) bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing; 2) untargeted metabolomics of the hydrophobic fraction, largely comprising lipids; and 3) targeted metabolomics for a panel of hydrophilic compounds previously implicated in mucoinflammation. We applied an integrative approach to select features and model 14 individual clinical variables representative of known associations with COPD trajectory (lung function, symptoms, and exacerbations). Measurements and Main Results: The majority of clinical measures associated with the lung microbiome and metabolome collectively in overall models (classification accuracies, >50%, P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. chance). Lower lung function, COPD diagnosis, and greater symptoms associated positively with Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Veillonella, together with compounds from several classes (glycosphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, polyamines and xanthine, an adenosine metabolite).

Studies are limited in scope and replication. Objectives: To conduct large-scale epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation and pulmonary function. Methods: Twelve cohorts analyzed associations of methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine probes (CpGs), using Illumina 450K or EPIC/850K arrays, with FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC. We performed multiancestry epigenome-wide meta-analyses (total of 17,503 individuals; 14,761 European, 2,549 African, and 193 Hispanic/Latino ancestries) and interpreted results using integrative epigenomics. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 1,267 CpGs (1,042 genes) differentially methylated (false discovery rate, <0.025) in relation to FEV1, FVC, or FEV1/FVC, including 1,240 novel and 73 also related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1,787 cases). We found 294 CpGs unique to European or African ancestry and 395 CpGs unique to never or ever smokers. The majority of significant CpGs correlated with nearby gene expression in blood. Findings were enriched in key regulatory elements for gene function, including accessible chromatin elements, in both blood and lung. Sixty-nine implicated genes are targets of investigational or approved drugs. One example novel gene highlighted by integrative epigenomic and druggable target analysis is TNFRSF4. Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses suggest that epigenome-wide association study signals capture causal regulatory genomic loci. Conclusions: We identified numerous novel loci differentially methylated in relation to pulmonary function; few were detected in large genome-wide association studies. Integrative analyses highlight functional relevance and potential therapeutic targets. This comprehensive discovery of potentially modifiable, novel lung function loci expands knowledge gained from genetic studies, providing insights into lung pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), predictive performance is limited when the discovery and target populations are not well matched. Hypothesizing that the biological mechanisms of disease are shared across ancestry groups, we introduce a PrediXcan-derived polygenic transcriptome risk score (PTRS) to improve cross-ethnic portability of risk prediction. We constructed the PTRS using summary statistics from application of PrediXcan on large-scale GWASs of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s [FEV1] and its ratio to forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC]) in the UK Biobank. We examined prediction performance and cross-ethnic portability of PTRS through smoking-stratified analyses both on 29,381 multi-ethnic participants from TOPMed population/family-based cohorts and on 11,771 multi-ethnic participants from TOPMed COPD-enriched studies. Analyses were carried out for two dichotomous COPD traits (moderate-to-severe and severe COPD) and two quantitative lung function traits (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC). While the proposed PTRS showed weaker associations with disease than PRS for European ancestry, the PTRS showed stronger association with COPD than PRS for African Americans (e.g., odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 1.24 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.43] for PTRS versus 1.10 [0.96-1.26] for PRS among heavy smokers with \u2265 40 pack-years of smoking) for moderate-to-severe COPD. Cross-ethnic portability of the PTRS was significantly higher than the PRS (paired t test p\u00a0<\u00a02.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-16 with portability gains ranging from 5% to 28%) for both dichotomous COPD traits and across all smoking strata.

Starting as early as 1971, investigators in the C4R cohort studies have collected data on clinical and subclinical diseases and their risk factors, including behavior, cognition, biomarkers, and social determinants of health. C4R links this pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) phenotyping to information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute and postacute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the United States. C4R ascertains SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey conducted via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations and high-quality event surveillance. Extensive prepandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these data will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings. This resource will allow evaluation of risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including postacute sequelae, and assessment of the social and behavioral impact of the pandemic

Their association with the development and progression of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) in humans is unknown. Objectives: We evaluated the associations of blood monocyte count, and other immune cell types, with ILA, high-attenuation areas, and FVC in four independent cohorts. Methods: We included participants with measured monocyte counts and computed tomographic (CT) imaging enrolled in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, n\u2009=\u2009484), AGES-Reykjavik (Age/Gene Environment Susceptibility Study, n\u2009=\u20093,547), COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD, n\u2009=\u20092,719), and the ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points, n\u2009=\u2009646).

Objectives: To assess whether race-specific approaches for estimating lung function contribute to racial inequities by failing to recognize pathological decrements and considering them normal. Methods: In a cohort with and at risk for COPD, we assessed whether lung function prediction equations applied in a race-specific versus universal manner better modeled the relationship between FEV1, FVC, and other COPD outcomes, including the COPD Assessment Test, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, computed tomography percent emphysema, airway wall thickness, and 6-minute-walk test. We related these outcomes to differences in FEV1 using multiple linear regression and compared predictive performance between fitted models using root mean squared error and Alpaydin's paired F test. Measurements and Main Results: Using race-specific equations, African American individuals were calculated to have better lung function than non-Hispanic White individuals (FEV1, 76.8% vs. 71.8% predicted; P\u2009=\u20090.02). Using universally applied equations, African American individuals were calculated to have worse lung function. Using Hankinson's Non-Hispanic White equation, FEV1 was 64.7% versus 71.8% (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Using the Global Lung Initiative's Other race equation, FEV1 was 70.0% versus 77.9% (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Prediction errors from linear regression were less for universally applied equations compared with race-specific equations when examining FEV1% predicted with the COPD Assessment Test (P\u2009<\u20090.01), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (P\u2009<\u20090.01), and airway wall thickness (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Although African American participants had greater adversity (P\u2009<\u20090.001), less adversity was only associated with better FEV1 in non-Hispanic White participants (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.041).

Methods: The MESA Lung Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, performed standardized spirometry from 2004 to 2006.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related state in which somatic mutations in clonal blood populations induce aberrant inflammatory responses. Patients with CHIP have an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, but the association of CHIP with COPD remains unclear. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing data to detect CHIP in 48\u2009835 patients, of whom 8444 had moderate to very severe COPD, from four separate cohorts with COPD phenotyping and smoking history. We measured emphysema in murine models in which Tet2 was deleted in hematopoietic cells. In the COPDGene cohort, individuals with CHIP had risks of moderate-to-severe, severe, or very severe COPD that were 1.6 (adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.2) and 2.2 (adjusted 95% CI, 1.5-3.2) times greater than those for noncarriers. These findings were consistently observed in three additional cohorts and meta-analyses of all patients. CHIP was also associated with decreased FEV1% predicted in the COPDGene cohort (mean between-group differences, -5.7%; adjusted 95% CI, -8.8% to -2.6%), a finding replicated in additional cohorts. Smoke exposure was associated with a small but significant increased risk of having CHIP (odds ratio, 1.03 per 10 pack-years; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05 per 10 pack-years) in the meta-analysis of all patients.

Objectives: To evaluate the association between insulin resistance and RV function by echocardiography in a cohort of adults without baseline cardiovascular disease. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Linear regression was used to examine the association between overall insulin resistance measured by the mean triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio (TG:HDL) and change in TG:HDL over time for each participant with echocardiographic RV function. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) of RV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Results: Among 3,032 participants, higher mean TG:HDL was associated with lower (worse) absolute RV longitudinal strain (\u03b2, -0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.64 to -0.13; P\u2009<\u20090.01), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (\u03b2, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.04; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher odds of abnormal RV strain (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.47; P\u2009<\u20090.01) and abnormal tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.51; P\u2009<\u20090.001). TG:HDL was also associated with lower ratio of tricuspid early to late ventricular filling velocities (E/A) (\u03b2, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01; P\u2009<\u20090.01), higher ratio of early diastolic tricuspid inflow to tricuspid lateral annular velocity (E/e') (\u03b2, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.23; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher odds of graded RV diastolic dysfunction (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.39; P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Objectives: Examine the impact of depressive symptoms compared with FEV1% on COPD morbidity. Methods: Using longitudinal data from individuals with COPD in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study, longitudinal growth analysis was performed to assess COPD morbidity by assessing differences in baseline 6-minute walk distance and patient reported outcomes (PROs) and their rate of change over time explained by depressive symptoms or lung function, as measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale or FEV1% respectively. PROs consisted of in-person completion of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue, and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale measures.

Unsupervised learning of emphysema subtypes on computed tomography (CT) opens the way to new definitions of emphysema subtypes and eliminates the need of thorough manual labeling. However, CT-based emphysema subtypes have been limited to texture-based patterns without considering spatial location. In this work, we introduce a standardized spatial mapping of the lung for quantitative study of lung texture location and propose a novel framework for combining spatial and texture information to discover spatially-informed lung texture patterns (sLTPs) that represent novel emphysema subtype candidates. Exploiting two cohorts of full-lung CT scans from the MESA COPD (n = 317) and EMCAP (n = 22) studies, we first show that our spatial mapping enables population-wide study of emphysema spatial location. We then evaluate the characteristics of the sLTPs discovered on MESA COPD, and show that they are reproducible, able to encode standard emphysema subtypes, and associated with physiological symptoms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Atherosclerosis", "Emphysema", "Humans", "Lung", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Emphysema"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elsa D", "Last Name": "Angelini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pallavi P", "Last Name": "Balte", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John H M", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benjamin M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Laine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "PubDate": "2021Dec"}, {"PMID": "34197703", "Title": "Polycythemia is Associated with Lower Incidence of Severe COPD Exacerbations in the SPIROMICS Study.", "Abstract": "Secondary polycythemia has long been recognized as a consequence of chronic pulmonary disease and hypoxemia and is associated with lower mortality and fewer hospitalizations among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-prescribed long-term oxygen therapy. This study investigates the association of polycythemia with COPD severity, phenotypic features, and respiratory exacerbations in a contemporary and representative sample of individuals with COPD. Current and former smokers with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] to forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio <70%) without a history of hematologic/oncologic disorders were selected from the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcomes Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS), a multi-center observational cohort. Participants with polycythemia (hemoglobin \u226515g/dL [females] or \u226517g/dL [males]), were compared to individuals without anemia (hemoglobin \u226512g/dL [females] or \u226513g/dL [males]). Cross-sectional outcomes including percent predicted FEV1, respiratory symptoms, quality of life, exercise tolerance, and percentage and distribution of emphysema (voxels<-950 Hounsfield units [HU] at total lung capacity) were evaluated using linear or logistic regression. Longitudinal acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and severe AECOPD (requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization) were assessed using zero-inflated negative binomial models. Among 1261 participants, 148 (11.7%) had polycythemia. Average follow-up was 4.2\u00b11.7 years and did not differ by presence of polycythemia. In multivariate analysis, compared to participants with normal hemoglobin, polycythemia was associated with a reduced rate of severe AECOPD (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.57, 95% CI: 0.33-0.98), lower percent predicted FEV1, lower resting oxygen saturation, increased upper to lower lobe ratio of emphysema, and a greater degree of emphysema, though the latter was attenuated after adjusting for lung function. There were no significant differences in total AECOPD, patient-reported outcomes, or exercise tolerance. These findings suggest that polycythemia, while associated with less favorable physiologic parameters, is not independently associated with symptoms, and is associated with fewer severe exacerbations.

This study pursues technical validation of novel CT-based methods for assessment of peripheral bone microstructure together with a human pilot study examining relationships between bone microstructure and vertebral fractures in smokers. To examine the accuracy and reproducibility of the methods, repeat ultra-high-resolution (UHR) CT and micro-CT scans of cadaveric ankle specimens were acquired. Thirty smokers from the University of Iowa COPDGene cohort were recruited at their 5-year follow-up visits. Chest CT scans, collected under the parent study, were used to assess vertebral fractures. UHR CT scans of distal tibia were acquired for this pilot study to obtain peripheral cortical and trabecular bone (Cb and Tb) measures. UHR CT-derived Tb measures, including volumetric bone mineral density (BMD), network area, transverse trabecular density, and mean plate width, showed high correlation (r >\u20090.901) with their micro-CT-derived values over small regions of interest (ROIs). Both Cb and Tb measures showed high reproducibility-intra-class correlation (ICC) was greater than 0.99 for all Tb measures except erosion index and greater than 0.97 for all Cb measures. Female sex was associated with lower transverse Tb density (p <\u20090.1), higher Tb spacing (p <\u20090.05), and lower cortical thickness (p <\u20090.001). Participants with vertebral fractures had significantly degenerated values (p <\u20090.05) for all Tb measures except thickness. There were no statistically significant differences for Cb measures between non-fracture and fracture groups. Vertebral fracture-group differences of Tb measures remained significant after adjustment with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status. Although current smokers at baseline had more fractures-81.8% versus 63.2% for former smokers-the difference was not statistically significant. This pilot cross-sectional human study demonstrates CT-based peripheral bone microstructural differences among smokers with and without vertebral fractures. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

We tested the association between isolation index and respiratory symptoms, physiologic outcomes, imaging parameters, and exacerbation risk among urban Black residents, adjusting for established COPD risk factors, including smoking. Additional mediation analyses were conducted for factors that could lie on the pathway between segregation and COPD outcomes, including individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status, comorbidity burden, depression/anxiety, and ambient pollution.Measurements and Main Results: Among 515 Black participants, those residing in segregated neighborhoods (i.e., isolation index \u2a7e0.6) had worse COPD Assessment Test score (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7 to 4.0), dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council scale; \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.29; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.47), quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; \u03b2\u2009=\u20096.1; 95% CI, 2.3 to 9.9), and cough and sputum (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.8; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.5); lower FEV1% predicted (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-7.3; 95% CI, -10.9 to -3.6); higher rate of any and severe exacerbations; and higher percentage emphysema (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.3; 95% CI, 0.7 to 3.9) and air trapping (\u03b2\u2009=\u20093.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 7.1).

GWASs of other diseases have shown an approximately 10-fold overrepresentation of nonsynonymous variants, despite limited exonic coverage on genotyping arrays. We hypothesized that a large-scale analysis of coding variants could discover novel genetic associations with COPD, including rare variants with large effect sizes. We performed a meta-analysis of exome arrays from 218,399 controls and 33,851 moderate-to-severe COPD cases. All exome-wide significant associations were present in regions previously identified by GWAS. We did not identify any novel rare coding variants with large effect sizes. Within GWAS regions on chromosomes 5q, 6p, and 15q, four coding variants were conditionally significant (P < 0.00015) when adjusting for lead GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms A common gasdermin B (GSDMB) splice variant (rs11078928) previously associated with a decreased risk for asthma was nominally associated with a decreased risk for COPD [minor allele frequency (MAF)\u2009=\u20090.46, P = 1.8e-4]. Two stop variants in coiled-coil \u03b1-helical rod protein 1 (CCHCR1), a gene involved in regulating cell proliferation, were associated with COPD (both P < 0.0001). The SERPINA1 Z allele was associated with a random-effects odds ratio of 1.43 for COPD (95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.74), though with marked heterogeneity across studies. Overall, COPD-associated exonic variants were identified in genes involved in DNA methylation, cell-matrix interactions, cell proliferation, and cell death. In conclusion, we performed the largest exome array meta-analysis of COPD to date and identified potential functional coding variants. Future studies are needed to identify rarer variants and further define the role of coding variants in COPD pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "exome", "exon",

of D-Dimer with Computed Tomographic Lung Abnormalities, Serum Biomarkers of Lung Injury, and Forced Vital Capacity: MESA Lung Study.", "Abstract": "Rationale: The coagulation cascade may play a role in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease through increased production of thrombin and fibrin deposition. Whether circulating coagulation cascade factors are linked to lung inflammation and scarring among community-dwelling adults is unknown. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that higher baseline D-dimer concentrations are associated with markers of early lung injury and scarring. Methods: Using the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort (n = 6,814), we examined associations of baseline D-dimer concentrations with high attenuation areas from examination 1 (2000-2002; n = 6,184) and interstitial lung abnormalities from examination 5 computed tomographic (CT) scans (2010-2012; n = 2,227), and serum MMP-7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7) and SP-A (surfactant protein-A) from examination 1 (n = 1,098). We examined longitudinal change in forced vital capacity (FVC) from examinations 3-6 (2004-2018, n = 3,562). We used linear logistic regression and linear mixed models to examine associations and adjust for potential confounders. Results: The mean (standard deviation) age of the cohort was 62 (10) years, and the D-dimer concentration was 0.35 (0.69) ug/ml. For every 10% increase in D-dimer concentration, there was an increase in high attenuation area percentage of 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.47) after adjustment for covariates. Associations were stronger among those older than 65 years (P values for interaction < 0.001). A 10% increase in D-dimer concentration was associated with an odds ratio of 1.05 for interstitial lung abnormalities (95% CI, 0.99-1.11). Higher D-dimer concentrations were associated with higher serum MMP-7 and a faster decline in FVC. D-dimer was not associated with SP-A.

Routine chest CT examinations may allow assessment of obesity and sarcopenia by soft-tissue markers for predicting risks of mortality. Purpose To investigate associations between soft-tissue markers subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), and pectoralis muscle (PM) index from chest CT with mortality in participants with COPD. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, participants with available chest CT in 2010-2012 were included. CT examinations were analyzed to determine SAT, IMAT (within PM), and PM areas. The spirometry evaluations were used to establish COPD diagnosis. Mortality data were extracted from the National Death Index (April 2010 to December 2017). The correlations of the soft-tissue markers with fat mass index were studied. The associations of these markers and risks of mortality in participants with COPD were assessed by using Cox proportional-hazard models adjusted for confounders. Results Among 2994 participants who were included (mean age, 69 years \u00b1 9 [standard deviation]; 1551 women), 265 had COPD (9%; mean age, 72 years \u00b1 9; 162 men) and 49 participants with COPD (18%) died during follow-up. The SAT, IMAT, and PM areas had moderate-to-excellent reliabilities (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.88-0.99). In the 2994 participants, the SAT (\u03c1 = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.81; P < .001) and IMAT indexes (\u03c1 = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.41; P < .001) were correlated with fat mass index. Those with COPD and higher SAT index had lower risks of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.4; P < .001, per doubling), whereas a higher IMAT index was associated with a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.9; P = .04, per doubling). Conclusion Soft-tissue markers were reliably obtained by using chest CT performed for lung assessment. In participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a high intermuscular adipose tissue index was associated with a higher risk of mortality than was a high subcutaneous adipose tissue index. \u00a9\u2009RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

For decades, C4R cohorts have collected extensive data on clinical and subclinical diseases and their risk factors, including behavior, cognition, biomarkers, and social determinants of health. C4R will link this pre-COVID phenotyping to information on SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute and post-acute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and broadly reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the US. C4R is ascertaining severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations, and high-quality events surveillance. Extensive pre-pandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are being harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings. This unique resource will allow evaluation of risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including post-acute sequelae, and assessment of the social and behavioral impact of the

However, spirometry may underestimate the effects of smoking, missing smokers with respiratory disease who have minimal or no airflow obstruction. Objectives: To develop a multidimensional definition of a lung-related \"resilient smoker\" that is useful in research studies and then identify a resilient smoker subgroup in the SPIROMICS (SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study) cohort using this definition. Methods: We performed a three-round modified Delphi survey among a panel of COPD experts to identify and reach a consensus on clinical and radiographic domains to be included in a lung-related resilient smoker definition. Consensus on domains of resilience was defined as \u2a7e80% of experts voting \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" on a 5-point Likert scale. The Delphi-derived definition of resilience was applied to SPIROMICS to identify resilient smokers, whom we then characterized using known biomarkers of COPD. Results: Consensus was achieved on 6 of 12 diagnostic items, which include cough and sputum production, dyspnea, radiographic measures of emphysema and small airways disease, exacerbations, and decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Although 892 SPIROMICS participants were classified as smokers with preserved lung function by spirometry, only 149 participants (16.7%) qualified as resilient smokers by our definition. Blood biomarker expression of CRP (C-reactive protein) and sTNFRSF1A (soluble tumor necrosis receptor factor1A) was lower in resilient than nonresilient smokers (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03). Conclusions: A Delphi-derived consensus definition of resilient smoker identified 83.3% of smokers with preserved spirometry as \"nonresilient\" based on the presence of adverse effects of smoking on the lung. Resilient smokers were biologically distinct from nonresilient smokers based on CRP measurements.

The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes)1. In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected more than 400\u00a0million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400\u00a0million detected variants, 97% have frequencies of less than 1% and 46% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01%.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6", "Genetic Variation", "Genome, Human", "Genomics", "Haplotypes", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "INDEL Mutation", "Loss of Function

Radiologists scored mucus plugs on CT lung images, and imaging software automatically quantified emphysema percentage. Unadjusted and adjusted relationships between mucus plug score, emphysema percentage, and lung function were determined using regression.Measurements and Main Results: Among 400 smokers, 229 (57%) had mucus plugs and 207 (52%) had emphysema, and subgroups could be identified with mucus-dominant and emphysema-dominant disease. Only 33% of smokers with high mucus plug scores had mucus symptoms. Mucus plug score and emphysema percentage were independently associated with lower values for FEV1 and peripheral oxygen saturation (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The relationships between mucus plug score and lung function outcomes were strongest in smokers with limited emphysema (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Compared with smokers with low mucus plug scores, those with high scores had worse COPD Assessment Test scores (17.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7 vs. 14.4\u2009\u00b1\u200913.3), more frequent annual exacerbations (0.75\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 vs. 0.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85), and shorter 6-minute-walk distance (329\u2009\u00b1\u2009115 vs. 392\u2009\u00b1\u2009117 m) (P\u2009<\u20090.001).Conclusions: Symptomatically silent mucus plugs are highly prevalent in smokers and independently associate with lung function outcomes. These data provide rationale for targeting patients with mucus-high/emphysema-low COPD in clinical trials of mucoactive treatments.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov

We developed models for the entire cohort based on monitoring in a subset of homes, to predict mean 2-week-measured concentrations of PM2.5 , NO2 , NOx , and nicotine, using home and behavioral questionnaire responses available in the full cohort. Models incorporating socioeconomic, meteorological, behavioral, and residential information together explained about 60% of the variation in indoor concentration of each pollutant.

We assessed whether racial differences in symptom, functional, and imaging outcomes (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test score, modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, 6-minute-walk test distance, and computed tomography [CT] scan metrics) and severe exacerbation risk were explained by individual or neighborhood SES. Using generalized linear mixed model regression, we compared respiratory outcomes by race, adjusting for confounders and individual-level and neighborhood-level descriptors of SES both separately and sequentially.Measurements and Main Results: After adjusting for COPD risk factors, Black participants had significantly worse respiratory symptoms and quality of life (modified Medical Research Council scale, COPD Assessment Test, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire), higher risk of severe exacerbations and higher percentage of emphysema, thicker airways (internal perimeter of 10 mm), and more air trapping on CT metrics compared with white participants. In addition, the association between Black race and respiratory outcomes was attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjusting for individual-level SES, which explained up to 12-35% of racial disparities. Further adjustment showed that neighborhood-level SES explained another 26-54% of the racial disparities in respiratory outcomes. Even after accounting for both individual and neighborhood SES factors, Black individuals continued to have increased severe exacerbation risk and persistently worse CT outcomes (emphysema, air trapping, and airway wall thickness).Conclusions: Disadvantages by individual- and neighborhood-level SES each partly explain disparities in respiratory outcomes between Black individuals and white individuals. Strategies to narrow the gap in SES disadvantages may help to reduce race-related health disparities in COPD; however, further work is needed to identify additional risk factors contributing to

models, but human studies are lacking. We examined associations of circulating levels of DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids with hospitalization and death due to ILD over 12 years in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; n\u00a0=\u00a06,573). We examined cross-sectional associations with CT lung abnormalities in MESA (2000-2012; n = 6,541), the Framingham Heart Study (2005-2011; n = 3,917), and the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik) (2002-2006; n = 1,106). Polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were determined from fasting blood samples and extracted from plasma phospholipids (MESA and AGES-Reykjavik) or red blood cell membranes (Framingham Heart Study). Higher DHA levels were associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to ILD (per standard-deviation increment, adjusted rate ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48, 0.99) and a lower rate of death due to ILD (per standard-deviation increment, adjusted hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.98). Higher DHA was associated with fewer interstitial lung abnormalities on computed tomography (per natural log increment, pooled adjusted odds ratio = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.91).

We aimed to validate HAA in lung regions that are less subject to artefacts, such as extravascular lung water or dependent atelectasis. We examined the associations of HAA within six lung regions (basilar, non-basilar, peel, core, basilar peel, basilar core) with serum biomarkers of lung remodelling, forced vital capacity (FVC), visually-assessed interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), and all-cause and ILD-specific mortality. We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a prospective cohort of 6814 adults aged 45-84 years without known cardiovascular disease who underwent cardiac computed tomography. Median regional HAA ranged from 3.8% in the peel to 4.8% in the basilar core. Doubling of regional HAA was associated with greater serum matrix metalloproteinase-7 (range 3.8% to 10.3%; p\u22640.01), higher odds of ILA (OR 1.42 to 2.20; p\u22640.03), and a higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.20 to 1.47; p\u22640.001). Doubling of regional HAA was associated with greater serum interleukin-6 (4.9% to 10.3%; p\u22640.005) and higher risk of ILD-specific mortality (hazard ratio 3.30 to 3.98; p<0.001), except in the basilar core. Doubling of regional HAA was associated with lower FVC in the non-basilar, core and basilar core (113\u2005mL to 186\u2005mL; p<0.001). Associations of HAA with lung remodelling biomarkers, ILA risk and all-cause mortality were consistent across all regions of the lung, including dependent areas where atelectasis may be present.

Purpose To evaluate the relationship between longitudinal changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and CT-quantified emphysema and air trapping in smokers. Materials and Methods Cigarette smokers with and those without COPD participating in the multicenter observational COPDGene study were evaluated. Subjects underwent inspiratory and expiratory chest CT and spirometry at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Emphysema was quantified by using adjusted lung density (ALD). Air trapping was quantified by using mean lung density at expiratory CT and CT-measured functional residual capacity-to-total lung volume ratio. Linear models were used to regress quantitative CT measurements taken 5 years apart, and models were fit with and without adding FEV1 as a predictor. Analyses were stratified by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage (GOLD 0, no COPD; GOLD 1, mild COPD; GOLD 2, moderate COPD; GOLD 3, severe COPD; GOLD 4, very severe COPD). Subjects with preserved FEV1-to-forced vital capacity ratio and reduced FEV1 percentage predicted were categorized as having preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm). Results A total of 4211 subjects (503 with PRISm; 2034 with GOLD 0, 388 with GOLD 1, 816 with GOLD 2, 381 with GOLD 3, 89 with GOLD 4) were evaluated. ALD decreased by 1.7 g/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.5, -0.9) in subjects with GOLD 0 at baseline and by 5.3 g/L (95% CI: -6.2, -4.4) in those with GOLD 1-4 (P < .001 for both). When adjusted for changes in FEV1, corresponding numbers were -2.2 (95% CI: -3.0, -1.3) and -4.6 g/L (95% CI: -5.6, -3.4) (P < .001 for both). Progression in air trapping was identified only in GOLD stage 2-4. Approximately 33%-50% of changes in air trapping in GOLD stages 2-4 were accounted for by changes in FEV1. Conclusion CT measures of emphysema and air trapping increased over 5 years in smokers. Forced expiratory volume in one second accounted for less than 10% of emphysema progression and less than 50% of air trapping progression detected at CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Air", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Severity of Illness Index", "Smoking", "Time Factors", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Esther", "Last Name": "Pompe", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, PO 85500, Postbox E.03.511, Utrecht, Utrecht 3508 GA, the Netherlands (E.P.);

urine mitochondrial DNA with clinical measures of COPD in the SPIROMICS cohort.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUNDMitochondrial dysfunction, a proposed mechanism of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis, is associated with the leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may be detected extracellularly in various bodily fluids. Despite evidence for the increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease in COPD subjects and for mitochondrial dysfunction in the kidneys of murine COPD models, whether urine mtDNA (u-mtDNA) associates with measures of disease severity in COPD is unknown.METHODSCell-free u-mtDNA, defined as copy number of mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase-1 (MTND1) gene, was measured by quantitative PCR and normalized to urine creatinine in cell-free urine samples from participants in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) cohort. Urine albumin/creatinine ratios (UACR) were measured in the same samples. Associations between u-mtDNA, UACR, and clinical disease parameters - including FEV1 % predicted, clinical measures of exercise tolerance, respiratory symptom burden, and chest CT measures of lung structure - were examined.RESULTSU-mtDNA and UACR levels were measured in never smokers (n = 64), smokers without airflow obstruction (n = 109), participants with mild/moderate COPD (n = 142), and participants with severe COPD (n = 168). U-mtDNA was associated with increased respiratory symptom burden, especially among smokers without COPD. Significant sex differences in u-mtDNA levels were observed, with females having higher u-mtDNA levels across all study subgroups. U-mtDNA associated with worse spirometry and CT emphysema in males only and with worse respiratory symptoms in females only. Similar associations were not found with UACR.CONCLUSIONU-mtDNA levels may help to identify distinct clinical phenotypes and underlying pathobiological differences in males versus females with COPD.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01969344).FUNDINGUS NIH, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, supplemented by contributions made through the Foundation for the NIH and the COPD Foundation from AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bayer, Bellerophon Therapeutics, Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc., Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Forest Research Institute Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Grifols Therapeutics Inc., Ikaria Inc., Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Nycomed GmbH, ProterixBio, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sanofi, Sunovion, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and Theravance Biopharma and Mylan.", "Keywords": ["COPD", "Mitochondria", "Nephrology", "Pulmonology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William Z", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Joan and Sanford I.

A risk score for these variants, built on an independent dataset, explains 0.97% of the AvSpO2S variation and contributes to the linkage evidence. The 51 noncoding variants are enriched in regulatory features in a human lung fibroblast cell line and contribute to DLC1 expression variation.

PI Z-containing compound heterozygotes (ZS/ZVR; n\u2009=\u20097) had lower FEV1/FVC (P\u2009=\u20090.02) and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (P\u2009=\u20090.009). Nineteen white heterozygotes for five non-S/Z coding variants associated with lower alpha-1 antitrypsin had greater computed tomography-based emphysema compared with those without rare variants. In African Americans, a 5' untranslated region insertion (rs568223361) was associated with lower alpha-1 antitrypsin and functional small airway disease (P\u2009=\u20090.007).Conclusions: In this integrative deep sequencing study of SERPINA1 with alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations in a heavy smoker and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort, we confirmed the effects of PI Z heterozygote and compound heterozygote genotypes.

We examined whether CT-derived lung volumes representing air trapping could predict adverse respiratory outcomes and more rapid decline in spirometry to overt COPD using mixed-effect linear modelling.Among these subjects with normal forced expiratory volume in 1\u2005s (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, CT-measured residual volume (RVCT) to total lung capacity (TLCCT) ratio varied widely, from 21% to 59%. Over 2.5\u00b10.7\u2005years of follow-up, subjects with higher RVCT/TLCCT had a greater differential rate of decline in FEV1/FVC; those in the upper RVCT/TLCCT tertile had a 0.66% (95% CI 0.06%-1.27%) faster rate of decline per year compared with those in the lower tertile (p=0.015) regardless of demographics, baseline spirometry, respiratory symptoms score, smoking status (former versus current) or smoking burden (pack-years). Accordingly, subjects with higher RVCT/TLCCT were more likely to develop spirometric COPD (OR 5.7 (95% CI 2.4-13.2) in upper versus lower RVCT/TLCCT tertile; p<0.001).

We performed a GWAS of ILAs in each cohort and combined the results using a meta-analysis. We assessed for overlapping associations in independent GWASs of IPF.Measurements and Main Results: Genome-wide genotyping data were available for 1,699 individuals with ILAs and 10,274 control subjects. The MUC5B (mucin 5B) promoter variant rs35705950 was significantly associated with both ILAs (P\u2009=\u20092.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-27) and subpleural ILAs (P\u2009=\u20091.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-29). We discovered novel genome-wide associations near IPO11 (rs6886640, P\u2009=\u20093.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) and FCF1P3 (rs73199442, P\u2009=\u20094.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) with ILAs, and near HTRE1 (rs7744971, P\u2009=\u20094.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) with subpleural-predominant ILAs. These novel associations were not associated with IPF. Among 12 previously reported IPF GWAS loci, five (DPP9, DSP, FAM13A, IVD, and MUC5B) were significantly associated (P\u2009<\u20090.05/12) with ILAs.Conclusions: In a GWAS of ILAs in six studies, we confirmed the association with a MUC5B promoter variant and found strong evidence for an effect of previously described IPF loci; however, novel ILA associations were not associated with IPF. These findings highlight common genetically driven biologic pathways between ILAs and IPF, and also suggest distinct ones.", "Keywords": ["SNP", "genetics", "genome-wide association study",

Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Substudy.", "Abstract": "BackgroundChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with hemodynamic changes in the pulmonary vasculature. However, cardiac effects are not fully understood and vary by phenotype of chronic lower respiratory disease.PurposeTo use four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI for comprehensive assessment of the right-sided cardiovascular system, assess its interrater and intraobserver reproducibility, and examine associations with venous return to the right heart in individuals with chronic COPD and emphysema.Materials and MethodsThe Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis COPD substudy prospectively recruited participants who smoked and who had COPD and nested control participants from population-based samples. Electrocardiography and respiratory gated 4D flow 1.5-T MRI was performed at three sites with full volumetric coverage of the thoracic vessels in 2014-2017 with postbronchodilator spirometry and inspiratory chest CT to quantify percent emphysema. Net flow, peak velocity, retrograde flow, and retrograde fraction were measured on 14 analysis planes. Interrater reproducibility was assessed by two independent observers, and the principle of conservation of mass was employed to evaluate the internal consistency of flow measures. Partial correlation coefficients were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, weight, and smoking status.ResultsAmong 70 participants (29 participants with COPD [mean age, 73.5 years \u00b1 8.1 {standard deviation}; 20 men] and 41 control participants [mean age, 71.0 years \u00b1 6.1; 22 men]), the interrater reproducibility of the 4D flow MRI measures was good to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.73-0.98), as was the internal consistency. There were no statistically significant differences in venous flow parameters according to COPD severity (P > .05). Greater percent emphysema at CT was associated with greater regurgitant flow in the superior and inferior caval veins and tricuspid valve (adjusted r = 0.28-0.55; all P < .01), particularly in the superior vena cava.ConclusionFour-dimensional flow MRI had good-to-excellent observer variability and flow consistency. Percent emphysema at CT was associated with statistically significant differences in retrograde flow, greatest in the superior vena cava.\u00a9 RSNA, 2019Online supplemental material is available for this article.See also the editorial by Choe in this issue.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Atherosclerosis", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Ethnicity", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Lung", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Reproducibility of Results", "Venae Cavae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ozair", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Radiology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 737 N Michigan Ave, Suite 1600, Chicago, IL 60611 (O.R., M.M., H.B., C.B., K.S., J.C.);

Little is known about the association of rice consumption with arsenic-related health effects, particularly interstitial lung disease. Between 2000 and 2002, 6,814 white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults from 6 US cities were enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We included 2,250 participants who had spirometry data, 2,557 with full-lung computed tomography (CT) scans, and 5,710 with cardiac CT scans. Rice consumption and 310 participants with urinary arsenic were assessed at baseline. Spirometry and full-lung CT-derived measures of total lung capacity and high attenuation area (HAA), and interstitial lung abnormalities were measured at examination 5. Cardiac CT-derived HAA was measured at 1-3 visits. Twelve percent of participants reported eating at least 1 serving of rice daily. Comparing data between that group with those who ate less than 1 serving weekly, the mean difference for forced vital capacity was -102 (95% confidence interval (CI): -198, -7) mL, and for forced expiratory volume in 1 second was -90 (95% CI: -170, -11) mL after adjustment for demographics, anthropometrics, dietary factors, and smoking. The cross-sectional adjusted percent difference for total lung capacity was -1.33% (95% CI: -4.29, 1.72) and for cardiac-based HAA was 3.66% (95% CI: 1.22, 6.15).

Cigarette smoking is one such lifestyle factor. Across five ancestries, we performed a genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) in 129\u2009913 individuals in stage 1 and follow-up analysis in 480\u2009178 additional individuals in stage 2. We report here 136 loci significantly associated with MAP and/or PP. Of these, 61 were previously published through main-effect analysis of BP traits, 37 were recently reported by us for systolic BP and/or diastolic BP through gene-smoking interaction analysis and 38 were newly identified (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8, false discovery rate\u2009<\u20090.05). We also identified nine new signals near known loci. Of the 136 loci, 8 showed significant interaction with smoking status. They include CSMD1 previously reported for insulin resistance and BP in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. Many of the 38 new loci show biologic plausibility for a role in BP regulation. SLC26A7 encodes a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger expressed in the renal outer medullary collecting duct. AVPR1A is widely expressed, including in vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney, myocardium and brain. FHAD1 is a long non-coding RNA overexpressed in heart failure. TMEM51 was associated with contractile function in cardiomyocytes. CASP9 plays a central role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Identified only in African ancestry were 30 novel loci. Our findings highlight the value of multi-ancestry investigations, particularly in studies of interaction with lifestyle factors, where genomic and lifestyle differences may contribute to novel

identifies new loci associated with serum lipids.", "Abstract": "The concentrations of high- and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides are influenced by smoking, but it is unknown whether genetic associations with lipids may be modified by smoking. We conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study in 133,805 individuals with follow-up in an additional 253,467 individuals. Combined meta-analyses identified 13 new loci associated with lipids, some of which were detected only because association differed by smoking status. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of including diverse populations, particularly in studies of interactions with lifestyle factors, where genomic and lifestyle differences by ancestry may contribute to novel findings.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Life Style",

Associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Susceptibility and Lung Structure on Computed Tomography.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been associated with numerous genetic variants, yet the extent to which its genetic risk is mediated by variation in lung structure remains unknown.Objectives: To characterize associations between a genetic risk score (GRS) associated with COPD susceptibility and lung structure on computed tomography (CT).Methods: We analyzed data from MESA Lung (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Lung Study), a U.S. general population-based cohort, and SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study). A weighted GRS was calculated from 83 SNPs that were previously associated with lung function. Lung density, spatially matched airway dimensions, and airway counts were assessed on full-lung CT. Generalized linear models were adjusted for age, age squared, sex, height, principal components of genetic ancestry, smoking status, pack-years, CT model, milliamperes, and total lung volume.Measurements and Main Results: MESA Lung and SPIROMICS contributed 2,517 and 2,339 participants, respectively. Higher GRS was associated with lower lung function and increased COPD risk, as well as lower lung density, smaller airway lumens, and fewer small airways, without effect modification by smoking. Adjustment for CT lung structure, particularly small airway measures, attenuated associations between the GRS and FEV1/FVC by 100% and 60% in MESA and SPIROMICS, respectively. Lung structure (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not the GRS (P\u2009>\u20090.10), improved discrimination of moderate-to-severe COPD cases relative to clinical factors alone.Conclusions: A GRS associated with COPD susceptibility was associated with CT lung structure.

Epidemiological studies reported mixed findings for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)-pulmonary function association. We conducted the largest cross-sectional meta-analysis of the 25(OH)D-pulmonary function association to date, based on nine European ancestry (EA) cohorts (n 22 838) and five African ancestry (AA) cohorts (n 4290) in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium. Data were analysed using linear models by cohort and ancestry. Effect modification by smoking status (current/former/never) was tested. Results were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Mean serum 25(OH)D was 68 (sd 29) nmol/l for EA and 49 (sd 21) nmol/l for AA. For each 1 nmol/l higher 25(OH)D, forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) was higher by 1\u00b71 ml in EA (95 % CI 0\u00b79, 1\u00b73; P<0\u00b70001) and 1\u00b78 ml (95 % CI 1\u00b71, 2\u00b75; P<0\u00b70001) in AA (P race difference=0\u00b706), and forced vital capacity (FVC) was higher by 1\u00b73 ml in EA (95 % CI 1\u00b70, 1\u00b76; P<0\u00b70001) and 1\u00b75 ml (95 % CI 0\u00b78, 2\u00b73; P=0\u00b70001) in AA (P race difference=0\u00b756). Among EA, the 25(OH)D-FVC association was stronger in smokers: per 1 nmol/l higher 25(OH)D, FVC was higher by 1\u00b77 ml (95 % CI 1\u00b71, 2\u00b73) for current smokers and 1\u00b77 ml (95 % CI 1\u00b72, 2\u00b71) for former smokers, compared with 0\u00b78 ml (95 % CI 0\u00b74, 1\u00b72) for never smokers. In summary, the 25(OH)D associations with FEV1 and FVC were positive in both ancestries.

"Background: Over 90 regions of the genome have been associated with lung function to date, many of which have also been implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods: We carried out meta-analyses of exome array data and three lung function measures: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and the ratio of FEV 1 to FVC (FEV 1/FVC). These analyses by the SpiroMeta and CHARGE consortia included 60,749 individuals of European ancestry from 23 studies, and 7,721 individuals of African Ancestry from 5 studies in the discovery stage, with follow-up in up to 111,556 independent individuals. Results: We identified significant (P<2\u00b78x10 -7) associations with six SNPs: a nonsynonymous variant in RPAP1, which is predicted to be damaging, three intronic SNPs ( SEC24C, CASC17 and UQCC1) and two intergenic SNPs near to LY86 and FGF10. Expression quantitative trait loci analyses found evidence for regulation of gene expression at three signals and implicated several genes, including TYRO3 and PLAU.

We extend previous research by meta-analyzing genome-wide association studies of 1000 Genomes imputed variants in relation to pulmonary function in a multiethnic population of 90,715 individuals of European (N\u2009=\u200960,552), African (N\u2009=\u20098429), Asian (N\u2009=\u20099959), and Hispanic/Latino (N\u2009=\u200911,775) ethnicities. We identify over 50 additional loci at genome-wide significance in ancestry-specific or multiethnic meta-analyses. Using recent fine-mapping methods incorporating functional annotation, gene expression, and differences in linkage disequilibrium between ethnicities, we further shed light on potential causal variants and genes at known and newly identified loci. Several of the novel genes encode proteins with predicted or established drug targets, including KCNK2 and CDK12. Our study highlights the utility of multiethnic and integrative genomics approaches to extend existing knowledge of the genetics of lung function and clinical relevance of implicated loci.",

Data From 9 US Population-Based Cohorts: The NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study.", "Abstract": "Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs) are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. To support investigations into CLRD risk determinants and new approaches to primary prevention, we aimed to harmonize and pool respiratory data from US general population-based cohorts. Data were obtained from prospective cohorts that performed prebronchodilator spirometry and were harmonized following 2005 ATS/ERS standards. In cohorts conducting follow-up for noncardiovascular events, CLRD events were defined as hospitalizations/deaths adjudicated as CLRD-related or assigned relevant administrative codes. Coding and variable names were applied uniformly. The pooled sample included 65,251 adults in 9 cohorts followed-up for CLRD-related mortality over 653,380 person-years during 1983-2016. Average baseline age was 52 years; 56% were female; 49% were never-smokers; and racial/ethnic composition was 44% white, 22% black, 28% Hispanic/Latino, and 5% American Indian. Over 96% had complete data on smoking, clinical CLRD diagnoses, and dyspnea. After excluding invalid spirometry examinations (13%), there were 105,696 valid examinations (median, 2 per participant). Of 29,351 participants followed for CLRD hospitalizations, median follow-up was 14 years; only 5% were lost to follow-up at 10 years. The NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study provides a harmonization standard applied to a large, US population-based sample that may be used to advance epidemiologic research on CLRD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

We sequenced 821 patients with severe COPD and 973 control subjects from the COPDGene and Boston Early-Onset COPD studies, including both non-Hispanic white and African American individuals. We performed single-variant and grouped-variant analyses, and in addition, we assessed the overlap of variants between sequencing- and array-based imputation. Our most significantly associated variant was in a known region near HHIP (combined P\u2009=\u20091.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9); additional variants approaching genome-wide significance included previously described regions in CHRNA5, TNS1, and SERPINA6/SERPINA1 (the latter in African American individuals). None of our associations were clearly driven by rare variants, and we found minimal evidence of replication of genes identified by previously reported smaller sequencing studies. With WGS, we identified more than 20 million new variants, not seen with imputation, including more than 10,000 of potential importance in previously identified COPD genome-wide association study regions. WGS in severe COPD identifies a large number of potentially important functional variants, with the strongest associations being in known COPD risk loci, including HHIP and SERPINA1. Larger sample sizes will be needed to identify associated variants in novel regions of the genome.", "Keywords": ["association studies", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "whole-genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American", "Aged", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Severity of Illness Index", "White People", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dmitry", "Last Name": "Prokopenko", "Affiliation": "1 Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Phuwanat", "Last Name": "Sakornsakolpat", "Affiliation": "1 Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Heide Loehlein", "Last Name": "Fier", "Affiliation": "2 Working Group of Genomic Mathematics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Dandi", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "1 Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Margaret M", "Last Name": "Parker", "Affiliation": "1 Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Merry-Lynn N", "Last Name": "McDonald", "Affiliation": "4 Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama."}, {"First Name": "Ani", "Last Name": "Manichaikul", "Affiliation": "5 Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Stephen S", "Last Name": "Rich", "Affiliation": "5 Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "6 Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons and."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "8 Division of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Mark L", "Last Name": "Brantly", "Affiliation": "8 Division of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Lange", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Terri H", "Last Name": "Beaty", "Affiliation": "9 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland;

There are few publications describing usage patterns and respiratory risks in older adults or in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of current and former tobacco smokers from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study assessed associations between marijuana use and pulmonary outcomes. Marijuana use was defined as never, former (use over 30 days ago), or current (use within 30 days). Respiratory health was assessed using quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, pulmonary function tests and questionnaire responses about respiratory symptoms. Results: Of the total 2304 participants, 1130 (49%) never, 982 (43%) former, and 192 (8%) current marijuana users were included. Neither current nor former marijuana use was associated with increased odds of wheeze (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, OR 0.97), cough (OR 1.22; OR 0.93) or chronic bronchitis (OR 0.87; OR 1.00) when compared to never users. Current and former marijuana users had lower quantitative emphysema (P=0.004, P=0.03), higher percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%) (P<0.001, P<0.001), and percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) (p<0.001, P<0.001). Current marijuana users exhibited higher total tissue volume (P=0.003) while former users had higher air trapping (P<0.001) when compared to never marijuana users. Conclusions: Marijuana use was found to have little to no association with poor pulmonary health in older current and former tobacco smokers after adjusting for covariates. Higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was observed among current marijuana users. However, higher joint years was associated with more chronic bronchitis symptoms (e.g., wheeze), and this study cannot determine if long-term heavy marijuana smoking in the absence of tobacco smoking is associated with lung symptoms, airflow obstruction, or emphysema, particularly in those who have never smoked tobacco cigarettes.", "Keywords": ["Lung", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "computed tomography scan", "cross-sectional", "emphysema", "epidemiology", "forced expiratory volume", "forced vital capacity", "marijuana", "pulmonary", "respiratory", "smoking", "tobacco"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Madeline A", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Sean R", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Gregory L", "Last Name": "Kinney", "Affiliation": "2-Department of Epidemiology, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora."}, {"First Name": "Donald P", "Last Name": "Tashkin", "Affiliation": "3-Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles."}, {"First Name": "Prescott G", "Last Name": "Woodruff", "Affiliation": "4-Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep and Allergy, Department of Medicine and Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "5-Departments of Radiology, Medicine and Biomedical Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City."}, {"First Name": "Richard E", "Last Name": "Kanner", "Affiliation": "6-University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City."}, {"First Name": "Christopher B", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "3-Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles."}, {"First Name": "M Brad", "Last Name": "Drummond", "Affiliation": "8-Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "9-Columbia University, Division of General Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Oelsner", "Affiliation": "9-Columbia University, Division of General Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Barry J", "Last Name": "Make", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "MeiLan K", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "10-University Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor."}, {"First Name": "Nadia N", "Last Name": "Hansel", "Affiliation": "11-Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Wanda K", "Last Name": "O'Neal", "Affiliation": "8-Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."}, {"First Name": "Russell P", "Last Name": "Bowler", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}], "Journal": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Miami, Fla.)", "PubDate": "2018Jan24"}, {"PMID": "29584453", "Title": "Rural Residence and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations.

The association between rural residence and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations remains unclear.Objectives: In this work, we sought to determine the independent association between rural residence and COPD-related outcomes, including COPD exacerbations, airflow obstruction, and symptom burden.Methods: A total of 1,684 SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study) participants with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity < 0.70 had geocoding-defined rural-urban residence status determined (N = 204 rural and N = 1,480 urban). Univariate and multivariate logistic and negative binomial regressions were performed to assess the independent association between rurality and COPD outcomes, including exacerbations, lung function, and symptom burden. The primary exposure of interest was rural residence, determined by geocoding of the home address to the block level at the time of study enrollment. Additional covariates of interest included demographic and clinical characteristics, occupation, and occupational exposures. The primary outcome measures were exacerbations determined over a 1-year course after enrollment by quarterly telephone calls and at an annual research clinic visit. The odds ratio (OR) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) of exacerbations that required treatment with medications, including steroids or antibiotics (total exacerbations), and exacerbations leading to hospitalization (severe exacerbations) were determined after adjusting for relevant covariates.Results: Rural residence was independently associated with a 70% increase in the odds of total exacerbations (OR, 1.70 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-2.56]; P = 0.012) and a 46% higher incidence rate of total exacerbations (IRR 1.46 [95% CI, 1.02-2.10]; P = 0.039). There was no association between rural residence and severe exacerbations. Agricultural occupation was independently associated with increased odds and incidence of total and severe exacerbations. Inclusion of agricultural occupation in the analysis attenuated the association between rural residence and the odds and incidence rate of total exacerbations (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.00-2.32]; P = 0.05 and IRR 1.39 [95% CI, 0.97-1.99]; P = 0.07). There was no difference in symptoms or airflow obstruction between rural and urban participants.Conclusions: Rural residence is independently associated with increased odds and incidence of total, but not severe, COPD exacerbations. These associations are not fully explained by agriculture-related exposures, highlighting the need for future research into potential mechanisms of the increased risk of COPD exacerbations in the rural population.", "Keywords": ["chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "exacerbation", "rural health"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert M", "Last Name": "Burkes", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Amanda J", "Last Name": "Gassett", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, and."}, {"First Name": "Agathe S", "Last Name": "Ceppe", "Affiliation": "Marsico Lung Institute/Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Wayne", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Marsico Lung Institute/Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Wanda K", "Last Name": "O'Neal", "Affiliation": "Marsico Lung Institute/Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Prescott G", "Last Name": "Woodruff", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep and Allergy, Department of Medicine and Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Jerry A", "Last Name": "Krishnan", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep, and Allergy, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "MeiLan K", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, Michigan."}, {"First Name": "Fernando J", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro P", "Last Name": "Comellas", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa."}, {"First Name": "Allison A", "Last Name": "Lambert", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Joel D", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, and."}, {"First Name": "Mark T", "Last Name": "Dransfield", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama."}, {"First Name": "J Michael", "Last Name": "Wells", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama."}, {"First Name": "Richard E", "Last Name": "Kanner", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Paine", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"First Name": "Eugene R", "Last Name": "Bleecker", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Immunologic Diseases, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and."}, {"First Name": "Laura M", "Last Name": "Paulin", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Nadia N", "Last Name": "Hansel", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "M Bradley", "Last Name": "Drummond", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Current and former investigators of the SPIROMICS sites and reading centers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Annals of the American Thoracic Society", "PubDate": "2018Jul"}, {"PMID": "29529382", "Title": "Prognostic Significance of Large Airway Dimensions on Computed Tomography in the General Population.

Baldwin, Cournand, and Richards defined chronic pulmonary insufficiency by the presence of respiratory symptoms, radiologic evidence of pulmonary emphysema on chest radiography, and physiologic gas trapping. A decade later, airflow obstruction on spirometry was added to the definition and insufficiency became a disease. Contemporary studies are reviving the diagnostic approach described by these early luminaries, with researchers finding that symptomatic smokers with preserved spirometry have increased exacerbations and that smokers and non-smokers with normal spirometry but emphysema on chest computed tomography have increased mortality. Hence, the Baldwin-Cournand-Richards concept of disease defined by respiratory symptoms, radiologic findings, and physiology-regardless of spirometric criteria-is being rediscovered. Baldwin, Cournand, and Richards also stated that \"functionally, it is obvious that the pulmonary and circulatory apparatus are one unit,\" and they defined combined cardiopulmonary insufficiency as chronic pulmonary insufficiency with (left or right) cardiac and pulmonary artery enlargement. They appreciated the complexity of these interactions, which include the potential role of gas trapping in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; the impact of emphysema on blood flow in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; multiple contributions to cor pulmonale with increased pulmonary artery pressure; and cor pulmonale parvus in emphysema; all of which may be amenable to specific therapeutic interventions.

Emphysema subtypes can be defined on CT as a variety of textures with certain spatial prevalence. However, most existing approaches for learning emphysema subtypes on CT are limited to texture features, which are sub-optimal due to the lack of spatial information. In this work, we exploit a standardized spatial mapping of the lung and propose a novel framework for combining spatial and texture information to discover spatially-informed lung texture patterns (sLTPs). Our spatial mapping is demonstrated to be a powerful tool to study emphysema spatial locations over different populations. The discovered sLTPs are shown to have high reproducibility, ability to encode standard emphysema subtypes, and significant associations with clinical characteristics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Humans", "Lung", "Poisson Distribution", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elsa D", "Last Name": "Angelini", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pallavi P", "Last Name": "Balte", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Medicine and Biomedical Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John H M", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jingkuan", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Laine", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

We demonstrate that in vivo central airway branch variants are present in 26.5% of the general population, are unchanged over 10 y, and exhibit strong familial aggregation. The most common airway branch variant is associated with COPD in two cohorts (n = 5,054), with greater central airway bifurcation density, and with emphysema throughout the lung. The second most common airway branch variant is associated with COPD among smokers, with narrower airway lumens in all lobes, and with genetic polymorphisms within the FGF10 gene.

study identifies new asthma risk loci that colocalize with immune-cell enhancer marks.", "Abstract": "We examined common variation in asthma risk by conducting a meta-analysis of worldwide asthma genome-wide association studies (23,948 asthma cases, 118,538 controls) of individuals from ethnically diverse populations. We identified five new asthma loci, found two new associations at two known asthma loci, established asthma associations at two loci previously implicated in the comorbidity of asthma plus hay fever, and confirmed nine known loci. Investigation of pleiotropy showed large overlaps in genetic variants with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The enrichment in enhancer marks at asthma risk loci, especially in immune cells, suggested a major role of these loci in the regulation of immunologically related mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

However, methodological issues, including the use of self-reported smoking status and mixed cell types have made previously identified alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression difficult to interpret. In this study, we examined associations of tobacco exposure with DNA methylation and gene expression, utilizing a biomarker of tobacco exposure (urine cotinine) and CD14+ purified monocyte samples from 934 participants of the community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Urine cotinine levels were measured using an immunoassay. DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with microarrays. Multivariate linear regression was used to test for associations adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and study site. Urine cotinine levels were associated with methylation of 176 CpGs [false discovery rate (FDR)<0.01]. Four CpGs not previously identified by studies of non-purified blood samples nominally replicated (P value<0.05) with plasma cotinine-associated methylation in 128 independent monocyte samples. Urine cotinine levels associated with expression of 12 genes (FDR<0.01), including increased expression of P2RY6 (Beta \u00b1 standard error = 0.078 \u00b1 0.008, P = 1.99\u00a0\u00d7 10-22), a gene previously identified to be involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. No cotinine-associated (FDR<0.01) methylation profiles significantly (FDR<0.01) correlated with cotinine-associated (FDR<0.01) gene expression profiles.

Large cohorts of population-based research studies reported high correlations of emphysema quantification between full-lung (FL) and cardiac CT scans, using thresholding-based measurements. This work extends a hidden Markov measure field (HMMF) model-based segmentation method for automated emphysema quantification on cardiac CT scans.

In the combined meta-analysis, we identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide significance, including 13 new associations with COPD. Nine of these 13 loci have been associated with lung function in general population samples, while 4 (EEFSEC, DSP, MTCL1, and SFTPD) are new. We noted two loci shared with pulmonary fibrosis (FAM13A and DSP) but that had opposite risk alleles for COPD. None of our loci overlapped with genome-wide associations for asthma, although one locus has been implicated in joint susceptibility to asthma and obesity. We also identified genetic correlation between COPD and asthma. Our findings highlight new loci associated with COPD, demonstrate the importance of specific loci associated with lung function to COPD, and identify potential regions of genetic overlap between COPD

A meta-analysis from two large cohorts of current and former smokers with and without COPD [SPIROMICS (N = 750); COPDGene (N = 590)] was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with measurement of 88 blood proteins (protein quantitative trait loci; pQTLs). PQTLs consistently replicated between the two cohorts. Features of pQTLs were compared to previously reported expression QTLs (eQTLs). Inference of causal relations of pQTL genotypes, biomarker measurements, and four clinical COPD phenotypes (airflow obstruction, emphysema, exacerbation history, and chronic bronchitis) were explored using conditional independence tests. We identified 527 highly significant (p < 8 X 10-10) pQTLs in 38 (43%) of blood proteins tested. Most pQTL SNPs were novel with low overlap to eQTL SNPs. The pQTL SNPs explained >10% of measured variation in 13 protein biomarkers, with a single SNP (rs7041; p = 10-392) explaining 71%-75% of the measured variation in vitamin D binding protein (gene = GC). Some of these pQTLs [e.g., pQTLs for VDBP, sRAGE (gene = AGER), surfactant protein D (gene = SFTPD), and TNFRSF10C] have been previously associated with COPD phenotypes. Most pQTLs were local (cis), but distant (trans) pQTL SNPs in the ABO blood group locus were the top pQTL SNPs for five proteins. The inclusion of pQTL SNPs improved the clinical predictive value for the established association of sRAGE and emphysema, and the explanation of variance (R2) for emphysema improved from 0.3 to 0.4 when the pQTL SNP was included in the model along with clinical covariates. Causal modeling provided insight into specific pQTL-disease relationships for airflow obstruction and emphysema. In conclusion, given the frequency of highly significant local pQTLs, the large amount of variance potentially explained by pQTL, and the differences observed between pQTLs and eQTLs SNPs, we recommend that protein biomarker-disease association studies take into account the potential effect of common local SNPs and that pQTLs be integrated along with eQTLs to uncover disease mechanisms. Large-scale blood biomarker studies would also benefit from close attention to the ABO blood group.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ABO Blood-Group System", "Biomarkers", "Blood Proteins",

"Multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) is increasingly taking a central role in identifying subphenotypes within chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and other lung-related disease populations, allowing for the quantification of the amount and distribution of altered parenchyma along with the characterization of airway and vascular anatomy. The embedding of quantitative CT (QCT) into a multicenter trial with a variety of scanner makes and models along with the variety of pressures within a clinical radiology setting has proven challenging, especially in the context of a longitudinal study. SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study), sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, has established a QCT lung assessment system (QCT-LAS), which includes scanner-specific imaging protocols for lung assessment at total lung capacity and residual volume. Also included are monthly scanning of a standardized test object and web-based tools for subject registration, protocol assignment, and data transmission coupled with automated image interrogation to assure protocol adherence. The SPIROMICS QCT-LAS has been adopted and contributed to by a growing number of other multicenter studies in which imaging is embedded. The key components of the SPIROMICS QCT-LAS along with evidence of implementation success are described herein. While imaging technologies continue to evolve, the required components of a QCT-LAS provide the framework for future studies, and the QCT results emanating from SPIROMICS and the growing number of other studies using the SPIROMICS QCT-LAS will provide a shared resource of image-derived pulmonary metrics.", "Keywords": ["asthma", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "lung imaging", "pulmonary airways", "pulmonary parenchyma"], "MeSH terms": ["Asthma", "Body Mass Index", "Emphysema", "Humans", "Lung", "Lung Diseases", "Lung Volume Measurements", "Multicenter Studies as Topic", "Multidetector Computed Tomography", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jered P", "Last Name": "Sieren", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "Newell", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Medicine and Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University College of Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eugene R", "Last Name": "Bleecker", "Affiliation": "3 Center for Human Genomics and Personalized Medicine, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Nathan", "Last Name": "Burnette", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth E", "Last Name": "Carretta", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Couper", "Affiliation": "4 Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Goldin", "Affiliation": "5 Department of Radiology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Junfeng", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa."}, {"First Name": "MeiLan K", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "6 Department of Internal Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Nadia N", "Last Name": "Hansel", "Affiliation": "7 Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Richard E", "Last Name": "Kanner", "Affiliation": "8 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, {"First Name": "Ella A", "Last Name": "Kazerooni", "Affiliation": "9 Department of Radiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan."}, {"First Name": "Fernando J", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "10 Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Rennard", "Affiliation": "11 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska, Omaha, Nebraska; and."}, {"First Name": "Prescott G", "Last Name": "Woodruff", "Affiliation": "12 Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Radiology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "SPIROMICS Research Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2016Oct01"}, {"PMID": "27233746", "Title": "Association between air pollution and coronary artery calcification within six metropolitan areas in the USA (the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution): a longitudinal cohort study.", "Abstract": "Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5) and traffic-related air pollutant concentrations are associated with cardiovascular risk.

Here, we characterized and controlled for this diversity in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We simultaneously estimated population-structure principal components (PCs) robust to familial relatedness and pairwise kinship coefficients (KCs) robust to population structure, admixture, and Hardy-Weinberg departures. The PCs revealed substantial genetic differentiation within and among six self-identified background groups (Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Central and South American). To control for variation among groups, we developed a multi-dimensional clustering method to define a \"genetic-analysis group\" variable that retains many properties of self-identified background while achieving substantially greater genetic homogeneity within groups and including participants with non-specific self-identification. In GWASs of 22 biomedical traits, we used a linear mixed model (LMM) including pairwise empirical KCs to account for familial relatedness, PCs for ancestry, and genetic-analysis groups for additional group-associated effects. Including the genetic-analysis group as a covariate accounted for significant trait variation in 8 of 22 traits, even after we fit 20 PCs. Additionally, genetic-analysis groups had significant heterogeneity of residual variance for 20 of 22\u00a0traits, and modeling this heteroscedasticity within the LMM reduced genomic inflation for 19 traits. Furthermore, fitting an LMM\u00a0that utilized a genetic-analysis group rather than a self-identified background group achieved higher power to detect previously reported associations.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of lung function measures have identified several trait-associated loci, but explain only a modest portion of the phenotypic variability. We postulated that integrating pathway-based methods with GWASs of pulmonary function and airflow obstruction would identify a broader repertoire of genes and processes influencing these traits. We performed two independent GWASs of lung function and applied gene set enrichment analysis to one of the studies and validated the results using the second GWAS. We identified 131 significantly enriched gene sets associated with lung function and clustered them into larger biological modules involved in diverse processes including development, immunity, cell signaling, proliferation and arachidonic acid. We found that enrichment of gene sets was not driven by GWAS-significant variants or loci, but instead by those with less stringent association P-values. Next, we applied pathway enrichment analysis to a meta-analyzed GWAS of airflow obstruction. We identified several biologic modules that functionally overlapped with those associated with pulmonary function. However, differences were also noted, including enrichment of extracellular matrix (ECM) processes specifically in the airflow obstruction study. Network analysis of the ECM module implicated a candidate gene, matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10), as a putative disease target. We used a knockout mouse model to functionally validate MMP10's role in influencing lung's susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced emphysema. By integrating pathway analysis with population-based genomics, we unraveled biologic processes underlying pulmonary function traits and identified a candidate gene for obstructive lung disease.",

For thoracic CT and MRI, the main COPD research tools, disease biomarkers are being validated that go beyond anatomy and structure to include pulmonary functional measurements such as regional ventilation, perfusion, and inflammation. In addition, there has also been a drive to improve spatial and contrast resolution while at the same time reducing or eliminating radiation exposure. Therefore, this review focuses on our evolving understanding of patient-relevant and clinically important COPD endpoints and how current and emerging MRI and CT tools and measurements may be exploited for their identification, quantification, and utilization. Since reviews of the imaging physics of pulmonary CT and MRI and reviews of other COPD imaging methods were previously published and well-summarized, we focus on the current clinical challenges in COPD and the potential of newly emerging MR and CT imaging measurements to address them. Here we summarize MRI and CT imaging methods and their clinical translation for generating reproducible and sensitive measurements of COPD related to pulmonary ventilation and perfusion as well as parenchyma morphology. The key clinical problems in COPD provide an important framework in which pulmonary imaging needs to rapidly move in order to address the staggering burden, costs, as well as the mortality and morbidity associated with COPD.", "Keywords": ["COPD", "dual energy CT", "phenotypes", "pulmonary MRI", "pulmonary ventilation and perfusion", "quantitative CT"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Disease Progression", "Fluorine", "Gadolinium", "Helium", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Isotopes", "Lung", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Perfusion", "Phenotype", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Reproducibility of Results", "Swine", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Treatment Outcome", "Xenon Isotopes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, National Jewish Health Center, Denver, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Division of General Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edwin J R", "Last Name": "van Beek", "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Imaging Centre, Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."}, {"First Name": "Grace", "Last Name": "Parraga", "Affiliation": "Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "IWPFI Investigators", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI", "PubDate": "2016Mar"}, {"PMID": "26131930", "Title": "Directional dominance on stature and cognition in\u00a0diverse human populations.", "Abstract": "Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the first to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness. However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically significant associations between summed runs\u00a0of homozygosity and four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P < 1 \u00d7 10(-300), 2.1 \u00d7 10(-6), 2.5 \u00d7 10(-10) and 1.8 \u00d7 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection, this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Evolution", "Blood Pressure", "Body Height", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Cognition", "Cohort Studies", "Educational Status", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Genome, Human", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Lung Volume Measurements", "Male", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter K", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "Usher Institute for Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, Scotland."}, {"First Name": "Tonu", "Last Name": "Esko", "Affiliation": "Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia."}, {"First Name": "Hannele", "Last Name": "Mattsson", "Affiliation": "Unit of Public Health Genomics, National Institute for Health and Welfare, P.O.

Quantitative CT is useful for identifying and sequentially evaluating the extent of emphysematous lung destruction, changes in airway walls, and expiratory air trapping. However, visual assessment of CT scans remains important to describe patterns of altered lung structure in COPD. The classification system proposed and illustrated in this article provides a structured approach to visual and quantitative assessment of COPD. Emphysema is classified as centrilobular (subclassified as trace, mild, moderate, confluent, and advanced destructive emphysema), panlobular, and paraseptal (subclassified as mild or substantial). Additional important visual features include airway wall thickening, inflammatory small airways disease, tracheal abnormalities, interstitial lung abnormalities, pulmonary arterial enlargement, and bronchiectasis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Radiology (D.A.L.) and Medicine (J.D.C.), National Jewish Health, 1400 Jackson St, Denver, CO 80206;

Epidemiologic studies have found inconsistent associations between lung function and AF, and none have studied pulmonary emphysema, which overlaps only partially with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the general population. The aim of this study was to assess the relation among lung function measured by spirometry, the percentage of emphysema-like lung on computed tomography, and incident AF. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a multicenter cohort study following 6,814 subjects free of clinical cardiovascular disease, including AF, at baseline. Spirometry was performed in a subset of 3,965 participants. Percentage emphysema was defined on baseline computed tomographic scans as lung regions <950 Hounsfield units. Incident AF was identified from hospital discharge diagnosis and Medicare claims data. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess independent associations of lung volumes and percentage emphysema with AF. A total of 3,811 participants with valid spirometric results were included in this study. The mean age was 64.5 \u00b1 9.8\u00a0years, and 49.4% were men. AF developed in 149 subjects (3.8%) over a mean follow-up period of 4.1\u00a0years after spirometry. Lower levels of forced expiratory volume at 1\u00a0second and forced vital capacity were associated with a higher risk for AF (hazard ratios 1.21 and 1.19 per 500\u00a0ml, respectively, p <0.001) after adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Percentage emphysema was not significantly related to AF. In conclusion, in a multiethnic community-based sample of subjects free of cardiovascular disease at baseline, functional airflow limitation was related to a higher risk for AF.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Severity of Illness Index"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Harjit", "Last Name": "Chahal", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York."}, {"First Name": "Susan R", "Last Name": "Heckbert", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Health Studies Coordinating Center, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bluemke", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Aditya", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Mohammadali", "Last Name": "Habibi", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Alvaro", "Last Name": "Alonso", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Kronmal", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Joao A C", "Last Name": "Lima", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Karol E", "Last Name": "Watson", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, University of California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Kiang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Lewis J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Greenland", "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois.

Genome-wide association analysis of CMH in COPD and non-COPD subjects yielded no genome-wide significance after replication. In COPD, our top SNP (rs10461985, p=5.43\u00d710(-5)) was located in the GDNF-AS1 gene that is functionally associated with the GDNF gene. Expression of GDNF in bronchial biopsies of COPD patients was significantly associated with CMH (p=0.007).

The relationship between PTX3 and right ventricular (RV) structure and function is not known. We included men and women with magnetic resonance imaging assessment of RV structure and function and measurement of PTX3 from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a study of individuals free of clinical cardiovascular disease. Multivariable linear regression estimated associations between PTX3 protein levels and RV measures after adjusting for demographic characteristics, anthropometrics, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and corresponding left ventricular (LV) parameters. Instrumental variable analysis exploiting Mendelian randomization was attempted using two-stage least squares regression. The study sample included 1,779 participants with available PTX3 levels, RV measures, and all covariables. Mean PTX3 level was 2.1 ng/mL. Higher PTX3 was independently associated with greater RV mass and larger RV end-diastolic volume with and without adjustment for the corresponding LV parameters or C-reactive protein (all P < .05). There was no association between PTX3 and RV ejection fraction or stroke volume. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were not associated with PTX3 protein levels or RV measures after accounting for race. Instrumental variable analysis could not be reliably performed. Higher PTX3 protein levels were associated with greater RV mass and larger RV end-diastolic volume.

We investigated whether asthma and COPD have common underlying genetic factors, performing genome-wide association studies for both asthma and COPD and combining the results in meta-analyses. Three loci showed potential involvement in both diseases: chr2p24.3, chr5q23.1 and chr13q14.2, containing DDX1, COMMD10 (both participating in the nuclear factor (NF) \u03ba\u03b2 pathway) and GNG5P5, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs9534578 in GNG5P5 reached genome-wide significance after first replication phase (p=9.96\u00d710(-9)). The second replication phase, in seven independent cohorts, provided no significant replication. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis in blood cells and lung tissue on the top 20 associated SNPs identified two SNPs in COMMD10 that influenced gene expression. Inflammatory processes differ in asthma and COPD and are mediated by NF-\u03ba\u03b2, which could be driven by the same underlying genes, COMMD10 and DDX1. None of the SNPs reached genome-wide significance. Our eQTL studies support a functional role for two COMMD10 SNPs, since they influence gene expression in both blood cells and lung tissue. Our findings suggest that there is either no common genetic component in asthma and COPD or, alternatively, different environmental factors, e.g. lifestyle and occupation in different countries and

However, the reliability of this approach is limited by several factors that affect the CT intensity distributions in the lung. This work presents a novel method for emphysema quantification, based on parametric modeling of intensity distributions and a hidden Markov measure field model to segment emphysematous regions. The framework adapts to the characteristics of an image to ensure a robust quantification of emphysema under varying CT imaging protocols, and differences in parenchymal intensity distributions due to factors such as inspiration level. Compared to standard approaches, the presented model involves a larger number of parameters, most of which can be estimated from data, to handle the variability encountered in lung CT scans. The method was applied on a longitudinal data set with 87 subjects and a total of 365 scans acquired with varying imaging protocols. The resulting emphysema estimates had very high intra-subject correlation values.

Similar to lung function measured by spirometry, lung measures obtained by QCT vary by demographic and anthropomorphic factors including sex, race/ethnicity, and height in asymptomatic nonsmokers. Hence, accounting for these factors is necessary to define abnormal from normal QCT values. Prediction equations for QCT may be derived from a sample of asymptomatic individuals to estimate reference values. This review article describes the methodology of reference equation development using, as an example, quantitative densitometry to detect pulmonary emphysema. The process described is generalizable to other QCT measures, including lung volumes, airway dimensions, and gas-trapping. Pulmonary emphysema is defined morphologically by airspace enlargement with alveolar wall destruction and has been shown to correlate with low lung attenuation estimated by QCT. Deriving reference values for a normal quantity of low lung attenuation requires 3 steps. First, criteria that define normal must be established. Second, variables for inclusion must be selected on the basis of an understanding of subject-specific, scanner-specific, and protocol-specific factors that influence lung attenuation. Finally, a reference sample of normal individuals must be selected that is representative of the population in which QCT will be used to detect pulmonary emphysema. Sources of bias and confounding inherent to reference values are also discussed. Reference equation development is a multistep process that can define normal values for QCT measures such as lung attenuation. Normative reference values will increase the utility of QCT in both research and clinical practice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pulmonary Emphysema", "Reference Values", "Risk Factors", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of thoracic imaging", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23932860", "Title": "Relationship of CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen with right ventricular structure and function: the MESA-Right Ventricle Study.", "Abstract": "Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of disease associated with the left ventricle (LV); yet, our understanding of the effect of inflammation on the right ventricle (RV) is quite limited.", "Keywords": ["Heart failure", "Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis", "Right ventricle", "Systemic inflammation"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cohort Studies", "Ethnicity", "Female", "Fibrinogen", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Ventricular Function, Right"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael O", "Last Name": "Harhay", "Affiliation": "Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Russell P", "Last Name": "Tracy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emilia", "Last Name": "Bagiella", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Diane", "Last Name": "Pinder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "W Gregory", "Last Name": "Hundley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bluemke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Kronmal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joao A C", "Last Name": "Lima", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven M", "Last Name": "Kawut", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "International journal of cardiology", "PubDate": "2013Oct09"}, {"PMID": "23900982", "Title": "APOM and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with lung function and per cent emphysema.", "Abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to cardiovascular disease; however, there are few studies on the associations of cardiovascular genes with COPD.

Using purified primary monocytes from subjects in a large community-based cohort (n = 1264), we characterized methylation (>485 000 CpG sites) and mRNA expression (>48K transcripts) and carried out genome-wide association analyses of 8370 expression phenotypes. We identified 11 203 potential cis-acting CpG loci whose degree of methylation was associated with gene expression (eMS) at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.001. Most of the associations were consistent in effect size and direction of effect across sex and three ethnicities. Contrary to expectation, these eMS were not predominately enriched in promoter regions, or CpG islands, but rather in the 3' UTR, gene bodies, CpG shores or 'offshore' sites, and both positive and negative correlations between methylation and expression were observed across all locations. eMS were enriched for regions predicted to be regulatory by ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) data in multiple cell types, particularly enhancers. One of the strongest association signals detected (P < 2.2 \u00d7 10(-308)) was a methylation probe (cg17005068) in the promoter/enhancer region of the glutathione S-transferase theta 1 gene (GSTT1, encoding the detoxification enzyme) with GSTT1 mRNA expression.

Genome-wide association studies, mostly in populations of European ancestry, have identified numerous asthma-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Studies in populations with diverse ancestries allow both for identification of robust associations that replicate across ethnic groups and for improved resolution of associated loci due to different patterns of linkage disequilibrium between ethnic groups. Here we report on an analysis of 745 African-American subjects with asthma and 3,238 African-American control subjects from the Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) Consortium, including analysis of SNPs imputed using 1,000 Genomes reference panels and adjustment for local ancestry. We show strong evidence that variation near RAD50/IL13, implicated in studies of European ancestry individuals, replicates in individuals largely of African ancestry.

elasticity and lung function. Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation could potentially decrease elasticity of both vasculature and lung tissue. We examined biomarkers, large arterial elasticity and small arterial elasticity (SAE), and forced vital capacity (FVC) in a period cross-sectional design in the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis, which recruited 1823 women and 1803 men, age range 45 to 84 years, black, white, Hispanic, and Chinese, free of clinically recognized cardiovascular disease. Radial artery tonometric pulse waveform registration was performed and large arterial elasticity and SAE were derived from diastole. Spirometric data and markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation (soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, fibrinogen, hs-C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6) were obtained. Mean large arterial elasticity was 13.7 \u00b1 5.5 mL/mm Hg \u00d7 10 and SAE was 4.6 \u00b1 2.6 mL/mm Hg \u00d7 100. Mean FVC was 3192 \u00b1 956.0 mL and forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 2386 \u00b1 734.5 mL. FVC was about 40 \u00b1 5 mL higher per SD of SAE, stronger in men than women. The association was slightly weaker with large arterial elasticity, with no sex interaction. After regression adjustment for demographic, anthropometric, and cardiovascular risk factors, the biomarkers tended to be related to reduced SAE and FVC, particularly in men. These biomarker associations suggest important cardiovascular disease risk alterations that occur concurrently with lower arterial elasticity and lung function. The observed positive association of SAE with FVC and with forced expiratory volume in 1 second in middle-aged to older free-living people is consistent with the hypothesis of parallel physiological pathways for elastic changes in the vasculature and in lung parenchymal tissue.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arteries", "Atherosclerosis", "Biomarkers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Risk Factors", "Vascular Stiffness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Duprez", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Division, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware St Se, MMC 508, Minneapolis, MN, USA. dupre007@umn.edu"}, {"First Name": "Mary O", "Last Name": "Hearst", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pamela L", "Last Name": "Lutsey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Herrington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pamela", "Last Name": "Ouyang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bluemke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "McAllister", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Carr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}, {"PMID": "23107018", "Title": "Obesity is associated with a lower resting oxygen saturation in the ambulatory elderly: results from the cardiovascular health study.", "Abstract": "The contribution of obesity to hypoxemia has not been reported in a community-based study.
