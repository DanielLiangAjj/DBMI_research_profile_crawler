Studies to date have defined the regulatory controls and function of PKC\u03b1 entirely based upon the previously annotated ubiquitously expressed prototypical isoform. From RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis in murine heart, we identified a previously unannotated PKC\u03b1 variant produced by alternative RNA splicing. This PKC\u03b1 transcript variant, which we named PKC\u03b1-novel exon (PKC\u03b1-NE), contains an extra exon between exon 16 and exon 17, and is specifically detected in adult mouse cardiac and skeletal muscle, but not other tissues; it is also detected in human hearts. This transcript variant yields a PKC\u03b1 isoform with additional 16 amino acids inserted in its COOH-terminal variable region.

Our unbiased proteomic analysis identified a specific interaction between PKC\u03b1-NE and eukaryotic elongation factor-1\u03b1 (eEF1A1).

PKD1 (the founding member of this enzyme family) has been implicated in the phosphorylation of substrates that regulate cardiac hypertrophy, contraction, and susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury, and de novo PRKD1 (protein kinase D1 gene) mutations have been identified in patients with syndromic congenital heart disease. However, cardiomyocytes coexpress all three PKDs. Although stimulus-specific activation patterns for PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 have been identified in cardiomyocytes, progress toward identifying PKD isoform-specific functions in the heart have been hampered by significant gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate PKD activity. This review incorporates recent conceptual breakthroughs in our understanding of various alternative mechanisms for PKD activation, with an emphasis on recent evidence that PKDs activate certain effector responses as dimers, to consider the role of PKD isoforms in signaling pathways that drive cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The focus is on whether the recently identified activation mechanisms that enhance the signaling repertoire of PKD family enzymes provide novel therapeutic strategies to target PKD enzymes and prevent or slow the evolution of cardiac injury and pathological cardiac remodeling.

Since PKC\u03b4 can be proteolytically cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, the prevailing assumption has been that the kinase domain fragment (\u03b4KD) freed from autoinhibitory constraints imposed by the regulatory domain is catalytically competent and that Thr507 phosphorylation is not required for \u03b4KD activity.

This study uses Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, a method that exaggerates phosphorylation-dependent mobility shifts, to overcome this technical limitation. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE resolves PKD1 as distinct molecular species (indicative of pools of enzyme with distinct phosphorylation profiles) in unstimulated cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes; as a result, attempts to track PKD1 mobility shifts that result from agonist activation were only moderately successful. In contrast, PKD2 and PKD3 are recovered from resting cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes as single molecular species; both enzymes display robust mobility shifts in Phos-tag SDS-PAGE in response to treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate, thrombin, PDGF, or H2O2.

The present study uses MS-based methods to identify PKC\u03b4 phosphorylation at Thr(50) and Ser(645) (in resting and PMA-treated cardiomyocytes) as well as Thr(37), Thr(38), Ser(130), Thr(164), Thr(211), Thr(215), Ser(218), Thr(295), Ser(299) and Thr(656) (as sites that increase with PMA). We focused on the consequences of phosphorylation at Ser(130) and Thr(141) (sites just N-terminal to the pseudosubstrate domain). We show that S130D and T141E substitutions co-operate to increase PKC\u03b4's basal lipid-independent activity and that Ser(130)/Thr(141) di-phosphorylation influences PKC\u03b4's substrate specificity.

The present study shows that S130D and T141E substitutions increase PKC\u03b4's threonine kinase activity indirectly by decreasing G loop phosphorylation at Ser(357). A S130F substitution [that mimics a S130F single-nt polymorphism (SNP) identified in some human populations] also increases PKC\u03b4's maximal lipid-dependent catalytic activity and confers threonine kinase activity. Finally, we show that Ser(130)/Thr(141) phosphorylations relieve auto-inhibitory constraints that limit PKC\u03b4's activity and substrate specificity in a cell-based context.

PKC isoforms are traditionally viewed as allosterically activated enzymes that are recruited to membranes by growth factor receptor-generated lipid cofactors. An inherent assumption of this conventional model of PKC isoform activation is that PKCs act exclusively at membrane-delimited substrates and that PKC catalytic activity is an inherent property of each enzyme that is not altered by the activation process. This traditional model of PKC activation does not adequately explain the many well-documented actions of PKC enzymes in mitochondrial, nuclear, and cardiac sarcomeric (non-sarcolemmal) subcellular compartments. Recent studies address this dilemma by identifying stimulus-specific differences in the mechanisms for PKC isoform activation during growth factor activation versus oxidative stress. This review discusses a number of non-canonical redox-triggered mechanisms that can alter the catalytic properties and subcellular compartmentation patterns of PKC enzymes. While some redox-activated mechanisms act at structural determinants that are common to all PKCs, the redox-dependent mechanism for PKC\u03b4 activation requires Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of a unique phosphorylation motif on this enzyme and is isoform specific.

PKC\u03b4 is released from membranes as a Tyr(313)-phosphorylated enzyme that displays a high level of lipid-independent activity and altered substrate specificity during oxidative stress.

This modification increases catalytic activity, including that toward an autophosphorylation site (Ser(916)) in a postsynaptic density-95/disks large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif at the extreme COOH terminus. However, there is growing evidence that PKD1 activation can also result from a PKC-independent autocatalytic reaction at Ser(744)/Ser(748) and that certain stimuli increase in PKD1 phosphorylation at Ser(744)/S(748) without an increase in autophosphorylation at Ser(916). This study exposes a mechanism that results in a discrepancy between PKD1 COOH-terminal autocatalytic activity and activity toward other substrates. We show that PKD1 constructs harboring COOH-terminal epitope tags display high levels of in vitro activation loop autocatalytic activity and activity toward syntide-2 (a peptide substrate), but no Ser(916) autocatalytic activity. Cell-based studies show that the COOH-terminal tag, adjacent to PKD1's PDZ1-binding motif, does not grossly influence PKD1 partitioning between soluble and particulate fractions in resting cells or PKD1 translocation to the particulate fraction following treatment with PMA. However, a COOH-terminal tag that confers a high level of activation loop autocatalytic activity decreases the PKC requirement for agonist-dependent PKD1 activation in cells. The recognition that COOH-terminal tags alter PKD1's pharmacological profile is important from a technical standpoint.

The R389G polymorphism influences coupling to the Gs-cAMP pathway.

A second S49G polymorphism is implicated in the evolution of heart failure, but the mechanism remains uncertain. This study shows that position 49 and 389 polymorphisms function in a coordinate manner to influence agonist-dependent cAMP/PKA and ERK responses. cAMP/PKA and ERK responses are more robust in HEK293 cells that heterologously overexpress G(49)-\u03b21ARs, compared with S(49)-\u03b21ARs.
