[{"PMID": "35072087", "Title": "A Generative Modeling Approach to Calibrated Predictions: A Use Case on Menstrual Cycle Length Prediction.", "Abstract": "We explore how to quantify uncertainty when designing predictive models for healthcare to provide well-calibrated results. Uncertainty quantification and calibration are critical in medicine, as one must not only accommodate the variability of the underlying physiology, but adjust to the uncertain data collection and reporting process. This occurs not only on the context of electronic health records (i.e., the clinical documentation process), but on mobile health as well (i.e., user specific self-tracking patterns must be accounted for). In this work, we show that accurate uncertainty estimation is directly relevant to an important health application: the prediction of menstrual cycle length, based on self-tracked information. We take advantage of a flexible generative model that accommodates under-dispersed distributions via two degrees of freedom to fit the mean and variance of the observed cycle lengths. From a machine learning perspective, our work showcases how flexible generative models can not only provide state-of-the art predictive accuracy, but enable well-calibrated predictions. From a healthcare perspective, we demonstrate that with flexible generative models, not only can we accommodate the idiosyncrasies of mobile health data, but we can also adjust the predictive uncertainty to per-user cycle length patterns. We evaluate the proposed model in real-world cycle length data collected by one of the most popular menstrual trackers worldwide, and demonstrate how the proposed generative model provides accurate and well-calibrated cycle length predictions. Providing meaningful, less uncertain cycle length predictions is beneficial for menstrual health researchers, mobile health users and developers, as it may help design more usable mobile health solutions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "I\u00f1igo", "Last Name": "Urteaga", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Data Science Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathy", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Data Science Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Shea", "Affiliation": "Clue by BioWink, Adalbertstra\u00dfe 7-8, 10999 Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Virginia J", "Last Name": "Vitzthum", "Affiliation": "Kinsey Institute & Department of Anthropology Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chris H", "Last Name": "Wiggins", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Data Science Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "No\u00e9mie", "Last Name": "Elhadad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Data Science Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of machine learning research", "PubDate": "2021Aug"}, {"PMID": "34534312", "Title": "A predictive model for next cycle start date that accounts for adherence in menstrual self-tracking.", "Abstract": "The study sought to build predictive models of next menstrual cycle start date based on mobile health self-tracked cycle data.

As genomic tumor profiling is becoming more common, targeted treatments for specific molecular alterations are gaining traction. To discover new potential therapeutics that may apply to broad classes of tumors matching some molecular pattern, experimentalists and pharmacologists rely on high-throughput, in vitro screens of many compounds against many different cell lines. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model of how cancer cell lines respond to drugs in these experiments and develop a method for fitting the model to real-world high-throughput screening data. Through a case study, the model is shown to capture nontrivial associations between molecular features and drug response, such as requiring both wild type TP53 and overexpression of MDM2 to be sensitive to Nutlin-3(a). In quantitative benchmarks, the model outperforms a standard approach in biology, with $\\approx20\\%$ lower predictive error on held out data.

Previously, menstruation was primarily studied through survey results; however, as menstrual tracking mobile apps become more widely adopted, they provide an increasingly large, content-rich source of menstrual health experiences and behaviors over time. By exploring a database of user-tracked observations from the Clue app by BioWink GmbH of over 378,000 users and 4.9 million natural cycles, we show that self-reported menstrual tracker data can reveal statistically significant relationships between per-person cycle length variability and self-reported qualitative symptoms. A concern for self-tracked data is that they reflect not only physiological behaviors, but also the engagement dynamics of app users. To mitigate such potential artifacts, we develop a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing us to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We uncover that women located at different ends of the menstrual variability spectrum, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit statistically significant differences in their cycle characteristics and symptom tracking patterns. We also find that cycle and period length statistics are stationary over the app usage timeline across the variability spectrum. The symptoms that we identify as showing statistically significant association with timing data can be useful to clinicians and users for predicting cycle variability from symptoms, or as potential health indicators for conditions like endometriosis.

In contrast, there has only been limited effort towards the development of tools that take advantage of multi-channel microscopy data and facilitate integrative analysis of cell-motility. We have implemented algorithms for detecting, tracking, and analyzing cell motility from multi-channel time-lapse microscopy data. We have integrated these into a MATLAB-based toolset we call TIAM (Tool for Integrative Analysis of Motility). The cells are detected by a hybrid approach involving edge detection and Hough transforms from transmitted light images. Cells are tracked using a modified nearest-neighbor association followed by an optimization routine to join shorter segments. Cell positions are used to perform local segmentation for extracting features from transmitted light, reflection and fluorescence channels and associating them with cells and cell-tracks to facilitate integrative analysis. We found that TIAM accurately captures the motility behavior of T cells and performed better than DYNAMIK, Icy, Imaris, and Volocity in detecting and tracking motile T cells. Extraction of cell-associated features from reflection and fluorescence channels was also accurate with less than 10% median error in measurements. Finally, we obtained novel insights into T cell motility that were critically dependent on the unique capabilities of TIAM. We found that 1) the CD45RO subset of human CD8 T cells moved faster and exhibited an increased propensity to attach to the substratum during CCL21-driven chemokinesis when compared to the CD45RA subset; and 2) attachment area and arrest coefficient during antigen-induced motility of the CD45A subset is correlated with surface density of integrin LFA1 at the contact.", "Keywords": ["Integrative analysis", "Multi-channel microscopy", "T cell motility", "Tracking"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Movement", "Chemokine CCL21", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Leukocyte Common Antigens", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Software"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Viveka", "Last Name": "Mayya", "Affiliation": "Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, NYU Medical Center, 540 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA."}, {"First Name": "Willie", "Last Name": "Neiswanger", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, 200 S.W.

Despite being one of the best-studied model systems for transcriptional regulation, the number and conformations of loop structures accessible to LacI remain unclear, though the importance of multiple coexisting loops has been implicated in interactions between LacI and other cellular regulators of gene expression. To probe this issue, we have developed a new analysis method for tethered particle motion, a versatile and commonly used in vitro single-molecule technique. Our method, vbTPM, performs variational Bayesian inference in hidden Markov models. It learns the number of distinct states (i.e. DNA-protein conformations) directly from tethered particle motion data with better resolution than existing methods, while easily correcting for common experimental artifacts. Studying short (roughly 100 bp) LacI-mediated loops, we provide evidence for three distinct loop structures, more than previously reported in single-molecule studies. Moreover, our results confirm that changes in LacI conformation and DNA-binding topology both contribute to the repertoire of LacI-mediated loops formed in vitro, and provide qualitatively new input for models of looping and transcriptional regulation. We expect vbTPM to be broadly useful for probing complex protein-nucleic acid interactions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Artifacts", "Bayes Theorem", "DNA", "Kinetics", "Lac Repressors", "Markov Chains", "Motion", "Nucleic Acid Conformation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E.

Estimation of these rates often requires analysis of a population of molecules, in which the conformational trajectory of each molecule is represented by a noisy, time-dependent signal trajectory. Although hidden Markov models (HMMs) may be used to infer the conformational trajectories of individual molecules, estimating a consensus kinetic model from the population of inferred conformational trajectories remains a statistically difficult task, as inferred parameters vary widely within a population. Here, we demonstrate how a recently developed empirical Bayesian method for HMMs can be extended to enable a more automated and statistically principled approach to two widely occurring tasks in the analysis of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments: 1), the characterization of changes in rates across a series of experiments performed under variable conditions; and 2), the detection of degenerate states that exhibit the same FRET efficiency but differ in their rates of transition. We apply this newly developed methodology to two studies of the bacterial ribosome, each exemplary of one of these two analysis tasks. We conclude with a discussion of model-selection techniques for determination of the appropriate number of conformational states.

In particular we consider single-molecule experiments which indirectly measure the distinct steps in a biomolecular process via observations of noisy time-dependent signals such as a fluorescence intensity or bead position. Straightforward hidden Markov model (HMM) analyses attempt to characterize such processes in terms of a set of conformational states, the transitions that can occur between these states, and the associated rates at which those transitions occur; but require ad-hoc post-processing steps to combine multiple signals. Here we develop a hierarchically coupled HMM that allows experimentalists to deal with inter-signal variability in a principled and automatic way.
