In about 5% to 10% of cases, there is a family history of ALS or a related condition such as frontotemporal dementia in a first or second degree relative, and for about 80% of such people a pathogenic gene variant can be identified. Such variants are also seen in people with no family history because of factor influencing the expression of genes, such as age. Genetic susceptibility factors also contribute to risk, and the heritability of ALS is between 40% and 60%.

These participants most often had symptom onset \u226424 months and an ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score \u226444 at baseline. Compared with the overall FORTITUDE-ALS population, the subgroup meeting these criteria declined by fewer ALSFRS-R points at 12 weeks (difference of least-squares mean [SE] versus placebo 1.84 [0.49] and 0.87 [0.35] for the overall population). These inclusion criteria will be used for the phase 3 clinical trial, COURAGE-ALS, in which the primary outcome is the change in ALSFRS-R total score at week 24. We also measure durable medical equipment use and evaluate strength in muscles expected to change rapidly. To reduce participant burden, study visits are often remote, and strength evaluation is simplified to reduce time and effort.Conclusions: In COURAGE-ALS, the phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate reldesemtiv, the sensitivity of detecting a potential treatment effect may be increased by defining eligibility criteria that limit the proportion of participants who have slower disease progression.

The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is testing multiple investigational products in parallel and sequentially in persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with the goal of rapidly identifying novel treatments to slow disease progression. Platform trials have considerable operational and statistical efficiencies compared with typical randomized controlled trials due to their use of shared infrastructure and shared control data. We describe the statistical approaches required to achieve the objectives of a platform trial in the context of ALS. This includes following regulatory guidance for the disease area of interest and accounting for potential differences in outcomes of participants within the shared control (potentially due to differences in time of randomization, mode of administration, and eligibility criteria). Within the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, the complex statistical objectives are met using a Bayesian shared parameter analysis of function and survival. This analysis serves to provide a common integrated estimate of treatment benefit, overall slowing in disease progression, as measured by function and survival while accounting for potential differences in the shared control group using Bayesian hierarchical modeling. Clinical trial simulation is used to provide a better understanding of this novel analysis method and complex design.

The PLS Natural History Study is a 30-site, 24-month, prospective study that is supported by multiple funding sources. The study aims to enroll 50 early PLS (disease duration \u22644 years) and 50 definite PLS (disease duration 4 to 15 years) participants using modified PLS Diagnostic Criteria. Smartphone-based assessments including semi-quantitative and quantitative measures and patient-reported outcomes are utilized. In-person quantitative measures are also completed during site visits. The change in the PLS Functional Rating Scale score is the primary outcome. The study utilizes the NeuroBANK\u00ae patient-centric data capture and management platform. The biostatistical analysis plan has been developed. Results. In one year, 28 participants have been recruited. Enrollment has been much slower than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rarity of PLS, and potential study competition for internal resources from ALS clinical trials. Discussion. We discuss the need for more innovative methods to enroll and study individuals with such rare diseases and propose a number of mechanisms by which more efficient enrollment could be facilitated.",

Limited knowledge of the underlying causes of ALS has made it difficult to target upstream biological mechanisms of disease, and therapeutic interventions are usually administered relatively late in the course of disease. Genetic forms of ALS offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic development, as genetic associations may reveal potential insights into disease etiology. Genetic ALS may also be amenable to investigating earlier intervention given the possibility of identifying clinically presymptomatic, at-risk individuals with causative genetic variants. There is increasing evidence for a presymptomatic phase of ALS, with biomarker data from the Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS) study showing that an elevation in blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) precedes phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Tofersen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce synthesis of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein through degradation of SOD1 mRNA. Informed by Pre-fALS and the tofersen clinical development program, the ATLAS study (NCT04856982) is designed to evaluate the impact of initiating tofersen in presymptomatic carriers of SOD1 variants associated with high or complete penetrance and rapid disease progression who also have biomarker evidence of disease activity (elevated plasma NfL). The ATLAS study will investigate whether tofersen can delay the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first interventional trial in presymptomatic ALS and has the potential to yield important insights into the design and conduct of presymptomatic trials, identification, and monitoring of at-risk individuals, and future treatment paradigms in ALS.", "Keywords": ["Genetic testing", "Neurofilament", "Phenoconversion", "Pre-fALS", "SOD1-ALS"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Superoxide Dismutase-1", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Superoxide Dismutase", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Oligonucleotides, Antisense", "Biomarkers", "RNA, Messenger", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Benatar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, 1120 NW 14th Street, Clinical Research Building, Miami, FL, 33136, USA. mbenatar@med.miami.edu."}, {"First Name": "Joanne", "Last Name": "Wuu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Miami, 1120 NW 14th Street, Clinical Research Building, Miami, FL, 33136, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter M", "Last Name": "Andersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Science, Neurosciences, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Bucelli", "Affiliation": "Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinsy A", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "The Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus", "Last Name": "Otto", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Martin Luther University, Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nita A", "Last Name": "Farahany", "Affiliation": "Duke University School of Law, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Harrington", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Weiping", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adele A", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Toby", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheena", "Last Name": "Chew", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liz", "Last Name": "Gedney", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sue", "Last Name": "Oakley", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeong", "Last Name": "Heo", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sowmya", "Last Name": "Chary", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Fanning", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peng", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yingying", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janice", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Fradette", "Affiliation": "Biogen, 225 Binney Street, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.

Implementation of NIV marks a step-change in clinical status for patients and a major increase in burden for caregivers. All means to ease this transition should be explored: an oral therapy that supported respiratory function and patients' independence and sense of well-being would aid discussions to facilitate the eventual successful introduction of NIV. Assessment of a candidate oral therapy that might support respiratory function in ALS patients would be aided by the development of improved patient-reported outcome measures for robust quantification of treatment effect and quality of life. Such instruments could also be used to monitor patients' status during the COVID-19 pandemic, averting some of the risks of face-to-face assessment plus the patient burden and costs of traditional methods.

Methods: Health economic outcome information was collected in FORTITUDE-ALS (NCT03160898); sites recorded if and when DME, specifically manual or power wheelchairs, gastrostomy tubes, noninvasive ventilators, or augmentative language devices, was prescribed by a physician and accepted by the patient (DME-PAP) during the trial.

Methods: VITALITY-ALS enrolled patients with a slow vital capacity (SVC) \u226570% of predicted who were not using NIV at screening. Physicians prescribed NIV without restriction following randomization. Reason(s) for NIV prescription, dates prescribed and initiated, and compliance were recorded. Compliance was recorded as prescribed but never initiated, used \u22652\u2009h/24\u2009h, used \u22654\u2009h/24\u2009h, or used \u226522\u2009h/24\u2009h.

During the trial, 179/565 (31.7%) patients had a decline of SVC below 50%; of these patients, 122/179 (68.2%) were prescribed NIV. Reasons for prescribing NIV were different for patients from North America compared with Europe. Conclusions: Despite allowing for NIV initiation at any point following randomization in VITALITY-ALS, only slightly more than two out of three patients whose SVC fell below 50% were prescribed NIV; this was similar in Europe and in North America.

Reldesemtiv was well tolerated, with nausea and fatigue being the most common side effects. A dose-dependent decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate was noted, and transaminase elevations were seen in approximately 5% of patients. Both hepatic and renal abnormalities trended toward resolution after study drug discontinuation. Conclusions: Although the primary efficacy analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance, there were trends favoring reldesemtiv for all three endpoints, with effect sizes generally regarded as clinically important. Tolerability was good; modest hepatic and renal abnormalities were reversible. The impact of reldesemtiv on patients with ALS should be assessed in a pivotal Phase 3 trial.

of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with that observed in clinical trials. Methods: Two independent PubMed searches were conducted, to identify population studies that reported median survival for ALS patients who were either treated with riluzole or remained riluzole-free. Results: We identified 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria of reporting median survival and an additional study that reported mean survival of both riluzole and riluzole-free patients. Analysis of the 15 studies found that a majority reported increased survival of riluzole vs. riluzole-free patients. In 8 studies, the median survival for patients treated with riluzole was 6-19 months longer compared with patients not treated with riluzole (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Three additional studies reported a clinically meaningful treatment effect (range 3-5.9 months) but did not meet statistical significance. The remaining 4 studies did not show a meaningful treatment effect between riluzole and riluzole-free groups (<3 months), and differences among the groups were not significant. Also, 5 of the studies used multivariate regression analysis to investigate the level of association between treatment with riluzole and survival; these analyses supported the positive effect of riluzole on survival. Conclusions: A majority of population studies that compared riluzole vs. riluzole-free ALS patients found significant differences in median survival between the two groups, ranging from 6 to 19 months. This is substantially longer than the 2- to 3-month survival benefit observed in the pivotal clinical trials of riluzole.", "Keywords": ["Riluzole", "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "neurodegenerative", "real-world", "survival"], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Humans", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Riluzole"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jinsy A", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "Neurological Institute of New York, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carlayne E", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "Health Science Center, The University of Texas, San Antonio, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Terry D", "Last Name": "Heiman-Patterson", "Affiliation": "Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paolo", "Last Name": "Bettica", "Affiliation": "Italfarmaco SpA, Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin Rix", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "Atrium Health Neurosciences Institute, Carolinas Medical Center, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Charlotte, NC, USA, and."}, {"First Name": "Erik P", "Last Name": "Pioro", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Centre, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA."}], "Journal": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration", "PubDate": "2020Nov"}, {"PMID": "32445195", "Title": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis care and research in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges and opportunities.", "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has created unprecedented challenges for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical care and research in the United States.

Evidence- and experience-based treatment options, such as multidisciplinary team care, feeding tubes, wheelchairs, home health, and hospice, have become more difficult to obtain and in some places are unavailable. In addition, the pandemic has impacted ALS clinical trials by impairing the ability to obtain measurements for trial eligibility, to monitor safety and efficacy outcomes, and to dispense study drug, as these also often rely on in-person visits.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled adults with ALS and slow vital capacity (SVC)\u2009>\u200950% from 73 centers in eight countries. Patients who tolerated open-label tirasemtiv 125\u2009mg b.i.d. for one week were randomized to double-blind treatment either to placebo or tirasemtiv, escalating to a maximum tolerated dose up to 250\u2009mg b.i.d. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ALSFRS-R; secondary endpoints included SVC, maximum voluntary ventilation, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, isometric muscle strength, and sub-maximum handgrip fatigue. Of 711 patients enrolled, 596 were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind treatment.

recruitment, and baseline demographic and disease characteristics.", "Abstract": "Abstract In a multicenter study of newly diagnosed ALS patients without a reported family history of ALS, we are prospectively investigating whether markers of oxidative stress (OS) are associated with disease progression. Methods utilize an extensive structured telephone interview ascertaining environmental, lifestyle, dietary and psychological risk factors associated with OS. Detailed assessments were performed at baseline and at 3-6 month intervals during the ensuing 30 months. Our biorepository includes DNA, plasma, urine, and skin. Three hundred and fifty-five patients were recruited. Subjects were enrolled over a 36-month period at 16 sites. To meet the target number of subjects, the recruitment period was prolonged and additional sites were included. Results showed that demographic and disease characteristics were similar between 477 eligible/non-enrolled and enrolled patients, the only difference being type of health insurance among enrolled patients. Sites were divided into three groups by the number of enrolled subjects. Comparing these three groups, the Columbia site had fewer 'definite ALS' diagnoses. This is the first prospective, interdisciplinary, in-depth, multicenter epidemiological investigation of OS related to ALS progression and has been accomplished by an aggressive recruitment process. The baseline demographic and disease features of the study sample are now fully characterized.", "Keywords": ["ALS", "disease progression", "epidemiology", "oxidative stress", "survival"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Cohort Studies", "Demography", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Insurance Coverage", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxidative Stress", "Patient Selection", "Skin", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Mitsumoto", "Affiliation": "Eleanor and Lou Gehrig MDA/ALS Research Center, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center , New York."}, {"First Name": "Pam", "Last Name": "Factor-Litvak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Howard", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raymond R", "Last Name": "Goetz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leslie", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Judith G", "Last Name": "Rabkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "McElhiney", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeri", "Last Name": "Nieves", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Regina M", "Last Name": "Santella", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Hupf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jess", "Last Name": "Singleton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Merle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Kilty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daragh", "Last Name": "Heitzman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard S", "Last Name": "Bedlack", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert G", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan S", "Last Name": "Katz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dallas", "Last Name": "Forshew", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Barohn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric J", "Last Name": "Sorenson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bjorn", "Last Name": "Oskarsson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Americo M", "Last Name": "Fernandes Filho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edward J", "Last Name": "Kasarskis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Lomen-Hoerth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tahseen", "Last Name": "Mozaffar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yvonne D", "Last Name": "Rollins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sharon P", "Last Name": "Nations", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea J", "Last Name": "Swenson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeremy M", "Last Name": "Shefner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jinsy A", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Boguslawa A", "Last Name": "Koczon-Jaremko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "ALS COSMOS Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration", "PubDate": "2014Jun"}, {"PMID": "23452274", "Title": "Body mass index (BMI) as predictor of ALSFRS-R score decline in ALS patients.", "Abstract": "Recent studies of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suggest that body mass index (BMI) predicts patients' survival in a curvilinear manner. We sought to determine the relationship of initial BMI to decline in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score over time. We used data from the high dose Coenzyme-Q10 in ALS (QALS) clinical trial, with in-person ALSFRS-R interviews at baseline and nine months (n = 150). Multiple regression analysis allowed adjustment for a range of predictors. The final analysis, adjusted for age and FVC, indicated a significant, non-linear association of BMI with the change of ALSFRS-R over time (p < 0.01). The smallest decline was at BMI of 30. Among non-obese patients (BMI < 30, n = 126), higher BMI was associated with slower ALSFRS-R decline (p = 0.03). Among obese patients (BMI \u2265 30, n = 24), higher BMI was associated, although not significantly, with faster decline (p = 0.17). In conclusion, for ALS patient with BMI less than 30, higher initial BMI predicts slower functional decline. For patients with BMI greater than 30, higher initial BMI predicts more rapid decline. These results indicate that previous, apparently contradictory results can be reconciled, and suggest that initial BMI may help predict disease progression in ALS patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Body Mass Index", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ronit", "Last Name": "Reich-Slotky", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. rslotky@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "Jinsy", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Buchsbaum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Diane", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Petra", "Last Name": "Kaufmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John L P", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}]
