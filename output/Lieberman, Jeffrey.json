Specific motivations for these acts are not well understood, often overattributed to severe mental illness. Identifying diverse factors motivating mass murders may facilitate prevention. We examined 1,725 global mass murders from 1900-2019, publicly described in English in print or online. We empirically categorized each into one of ten categories reflecting reported primary motivating factors, which were analyzed across mass murderers generally, as well as between U.S- and non-U.S.-based mass-shooters. Psychosis or disorganization related to mental illness were infrequently motivational factors (166; 9.6%), and were significantly more associated with mass murder committed using methods other than firearms. The vast majority (998, 57.86%) of incidents were impulsive and emotionally-driven, following adverse life circumstances. Most mass murderers prompted by emotional upset were found to be driven by despair or extreme sadness over life events (161, 16.13% within the category); romantic rejection or loss, or severe jealousy (204, 20.44% within the category); some specific non-romantic grudge (212, 21.24% within the category); or explosive, overwhelming rage following a dispute (266, 26.65% within the category).

We review an earlier model whereby an initial glutamate signaling deficit progresses through different phases of allostatic adaptation, moving from potentially reversible functional abnormalities associated with early psychosis and working memory dysfunction, and ending with difficult-to-reverse structural changes after chronic illness. We integrate this model with evidence of dopaminergic abnormalities, including cortical D1 dysfunction, which develop during adolescence.

Far less accepted is the possibility that neurodegenerative processes are involved as well, or even that key dimensions of function, such as cognition and aspects of biological integrity, such as white matter function, decline in chronic schizophrenia beyond levels associated with normal aging. We propose that recent research germane to these issues warrants a current look at the question of neurodegeneration. We propose the view that a neurodegenerative hypothesis provides a better explanation of some features of chronic schizophrenia, including accelerated aging, than is provided by neurodevelopmental hypotheses. Moreover, we suggest that neurodevelopmental influences in early life, including those that may extend to later life, do not preclude the development of neurodegenerative processes in later life, including some declines in cognitive and biological integrity. We evaluate these views by integrating recent findings in representative domains such as cognition and white and gray matter integrity with results from studies on accelerated aging, together with functional implications of neurodegeneration for our understanding of chronic schizophrenia.", "Keywords": ["Accelerated aging", "Chronic schizophrenia", "Cognition", "Neurodegenerative processes", "Neurodevelopmental hypothesis", "White matter"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Cognition", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Schizophrenia", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.

This mechanism is particularly relevant to the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, given the abnormalities in cortical dopamine (DA) neurotransmission and in the expression of D1R. Despite the critical need for D1R-based therapeutics, many factors have complicated their development and prevented this important therapeutic target from being adequately interrogated. Challenges include determination of the optimal level of D1R stimulation needed to improve cognitive performance, especially when D1R expression levels, affinity states, DA levels, and the resulting D1R occupancy by DA, are not clearly known in schizophrenia, and may display great interindividual and intraindividual variability related to cognitive states and other physiological variables. These directly affect the selection of the level of stimulation necessary to correct the underlying neurobiology. The optimal mechanism for stimulation is also unknown and could include partial or full agonism, biased agonism, or positive allosteric modulation. Furthermore, the development of D1R targeting drugs has been complicated by complexities in extrapolating from in vitro affinity determinations to in vivo use. Prior D1R-targeted drugs have been unsuccessful due to poor bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and insufficient target engagement at tolerable doses. Newer drugs have recently become available, and these must be tested in the context of carefully designed paradigms that address methodological challenges. In this paper, we discuss how a better understanding of these challenges has shaped our proposed experimental design for testing a new D1R/D5R partial agonist, PF-06412562, renamed CVL-562.", "Keywords": ["D1 partial agonism", "D1 receptor", "cognition", "schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Dopamine Agonists", "Drug Development", "Humans", "Receptors, Dopamine D1", "Receptors, Dopamine D5", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anissa", "Last Name": "Abi-Dargham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychaitric Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Slifstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Anticevic", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Monica E", "Last Name": "Calkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Youngsun T", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clara", "Last Name": "Fonteneau", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Gil", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ragy", "Last Name": "Girgis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychaitric Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raquel E", "Last Name": "Gur", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruben C", "Last Name": "Gur", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jack", "Last Name": "Grinband", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychaitric Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Kantrowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychaitric Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Kohler", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Krystal", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohini", "Last Name": "Ranganathan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Santamauro", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared", "Last Name": "Van Snellenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zailyn", "Last Name": "Tamayo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "TRANSCENDS Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Cerevel Therapeutics Research and Development, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychaitric Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Schizophrenia bulletin", "PubDate": "2022Jan21"}, {"PMID": "34391077", "Title": "The neurobiology of auditory and visual perceptual abnormalities in a clinical high-risk for psychosis cohort: A pilot morphometric magnetic resonance imaging study.", "Abstract": "Our goal was to examine the neurobiology of auditory and visual perceptual abnormalities in individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) using morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

GABA levels or GABAergic interneuron numbers are generally low in MDD, potentially disinhibiting Glu release. It is unclear whether Glu release or turnover is increased in depression. Conversely, a meta-analysis of prefrontal proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) studies in MDD finds low Glx (combination of glutamate and glutamine) in medicated MDD. We hypothesize that elevated Glx or Glu may be a marker of more severe, untreated MDD. We examined ventromedial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (vmPFC/ACC) Glx and glutamate levels using 1H MRS in 34 medication-free, symptomatic, chronically ill MDD patients and 32 healthy volunteers, and GABA levels in a subsample. Elevated Glx and Glu were observed in MDD compared with healthy volunteers, with the highest levels seen in males with MDD. vmPFC/ACC GABA was low in MDD. Higher Glx levels correlated with more severe depression and lower GABA. MDD severity and diagnosis were both linked to higher Glx in vmPFC/ACC. Low GABA in a subset of these patients is consistent with our hypothesized model of low GABA leading to glutamate disinhibition in MDD.

Intrasynaptic DA levels can be inferred from imaging the change in radiotracer binding at D2 receptors due to a pharmacological challenge. Here, we used methylphenidate, a DA reuptake inhibitor, and [11C]-(+)-PHNO, to measure synaptic DA availability in CHR both in striatal and extra-striatal brain regions. Fourteen unmedicated, nonsubstance using CHR individuals and 14 matched control subjects participated in the study. Subjects underwent two [11C]-(+)-PHNO scans, one at baseline and one following administration of a single oral dose (60\u2009mg) of methylphenidate. [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND, the binding potential relative to the nondisplaceable compartment, was derived using the simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference tissue. The percent change in BPND between scans, \u0394BPND, was computed as an index of synaptic DA availability, and group comparisons were performed with a linear mixed model. An overall trend was found for greater synaptic DA availability (\u2206BPND) in CHR than controls (p\u2009=\u20090.06).

There were no significant group differences in any other brain region. There were no significant differences in DA transmission in any striatal region between converters and nonconverters, although this finding is limited by the small sample size (N\u2009=\u20092).

This project studies augmenting the efficacy of auditory neuroplasticity cognitive remediation (AudRem) with d-serine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) glycine-site agonist. We operationalize improved (smaller) thresholds in pitch (frequency) between successive auditory stimuli after AudRem as improved plasticity, and mismatch negativity (MMN) and auditory \u03b8 as measures of functional target engagement of both NMDAR agonism and plasticity. Previous studies showed that AudRem alone produces significant, but small cognitive improvements, while d-serine alone improves symptoms and MMN. However, the strongest results for plasticity outcomes (improved pitch thresholds, auditory MMN and \u03b8) were found when combining d-serine and AudRem. AudRem improvements correlated with reading and other auditory cognitive tasks, suggesting plasticity improvements are predictive of functionally relevant outcomes. While d-serine appears to be efficacious for acute AudRem enhancement, the optimal dose remains an open question, as does the ability of combined d-serine + AudRem to produce sustained improvement. In the ongoing R61, 45 schizophrenia patients will be randomized to receive three placebo-controlled, double-blind d-serine + AudRem sessions across three separate 15 subject dose cohorts (80/100/120 mg/kg).

Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery.

Two metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonists (pomaglumetad [POMA] and TS-134) were assessed in two Phase Ib proof of mechanism studies of comparable designs and using identical clinical assessments and pharmacoBOLD methodology. POMA was examined in a randomized controlled trial under double-blind conditions for 10-days at doses of 80 or 320\u2009mg/d POMA versus placebo (1:1:1 ratio). The TS-134 trial was a randomized, single-blind, 6-day study of 20 or 60\u2009mg/d TS-134 versus placebo (5:5:2 ratio). Primary outcomes were ketamine-induced changes in pharmacoBOLD in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and symptoms reflected on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Both trials were conducted contemporaneously. 95 healthy volunteers were randomized to POMA and 63 to TS-134. High-dose POMA significantly reduced ketamine-induced BPRS total symptoms within and between-groups (p\u2009<\u20090.01, d\u2009=\u2009-0.41; p\u2009=\u20090.04, d\u2009=\u2009-0.44, respectively), but neither POMA dose significantly suppressed ketamine-induced dACC pharmacoBOLD.

High-dose POMA exerted significant effects on clinical symptoms, but not on target engagement, suggesting a higher dose may yet be needed, while the low dose of TS-134 showed evidence of symptom reduction and target engagement.

Antipsychotic drugs have been proven to alleviate acute psychotic symptoms and prevent their recurrence in schizophrenia, but the outcomes of most patients historically have been suboptimal. However, a series of findings in studies of first-episode schizophrenia patients transformed the psychiatric field's thinking about the pathophysiology, course, and potential for disease-modifying effects of treatment. These include the relationship between the duration of untreated psychotic symptoms and outcome; the superior responses of first-episode patients to antipsychotics compared with patients with chronic illness, and the reduction in brain gray matter volume over the course of the illness. Studies of the effectiveness of early detection and intervention models of care have provided encouraging but inconclusive results in limiting the morbidity and modifying the course of illness. Nevertheless, first-episode psychosis studies have established an evidentiary basis for considering a team-based, coordinated specialty approach as the standard of care for treating early psychosis, which has led to their global proliferation. In contrast, while clinical high-risk research has developed an evidence-based care model for decreasing the burden of attenuated symptoms, no treatment has been shown to reduce risk or prevent the transition to syndromal psychosis. Moreover, the current diagnostic criteria for clinical high risk lack adequate specificity for clinical application. What limits our ability to realize the potential of early detection and intervention models of care are the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic criteria for pre-syndromal schizophrenia, validated biomarkers, and proven therapeutic strategies. Future research requires methodologically rigorous studies in large patient samples, across multiple sites, that ideally are guided by scientifically credible pathophysiological theories for which there is compelling evidence. These caveats notwithstanding, we can reasonably expect future studies to build on the research of the past four decades to advance our knowledge and enable this game-changing model of care to become a reality.", "Keywords": ["Biomarkers", "Early Detection", "Prevention", "Psychosis", "Schizophrenia", "Treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Early Diagnosis", "Humans", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry (Lieberman, Small, Girgis) and Department of Neurology (Small), College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York (Lieberman, Small, Girgis)."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry (Lieberman, Small, Girgis) and Department of Neurology (Small), College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York (Lieberman, Small, Girgis)."}, {"First Name": "Ragy R", "Last Name": "Girgis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry (Lieberman, Small, Girgis) and Department of Neurology (Small), College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York (Lieberman, Small, Girgis)."}], "Journal": "The American journal of psychiatry", "PubDate": "2019Oct01"}, {"PMID": "31551481", "Title": "The smartest person in the room: Donald F.

The contribution of common genetic variants to TD susceptibility has been investigated in recent years, but with limited success. The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential contribution of rare variants to TD vulnerability. In order to identify TD risk genes, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and gene-based collapsing analysis focusing on rare (allele frequency\u202f<\u202f1%) and putatively deleterious variants (qualifying variants). 82 Jewish schizophrenia patients chronically treated with antipsychotics were included and classified as having severe TD or lack of any abnormal movements based on a rigorous definition of the TD phenotype. First, we performed a case-control, exome-wide collapsing analysis comparing 39 schizophrenia patients with severe TD to 3118 unrelated population controls. Then, we checked the potential top candidate genes among 43 patients without any TD manifestations. All the genes that were found to harbor one or more qualifying variants in patients without any TD features were excluded from the final list of candidate genes. Only one gene, regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 2 (RIMS2), showed significant enrichment of qualifying variants in TD patients compared with unrelated population controls after correcting for multiple testing (Fisher's exact test p\u202f=\u202f5.32E-08, logistic regression p\u202f=\u202f2.50E-08). Enrichment was caused by a single variant (rs567070433) due to a frameshift in an alternative transcript of RIMS2. None of the TD negative patients had qualifying variants in this gene. In a validation cohort of 140 schizophrenia patients assessed for TD, the variant was also not detected in any individual. Some potentially suggestive TD genes were detected in the TD cohort and warrant follow-up in future studies. No significant enrichment in previously reported TD candidate genes was identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first WES study of TD, demonstrating the potential role of rare loss-of-function variant enrichment in this pharmacogenetic phenotype.", "Keywords": ["Collapsing", "RIMS2", "Tardive dyskinesia", "WES"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Case-Control Studies", "Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Schizophrenia", "Exome Sequencing", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Alkelai", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA.

Its pathophysiology is unclear; however, familial patterns and gene association studies indicate an inherited component to risk. The disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene was selected for analysis because it interacts with and regulates two important proteins involved in antipsychotic medication action: the dopamine D2 receptor and the cAMP phosphodiesterase type IVB (PDE4B). The D2 receptor is the obligate target of all existing antipsychotic medications, and PDE4B hydrolyzes cAMP, a core signaling molecule activated by agonist binding to the D2 receptor. Notably, PDE4B inhibitors such as rolipram have been shown to reduce TD-like behaviours in animal models. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DISC1 gene were investigated in a sample of 193 chronic schizophrenia patients for association with the presence and severity of TD, with age and sex as additional variables.

Despite there being several promising targets, such as allosteric modulation of the NMDA and \u03b17 nicotinic receptors, we cannot confidently state that any of the mechanistically novel experimental treatments covered in this review are definitely effective for the treatment of schizophrenia and ready for clinical use.

Therefore, we conducted a study in which 24 healthy volunteers were randomized to olanzapine (highly weight-gain liability), iloperidone (less weight-gain liability), or placebo treatment for 28 days under double-blind conditions. We hypothesized that antipsychotics induce weight gain primarily through increased caloric intake, which causes secondary dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Subjects were phenotyped pre- and post-treatment for body weight, adiposity by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry, food intake, oral glucose tolerance, plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, and other hormones. We found significantly increased food intake and body weight but no change in energy expenditure in olanzapine-treated subjects, with associated trends towards lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance the extent of which were presumably limited by the duration of treatment. Iloperidone treatment led to modest non-significant and placebo no weightgain, lipid increases and alterations in insulin metabolism.

The current study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from a healthcare provider's perspective, of an HLA genotype-guided approach in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who were taking clozapine and to compare the results with the current absolute neutrophil count monitoring (ANCM) schemes used in the USA. A semi-Markovian model was developed to simulate the progress of a cohort of adult men and women who received clozapine as a third-line antipsychotic medication. We compared current practices using two genotype-guided strategies: (1) HLA genotyping followed by clozapine, with ANCM only for patients who tested positive for one or both alleles (genotype-guided blood sampling); (2) HLA genotyping followed by clozapine for low-risk patients and alternative antipsychotics for patients who tested positive (clozapine substitution scheme).

Researchers hope that progress in identifying aetiological mechanisms will ultimately enable more precise division of heterogeneous diagnoses into specific and valid subgroups. This goal has been an aim of psychiatry since the 19th century, when patients with general paresis were thought to have \"insanity\" similar to dementia praecox and manic depressive illness. Nowadays, the constructs of organic-induced and substance-induced psychotic disorder show that our diagnostic classification system already reflects, in part, aetiological factors. Most recently, gene copy number variation and autoimmunity have been associated with schizophrenia. We suggest how, on the basis of recent scientific advances, we can progress the identification of further putative subgroups and make the most of currently available interventions.

Present classifications of psychotic disorder remain based on the presence of specific psychotic symptoms, relative to affective and other symptoms, and their sequence and duration. Although extant diagnostic classifications have restricted validity, they have proven reliability and most clinicians and some patients find them useful. Moreover, these classifications have yet to be replaced by anything better. We propose that an expansion of the subgrouping approach inherent to classification will provide incremental improvement to present diagnostic constructs-as has worked in the rest of medicine. We also propose that subgroups could be created both within and across present diagnostic classifications, taking into consideration the potential value of continuous measures (eg, duration of psychotic symptoms and intelligence quotient).

The authors determined the brain regions associated with factors underlying DSM-IV diagnoses and compared the ability of DSM-IV diagnoses, factor scores, and self-report measures to account for the neuroanatomical findings in patients with penetrating brain injuries. This prospective cohort study included 254 Vietnam War veterans: 199 with penetrating brain injuries and 55 matched control participants. Measures include DSM-IV diagnoses (from a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM), self-report measures of depression and anxiety, and CT scans. Factors underlying DSM-IV diagnoses were determined using an exploratory factor analysis and correlated with percent of brain regions affected. The ability of the factor scores, DSM-IV diagnoses, and the self-report psychiatric measures to account for the anatomical variance was compared with multiple regressions. Internalizing and externalizing factors were identified in these brain-injured patients. Damage to the left amygdala and bilateral basal ganglia was associated with lower internalizing factor scores, and damage to the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with higher, and bilateral hippocampi with lower, externalizing factor scores. Factor scores best predicted left amygdala and bilateral hippocampal involvement, whereas DSM-IV diagnoses best predicted bilateral basal ganglia and left OFC involvement. Damage to the limbic areas involved in the processing of emotional and reward information, including structures involved in the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria Negative Valence Domain, influences the development of internalizing and externalizing psychiatric symptoms. Self-report measures underperformed DSM-IV and factor scores in predicting neuroanatomical findings.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anxiety", "Brain", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Depression", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward D", "Last Name": "Huey", "Affiliation": "From the Taub Institute and Gertrude H.

For this 2015 revision, all available publications pertaining to the biological treatment of schizophrenia were reviewed systematically to allow for an evidence-based update. These guidelines provide evidence-based practice recommendations which are clinically and scientifically relevant. They are intended to be used by all physicians diagnosing and treating patients with schizophrenia. Based on the first version of these guidelines a systematic review, as well as a data extraction from national guidelines have been performed for this update. The identified literature was evaluated with respect to the strength of evidence for its efficacy and subsequently categorised into six levels of evidence (A-F) and five levels of recommendation (1-5). This third part of the updated guidelines covers the management of the following specific treatment circumstances: comorbid depression, suicidality, various comorbid substance use disorders (legal and illegal drugs), and pregnancy and lactation.

Genome-wide association studies of obesity have pointed to a number of potential candidate genes, such as MC4R, that were later found to be shared with AAWG. GABAA \u03b12 receptor subunit (GABRA2) was another potential candidate gene for obesity from genome-wide association studies; however, it has not been explored in AAWG. We examined 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms across the GABRA2 gene. Prospective weight change was assessed for a total of 160 schizophrenia patients of European ancestry. The rs279858 marker was associated with percent weight change, with the patients homozygous for the TT genotype experiencing higher percentage weight gain on average than the C allele carriers (P = 0.009).

This proof-of-principle study sought to determine whether the active enantiomer of the selective and full D1 receptor agonist dihydrexidine (DAR-0100A) could attenuate working memory impairments in unmedicated patients with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DAR-0100A (15\u2009mg/150\u2009ml of normal saline administered intravenously over 30\u2009min) in medication-free patients with SPD (n=16) who met the criteria for cognitive impairment (ie, scoring below the 25th percentile on tests of working memory). We employed two measures of verbal working memory that are salient to schizophrenia-spectrum cognitive deficits, and that clinical data implicate as being associated with prefrontal D1 availability: (1) the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT); and (2) the N-back test (ratio of 2-back:0-back scores). Study procedures occurred over four consecutive days, with working memory testing on Days 1 and 4, and DAR-0100A/placebo administration on Days 2-4. Treatment with DAR-0100A was associated with significantly improved PASAT performance relative to placebo, with a very large effect size (Cohen's d=1.14). Performance on the N-back ratio was also significantly improved; however, this effect rested on both a non-significant enhancement and diminution of 2-back and 0-back performance, respectively; therefore interpretation of this finding is more complicated. DAR-0100A was generally well tolerated, with no serious medical or psychiatric adverse events; common side effects were mild to moderate and transient, consisting mainly of sedation, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and hypotension; however, we were able to minimize these effects, without altering the dose, with supportive measures, eg, co-administered normal saline. Although preliminary, these findings lend further clinical support to the potential of D1 receptor agonists to treat schizophrenia-spectrum working memory impairments. These data suggest a need for further studies with larger group sizes, serum DAR-0100A levels, and a more comprehensive neuropsychological battery.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Dopamine Agonists", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Short-Term", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Phenanthridines", "Receptors, Dopamine D1", "Schizotypal Personality Disorder", "Verbal Learning", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel R", "Last Name": "Rosell", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Outpatient Psychiatry, James J.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in schizophrenia, and antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine have been associated with differences in gene expression in mitochondria. We investigated the hypothesis that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, particularly those involved in oxidative phosphorylation or involved in oxidative stress, mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis, would be associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). In total, we selected 28 genes and analyzed 60 SNPs (50 are functional), in 283 schizophrenia subjects, treated with atypical medications for up to 14 weeks. Association between AIWG (as measured by the % of weight gain from baseline) and SNP genotypes were tested using linear regression with treatment duration, baseline body weight, and medication type as covariates. We observed a significant association between rs6435326 in the NDUFS1 gene and AIWG in the subset of European patients (N=150, Pcorrected=0.02). The haplotype carrying the risk alleles of rs6435326 and two other SNPs (rs1053517 and rs1801318) in NDUFS1 was also nominally associated with percentage of weight gain (T-C-G vs A-T-A, P=0.005). In addition, stepwise linear regression was performed to select important variables predictive of the outcome, and a gene-gene interaction analysis was carried out. We observed a significant interaction between the TT risk genotype of rs6435326 in NDUFS1 and AG genotype of rs3762883 in COX18 (Pcorrected=0.001). A permutation-based test of all 60 SNPs jointly showed significant association with weight gain (P=0.02). Finally, our replication study of rs6435326, rs1053517 and rs1801318 in NDUFS1 using samples from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) showed that rs1801318 was significantly associated with AIWG (N=200, Pcorrected=0.04), and the three SNPs were collectively associated with AIWG (P=0.04).

Its etiology is unclear, but family studies suggest that genetic factors play an important role in contributing to risk for TD. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an interesting candidate for genetic studies of TD because it regulates the release of neurotransmitters implicated in TD, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABA. VMAT2 is also a target of tetrabenazine, a drug used in the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders, including TD. We examined nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC18A2 gene that encodes VMAT2 for association with TD in our sample of chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 217). We found a number of SNPs to be nominally associated with TD occurrence and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), including the rs2015586 marker which was previously found associated with TD in the CATIE sample (Tsai et al., 2010), as well as the rs363224 marker, with the low-expression AA genotype appearing to be protective against TD (p = 0.005). We further found the rs363224 marker to interact with the putative functional D2 receptor rs6277 (C957T) polymorphism (p = 0.001), supporting the dopamine hypothesis of TD.

The degree to which genetic variation is unique to individual disorders or shared across disorders is unclear. To examine shared genetic etiology, we use genome-wide genotype data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17-29% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 \u00b1 0.04 s.e.), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43 \u00b1 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47 \u00b1 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive disorder (0.32 \u00b1 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and ASD (0.16 \u00b1 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the negative control of Crohn's disease.

in schizophrenia is characterized by both hypermetabolism and reduced size. It remains unknown whether these abnormalities are mechanistically linked. Here we addressed this question by using MRI tools that can map hippocampal metabolism and structure in patients and mouse models. In at-risk patients, hypermetabolism was found to begin in CA1 and spread to the subiculum after psychosis onset. CA1 hypermetabolism at baseline predicted hippocampal atrophy, which occurred during progression to psychosis, most prominently in similar regions. Next, we used ketamine to model conditions of acute psychosis in mice. Acute ketamine reproduced a similar regional pattern of hypermetabolism, while repeated exposure shifted the hippocampus to a hypermetabolic basal state with concurrent atrophy and pathology in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Parallel in\u00a0vivo experiments using the glutamate-reducing drug LY379268 and direct measurements of extracellular glutamate showed that glutamate drives both neuroimaging abnormalities.

Studies indicate that N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal integrity, and choline, a marker of cell membrane turnover and white matter integrity, may be altered in schizophrenia. Davunetide is a neurotrophic peptide that can enhance cognitive function in animal models of neurodegeneration. Davunetide has recently demonstrated modest functional improvement in a study of people with schizophrenia. In a subset of these subjects, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) was conducted to explore the effects of davunetide on change in NAA/creatine (NAA/Cr) and choline/creatine (choline/Cr) over 12 weeks of treatment. Of 63 outpatients with schizophrenia who received randomized davunetide (5 and 30\u2009mg/day) or placebo in the parent clinical trial, 18 successfully completed (1)H-MRS in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at baseline and at 12 weeks. Cognition was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). NAA/Cr was unchanged for combined high- and low-dose davunetide groups (N=11). NAA/Cr in the high-dose davunetide group (N=8) suggested a trend increase of 8.0% (P=0.072) over placebo (N=7). Choline/Cr for combined high- and low-dose davunetide groups suggested a 6.4% increase (P=0.069), while the high-dose group showed a 7.9% increase (P=0.040) over placebo. Baseline NAA/Cr correlated with the composite MCCB score (R=0.52, P=0.033), as did individual cognitive domains of attention/vigilance, verbal learning, and social cognition; however, neither metabolite correlated with functional capacity. In this exploratory study, 12 weeks of adjunctive davunetide appeared to produce modest increases in NAA/Cr and choline/Cr in DLPFC in people with schizophrenia. This is consistent with a potential neuroprotective mechanism for davunetide. The data also support use of MRS as a useful biomarker of baseline cognitive function in schizophrenia. Future clinical and preclinical studies are needed to fully define the mechanism of action and cognitive effects of davunetide in schizophrenia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Aspartic Acid", "Choline", "Cognition", "Creatine", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oligopeptides", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "L Fredrik", "Last Name": "Jarskog", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhengchao", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alayar", "Last Name": "Kangarlu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tiziano", "Last Name": "Colibazzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ragy R", "Last Name": "Girgis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence S", "Last Name": "Kegeles", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deanna M", "Last Name": "Barch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert W", "Last Name": "Buchanan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John G", "Last Name": "Csernansky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald C", "Last Name": "Goff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Harms", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Javitt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard Se", "Last Name": "Keefe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph P", "Last Name": "McEvoy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert P", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen R", "Last Name": "Marder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bradley S", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "23303043", "Title": "A randomized exploratory trial of an \u03b1-7 nicotinic receptor agonist (TC-5619) for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "This exploratory trial was conducted to test the effects of an alpha7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist, TC-5619, on cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms in subjects with schizophrenia. In the United States and India, 185 outpatients (18-60 years; male 69%; 46% tobacco users) with schizophrenia treated with quetiapine or risperidone monotherapy were randomized to 12 weeks of placebo (n=91) or TC-5619 (n=94; orally once daily 1\u2009mg day 1 to week 4, 5\u2009mg week 4 to 8, and 25\u2009mg week 8 to 12). The primary efficacy outcome measure was the Groton Maze Learning Task (GMLT; executive function) of the CogState Schizophrenia Battery (CSB). Secondary outcome measures included: CSB composite score; Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS); Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I); CGI-severity (CGI-S); and Subject Global Impression-Cognition. GMLT statistically favored TC-5619 (P=0.036) in this exploratory trial. SANS also statistically favored TC-5619 (P=0.030).

The results were typically stronger in favor of TC-5619 in tobacco users and occasionally better in the United States than in India.

Previous studies have demonstrated an influence of clozapine, but not haloperidol, on neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the hypothalamus. Because NPY is a potent orexigenic peptide stimulating food intake, and genetic variation of the gene has been shown to influence development of obesity, we investigated the impact of NPY polymorphisms on antipsychotic-induced BWG.We analyzed 5 polymorphisms in the NPY gene (rs10551063, rs16147, rs5573, rs5574, and rs16475) in schizophrenia subjects (n = 226), treated mostly with clozapine and olanzapine for up to 14 weeks. Association was tested using analysis of covariance with change (%) from baseline weight as the dependent variable and duration of treatment and baseline body weight as covariates.In patients of European ancestry who received either clozapine or olanzapine, significant genotypic and allelic association of rs16147 with weight change was observed (P(corrected) = 0.012 and 0.018, respectively). Carriers of the C allele gained significantly more weight compared with individuals with TT genotype (CC + CT vs TT; 5.82% \u00b1 5.6% vs 2.25% \u00b1 4.8%; P= 0.001). Similarly, 2 other polymorphisms (rs5573 and rs5574) were also significantly associated with weight change (P(corrected) = 0.018 and 0.03). In addition, we observed a significant gene-gene interaction between the rs16147 in NPY and rs806378 in cannabinoid receptor 1 (P(corrected) = 0.011).Our observation of association of NPY polymorphisms gives further evidence for a genetic influence on antipsychotic-induced BWG and suggests a role of NPY gene in influencing this complex adverse effect.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Black or African American", "Analysis of Variance", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Benzodiazepines", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Clozapine", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genotype", "Germany", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropeptide Y", "New York", "Ohio", "Olanzapine", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Schizophrenia", "Weight Gain", "White People", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arun K", "Last Name": "Tiwari", "Affiliation": "Neurogenetics Section, Neuroscience Department, Centre forAddiction and Mental Health & Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Eva J", "Last Name": "Brandl", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Olga", "Last Name": "Likhodi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clement C", "Last Name": "Zai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Margaret K", "Last Name": "Hahn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Herbert Y", "Last Name": "Meltzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James L", "Last Name": "Kennedy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "M\u00fcller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical psychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}, {"PMID": "23216388", "Title": "World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for biological treatment of schizophrenia, part 2: update 2012 on the long-term treatment of schizophrenia and management of antipsychotic-induced side effects.", "Abstract": "Abstract These updated guidelines are based on a first edition of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for biological treatment of schizophrenia published in 2006. For this 2012 revision, all available publications pertaining to the biological treatment of schizophrenia were reviewed systematically to allow for an evidence-based update. These guidelines provide evidence-based practice recommendations that are clinically and scientifically meaningful. They are intended to be used by all physicians diagnosing and treating people suffering from schizophrenia. Based on the first version of these guidelines, a systematic review of the MEDLINE/PUBMED database and the Cochrane Library, in addition to data extraction from national treatment guidelines, has been performed for this update. The identified literature was evaluated with respect to the strength of evidence for its efficacy and then categorised into six levels of evidence (A-F) and five levels of recommendation (1-5) ( Bandelow et al. 2008a ,b, World J Biol Psychiatry 9:242, see Table 1 ).

The caudate and hippocampus were represented as medial representations (M-reps); mesh structures derived from automatic segmentations of high resolution MRIs. Two quantitative shape measures were examined: local width and local deformation. A novel nonparametric statistical method, adjusted exponentially tilted (ET) likelihood, was used to compare the shape measures across the three groups while controlling for covariates. Longitudinal shape change was not observed in the hippocampus or caudate when the treatment groups and controls were examined in a global analysis, nor when the three groups were examined individually. Both baseline and repeated measures analysis showed differences in local caudate and hippocampal size between patients and controls, while no consistent differences were shown between treatment groups.
