Flexible fibers contribute to the softness of the tissue paper by allowing the sheets to conform to the contours of the skin without feeling rough or abrasive. This study focuses on developing innovative CGG/APAM/PDA hydrogels with interpenetrating networks consisting of cationic guar gum, anionic polyacrylamide, and polydopamine for cellulase immobilization, aimed at improving bamboo fiber flexibility. Cellulase biomolecules are efficiently immobilized on CGG/APAM/PDA hydrogels through the Schiff base reaction. Immobilized cellulases have a wider pH applicability than free cellulases, good storage stability, and can maintain high relative activity at relatively high temperatures. The treatment of bamboo fibers with immobilized cellulase results in a significant increase in flexibility, reaching 6.90\u202f\u00d7\u202f1014\u202fN\u00b7m2, which is 7.18 times higher than that of untreated fibers. The immobilization of cellulases using CGG/APAM/PDA hydrogels as carriers results in a substantial enhancement of storage stability, pH applicability, and inter-fiber bonding strength, as well as the capacity to sustain high relative enzymatic activity at elevated temperatures. The immobilization of cellulase within CGG/APAM/PDA interpenetrating network hydrogels presents a viable strategy for enhancing bamboo fiber flexibility, thereby expanding the accessibility of tissue products.", "Keywords": ["Bamboo fibers", "Hydrogels", "Immobilized cellulase", "Softness"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mengxin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper, State Key Laboratory of Biobased Fiber Manufacturing Technology, China Light Industry Key Laboratory of Papermaking and Biorefinery, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, No. 29, 13th Street, TEDA, Tianjin 300457, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper, State Key Laboratory of Biobased Fiber Manufacturing Technology, China Light Industry Key Laboratory of Papermaking and Biorefinery, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, No. 29, 13th Street, TEDA, Tianjin 300457, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Pulp and Paper, State Key Laboratory of Biobased Fiber Manufacturing Technology, China Light Industry Key Laboratory of Papermaking and Biorefinery, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, No. 29, 13th Street, TEDA, Tianjin 300457, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Jing Xing Paper Co., Ltd., No. 1, Jingxing Industry Zone, Jingxing First Road, Caoqiao Street, Pinghu, Zhejiang Province 314214, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Haibing", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Jing Xing Paper Co., Ltd., No. 1, Jingxing Industry Zone, Jingxing First Road, Caoqiao Street, Pinghu, Zhejiang Province 314214, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Zhengbai", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Jing Xing Paper Co., Ltd., No. 1, Jingxing Industry Zone, Jingxing First Road, Caoqiao Street, Pinghu, Zhejiang Province 314214, PR China.

Their behavioural adaptations to subterranean environments, however, are poorly understood. Wall-following (WF) behaviour, where an organism remains in close contact with the boundary demarcating its habitat when in the dark, is a peculiar behaviour observed in a wide range of animals and is enhanced in cave dwellers. Hence, we hypothesise that wall-following is also present in Sinocyclocheilus, possibly enhanced in eyeless species compared to eye bearing (normal-/micro-eyed species). Using 13 species representative of Sinocyclocheilus radiation and eye morphs, we designed a series of assays, based on pre-existing methods for Astyanax mexicanus behavioural experiments, to examine wall-following behaviour under three conditions. Our results indicate that eyeless species exhibit significantly enhanced intensities of WF compared to normal-eyed species, with micro-eyed forms demonstrating intermediate intensities in the WF distance. Using a mtDNA based dated phylogeny (chronogram with four clades A-D), we traced the degree of WF of these forms to outline common patterns. We show that the intensity of WF behaviour is higher in the subterranean clades compared to clades dominated by normal-eyed free-living species. We also found that eyeless species are highly sensitive to vibrations, whereas normal-eyed species are the least sensitive. Since WF behaviour is presented to some degree in all Sinocyclocheilus species, and given that these fishes evolved in the late Miocene, we identify this behaviour as being ancestral with WF enhancement related to cave occupation.

The good sodiophilicity, high molecule rigidity, and bulky size enable it to reshape the solvation sheath and promote the anion engagement in the solvated structures by molecule crowding. This change also enhances Na-ion transfer, inhibits side reactions, and leads to a thin and robust solid-electrolyte interphase. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability and operating temperature windows of the electrolyte are extended.

Despite its prevalence and associated risks, current treatments have yet to identify effective methods for reducing cravings and preventing relapse. In this study, we find that 4-Hz alternating bilateral sensory stimulation (ABS) effectively reduces ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice, while 4-Hz flash light does not exhibit therapeutic effects. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping demonstrates that 4-Hz ABS triggers notable activation in superior colliculus GABAergic neurons (SCGABA). SCGABA forms monosynaptic connections with ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons (VTADA), which is implicated in ethanol-induced CPP. Bidirectional chemogenetic manipulation of SC-VTA circuit either replicates or blocks the therapeutic effects of 4-Hz ABS on ethanol-induced CPP. These findings elucidate the role of SC-VTA circuit for alleviating ethanol-related CPP by 4-Hz ABS and point to a non-drug and non-invasive approach that might have potential for treating alcohol use disorder.", "Keywords": ["CP: Neuroscience", "alternating bilateral sensory stimulation", "dopaminergic neurons", "ethanol-induced conditioned place preference", "superior colliculus", "ventral tegmental area"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, P.R.

Next, we cultured senescent mesenchymal stem cells (S-MSCs) on samples with various nanotube topographies to determine suitable parameters. We found nanotube with a diameter of 10 nm significantly alleviated the cellular senescence of S-MSCs and improved the osteogenic differentiation of S-MSCs in vitro. Using an ectopic periodontium regeneration model, we confirmed that specific nanotube topography could promote tissue regeneration of S-MSCs in vivo.

It is a natural way to represent protein as a graph. In this work, we focus on protein-protein binding sites prediction between the ligand and receptor proteins. Previous work just simply adopts graph convolution to learn residue representations of ligand and receptor proteins, then concatenates them and feeds the concatenated representation into a fully connected layer to make predictions, losing much of the information contained in complexes and failing to obtain an optimal prediction. In this paper, we present Intra-Inter Graph Representation Learning for protein-protein binding sites prediction (IIGRL). Specifically, for intra-graph learning, we maximize the mutual information between local node representation and global graph summary to encourage node representation to embody the global information of protein graph. Then we explore fusing two separate ligand and receptor graphs as a whole graph and learning affinities between their residues/nodes to propagate information to each other, which could effectively capture inter-protein information and further enhance the discrimination of residue pairs.

However, conventional ambient light sensors are large in area and small in dynamic range, and they do not take into account the effects caused due to a dark current. To address the above problems, a programmable ambient light sensor with dark current compensation and a wide dynamic range is proposed in this paper. The proposed ambient light sensor exhibits a low current power consumption of only 7.7 \u00b5A in dark environments, and it operates across a wide voltage range (2-5 V) and temperature range (-40-80 \u00b0C). It senses ambient light and provides an output current proportional to the ambient light intensity, with built-in dark current compensation to effectively suppress the effects of a dark current. It provides a wide dynamic range over the entire operating temperature range with three selectable output-current gain modes. The proposed ambient light sensor was designed and fabricated using a 0.18 \u00b5m standard CMOS process, and the effective area of the chip is 663 \u00b5m \u00d7 652 \u00b5m.

Benefitting from the large electrochemical active surface of nanosheet arrays, rich WP/WP2 heterojunction interface, and trace Ru atom doping, the catalyst has a fairly low overpotential of 58.0 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 50.71 mV dec-1 in acid solution toward the electrocatalytic HER. Further, theoretical calculations unveil that Ru atom doping and interface effect synergistically optimized the electronic structure of the catalyst and hence weakened the adsorption capacity of the catalyst surface toward hydrogen (H), which lowered the Gibbs free energy (\u0394GH*) and consequently effectively improved the HER performance.

Identifying and characterizing novel components of the JNK signaling pathway to enhance and refine its network hold significant scientific and clinical importance for the prevention and treatment of associated cancers. This study utilized the model organism Drosophila and employed multidisciplinary approaches encompassing genetics, developmental biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology to investigate the interplay between Tip60 and the JNK signaling pathway, and elucidated its regulatory mechanisms. Our findings suggest that loss of Tip60 acetyltransferase activity results in JNK signaling pathway activation and subsequent induction of JNK-dependent apoptosis. Genetic epistasis analysis reveals that Tip60 acts downstream of JNK, paralleling with the transcription factor FOXO. The biochemical results confirm that Tip60 can bind to FOXO and acetylate it. Introduction of human Tip60 into Drosophila effectively mitigates apoptosis induced by JNK signaling activation, underscoring conserved regulatory role of Tip60 in the JNK signaling pathway from Drosophila to humans.

well-studied but the mechanistic origin of the heterogeneous antidepressant effect remains largely unknown. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 8 healthy individuals and 8 MDD patients before or after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment is performed. scRNA-seq analysis reveals a lower proportion of naive T cells, particularly CD4+ naive T cells, in MDD patients compared to controls, and in nonresponders versus responders at the baseline. Flow cytometry data analysis of an independent cohort of 35 patients and 40 healthy individuals confirms the findings. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated obvious immune activation in responders. A specific activated CD4+ naive T population in responders characterized by enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)\u00a0pathway is identified. E-twenty six (ETS) is proposed as an upstream regulator of the MAPK pathway and heterogeneous differentiation in activated CD4+ naive T population is associated with the response to antidepressant treatment in MDD patients. A distinct immune feature manifested by CD4+ naive T cells during antidepressant treatment in MDD is identified.

It is involved in the malignant process of generating multiple cancers. However, there are only a few reports about TMSB10 in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the mechanism of its carcinogenetic effect is still poorly understood. The present study intends to clarify the biological roles and carcinogenic mechanism of TMSB10 in CRC and to explore the possibility whether TMSB10 might be useful as a non-invasive serum tumor biomarker in detecting CRC. Immunohistochemical results showed that TMSB10 protein expression in CRC tissues was generally higher than that in adjacent tissues, and the TMSB10 contents in serum of CRC patients was significantly elevated compared to that of healthy controls. Knockdown-TMSB10 increased apoptosis and induced S-cell cycle arrest, and finally inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome sequencing and western blotting analysis revealed that knockdown-TMSB10 increased phosphorylation of p38 and activated the p38 pathway that blocked cell cycle and promoted apoptosis. Taken together, our study indicated that TMSB10 could serve as a minimally invasive serum tumor marker in detecting CRC.

The mutation of multiple aa residues in the E protein plays a critical role in the attenuated strain of JEV. This study demonstrated that the Asp to Gly, Ser, and His mutation of the E389 site, respectively, the replication ability of the viruses in cells was significantly reduced, and the viral neuroinvasiveness was attenuated to different degrees. Among them, the mutation at E389 site enhanced the E protein flexibility contributed to the attenuation of neuroinvasiveness. In contrast, less flexibility of E protein enhanced the neuroinvasiveness of the strain. Our results indicate that the mechanism of attenuation of E389 aa mutation attenuates neuroinvasiveness is related to increased flexibility of the E protein. In addition, the increased flexibility of E protein enhanced the viral sensitivity to heparin inhibition in vitro, which may lead to a decrease in the viral load entering brain. These results suggest that E389 residue is a potential site affecting JEV virulence, and the flexibility of the E protein of aa at this site plays an important role in the determination of neuroinvasiveness.", "Keywords": ["E protein", "E389", "Japanese encephalitis virus", "Molecular conformation", "Neuroinvasiveness"], "MeSH terms": ["Encephalitis Virus, Japanese", "Viral Envelope Proteins", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Virulence", "Virus Replication", "Encephalitis, Japanese", "Humans", "Heparin", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Mutation, Missense", "Mice", "Mutation", "Virulence Factors", "Membrane Glycoproteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rong", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yajing", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenghua", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Kui", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medicine and Forensic Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, 637100, China. jiany74@163.com."}], "Journal": "Virology journal", "PubDate": "2024Jun05"}, {"PMID": "38837936", "Title": "Bi-Fusion of Structure and Deformation at Multi-Scale for Joint Segmentation and Registration.", "Abstract": "Medical image segmentation and registration are two fundamental and highly related tasks. However, current works focus on the mutual promotion between the two at the loss function level, ignoring the feature information generated by the encoder-decoder network during the task-specific feature mapping process and the potential inter-task feature relationship. This paper proposes a unified multi-task joint learning framework based on bi-fusion of structure and deformation at multi-scale, called BFM-Net, which simultaneously achieves the segmentation results and deformation field in a single-step estimation. BFM-Net consists of a segmentation subnetwork (SegNet), a registration subnetwork (RegNet), and the multi-task connection module (MTC). The MTC module is used to transfer the latent feature representation between segmentation and registration at multi-scale and link different tasks at the network architecture level, including the spatial attention fusion module (SAF), the multi-scale spatial attention fusion module (MSAF) and the velocity field fusion module (VFF). Extensive experiments on MR, CT and ultrasound images demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The MTC module can increase the Dice scores of segmentation and registration by 3.2%, 1.6%, 2.2%, and 6.2%, 4.5%, 3.0%, respectively.

However, it suffers from two main issues: (1) the difficulty/complexity of computing global inter-class/intra-class scatters, commonly related to mean and covariance of graph samples, for discriminant learning; (2) the huge complexity and variety of graph topological structure that is rather challenging to robustly characterize. In this paper, we propose the Wasserstein Discriminant Dictionary Learning (WDDL) framework to achieve discriminant learning on graphs with robust graph topology modeling, and hence facilitate graph-based pattern analysis tasks. Considering the difficulty of calculating global inter-class/intra-class scatters, a reference set of graphs (aka graph dictionary) is first constructed by generating representative graph samples (aka graph keys) with expressive topological structure. Then, a Wasserstein Graph Representation (WGR) process is proposed to project input graphs into a succinct dictionary space through the graph dictionary lookup. To further achieve discriminant graph learning, a Wasserstein discriminant loss (WD-loss) is defined on the graph dictionary, in which the graph keys are optimizable, to make the intra-class keys more compact and inter-class keys more dispersed. Hence, the calculation of global Wasserstein metric (W-metric) centers can be bypassed. For sophisticated topology mining in the WGR process, a joint-Wasserstein graph embedding module is constructed to model both between-node and between-edge relationships across inputs and graph keys by encapsulating both the Wasserstein metric (between cross-graph nodes) and proposed novel Kron-Gromov-Wasserstein (KGW) metric (between cross-graph adjacencies). Specifically, the KGW-metric comprehensively characterizes the cross-graph connection patterns with the Kronecker operation, then adaptively captures those salient patterns through connection pooling. To evaluate the proposed framework, we study two graph-based pattern analysis problems, i.e. graph classification and cross-modal retrieval, with the graph dictionary flexibly adjusted to cater to these two tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to comprehensively compare with existing advanced methods, as well as dissect the critical component of our proposed architecture.

This study aims to investigate the impact of inappropriate antibiotic use on the dissemination and exacerbation of antibiotic resistance in ESBL-EC and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Through experimental analysis, we propose a hypothesis that inappropriate antibiotic use may exacerbate resistance by affecting vesicle formation and protein secretion. Experimental results demonstrate that under the influence of amoxicillin, the concentration of proteins secreted in outer membrane vehicles (OMVs) by ESBL-EC significantly increases, along with a significant upregulation in the expression of the CTX-M-55-type Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-M-55). Proteomic analysis and differential gene knockout experiments identified the key protein YdcZ, associated with OMVs formation and protein transportation in ESBL-EC under amoxicillin treatment. Further investigations reveal direct interactions between YdcZ and other proteins (YdiH and BssR). Upon ydcz gene knockout, a significant decrease in protein concentration within OMVs is observed, accompanied by a noticeable reduction in protection against sensitive bacteria. These findings suggest a critical role of YdcZ in regulating the process of protein transportation to OMVs in ESBL-EC under the influence of amoxicillin. In summary, our research uncovers the significant role of inappropriate antibiotic use in promoting the secretion of OMVs by ESBL-EC, aiding the survival of antibiotic-sensitive bacteria in the vicinity of infection sites.

Animal models of ischemic stroke have significantly contributed to our understanding of its pathological mechanisms and the development of potential treatments.

However, these methods have inherent limitations, such as reduced blood perfusion to the brain, damage to the external carotid artery system, impaired food and/or water intake, and sensory dysfunction of the face. This article introduces a new method for inducing a rat ischemic stroke model without compromising the cerebral vascular anatomy. In this study, the common carotid artery (CCA) of Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed, and an incision was made. A filament was then inserted through the incision into the internal carotid artery to occlude the middle cerebral artery. After 1.5 h of induced ischemia, the occluding filament was fully removed from both the internal carotid artery and the CCA. The incision in the CCA was subsequently sutured using 11-0 microsurgical sutures under a microscope (magnification 4x). Through the utilization of microsurgical techniques to repair the CCA, this study successfully developed a unique method to induce an ischemic stroke model in rats while preserving the anatomical integrity of cerebral blood vessels.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Rats", "Disease Models, Animal", "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhang", "Last Name": "Jiren", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation, Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Drug Delivery System and Biotech Drugs in Universities of Shandong, Yantai University."}, {"First Name": "Sun", "Last Name": "Yufei", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation, Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Drug Delivery System and Biotech Drugs in Universities of Shandong, Yantai University."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Huiwen", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation, Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Drug Delivery System and Biotech Drugs in Universities of Shandong, Yantai University."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Jian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Shilei", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Zhao", "Last Name": "Dongman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Xie", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Mingming", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University."}, {"First Name": "Wang", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation, Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Drug Delivery System and Biotech Drugs in Universities of Shandong, Yantai University; bluewt2000@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Zhang", "Last Name": "Pinyuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University; Zhpy_76@sina.com."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2024May17"}, {"PMID": "38828789", "Title": "The alleviatory effects of koumine on MSU-induced gouty arthritis via the TLR4/NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to validate the preventive effects of koumine (KM), a monoterpene indole alkaloid, on gouty arthritis (GA) and to explore its possible mechanisms.

In the liver of ICR mice, CYP2B10 and MDR1 were up-regulated after 3 days of T-A\u2162 administration. In vitro assessments were conducted using HepG2 cells to ascertain the effects and underlying mechanisms. In HepG2 cells, T-A\u2162 induced the expression of CYP2B6, MDR1, and CYP3A4, along with CAR activation. CAR siRNA reversed the T-A\u2162-induced increases in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Furthermore, other CAR target genes displayed significant up-regulation. Up-regulation of mCAR was observed in the livers of nude mice and ICR mice. Subsequent findings demonstrated that T-A\u2162 activated CAR by inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation, partially reversed by the MAPK/MEK activator t-BHQ. Inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway was also observed in vivo. Lastly, T-A\u2162 inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr1173 and Tyr845, and it suppressed EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, and CAR. Additionally, T-A\u2162 inhibited EGFR phosphorylation in nude mice.

Current methods estimate intraoperative dynamic meshes by refining a static initial organ mesh from the semantic information in the single-frame X-ray images. However, these methods fall short of reconstructing an accurate and smooth organ sequence due to the distinct respiratory patterns between the initial mesh and X-ray image. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel dual-stage complementary 4D organ reconstruction (DSC-Recon) model for recovering dynamic organ meshes by utilizing the preoperative and intraoperative data with different respiratory patterns. DSC-Recon is structured as a dual-stage framework: 1) The first stage focuses on addressing a flexible interpolation network applicable to multiple respiratory patterns, which could generate dynamic shape sequences between any pair of preoperative 3D meshes segmented from CT scans. 2) In the second stage, we present a deformation network to take the generated dynamic shape sequence as the initial prior and explore the discriminate feature (i.e., target organ areas and meaningful motion information) in the intraoperative X-ray images, predicting the deformed mesh by introducing a designed feature mapping pipeline integrated into the initialized shape refinement process.

Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data from 93 patients suffering from intermediate to advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treated at our institution from May 2018 to April 2020. Patients were divided based on the therapeutic regimen: 43 cases constituted the control group receiving lenvatinib plus transhepatic artery chemoembolization (TACE), while the remaining 50 cases in the study group were managed with lenvatinib, PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and TACE. Outcome measures included therapeutic efficacy, tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], \u03b1-L-fucosidase [AFU], carbohydrate antigen 199 [CA199]), immune response indices (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+ ratio), pertinent cytokine levels (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], matrix metalloproteinase-9 [MMP-9], basic fibroblast growth factor [aFGF], acidic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]), quality of life (as per Quality of Life Assessment Scale for Cancer Patients [QOL-LC] scores), adverse effects, and survival rates. Results: The study group exhibited a significantly enhanced total effective rate compared to the control group (74.00% vs 53.49%, P\u2009<\u2009.05). Post-treatment levels of CEA, AFP, AFU, CA199, CD8+, VEGF, MMP-9, aFGF, and bFGF were notably lower in both groups, particularly in the study group. Contrastingly, CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ratios, and QOL-LC scores were substantially elevated in the study group (P\u2009<\u2009.05). Adverse reaction prevalence was analogous between 2 groups (27.91% vs 26.00%; P\u2009>\u2009.05). Moreover, the study group reported significantly higher 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates than the control group (P\u2009<\u2009.05). Conclusion: The combined use of lenvatinib, PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and interventional treatment for intermediate to advanced hepatocellular carcinoma may have a definitive therapeutic efficacy. This regimen is effective in reducing tumor marker levels, enhancing immune function, modulating VEGF, MMP-9, and other related cytokine levels, and improving patients' quality of life without significantly augmenting adverse effects.

Herein, we report a doping-engineered bismuth sulfide pre-catalyst (BiS-1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS-1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95% at 2000 mA cm-2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS-1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95%) with current densities from 100 to 1300 mA cm-2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700 mA cm-2 while maintaining a FE of above 90% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150 h at 200 mA cm-2. In-situspectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation.

These methods mainly focus on selecting the proposal having high Intersection-over-Union with the true object location, while ignoring the problem of misclassification, which occurs when some proposals exhibit semantic similarities with objects from other categories due to viewing perspective and background interference. We observe that the positive class that is misclassified typically has the following two characteristics: 1) It is usually misclassified as one or a few specific negative classes, and the scores of these negative classes are high; 2) Compared to other negative classes, the score of the positive class is relatively high. Based on these two characteristics, we propose misclassification correction (MCC) and misclassification tolerance (MCT) respectively. In MCC, we establish a misclassification memory bank to record and summarize the class-pairs with high frequencies of potential misclassifications in the early stage of training, that is, cases where the score of a negative class is significantly higher than that of the positive class. In the later stage of training, when such cases occur and correspond to the summarized class-pairs, we select the top-scoring negative class proposal as the positive training example. In MCT, we decrease the loss weights of misclassified classes in the later stage of training to avoid them dominating training and causing misclassification of objects from other classes that are semantically similar to them during inference.

Escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is a commonly used antidepressant in clinics. However, more than one-third of patients with MDD do not respond to this drug. Gene polymorphism may affect the efficacy of escitalopram, but the genetic architecture of the antidepressant response in patients with MDD remains unclear. We perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the genetic effect on the outcome of escitalopram in patients with MDD. A total of 203 patients with MDD and 176 healthy control (HC) adults were recruited from Beijing Anding Hospital. Patients received 12\u00a0weeks of antidepressant treatment with escitalopram. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) or Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) were used to evaluate the severity of depression symptoms at the baseline and the end of 2 and 12\u00a0weeks of treatment.

Recently, Nb2CTx, as a new type of MXene, has attracted more and more attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 542 mAh g-1. However, the preparation of few-layer Nb2CTx nanosheets with high-quality remains a challenge, which limits their research and application. In this work, high-quality few-layer Nb2CTx nanosheets with a large lateral size and a high conductivity of up to 500 S cm-1 were prepared by a simple HCl-LiF hydrothermal etching method, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of previously reported Nb2CTx. Furthermore, from its aqueous ink, the viscosity-tunable organic few-layer Nb2CTx ink was prepared by HCl-induced flocculation and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone treatment. When using the organic few-layer Nb2CTx ink as an additive-free anode of lithium-ion batteries, it showed excellent cycling performance with a reversible specific capacity of 524.0 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g-1 and 444.0 mAh g-1 after 5000 cycles at 1 A g-1. For rate performance, a specific capacity of 159.8 mAh g-1 was obtained at a high current density of 5 A g-1, and an excellent capacity retention rate of about 95.65% was achieved when the current density returned to 0.5 A g-1.

Long-term administration of tacrolimus leads to dyslipidemia and affects liver lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the mode of action and underlying mechanisms of this adverse reaction. Mice were administered tacrolimus (2.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1, i.g.) for 10 weeks, then euthanized; the blood samples and liver tissues were collected for analyses. We showed that tacrolimus administration induced significant dyslipidemia and lipid deposition in mouse liver. Dyslipidemia was also observed in heart or kidney transplantation patients treated with tacrolimus. We demonstrated that tacrolimus did not directly induce de novo synthesis of fatty acids, but markedly decreased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in AML12 cells. Furthermore, we showed that tacrolimus dramatically decreased the expression of HMGCS2, the rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis, with decreased ketogenesis in AML12 cells, which was responsible for lipid deposition in normal hepatocytes. Moreover, we revealed that tacrolimus inhibited forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) nuclear translocation by promoting FKBP51-FoxO1 complex formation, thus reducing FoxO1 binding to the HMGCS2 promoter and its transcription ability in AML12 cells. The loss of HMGCS2 induced by tacrolimus caused decreased ketogenesis and increased acetyl-CoA accumulation, which promoted mitochondrial protein acetylation, thereby resulting in FAO function inhibition. Liver-specific HMGCS2 overexpression via tail intravenous injection of AAV8-TBG-HMGCS2 construct reversed tacrolimus-induced mitochondrial protein acetylation and FAO inhibition, thus removing the lipid deposition in hepatocytes. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel mechanism of liver lipid deposition and hyperlipidemia induced by long-term administration of tacrolimus, resulted from the loss of HMGCS2-mediated ketogenesis and subsequent FAO inhibition, providing an alternative target for reversing tacrolimus-induced adverse reaction.", "Keywords": ["FKBP51-FoxO1 complex", "HMGCS2", "fatty acid oxidation", "ketogenesis", "mitochondrial protein acetylation", "tacrolimus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sen-Lin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui-Min", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Meng-Heng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Ke-Shan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. xiangming@tjmu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Acta pharmacologica Sinica", "PubDate": "2024May17"}, {"PMID": "38760220", "Title": "Combination of miniplate and suture anchor in open reduction of anterior dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint: A case report.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Clinical Medical College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225001, PR China; Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225001, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Dianwei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116044, PR China; Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225001, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Wenyong", "Last Name": "Fei", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225001, PR China.

In particular, dressings with ROS scavenging capacity play a crucial role in the process of chronic wound healing. Herein, Zr-based large-pore mesoporous metal-organic frameworks (mesoMOFs) were successfully developed for the construction of spatially organized cascade bioreactors. Natural superoxide dismutase (SOD) and an artificial enzyme were spatially organized in these hierarchical mesoMOFs, forming a cascade antioxidant defense system, and presenting efficient intracellular and extracellular ROS scavenging performance. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the SOD@HMUiO-MnTCPP nanoparticles (S@M@H NPs) significantly accelerated diabetic wound healing. Transcriptomic and western blot results further indicated that the nanocomposite could inhibit fibroblast senescence and ferroptosis as well as the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway activation in macrophages mediated by mitochondrial oxidative stress through ROS elimination. Thus, the biomimetic multi-enzyme cascade catalytic system with spatial ordering demonstrated a high potential for diabetic wound healing, where senescence, ferroptosis, and STING signaling pathways

Entities and relations share the information of sequence and word embedding layers in the joint decoding stage. They are trained simultaneously and realize information interaction by updating the shared parameters. Specifically, we design a compound triangle strategy for the nested entity recognition and an adaptive multi-space interactive strategy for relationship extraction. Then, we construct a parameter-shared information space based on semantic continuity to decode entities and relationships. Extensive experiments were conducted on the Private Liver Disease Dataset (PLDD) provided by Beijing Friendship Hospital of Capital Medical University and public datasets (NYT, ACE04 and ACE05).

Our earlier work introduced a wound surgical integrated treatment (WSIT) for DFUs, yielding promising outcomes. This study focuses on a specific WSIT protocol employing antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) in the first Stage, and free vastus lateralis muscle-sparing (VLMS) flaps and split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) in the second stage to repair non-weight-bearing DFUs. From July 2021 to July 2023, seven DFU patients (aged 47-71\u2009years) underwent this treatment. Demographic data, hospital stay and repair surgery times were collected. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses assessed angiogenesis, collagen deposition and inflammation. SF-36 questionnaire measured pre- and postoperative quality of life. Preoperative ultrasound Doppler showed that the peak blood flow velocity of the recipient area artery was significantly >30\u2009cm/s (38.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.8\u2009cm/s) in all patients.

Histological analysis proved that covering DFUs with ALBC induced membrane formation and increased collagen, neovascularization and M2 macrophages fraction while reducing M1 macrophages one. All grafts survived without amputation during a 7- to 24-month follow-up, during which SF-36 scores significantly improved. A combination of ALBC with free VLMS flaps and STSGs proved to be safe and effective for reconstructing non-weight-bearing DFUs.

Methylimidazole molecules can be co-intercalated with Na+, and a small amount of unreleased solvated Na+ serves the dual purpose of providing support to the graphite layer and preventing peeling off. The interphase formed in imidazole is more uniform and dense compared with that in ether electrolytes, which reduces side reactions and the risk of internal short circuits. The obtained battery demonstrates a long cycle life of 1800 cycles with a capacity retention of 84.6%.

However, their poor porosity and permeability limit osteogenic cell ingrowth and vascularization, which is critical for bone regeneration. In the current study, we constructed a novel hierarchically-porous magnesium phosphate bone cement by incorporating extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking electrospun silk fibroin (SF) nanofibers. The SF-embedded MPC (SM) exhibited a heterogeneous and hierarchical structure, which effectively facilitated the rapid infiltration of oxygen and nutrients as well as cell ingrowth. Besides, the SF fibers improved the mechanical properties of MPC and neutralized the highly alkaline environment caused by excess magnesium oxide. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) adhered excellently on SM, as illustrated by formation of more pseudopodia. CCK8 assay showed that SM promoted early proliferation of BMSCs. Our study also verified that SM increased the expression of OPN, RUNX2 and BMP2, suggesting enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. We screened for osteogenesis-related pathways, including FAK signaing, Wnt signaling and Notch signaling, and found that SM aided in the process of bone regeneration by suppressing the Notch signaling pathway, proved by the downregulation of NICD1, Hes1 and Hey2. In addition, using a bone defect model of rat calvaria, the study revealed that SM exhibited enhanced osteogenesis, bone ingrowth and vascularization compared with MPC alone. No adverse effect was found after implantation of SM in vivo.

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.

However, its role in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy is unclear. Therefore, the present study investigated whether administering recombinant FSTL1 could mitigate DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and clarified the underlying molecular mechanisms. FSTL1 treatment attenuated DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis, and cellular apoptosis by inhibiting excess mitochondrial matrix protein methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 (MsrB2)-mediated mitophagy. Furthermore, FSTL1 administration reduced the expression of apoptotic proteins, including MsrB2, Bax, caspase 3, mitochondrial Parkin, and LC3-II, increased myocardial ATP content, and decreased cardiac malondialdehyde levels, thus protecting mitochondrial function against DOX-induced cardiac injury. Furthermore, FSTL1 treatment protected the contractile properties of adult cardiomyocytes against DOX-induced injury in vitro. Furthermore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a mitophagy inducer, impaired the protective effects of FSTL1 in DOX-treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes.

This study aimed to investigate the water retention capacities of SAPs in an alkaline environment over extended periods by incorporating liquid sodium silicate (SS) into SAP-water mixtures and examining the influence of temperature. The influence of SAP particle size on mortar's water absorption capacity and mechanical behavior was investigated. Two mixing techniques for SAPs (dry and pre-wetting) were employed to assess the influence of SAP on cement mortars' slump, mechanical properties, and cracking resistance. Four types of SAPs (SAP-a, SAP-b, SAP-c, and SAP-d), based on the molecular chains and particle size, were mixed with SS to study their water absorption over 30 days. The results showed that SAPs exhibit rapid water absorption within the first 30 min, exceeding 85% before reaching a saturation point, and the chemical and temperature variations in the water significantly affected water absorption and desorption. The filtration results revealed that SAP-d exhibited the slowest water release rate, retaining water for considerably longer than the other three types of SAPs.

According to the selected processing methods recorded in ancient literature, the analgesic activities of wine- and vinegar-processed R. mole Flos, as well as the raw product, were evaluated in a writhing test with acetic acid and a formalin-induced pain test. Subsequently, the HPLC-TOP-MS technique was utilized to investigate the changes in active components before and after processing once the variations in activities were confirmed.

After processing, especially in vinegar, R. mole Flos did not only maintain the anti-nociception but also showed reduced toxicity, and the chemical composition corresponding to these effects also changed significantly. Further investigation of its representative components revealed that RJ-VI has considerable anti-nociceptive activity, particularly in inflammatory pain (0.3\u00a0mg/kg) and peripheral neuropathic pain (0.6\u00a0mg/kg). Its toxicity was about three times lower than that of rhodojaponin III, which is another representative component of R. mole Flos. Additionally, RJ-VI mildly inhibits several subtypes of voltage-gated sodium channels (IC50\u2009>\u2009200\u00a0\u03bcM) that are associated with pain or cardiotoxicity.

In this study, a suite of plantain-derived biochar (MBB-400, MBB-600, and MBB-800), possessing a well-defined pore structure and a substantial number of uniformly distributed active sites (oxygen vacancy, OVs), was synthesized through a facile calcination process at varying temperatures (400, 600, and 800 \u00b0C). These materials were designed for the activation of PMS in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Experimental investigations revealed that OVs not only functioned as enriched sites for pollutants, enhancing the opportunities for free radicals (\u2022OH/SO4\u2022-) and surface-bound radicals (SBRs) to attack pollutants, but also served as channels for intramolecular charge transfer leaps. This role contributed to a reduction in interfacial charge transfer resistance, expediting electron transfer rates with PMS, thereby accelerating the decomposition of pollutants. Capitalizing on these merits, the MBB-800/PMS system displayed a 61-fold enhancement in the conversion rate for SMX degradation compared to inactivated MBB/PMS system. Furthermore, the MBB-800 exhibited less cytotoxicity towards rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells.

In this study, we prepared exosomes (EXOs) from cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs) and found that treatment with EXOs increased the viability, migration, and proliferation of cultured primary chondrocytes. In a subacute OA rat model, the application of EXOs facilitated cartilage regeneration as evidenced by histological staining. Exosomal protein analysis together with bioinformatics suggested that cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a key factor for chondrocyte growth and migration. Functional studies confirmed this prediction, that is, inhibiting CDK9 reduced the beneficial effects induced by EXOs in primary chondrocytes; while overexpression of CDK9 recapitulated the EXOs-induced phenotypes. RNA-Seq data showed that a set of genes involved in cell growth and migration were up-regulated by EXOs in chondrocytes. These changes could be partially reproduced by CDK9 overexpression.

In ZS-VAT, we design an attribute-head self-attention (AHSA) that is capable of learning unbiased attribute knowledge. Specifically, each attribute head in AHSA first transforms the local features into attribute-reinforced features and then accumulates the attribute knowledge from all corresponding reinforced features, reducing the mutual influence between attributes and avoiding information loss. AHSA finally preserves unbiased attribute knowledge through attribute embeddings. We also propose an attribute fusion model (AFM) that learns to recover the correct category knowledge from the attribute knowledge. In particular, AFM takes all features from AHSA as input and generates global embeddings. We carried out experiments to demonstrate that the attribute knowledge from AHSA and the category knowledge from AFM are able to assist each other. During the final semantic prediction, we combine the attribute embedding prediction (AEP) and global embedding prediction (GEP). We evaluated the proposed scheme on three benchmark datasets.

In this study, we successfully isolated different apoptotic vesicle subtypes based on their sizes and characterized them using NTA and TEM techniques, respectively. We compared the functional variances among the distinct subtypes of apoptotic vesicles in terms of stem cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, as well as for endothelial cell and macrophage function, effectively identifying subtypes that exhibit discernible functional differences. ApoSEV (with diameter\u00a0<1000\u00a0nm) promoted stem cell proliferation, migration, and multi-potent differentiation, and accelerated skin wound healing of diabetes mouse model, while apoBD (with diameter\u00a0>1000\u00a0nm) played the opposite effect on cell function and tissue regeneration. Lastly, employing protein analysis and gene sequencing techniques, we elucidated the intrinsic mechanisms underlying these differences between different subtypes of apoEVs. Collectively, this study identified that apoptotic vesicle subtypes possessed distinct bio-functions in regulating stem cell function and behaviour and modulating tissue regeneration, which primarily attribute to the distinct profiling of protein and mRNA in different subtypes.

Due to the limitations of technical difficulty and experimental period, research on completely knocking out YTHDF2 is rare. Therefore, further investigations are still needed to clarify the YTHDF2's clinical significance and biological function in GC. To carry out the investigation, an analysis was performed on the expression levels of YTHDF2 in both publicly available databases and samples obtained from patients with gastric cancer. Based on the complete knockout of YTHDF2 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of YTHDF2 on tumor formation, radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy resistance in GC. Our investigation revealed an increase in YTHDF2 levels in GC tissues, which was found to be associated with a negative prognosis. Under hypoxic conditions, high expression of YTHDF2 enhanced the invasion of gastric cancer cells, and high expression of YTHDF2 was associated with HIF-1a. YTHDF2 facilitated gastric cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the results of the present study demonstrated that YTHDF2 mediated the expression of CyclinD1 and stability of CyclinD1 mRNA. CyclinD1 knockdown inhibited YTHDF2-mediated GC cell proliferation whereas CyclinD1 overexpression ameliorated YTHDF2 knockdown-induced inhibition of GC progression. Furthermore, YTHDF2 also promoted resistance to DDP and CTX chemotherapy, along with radiotherapy treatment for GC cells. The findings suggested that YTHDF2 expression accelerated GC progression through a potential mechanism involving CyclinD1 expression, and enhanced chemoradiotherapy resistance. This indicated that YTHDF2 could be a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for individuals diagnosed with GC.", "Keywords": ["CyclinD1", "HIF\u20101\u03b1", "YTHDF2", "chemotherapy", "gastric cancer", "proliferation", "radiotherapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Cell Proliferation", "RNA-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yawen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingxu", "Last Name": "Da", "Affiliation": "The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China."}], "Journal": "Drug development research", "PubDate": "2024Apr"}, {"PMID": "38616399", "Title": "First Report of powdery mildew of Quercus guyavifolia (Fagaceae) Caused by Erysiphe quercicola.", "Abstract": "Oaks are the most abundant trees in naturally regenerated forests in China, play a crucial role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining ecological stability (Du et al. 2022). Quercus guyavifolia H. L\u00e9veill\u00e9 (Fagaceae family, Subgenus Cerris, section Ilex), is endemic in China, distributed in the southeastern boundary of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with elevations from 2, 000 - 4, 500 m a.s.l. (Denk et al. 2018; Sun et al. 2016). Powdery mildew is a prevalent disease of oaks with up to 60% of foliage infection, which can induce leaf necrosis or deformation and might contribute to oak decline (Mar\u00e7ais and Desprez-Loustau 2014). In September 2023, we found leaves of Q. guyavifolia near Yunnan Baima Snow Mountain covered with white fungal colonies. Diseased Q. guyavifolia plants were transplanted into a greenhouse at Yunnan University for pathogenicity tests. Conidia from diseased plants were blown into twenty healthy Q. guyavifolia seedlings by cold air blower and five non-inoculated healthy seedlings were used as control. The inoculated seedlings developed powdery mildew symptoms within ten days on both sides of the leaves. Trypan blue staining was used to identify the pathogen that infects Q. guyavifolia (Xiao et al. 2017). Microscopic examination revealed abundant conidia and extensive branched hyphae on leaves, similar to the characteristics of powdery mildew fungi. The mean length and width of conidia were 29.06 \u00b1 3.96 \u00d7 9.52 \u00b1 1.36 \u03bcm (n = 50). We collected fungi (YNBAIMAXS01) and extracted genomic DNA from five diseased plants (from the same location) using the CTAB method. We amplified and sequenced the ITS (Gardes and Bruns, 1993), MS294, and MS447 (two nuclear protein-encoding genes; Feau et al. 2011; GenBank numbers: PP079015, PP083693, PP083694). BLAST analysis revealed 100% identity of above three sequences with the ITS of Erysiphe quercicola isolate DACA010 (GenBank accession MT569439), MS294 of E. quercicola isolate GEM09_11_FRTB1 (GenBank accession KY348509), and MS447 of E. quercicola isolate A1I1.5 (GenBank accession KY466619). Therefore, the isolate YNBAIMAXS01 was identified as E. quercicola based on its morphological and molecular characteristics. Sequences from the above three regions for YNBAIMAXS01 and five Erysiphe species were used to construct a Maximum likelihood (ML) tree. In addition, we constructed a ML tree using only the ITS region of YNBAIMAXS01 and eight Erysiphe species from GenBank to better distinguish E. quercicola from these species. Both trees were constructed using MEGA X with K2 + G as best model. The ML trees confirmed the powdery mildew fungi isolated from Q. guyavifolia is closely related to E. alphitoides. To date, thirty-four powdery mildew species belonging to genus Erysiphe have been found affecting Quercus and nine oak species can be infected by E. quercicola (https://fungi.ars.usda.gov/).

To investigate this, we conducted experiments using a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Adenovirus carrying RP105 was injected apically at multiple points, and after 72\u00a0h, the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 30\u00a0min followed by 2\u00a0h of reperfusion. In vitro experiments were performed on H9C2 cells, which were transfected with recombinant adenoviral vectors for 48\u00a0h, subjected to 4\u00a0h of hypoxia, and then reoxygenated for 2\u00a0h. We measured oxidative stress markers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, using a microplate reader. The fluorescence intensity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in myocardial tissue was measured using a DHE probe. We also investigated the upstream and downstream components of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Upregulation of RP105 increased SOD and GSH-Px activities, reduced MDA concentration, and inhibited ROS production in response to I/R injury in vivo and hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) stimulation in vitro. The overexpression of RP105 led to a decrease in the myocardial enzyme LDH in serum and cell culture supernatant, as well as a reduction in infarct size. Additionally, left ventricular fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) were improved in the RP105 overexpression group compared to the control. Upregulation of RP105 promoted the expression of Lyn and Syk and further activated STAT phosphorylation, which was blocked by PP2 (a Lyn inhibitor).

Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dichlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe-N4 site formation without Fe NPs clustering at as low as 360\u2009\u00b0C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe-N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe-N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behaviour of the Fe-N-C material.

C1-functionalization (glycosylation) and C1,C2-difunctionalization of carbohydrates have been well developed. In contrast, C3-functionalization or C1,C3-difunctionalization of carbohydrates remains rare. Herein, we report such processes that efficiently and stereoselectively modify carbohydrates. Specifically, we found that trifluoroethanol (TFE) could promote 1,3-bis-indolylation/pyrrolylation of 2-nitroglycals generated carbohydrate derivatives in up to 93% yield at room temperature; slightly reducing the temperature could install two different indoles at the C1- and C3-positions. Switching TFE to a bifunctional amino thiourea catalyst leads to the generation of C3 monosubstituted carbohydrates, which could also be used to construct 1,3-di-C-functionalized carbohydrates. This approach produced a range of challenging sugar derivatives (over 80 examples) with controllable and high stereoselectivity (single isomer for over 90% of the examples). The potential applications of the reaction were demonstrated by a set of transformations including the synthesis of bridged large-ring molecules and gram scale reactions.

However, the natively unfolded structure of tau complicates the structure-based ligand design, and the relatively large surface areas that mediate tau-tau interactions in aggregation limit the potential for identifying high-affinity ligand binding sites. Herein, a group of isatin-pyrrolidinylpyridine derivative isomers (IPP1-IPP4) were designed and synthesized. They are like different forms of molecular \"transformers\". These isatin isomers exhibit different inhibitory effects on tau self-aggregation or even possess a depolymerizing effect. Our results revealed for the first time that the direct inhibitor of tau protein aggregation is not only determined by the previously reported conjugated structure, substituent, hydrogen bond donor, etc. but also depends more importantly on the molecular shape. In combination with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, a new inhibition mechanism was proposed: like a \"molecular clip\", IPP1 could noncovalently bind and fix a tau polypeptide chain at a multipoint to prevent the transition from the \"natively unfolded conformation\" to the \"aggregation competent conformation\" before nucleation. At the cellular and animal levels, the effectiveness of the inhibitor of the IPP1 has been confirmed, providing an innovative design strategy as well as a lead compound for Alzheimer's disease drug development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Keke", "Last Name": "Chai", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Assessment and Sustainability, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Tu", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Assessment and Sustainability, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}, {"First Name": "Junjie", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Assessment and Sustainability, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}, {"First Name": "Kang", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Assessment and Sustainability, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuo", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Assessment and Sustainability, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}, {"First Name": "Tianming", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Assessment and Sustainability, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."}], "Journal": "ACS central science", "PubDate": "2024Mar27"}, {"PMID": "38554174", "Title": "Efficacy of flexible ureterorenoscopy with holmium laser in the management of calyceal diverticular calculi.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy in the management of calyceal diverticular calculi.

Several E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified owing to advancements in sequencing and annotation of the wheat genome.

This study identified 14 members of the APC gene family in the wheat genome and divided them into three subgroups (CCS52B, CCS52A, and CDC20) to better understand their functions. Promoter sequence analysis revealed the presence of several cis-acting elements related to hormone and stress responses in the APC E3 ubiquitin ligases in wheat. All identified APC E3 ubiquitin ligase family members were highly expressed in the leaves, and the expression of most genes was induced by the application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA).

Here, tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid (TPPS) is explored as an electrolyte additive for advanced Zn anodes. It is interesting to note that TPPS spontaneously assembles into unique aggregates. As they adsorb on the Zn anode, the aggregates enhance the resistance to electrolyte percolation and dendrite growth compared to single molecules. Meanwhile, TPPS facilitates anion association in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, and boosts the transference number of Zn2+ up to 0.95. Therefore, anion-related side reactions and anion-induced electrode overpotentials are reduced accordingly. In this context, the electrolyte containing TPPS exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Even under a high loading of MnO2 (25\u2005mg\u2009cm-2), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=1.7), and a lean electrolyte (15\u2005\u03bcL\u2009mAh-1), the full cells still represent a higher cumulative capacity compared to the reported data.

Using in vivo rat carotid artery injury models and in vitro ischemia and hypoxia cell models employing human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (T/G HA-VSMCs), a comprehensive investigative framework was established. Histological analysis confirmed intimal hyperplasia in rat models. CHOP expression in vascular tissues was assessed using Western blot and immunohistochemical staining, and its presence in HAECs and T/G HA-VSMCs was determined through RT-PCR and Western blot. The study evaluated HAEC apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine secretion, cell proliferation, and T/G HA-VSMCs migration through Western blot, ELISA, CCK8, and Transwell migration assays. The rat carotid artery injury model revealed substantial fibrous plaque formation and vascular stenosis, resulting in an increased intimal area and plaque-to-lumen area ratio. Notably, CHOP is markedly elevated in vessels of the carotid artery injury model compared to normal vessels. Atorvastatin effectively mitigated vascular stenosis and suppresses CHOP protein expression. In HAECs, ischemia and hypoxia-induced CHOP upregulation, along with heightened TNF\u03b1, IL-6, caspase3, and caspase8 levels, while reducing cell proliferation. Atorvastatin demonstrated a dose-dependent suppression of CHOP expression in HAECs. Downregulation of CHOP or atorvastatin treatment led to reduced IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 secretion, coupled with augmented cell proliferation. Similarly, ischemia and hypoxia conditions increased CHOP expression in T/G HA-VSMCs, which was concentration-dependently inhibited by atorvastatin. Furthermore, significantly increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 concentrations in the cell culture supernatant correlated with enhanced T/G HA-VSMCs migration. However, interventions targeting CHOP downregulation and atorvastatin usage curtailed MMP-9 and MMP-2 secretion and suppressed cell migration. In conclusion, CHOP plays a crucial role in endothelial injury, proliferation, and VSMCs migration during carotid artery injury, serving as a pivotal regulator in post-injury fibrous plaque formation and vascular remodeling. Statins emerge as protectors of endothelial cells, restraining VSMCs migration by modulating CHOP expression.", "Keywords": ["CHOP", "Carotid artery injury", "Plaque", "Vascular remodeling", "Vascular stenosis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, NO, 183 Yiling Road, Yichang, 443003, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Qin", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, NO, 183 Yiling Road, Yichang, 443003, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Zi-Yi", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, NO, 183 Yiling Road, Yichang, 443003, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Fei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, NO, 183 Yiling Road, Yichang, 443003, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Cun-Yu", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medicine, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, 443000, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, NO, 183 Yiling Road, Yichang, 443003, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jia-Wang", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, NO, 183 Yiling Road, Yichang, 443003, Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Yichang Central People's Hospital, NO, 183 Yiling Road, Yichang, 443003, Hubei, People's Republic of China. yangjian@ctgu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Biochemical genetics", "PubDate": "2024Mar25"}, {"PMID": "38526128", "Title": "The \u03c9-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Docosahexaenoic Acid Enhances NK-Cell Antitumor Effector Functions.", "Abstract": "\u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are known to directly repress tumor development and progression. In this study, we explored whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a type of \u03c9-3 PUFA, had an immunomodulatory role in inhibiting tumor growth in immunocompetent mice. The number of natural killer (NK) cells but not the number of T or B cells was decreased by DHA supplementation in various tissues under physiologic conditions. Although the frequency and number of NK cells were comparable, IFN\u03b3 production by NK cells in both the spleen and lung was increased in DHA-supplemented mice in the mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor model. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that DHA promoted effector function and oxidative phosphorylation in NK cells but had no obvious effects on other immune cells. Using Rag2-/- mice and NK-cell depletion by PK136 antibody injection, we demonstrated that the suppression of B16F10 melanoma tumor growth in the lung by DHA supplementation was dependent mainly on NK cells. In vitro experiments showed that DHA directly enhanced IFN\u03b3 production, CD107a expression, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity and slightly increased proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) protein expression in NK cells.

Current treatments lack understanding on how to effectively alleviate oxidative stress, relieve inflammation, as well as modulate gut microbiota for maintaining intestinal homeostasis synchronously. In this study, a novel drug delivery system based on a metal polyphenol network (MPN) was constructed via metal coordination between epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and Fe3+. Curcumin (Cur), an active polyphenolic compound, with distinguished anti-inflammatory activity was assembled and encapsulated into MPN to generate Cur-MPN. The obtained Cur-MPN could serve as a robust reactive oxygen species modulator by efficiently scavenging superoxide radical (O2\u2022-) as well as hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH). By hitchhiking yeast microcapsule (YM), Cur-MPN was then encapsulated into YM to obtain CM@YM. Our findings demonstrated that CM@YM was able to protect Cur-MPN to withstand the harsh gastrointestinal environment and enhance the targeting and retention abilities of the inflamed colon. When administered orally, CM@YM could alleviate DSS-induced colitis with protective and therapeutic effects by scavenging ROS, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and regulating the polarization of macrophages to M1, thus restoring barrier function and maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Importantly, CM@YM also modulated the gut microbiome to a favorable state by improving bacterial diversity and transforming the compositional structure to an anti-inflammatory phenotype as well as increasing the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid).

However, the most widely used methods for high-throughput detection of environmental cyanobacteria, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, typically provide above-species-level resolution, thereby disregarding intraspecific variation. To address this, we developed a novel DNA microarray tool, termed the CyanoStrainChip, that enables strain-level comprehensive profiling of environmental cyanobacteria. The CyanoStrainChip was designed to target 1277 strains; nearly all major groups of cyanobacteria are included by implementing 43,666 genome-wide, strain-specific probes. It demonstrated strong specificity by in vitro mock community experiments. The high correlation (Pearson's R > 0.97) between probe fluorescence intensities and the corresponding DNA amounts (ranging from 1-100 ng) indicated excellent quantitative capability. Consistent cyanobacterial profiles of field samples were observed by both the CyanoStrainChip and next-generation sequencing methods. Furthermore, CyanoStrainChip analysis of surface water samples in Lake Chaohu uncovered a high intraspecific variation of abundance change within the genus Microcystis between different severity levels of cyanobacterial blooms, highlighting two toxic Microcystis strains that are of critical concern for Lake Chaohu harmful blooms suppression.

However, due to the scarcity of SCO hosts and their own limited cavities, the interplay between the SCO host and the multiple guests binding has remained elusive. In this contribution, we present a family of pseudo-octahedral coordination cages (M6L4, M = ZnII, CoII, FeII, and NiII) assembled from a tritopic tridentate ligand L with metal ions. The utilization of FeII ion leads to the successful creation of the Fe6L4-type SCO cage. Host-guest studies of these M6L4 cages reveal their capacity to encapsulate four adamantine-based guests. Notably, the spin transition temperature T1/2 of Fe6L4 is dependent on the multiple guests encapsulated. The inclusion of adamantine yields an unprecedented T1/2 shift of 54 K, a record shift in guest-mediated SCO coordination cages to date. This drastic shift is ascribed to the synergistic effect of multiple guests coupled with their optimal fit within the host. Through a straightforward thermodynamic cycle, the binding affinities of the high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS) states are separated from their apparent binding constant. This result indicates that the LS state has a stronger binding affinity for the multiple guests than the HS state. Exploring the SCO thermodynamics of host-guest complexes allows us to examine the optimal fit of multiple guests to the host cavity. This study reveals that the T1/2 of the SCO host can be manipulated by the encapsulation of multiple guests, and the SCO cage is an ideal candidate for determining the multiple guest fit.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou 350002, P.

The Gut microbiota (GM) produce neuroactives, specifically neurotransmitters that modulates local and central neuronal brain functions. An imbalance between intestinal commensals and pathobionts leads to a disruption in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis, which affects intestinal barrier integrity and gut-immune and neuroimmune systems. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT elicits its action by ameliorating inflammatory responses through the restoration of microbial composition and functionality. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic option in suppressing neuroinflammation in post-stroke conditions and other neurological disorders involving the neuroimmune axis. Specifically, FMT protects against ischemic injury by decreasing IL-17, IFN-\u03b3, Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, FMT improves cognitive function by lowering amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and upregulating synaptic marker (PSD-95, synapsin-1) expression in Alzheimer's disease. In Parkinson's disease, FMT was shown to inhibit the expression of TLR4 and NF-\u03baB.

Although there are many treatments for bladder cancer, identifying more effective drugs and methods remains an urgent problem. As a pivotal component of contemporary medical practice, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) assumes a crucial role in the realm of anti-tumor therapy, especially with the identification of active ingredients and successful exploration of pharmacological effects. Febrifugine, identified as a quinazoline-type alkaloid compound extracted from the Cytidiaceae family plant Huangchangshan, exhibits heightened sensitivity to bladder cancer cells in comparison to control cells (non-cancer cells) group. The proliferation growth of bladder cancer cells T24 and SW780 was effectively inhibited by Febrifugine, and the IC50 was 0.02 and 0.018\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. Febrifugine inhibits cell proliferation by suppressing DNA synthesis and induces cell death by reducing steroidogenesis and promoting apoptosis. Combined with transcriptome analysis, Febrifugine was found to downregulate low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein, lanosterol synthase, cholesterol biosynthesis second rate-limiting enzyme, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, flavin adenine dinucleotide dependent oxidoreductase and other factors to inhibit the production of intracellular steroids in bladder cancer T24 cells. The results of animal experiments showed that Febrifugine could inhibit tumor growth. In summary, the effect of Febrifugine on bladder cancer is mainly through reducing steroid production and apoptosis. Therefore, this study contributes to the elucidation of Febrifugine's potential as an inhibitor of bladder cancer and establishes a solid foundation for the future development of novel therapeutic agents targeting bladder cancer.", "Keywords": ["Apoptosis", "Bladder cancer", "Febrifugine", "Steroidogenesis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Quinazolines", "Apoptosis", "Piperidines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jingyuan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Urumqi 830052, China; Precision Medicine Laboratory for Chronic Non-communicable Diseases of Shandong Province, Jining 272067, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuhao", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Precision Medicine Laboratory for Chronic Non-communicable Diseases of Shandong Province, Jining 272067, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianhua", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Precision Medicine Laboratory for Chronic Non-communicable Diseases of Shandong Province, Jining 272067, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Le", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xinjiang Agricultural University, Urumqi 830052, China.

More reliable molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis in CRC patients are needed. A crucial role for thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 6 (TRIP6) is played in tumorigenesis and tumor growth. Our study aims to determine the diagnostic and prognostic roles of TRIP6 at CRC. TRIP6 gene expression levels were analyzed in this study from public databases. The relationship between TRIP6 expression and clinicopathological characteristics was explored by logistic regression analysis. Based on Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) analysis, the prognostic and diagnostic values of TRIP6 were determined. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks analysis were performed using the STRING database. A Spearman's correlation analysis applied for examining the correlation between TRIP6 expression, immune cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint genes. Moreover, colony formation assay and transwell assay were used to investigate the functions of TRIP6. TRIP6 was highly expressed in CRC cancer tissues and cells. K-M survival analysis indicated that a high expression of TRIP6 was associated with poor prognosis. TRIP6 expression was obviously associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression. For validation, the results of collected clinical CRC samples show that TRIP6 levels in CRC tumor tissue were higher than those of paired adjacent colorectal tissues. Additionally, in vitro experiments suggested that TRIP6 knockdown suppressed proliferation and migration in CRC cell line RKO. TRIP6 overexpression promoted the proliferation and migration of normal colon cell line NCM460. High TRIP6 expression is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration which may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target for CRC, providing new insights into its role in CRC.", "Keywords": ["Colorectal cancer", "Immune cell infiltration", "Immune checkpoints", "Prognostic biomarker", "TRIP6"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huijuan", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziwei", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China."}, {"First Name": "Jialing", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China."}, {"First Name": "Yihan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China."}, {"First Name": "Kangliang", "Last Name": "Sheng", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China. kangliang@ahu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Hefei, Anhui, China. guokunmedical@126.com."}, {"First Name": "Yongzhong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei, Anhui, China. yzwang@ahu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Biochemical genetics", "PubDate": "2024Mar02"}, {"PMID": "38429281", "Title": "Expert consensus on difficulty assessment of endodontic therapy.", "Abstract": "Endodontic diseases are a kind of chronic infectious oral disease. Common endodontic treatment concepts are based on the removal of inflamed or necrotic pulp tissue and the replacement by gutta-percha.

Recent research, encompassing bacterial etiology and advanced imaging techniques, contributes to our understanding of the root canal system's anatomy intricacies and the technique sensitivity of RCT. Success in RCT hinges on factors like patients, infection severity, root canal anatomy, and treatment techniques. Therefore, improving disease management is a key issue to combat endodontic diseases and cure periapical lesions. The clinical difficulty assessment system of RCT is established based on patient conditions, tooth conditions, root canal configuration, and root canal needing retreatment, and emphasizes pre-treatment risk assessment for optimal outcomes. The findings suggest that the presence of risk factors may correlate with the challenge of achieving the high standard required for RCT.

Astaxanthin (ASTA), a natural antioxidant, can effectively protect against OTA-induced hepatotoxicity; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. In the present study, we elucidate the protective effects of ASTA on the OTA-induced damage of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in broiler liver samples by serum biochemical analysis, antioxidant analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. ASTA inhibited the expressions of ahr, pxr, car, cyp1a1, cyp1a5, cyp2c18, cyp2d6, and cyp3a9 genes, and significantly alleviated OTA-induced liver oxidative damage (SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, MDA). Furthermore, it inhibited OTA-activated endoplasmic reticulum stress genes and proteins (grp94, GRP78, atf4, ATF6, perk, eif2\u03b1, ire1, CHOP). ASTA alleviated OTA-induced mitochondrial dynamic imbalance, inhibited mitochondrial division (DRP1, mff), and promoted mitochondrial fusion (OPA1, MFN1, MFN2).

Considering that there is no effective drug treatment, it is important to seek preventive treatment for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Although astragaloside IV (AS-IV) protects against NIHL by reducing serum inflammatory factors, there is scarce information on the regulation of inflammatory factors by AS-IV to prevent NIHL. We investigated the hearing thresholds and relationship between the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal microbiota of c57bl/6j mice exposed to noise (103 dB SPL 4 h\u00b7d-1) for 7 days, treated with or without AS-IV. Our results revealed a lower hearing threshold and lower serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 in the mice treated with AS-IV. Additionally, AS-IV increased the abundance levels of the phylum Firmicutes, class Bacillus, order Lactobacillus, and family Lactobacillus (p < 0.05), and decreased those of the phylum Bacteroidetes and order Bacteroidales (p < 0.05). Lactobacillus and Bacilli negatively correlated with TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b3, and IL-1\u03b2; Erysipelotrichaceae negatively correlated with INF-\u03b3; and Clostridiales positively correlated with IL-1\u03b2. In conclusion, AS-IV reduces the elevation of hearing thresholds in mice, preventing hearing loss in mice exposed to noise, and under the intervention of AS-IV, changes in the levels of inflammatory factors correlate with intestinal flora.

This study aims to investigate the effects of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) on the phagocytosis of macrophage via CD47 and the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via TIPRL. Our results demonstrate that lncRNA KCTD21-AS1 increases in NSCLC tissues and is associated with poor survival of patients. KCTD21-AS1 and its m6A modification by Mettl14 promote NSCLC cell proliferation. miR-519d-5p gain suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells by regulating CD47 and TIPRL. Through ceRNA with miR-519d-5p, KCTD21-AS1 regulates the expression of CD47 and TIPRL, which further regulates macrophage phagocytosis and cancer cell autophagy. Low miR-519d-5p in patients with NSCLC corresponds with poor survival. High TIPRL or CD47 levels in patients with NSCLC corresponds with poor survival.

In this study, we propose a separable attention network (comprising high-intensity priority (HP) attention and low-intensity separation (LS) attention), named SANet. Our SANet could explore the areas of high-and low-intensity regions in the \"forward\" and \"reverse\" directions with the help of the auxiliary contrast while learning clearer anatomical structure and edge information for the SR of a target-contrast MR image. SANet provides three appealing benefits: First, it is the first model to explore a separable attention mechanism that uses the auxiliary contrast to predict the high-and low-intensity regions, diverting more attention to refining any uncertain details between these regions and correcting the fine areas in the reconstructed results. Second, a multistage integration module is proposed to learn the response of multi-contrast fusion at multiple stages, get the dependency between the fused representations, and boost their representation ability. Third, extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art multi-contrast SR methods on fastMRI and clinical in vivo datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.

Therefore, the promotion of tendon healing has become the focus of regenerative medicine. The purpose of this study was to develop a gradient COL1/ hydroxyapatite (HAp) biomaterial loaded with human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). The performance of common cross-linking agents, Genipin, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS), and dual cross-linked materials were compared to select the best cross-linking mechanism to optimize the biological and mechanical properties of the scaffold. The optimal COL1/HAp-loaded with hAMSCs were implanted into the tendon-bone rotator cuff interfaces in rats and the effect on the tendon-bone healing was assessed by micro-CT, histological analysis, and biomechanical properties. The results showed that Genipin and EDC/NHS dual cross-linked COL1/HAp had good biological activity and mechanical properties and promoted the proliferation and differentiation of hAMSCs. Animal experiments showed that the group using a scaffold loaded with hAMSCs had excellent continuity and orientation of collagen fibers, increased fibrocartilage and bone formation, and significantly higher biomechanical functions than the control group at the interface at 12\u00a0weeks post operation. This study demonstrated that dual cross-linked gradient COL1/HAp-loaded hAMSCs could promote interface healing, thereby providing a feasible strategy for tendon-bone interface regeneration.", "Keywords": ["Gradient scaffold", "Stem cells", "Tendon-bone regeneration", "Tissue engineering"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Animals", "Rats", "Rotator Cuff", "Durapatite", "Bionics", "Tendons", "Immunologic Factors", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Collagen", "Iridoids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaomei", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing and School of Public Health, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China; Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Meijuan", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing and School of Public Health, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China; Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yuxia", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China; Medical College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Mengbo", "Last Name": "Dang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China; Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China; Medical College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Junli", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Dianwei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China; Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Mingjun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital, Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, PR China; Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Hang", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, PR China.

In this paper, we explore several useful properties, including high-resolution representation, auxiliary guidance, and model robustness, which collectively contribute to a novel method for accurate human parsing in both simple and complex scenes. Starting from simple scenes: we propose the boundary-aware hybrid resolution network (BHRN), an advanced human parsing network. BHRN utilizes deconvolutional layers and multi-scale supervision to generate rich high-resolution representations. Additionally, it includes an edge perceiving branch designed to enhance the fineness of part boundaries. Building on BHRN, we construct a dual-task mutual learning (DTML) framework. It not only provides implicit guidance to assist the parser by incorporating boundary features, but also explicitly maintains the high-order consistency between the parsing prediction and the ground truth. Toward complex scenes: we develop a domain transform method to enhance the model robustness. By transforming the input space from the spatial domain to the polar harmonic Fourier moment domain, the mapping relationship to the output semantic space is highly stable. This transformation yields robust representations for both clean and corrupted data. When evaluated on standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art human parsing methods. Furthermore, our domain transform strategy significantly improves the robustness of DTML dramatically in most complex scenes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yunan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chunpeng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mingyu", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Gui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shanshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence", "PubDate": "2024Feb16"}, {"PMID": "38362100", "Title": "Validity and applicability of the global leadership initiative on malnutrition criteria in non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease.", "Abstract": "There are no standardized assessment criteria for selecting nutritional risk screening tools or indicators to assess reduced muscle mass (RMM) in the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria.

been the subject of continuous exploration by scientists. With the help of modern neuroimaging techniques, there has been significant progress made in brain disorder analysis. There is an increasing interest about utilizing artificial intelligence techniques to improve the efficiency of disorder diagnosis in recent years. However, these methods rely only on neuroimaging data for disorder diagnosis and do not explore the pathogenic mechanism behind the disorder or provide an interpretable result toward the diagnosis decision. Furthermore, the scarcity of medical data limits the performance of existing methods. As the hot application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in molecular graphs and drug discovery due to its strong graph-structured data learning ability, whether GNNs can also play a huge role in the field of brain disorder analysis. Thus, in this work, we innovatively model brain neuroimaging data into graph-structured data and propose knowledge distillation (KD) guided brain subgraph neural networks to extract discriminative subgraphs between patient and healthy brain graphs to explain which brain regions and abnormal functional connectivities cause the disorder. Specifically, we introduce the KD technique to transfer the knowledge of pretrained teacher model to guide brain subgraph neural networks training and alleviate the problem of insufficient training data. And these discriminative subgraphs are conducive to learn better brain graph-level representations for disorder prediction. We conduct abundant experiments on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets, i.e., Parkinson's disease (PD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and experimental results well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other brain graph analysis methods for disorder prediction accuracy. The interpretable experimental results given by our method are consistent with corresponding medical research, which is encouraging to provide a potential for deeper brain disorder study.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xuexiong", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongyang", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chuan", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "PubDate": "2024Feb13"}, {"PMID": "38353507", "Title": "Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement for functional tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided valve surgery: A single-center experience.", "Abstract": "Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) following left-sided valve surgery (LSVS) is of clinical significance due to its high recurrence and mortality rates.

The low efficiency of self-charging has been the key challenge at present. Here, a more efficient autoxidation self-charging mechanism is realized by introducing hemoglobin (Hb) as a positive electrode additive in the polyaniline (PANI)-zinc battery system. The heme acts as a catalyst that reduces the energy barrier of the autoxidation reaction by regulating the charge and spin state of O2. To realize self-charging, the adsorbed O2 molecules capture electrons of the reduced (discharged state) PANI, leading to the desorption of zinc ions and the oxidation of PANI to complete self-charging. The battery can discharge for 12 min (0.5 C) after 50 self-charging/discharge cycles, while there is nearly no discharge capacity in the absence of Hb.

The classification accuracy of the ResNet model and SVM exceeds that of other conventional machine learning models (KNN, RF, and XGBoost). Redundant variables were further diminished through competitive adaptive reweighted sampling feature wavelength screening, which had less impact on the model's accuracy. Upon validating the model's performance using an external validation set, the ResNet model yielded more satisfactory outcomes, exhibiting recognition accuracy exceeding 85%. In conclusion, the comprehensive results demonstrate that the integration of deep learning with HSI techniques effectively distinguishes Coix seed samples from different storage years.", "Keywords": ["Coix seed", "classification and recognition", "food authenticity", "hyperspectral imaging", "machine learning"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruibin", "Last Name": "Bai", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Junhui", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Siman", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Tiegui", "Last Name": "Nan", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}, {"First Name": "Chu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Information Engineering, Huzhou University, Huzhou 313000, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Journal": "Foods (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2024Feb04"}, {"PMID": "38336832", "Title": "Multi-omics revealed molecular mechanism of biphenyl phytoalexin formation in response to yeast extract-induced oxidative stress in Sorbus aucuparia suspension cells.", "Abstract": "Yeast extract-induced oxidative stress in Sorbus aucuparia suspension cells leads to the biosynthesis of various hormones, which activates specific signaling pathways that augments biphenyl phytoalexin production. Pathogen incursions pose a significant threat to crop yield and can have a pronounced effect on agricultural productivity and food security. Biphenyl phytoalexins are a specialized group of secondary metabolites that are mainly biosynthesized by Pyrinae plants as a defense mechanism against various pathogens. Despite previous research demonstrating that biphenyl phytoalexin production increased dramatically in Sorbus aucuparia suspension cells (SASCs) treated with yeast extract (YE), the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted an in-depth, multi-omics analysis of transcriptome, proteome, and metabolite (including biphenyl phytoalexins and phytohormones) dynamics in SASCs exposed to YE. Our results indicated that exposure to YE-induced oxidative stress in SASCs, leading to the biosynthesis of a range of hormones, including jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonic acid isoleucine (JA-ILE), gibberellin A4 (GA4), indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). These hormones activated specific signaling pathways that promoted phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and augmented biphenyl phytoalexin production. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during this process also acted as signaling molecules, amplifying the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis cascade through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Key genes involved in these signaling pathways included SaBIS1, SaBIS2, SaBIS3, SaPAL, SaB4H, SaOMT, SaUGT1, SaLOX2, SaPR1, SaCHIB1, SaCHIB2 and SaCHIB3.

The research focus lies in the circulation of manganese (Mn) in the environment to enhance pollutant removal within CWs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in understanding the role and effects of Mn in chemical weapons, based on literature retrieval from 2002 to 2021. Ecological risk assessment and heavy metals within CWs emerge as current areas of research interest. Mn sources within CWs primarily include natural deposition, heavy metal wastewater, and intentional addition. The cycling between Mn(II) and Mn(IV) facilitates enhanced wastewater treatment within CWs. Moreover, employing a Mn matrix proves effective in reducing ammonia nitrogen wastewater, organic pollutants, as well as heavy metals such as Cd and Pb, thereby addressing complex pollution challenges practically. To comprehensively analyze influencing factors on the system's performance, both internal factors (biological species, design parameters, pH levels, etc.) and external factors (seasonal climate variations, precipitation patterns, ultraviolet radiation exposure, etc.) were discussed. Among these factors, microorganisms, pollutants, and temperature are the most important influencing factors, which emphasizes the importance of these factors for wetland operation. Lastly, this paper delves into plant absorption of Mn along with coping strategies employed by plants when faced with Mn poisoning or deficiency scenarios.

Studies with a ring-array PA tomography system, coupled with analysis of control nanoparticles lacking a targeting element (CPNPs), revealed that cRGD conjugation promoted the delivery of the NPs through abnormal vessels around the tumor to the solid tumor core. This proved true in both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor mice models, as confirmed by immunofluorescent studies. In combination with NIR-II laser photoirradiation, the cRGD-CPNPs provided near-baseline tumor growth inhibition through PTT both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the combination of the present cRGD-CPNPs and photoirradiation was found to inhibit intra-abdominal metastases in an orthotopic pancreatic tumor mouse model.

To achieve such cross-modal perception on machines, existing methods take advantage of the maps obtained by interpolation operations to localize the sound source. As semantic object-level localization is more attractive for prospective practical applications, we argue that these map-based methods only offer a coarse-grained and indirect description of the sound source. Additionally, these methods utilize a single audio-visual tuple at a time during self-supervised learning, causing the model to lose the crucial chance to reason about the data distribution of large-scale audio-visual samples. Although the introduction of Audio-Visual Contrastive Learning (AVCL) can effectively alleviate this issue, the contrastive set constructed by randomly sampling is based on the assumption that the audio and visual segments from all other videos are not semantically related. Since the resulting contrastive set contains a large number of faulty negatives, we believe that this assumption is rough. In this paper, we advocate a novel proposal-based solution that directly localizes the semantic object-level sound source, without any manual annotations. The Global Response Map (GRM) is incorporated as an unsupervised spatial constraint to filter those instances corresponding to a large number of sound-unrelated regions. As a result, our proposal-based Sound Source Localization (SSL) can be cast into a simpler Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. To overcome the limitation of random sampling in AVCL, we propose a novel Active Contrastive Set Mining (ACSM) to mine the contrastive sets with informative and diverse negatives for robust AVCL.

The results showed that the estimated heritabilities of semen traits ranged from 0.06 (total number of motile sperm, TNMS) to 0.37 (percentage of abnormal sperm, PAS) and conformation traits ranged from 0.23 (pin width, PW) to 0.69 (hip height, HH). The highest genetic correlations were found between semen volume per ejaculation (SVPE), semen concentration per ejaculation (SCPE), total number of sperm (TNS), and TNMS traits that were 0.97, 0.98, 1.00, and 0.99, respectively. Phenotypic correlations between SC and SVPE, SCPE, TNS, and TNMS were 0.35, 0.35, 0.48, and 0.42, respectively. In summary, the moderate or high heritability of semen traits indicates that genetic improvement of semen quality by selection is feasible, where SC could be a useful trait for indirect selection or as correlated information to improve semen quantity and production in the practical bull breeding programs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Miao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanqin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanpei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Shandong OX Livestock Breeding Co., Ltd., Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Shandong OX Livestock Breeding Co., Ltd., Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Shandong OX Livestock Breeding Co., Ltd., Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiuxin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Shandong OX Livestock Breeding Co., Ltd., Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Junqing", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "Fine Breed Centre of Animal Husbandry of HeBei, Shijiazhuang 050061, China."}, {"First Name": "Yabin", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Fine Breed Centre of Animal Husbandry of HeBei, Shijiazhuang 050061, China."}, {"First Name": "Rongling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Lingling", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Shandong OX Livestock Breeding Co., Ltd., Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Guosheng", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Shandong OX Livestock Breeding Co., Ltd., Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yundong", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianbin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China."}], "Journal": "Veterinary medicine international", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38317221", "Title": "HAND factors regulate cardiac lineage commitment and differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells.", "Abstract": "Transcription factors HAND1 and HAND2 (HAND1/2) play significant roles in cardiac organogenesis.

TMAO plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis plaque, which is one of the causative factors of the stroke event. Preclinical and clinical investigations on the TMAO and associated stroke risk, severity, and outcomes are summarised in this review. In addition, mechanisms of TMAO-driven vascular dysfunction are also discussed, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, thrombus and foam cell formation, altered cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, etc. Post-stroke inflammatory cascades involving activation of immune cells, i.e., microglia and astrocytes, result in Blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, allowing TMAO to infiltrate the brain and further aggravate inflammation. This event occurs as a result of the activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway through the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that further aggravate the BBB and initiate further recruitment of immune cells in the brain.

Notably, phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), a bacterial derived metabolite, has recently gained attention due to its role in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. This meta-organismal metabolite PAGln is a byproduct of amino acid acetylation of its precursor phenylacetic acid (PAA) from a range of dietary sources like egg, meat, dairy products, etc. The microbiota-dependent metabolism of phenylalanine produces PAA, which is a crucial intermediate that is catalyzed by diverse microbial catalytic pathways. PAA conjugates with glutamine and glycine in the liver and kidney to predominantly form phenylacetylglutamine in humans and phenylacetylglycine in rodents. PAGln is associated with thrombosis as it enhances platelet activation mediated through the GPCRs receptors \u03b12A, \u03b12B, and \u03b22 ADRs, thereby aggravating the pathological conditions. Clinical evidence suggests that elevated levels of PAGln are associated with pathology of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and neurological diseases.

The intestinal mucosal barrier is the first defense of the organism against commensal flora and intestinal pathogens and is closely associated with the occurrence and development of CRC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which BF mediates intestinal barrier injury and CRC progression. SW480 cells and a Caco2 intestinal barrier model were treated with entero-toxigenic BF (ETBF), its enterotoxin (B. fragilis toxin, BFT), and non-toxigenic BF (NTBF). Cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assays were performed to analyze the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of SW480 cells. Transmission electron microscopy, FITC-dextran, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were used to analyze damage in the Caco2 intestinal barrier model. The Azoxymethane/Dextran Sulfate Sodium (AOM/DSS) animal model was established to evaluate the effect of ETBF on intestinal barrier injury and CRC progression in vivo. ETBF and BFT enhanced the viability, wound healing ratio, invasion, and EMT of SW480 cells. In addition, ETBF and BFT disrupted the tight junctions and villus structure in the intestinal barrier model, resulting in increased permeability and reduced TEER. Similarly, the expression of intestinal barrier-related proteins (MUC2, Occludin and Zo-1) was restricted by ETBF and BFT. Interestingly, the STAT3/ZEB2 axis was activated by ETBF and BFT, and treatment with Brevilin A (a STAT3 inhibitor) or knockdown of ZEB2 limited the promotional effect of ETBF and BFT on the SW480 malignant phenotype. In vivo experiments also confirmed that ETBF colonization accelerated tumor load, carcinogenesis, and intestinal mucosal barrier damage in the colorectum of the AOM/DSS animal model, and that treatment with Brevilin A alleviated these processes. ETBF-secreted BFT accelerated intestinal barrier damage and CRC by activating the STAT3/ZEB2 axis.

Our simulation studies demonstrated that gene-based tests maintained an appropriate type I error rate at \u03b1=0.001. Notably, when 5% or more heteroplasmic variants within a target region were linked to an outcome, burden-extension tests (including the adaptive burden test, variable threshold burden test, and z-score weighting burden test) outperformed the sequence kernel association test (SKAT) and the original burden test. Applying this framework, we conducted association analyses on whole-blood derived heteroplasmy in 17,507 individuals of African and European ancestries (31% of African Ancestry, mean age of 62, with 58% women) with whole genome sequencing data. We performed both cohort- and ancestry-specific association analyses, followed by meta-analysis on both pooled samples and within each ancestry group. Our results suggest that mtDNA-encoded genes/regions are likely to exhibit varying rates in somatic aging, with the notably strong associations observed between heteroplasmy in the RNR1 and RNR2 genes (p<0.001) and advance aging by the Original Burden test. In contrast, SKAT identified significant associations (p<0.001) between diabetes and the aggregated effects of heteroplasmy in several protein-coding genes.

Magnesium phosphate cements (MPCs) are widely used for bone defect repair because of their excellent mechanical properties and biodegradability. However, high crystallinity and uncontrolled magnesium ion (Mg2+) release limit the surface bioactivity of MPCs in bone regeneration. Here, we fabricate chondroitin sulfate (CS) as a surface coating via the lyophilization method, namely CMPC. We find that the CS coating is uniformly distributed and improves the mechanical properties of MPC through anionic electrostatic adsorption, while mediating degradation-related controlled ion release of Mg2+.

One strategy to improve Pi use efficiency is to enhance Pi remobilization among leaves. Using transcriptome analysis with first (top) and fourth (down) leaf blades from rice (Oryza sativa) in Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions, we identified 1384 genes differentially expressed among these leaf blades. These genes were involved in physiological processes, metabolism, transport, and photosynthesis. Moreover, we identified the Pi efflux transporter gene, OsPHO1;3, responding to Pi-supplied conditions among these leaf blades. OsPHO1;3 is highly expressed in companion cells of phloem, but not xylem, in leaf blades and induced by Pi starvation. Mutation of OsPHO1;3 led to Pi accumulation in second to fourth leaves under Pi-sufficient conditions, but enhanced Pi levels in first leaves under Pi-deficient conditions. These Pi accumulations in leaves of Ospho1;3 mutants resulted from induction of OsPHT1;2 and OsPHT1;8 in root and reduction of Pi remobilization in leaf blades, revealed by the decreased Pi in phloem of leaves. Importantly, lack of OsPHO1;3 caused growth defects under a range of Pi-supplied conditions.

The relationship between CERS5 and 22 immune infiltrating cell categories was detected using CIBERSORT. Single-cell analysis revealed elevated CERS5 levels in fibroblasts, which are vital in tumor immunity. The relationship between the expression of CERS5 and the immune-related genes, microsatellite instability, tumor mutational burden, and RNA modification genes in cancer were examined using the pan-cancer database. The role of CERS5 in immune regulation might be crucial to the tumor microenvironment. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated associations between CERS5 and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, the WNT signaling pathway, and cell-cell junctions. Specifically, CERS5 was positively correlated with Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA4), Programmed Cell Death 1 (PDCD1), and Lymphocyte Activating 3 (LAG3) in stomach adenocarcinoma.

Herein, we realize a 2D WS2-Au-BP heterostructure, in which Au nanoparticles are connected between BP and WS2 via ionic bonds. The ultralow conduction band minimum position, the reduced adsorption energies of O2, and the increased dissociation barrier energy of O2- into 2O contribute greatly to improving the long-term stability of BP in the air. The formation of heterostructures can reduce the potential barrier energy in target gas molecules, thus enhancing the absorption energy and charge transfer. Taking the paramagnetic NO2 gas molecules as a representative, a stable response magnitude of 2.11 to 100 ppb NO2 is achieved for 80 days, which is far larger than the initial responses of most BP-based materials.

The transition from the electric-field induced lattice strain effect to polarization current effect can be controlled effectively by decreasing the in-plane reading current at room temperature. With the decrease of temperature, the interfacial charge effect dominates over the lattice strain effect due to the reduced charge carrier density. In addition, light stimulus can lead to the delocalization of eg carriers, and thus enhance the lattice strain effect and suppress the interfacial charge effect.

Senolytics present therapeutic effects on age-related hepatic steatosis without eliminating senescent hepatocytes directly. Therefore, it highlights the need to find senolytics' therapeutic targets. Dysfunction of adipose tissue underlies the critical pathogenesis of lipotoxicity in the liver. However, the correlation between adipose tissue and hepatic steatosis during aging and its underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. We explored the correlation between white adipose tissue (WAT) and the liver during aging and evaluated the effect of lipolysis of aged WAT on hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte senescence. We screened out the ideal senolytics for WAT and developed a WAT-targeted delivery system for senotherapy. We assessed senescence and lipolysis of WAT and hepatic lipid accumulation after treatment. The results displayed that aging\u00a0accelerated cellular senescence and facilitated lipolysis of WAT. Free fatty acids (FFAs) generated by WAT during aging enhanced hepatic steatosis and induced hepatocyte senescence. The combined usage of dasatinib and quercetin was screened out as the ideal senolytics to eliminate senescent cells in WAT. To minimize non-specific distribution and enhance the effectiveness of senolytics, liposomes decorated with WAT affinity peptide P3 were constructed for senotherapy in vivo. In vivo study, WAT-targeted treatment eliminated senescent cells in WAT and reduced lipolysis, resulting in the alleviation of hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatocyte senescence when compared to

Previous study reported that dibutyl phthalate (DBP) identified from the metabolites of A. panax is a potent mycotoxin against P. ginseng. However, more evidence suggests that DBP is one of the constituents of plasticisers. To identify mycotoxins from A. panax and evaluate their phytotoxicity on the leaves of P. ginseng, different chromatographic, spectral and bioassay-guided methods were used together in this report. As a result, tyrosol (1), 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propanoic acid (2), and 3-benzylpiperazine-2,5-dione (3) were isolated and characterised from the extract of A. panax, in which compounds 1 and 2 showed phytotoxic activity on ginseng leaves. Furthermore, DBP was confirmed to come from the residue of ethyl acetate through UPLC-MS/MS analysis, and displayed no phytotoxicity on ginseng leaves based on biological experiments.

In Southeast Asia, the Mekong River Basin (MRB) is experiencing heavy PM2.5 pollution and the existing PM2.5 studies in the MRB are limited in terms of accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage. To achieve high-accuracy and long-term PM2.5 monitoring of the MRB, fused aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and multi-source auxiliary data are fed into a stacking model to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. The proposed stacking model takes advantage of convolutional neural network (CNN) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models and can well represent the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the PM2.5-AOD relationship. In the cross-validation (CV), comparison with CNN and LightGBM models shows that the stacking model can better suppress overfitting, with a higher coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.92, a lower root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.58\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, and a lower mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.44\u00a0\u03bcg/m3. For the first time, the high-accuracy PM2.5 dataset reveals spatially and temporally continuous PM2.5 pollution and variations in the MRB from 2015 to 2022. Moreover, the spatiotemporal variations of annual and monthly PM2.5 pollution are also investigated at the regional and national scales.

However, the mechanisms underlying DCM-induced cardiac injury remain unclear. Recently, the role of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS/STING) signaling and pyroptosis in DCM has been investigated. Based on our previous results, this study was designed to examine the impact of irisin, mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase (MITOL/MARCH5), and cGAS/STING signaling in DCM-induced cardiac dysfunction and the effect of gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis. High-fat diet-induced mice and H9c2 cells were used for cardiac geometry and function or pyroptosis-related biomarker assessment at the end of the experiments. Here, we show that DCM impairs cardiac function by increasing cardiac fibrosis and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis, including the activation of MITOL and cGAS/STING signaling.

However, limited by various monocular laparoscopic imaging characteristics such as highlight noises, motion blur, texture interference and illumination variation, most exiting feature matching methods face the challenges of producing high-quality matches efficiently and sufficiently. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel sequential coupling feature descriptor to extract and express multilevel feature maps efficiently, and a dual-correlate optimized coarse-fine strategy to establish dense matches in coarse level and adjust pixel-wise matches in fine level. Firstly, a novel sequential coupling swin transformer layer is designed in feature descriptor to learn and extract multilevel feature representations richly without increasing complexity. Then, a dual-correlate optimized coarse-fine strategy is proposed to match coarse feature sequences under low resolution, and the correlated fine feature sequences is optimized to refine pixel-wise matches based on coarse matching priors. Finally, the sequential coupling feature descriptor and dual-correlate optimization are merged into the Sequential Coupling Dual-Correlate Network (SeCo DC-Net) to produce high-quality matches. The evaluation is conducted on two public laparoscopic datasets: Scared and EndoSLAM, and the experimental results show the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in homography estimation, relative pose estimation, reprojection error, matching pairs number and inference runtime.

However, accurately extracting the complete vessel structure from images remains a challenge due to issues such as uneven contrast and background noise. Existing methods primarily focus on segmenting individual pixels and often fail to consider vessel features and morphology. As a result, these methods often produce fragmented results and misidentify vessel-like background noise, leading to missing and outlier points in the overall segmentation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel approach called the progressive edge information aggregation network for vessel segmentation (PEA-Net). The proposed method consists of several key components. First, a dual-stream receptive field encoder (DRE) is introduced to preserve fine structural features and mitigate false positive predictions caused by background noise. This is achieved by combining vessel morphological features obtained from different receptive field sizes. Second, a progressive complementary fusion (PCF) module is designed to enhance fine vessel detection and improve connectivity. This module complements the decoding path by combining features from previous iterations and the DRE, incorporating nonsalient information. Additionally, segmentation-edge decoupling enhancement (SDE) modules are employed as decoders to integrate upsampling features with nonsalient information provided by the PCF. This integration enhances both edge and segmentation information. The features in the skip connection and decoding path are iteratively updated to progressively aggregate fine structure information, thereby optimizing segmentation results and reducing topological disconnections. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed PEA-Net model and strategy achieve optimal performance in both pixel-level and topology-level metrics.", "Keywords": ["Progressive learning", "Topology preserving", "Vessel segmentation", "X-ray angiography"], "MeSH terms": ["Pisum sativum", "Benchmarking", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sigeng", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Beijing Engineering Research Center of Mixed Reality and Advanced Display, School of Optics and Photonics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingfan", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Beijing Engineering Research Center of Mixed Reality and Advanced Display, School of Optics and Photonics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China.

It has been reported that the F-box protein FBXO3 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in regulating various biological processes, including host autoimmune, antiviral innate immunity, and inflammatory response. However, the role of FBXO3 in tumor metastasis remains elusive. We have previously shown that \u0394Np63\u03b1 is a common inhibitory target in oncogene-induced cell motility and tumor metastasis. In this study, we show that FBXO3 plays a vital role in PI3K-mediated breast cancer metastasis independent of its E3 ligase activity and \u0394Np63\u03b1 in breast cancer cells and in mouse. FBXO3 can bind to and stabilize USP4, leading to Twist1 protein stabilization and increased breast cancer cell migration and tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, FBXO3 disrupts the interaction between USP4 and aspartyl aminopeptidase (DNPEP), thereby protecting USP4 from DNPEP-mediated degradation. Furthermore, p110\u03b1H1047R facilitates the phosphorylation and stabilization of FBXO3 in an ERK1-dependent manner. Knockdown of either FBXO3 or USP4 leads to significant inhibition of PI3K-induced breast cancer metastasis. Clinically, elevated expression of p110\u03b1/FBXO3/USP4/Twist1 is associated with poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of breast cancer patients.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the occurrence and persistence of DCM, in which oxidative stress and autophagy play a non-negligible role. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. The 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (AMPK/Nrf2) are expressed in the heart, and studies have shown that asiaticoside (ASI) and activated AMPK/Nrf2 have a protective effect on the myocardium. However, the roles of ASI and AMPK/Nrf2 in DCM are unknown. The intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) and high-fat feed were used to establish the DCM models in 100 C57/BL mice. Asiaticoside and inhibitors of AMPK/Nrf2 were used for intervention. Cardiac function, oxidative stress, and autophagy were measured in mice. DCM mice displayed increased levels of oxidative stress while autophagy levels declined. In addition, AMPK/Nrf2 was activated in DCM mice with ASI intervention. Further, we discovered that AMPK/Nrf2 inhibition blocked the protective effect of ASI by compound C and treatment with ML-385.

In DL-MA methods, atlas-target correspondence is the key for accurate segmentation. In most existing DL-MA methods, such correspondence is usually established using traditional or deep learning based registration methods at image level with no further feature level adaption. This could cause possible atlas-target feature inconsistency. As a result, the information from atlases often has limited positive and even counteractive impact on the final segmentation results. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a new DL-MA framework, where a novel differentiable atlas feature warping module with a new smooth regularization term is presented to establish feature level atlas-target correspondence. Comparing with the existing DL-MA methods, in our framework, atlas features containing anatomical prior knowledge are more relevant to the target image feature, leading the final segmentation results to a high accuracy level. We evaluate our framework in the context of brain parcellation using two public MR brain image datasets: LPBA40 and NIREP-NA0.

For achieving better effect of neuroregeneration, this is the first time to jointly apply a dynamic perfusion bioreactor and the ascorbic acid to stimulate the SKP-SCs secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM). To overcome the limitation of traditional tissue-engineered nerve grafts, jointly utilizing SKP-SCs and their ECM components were motivated by the thought of prolongating the effect of support cells and their bioactive cues that promote peripheral nerve regeneration. To further explore the regulatory model of gene expression and the related molecular mechanisms involved in tissue engineering-aided peripheral nerve regeneration, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression profiling, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and a validation study on the grafted segments and dorsal root ganglia tissues. A wealth of transcriptomic and bioinformatics data has revealed complex molecular networks and orchestrated functional regulation that may be responsible for the effects of SKP-SCs-TEN on promoting peripheral nerve regeneration.

However, the role of THI1/THI2 in plant immunity remains unclear. In this study, we cloned TaTHI2 from wheat and investigated its function in Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) infection. Overexpression of TaTHI2 (TaTHI2-OE) inhibited CWMV infection, while TaTHI2 silencing enhanced viral infection in wheat. Interestingly, the membrane-localized TaTHI2 protein was increased during CWMV infection. TaTHI2 also interacted with the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase 5 (TaCPK5), which is localized in the plasma membrane, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by repressing TaCPK5-mediated activity of the catalase protein TaCAT1. CWMV CP disrupted the interaction between TaTHI2 and TaCAT1, reducing ROS accumulation and facilitating viral infection. Additionally, transgenic plants overexpressing TaTHI2 showed increased seed number per ear and 1000-kernel weight compared to control plants. Our findings reveal a novel function of TaTHI2 in plant immunity and suggest its potential as a valuable gene for balancing disease resistance and wheat yield.

By engineering the ultralow concentration of O at GBs, the inherent GB brittleness of Mo can be largely eliminated, which, in conjunction with high fractions of soft texture and low angle GBs, enables a significant development of ordered dislocation networks and the effective dislocation transmission across low angle GBs.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of 3DPMs for learning the arterial supply of the head and neck region. One hundred eighty-four undergraduate medical students were randomly assigned to one of four learning modalities including wet specimen, digital model, 3DPM, and textbook image. Posttest scores indicated that all four modalities supported participants' knowledge acquisition, most significantly in the wet specimen group. While the participants rated 3DPMs lower for helping correct identification of structures than wet specimens, they praised 3DPMs for their ability to demonstrate topographical relationships between the arterial supply and adjacent structures. The data further suggested that the biggest limitation of the 3DPMs was their simplicity, thus making it more difficult for users to recognize the equivalent structures on the wet specimens. It was concluded that future designs of 3DPMs will need to consider the balance between the ease of visualization of anatomical structures and the degree of complexity required for successful transfer of learning. Overall, this study presented some conflicting evidence of the favorable outcomes of 3DPMs reported in other similar studies.

However, the parent melilite-structured materials with stoichiometric oxygen are usually insulators. Herein, we reported high and pure oxide ion conduction in the parent K2ZnV2O7 material with a melilite-related structure, e.g., \u223c1.14 \u00d7 10-3 S/cm at 600 \u00b0C, which is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art yttrial-stabilized ZrO2 applied in practical fuel cells. Neutron diffraction data revealed the interesting thermally induced formation of oxygen vacancies at elevated temperatures, which triggered the transformation of the material from electronically conducting to purely and highly oxide ion-conducting. The VO4 tetrahedron with non-bridging terminal oxygen in K2ZnV2O7 was proved to be the key structural factor for transporting oxygen vacancies. The molecular dynamic simulation based on the interatomic potential approach revealed that long-range oxide ion diffusion was achieved by breaking and re-forming the 5-fold MO4 (M = Zn and V) tetrahedral rings.

However, the role of Pin1 in cellular autophagy is still poorly understood. Here we report that pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 decreased the formation of autophagosome/autolysosomes upon nutrient starvation. Inhibition of Pin1 reduced, whereas forced expression of Pin1 increased, the level of LC3 and viability of U2OS and PANC-1 cells. Pin1 could augment the accumulation of LC3 upon chloroquine treatment, while chloroquine also disturbed its function on cell viability. RNA-Seq and qPCR identified altered autophagic pathway upon Pin1 silencing. Mechanistically, FoxO3 was identified critical for Pin1-mediated autophagy. Knockdown of FoxO3 could rescue the changes of LC3 level and cellular viability caused by Pin1 overexpression. In xenograft mouse model, Pin1 reduced the sensitivity of PANC-1 to chloroquine while FoxO3 silencing could inhibit Pin1's function. Moreover, Pin1 could bind FoxO3 via its pS284-P motif, reduce its phosphorylation at T32, facilitate its nuclear retention, and therefore increased its transcriptional activity. S284A mutation of FoxO3 interfered with its T32 phosphorylation, reduced its nuclear localization and disrupted its function to support cell viability upon nutrient starvation. Furthermore, the protein level of Pin1 positively correlated with FoxO3 nuclear localization and LC3 level in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and osteosarcoma samples. Together, this study highlights an important role for Pin1-FoxO3 axis in regulating autophagy and cancer cell viability.

Utilizing the prognostic information derived from the GSE47460 dataset, we identified 22 differentially expressed switch genes that were correlated with clinical indicators as important genes. Among these genes, we found that the midkine (MDK) gene has the potential to serve as a marker of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis because its cellular communicating genes are differentially expressed in the epithelial cells. We then utilized midkine and its cellular communication-related genes to calculate the midkine score. Machine learning models were further constructed through midkine and related genes to predict Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis disease through the bulk gene expression datasets. The midkine score demonstrated a correlation with clinical indexes, and the machine learning model achieved an AUC of 0.94 and 0.86 in the Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis classification task based on lung tissue samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples, respectively.

Based on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images superimposed with or without oral scan (OS) data, a virtual template is crafted through software and subsequently translated into a 3-dimensional (3D) printing for SGE, while the system guides the drilling path with a real-time navigation in DGE.

The establishment of pioneer microbiota overlaps with the development of the brain during early life, and Pb-induced developmental neurotoxicity may be partially caused by early-life microbiota dysbiosis. This study investigated the locomotor activity and the microbiota in developing zebrafish at multiple developmental time points (five days post fertilization [5 dpf], 6 dpf, and 7 dpf) under exposure to low concentrations of lead (0.05\u00a0mg/L). Time-dependent reductions in the number of activities and the average movement distance of larvae compared to the control were observed following Pb exposure. Furthermore, Pb exposure significantly altered the composition of the gut microbiota of zebrafish larvae. At the phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased from 5 to 7 dpf, while that of Actinobacteria increased in the control groups. At the class level, the proportion of Alphaproteobacteria decreased, while that of Actinobacteria increased in the control groups. Notably, all showed the opposite trend in Pb groups. A correlation analysis between indices of locomotor activity and microbial communities revealed genus-level features that were clearly linked to the neurobehavioral performance of zebrafish. Seven genera were significantly correlated with the two performance indicators of the locomotion analysis, namely Rhodococcus, Deinococcus, Bacillus, Bosea, Bradyrhizobium, Staphylococcus, and Rhizobium. Rhizobium was dominant in zebrafish and increased in the Pb groups in a time-dependent manner. In addition, the expression levels of bdnf, trkb1, trkb2, and p75ntr changed in zebrafish from 5 to 7 dpf under Pb exposure.

However, the present in vivo researches were mainly devoted to the hepatic lipid metabolism, while the evidence about the impacts of TCC/TCS on the adipose tissue is very limited and the potential mechanism is unclear, especially the molecular initiation events. Moreover, little is known about the toxic difference between TCC and TCS. This study aimed to demonstrate the differential adipogenic activity of TCC/TCS as well as the potential molecular mechanism via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3). The in vitro experiment based on 3T3-L1 cells showed that TCC/TCS promoted the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes at nanomolar to micromolar concentrations, which was approach to their human exposure levels. We revealed for the first time by reporter gene assay that TCC could activate three PPARs signaling pathways in a concentration-dependent manner, while TCS only activate PPAR\u03b2. The molecular docking strategy was applied to simulate the interactions of TCC/TCS with PPARs, which explained well the different PPARs activities between TCC and TCS. TCC up-regulated the mRNA expression of three PPARs, but TCS only up-regulated PPAR\u03b2 and PPAR\u03b3 significantly. Meanwhile, TCC/TCS also promoted the expression of adipogenic genes targeted by PPARs to different extent. The cellular and simulating studies demonstrated that TCC exerted higher adipogenic effects and PPARs activities than TCS. Our mice in vivo experiment showed that TCC could lead to adipocyte size increase, adipocyte lipid accumulation growing, fat weight and body weight gain at human-related exposure levels, and high fat diet exacerbated these effects. Moreover, male mice tended to be more susceptible to TCC induced obesogenic effect than female mice. This work highlights the potential obesogenic risks of TCC/TCS via PPARs signaling pathways, and TCC deserves more concerns for its higher activity.", "Keywords": ["Antimicrobial agents", "Lipid metabolism", "Molecular mechanism", "PPARs", "Triclocarban", "Triclosan"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Female", "Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Triclosan", "PPAR-beta", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Carbanilides", "Lipids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jia-Da", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Sen", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Ting-Ting", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Chuan-Hai", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Qingdao University, 308 Ningxia Road, Qingdao, 266071, China."}, {"First Name": "Bing-Hua", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu-Long", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Lin-Ying", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "College of Environment and Ecology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China; College of Animal Science and Technology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, 410128, China.

Therefore, the study of proppant backflow is of great significance for the development and production of gas wells. At present, the physical simulation methods for proppant backflow mainly include the tube perforation model, the slot model, an API standard flow tester, and a large-scale flowback apparatus. The current experimental methods are unable to observe the backflow of proppants during the process of the flowback test. In addition, the only characterization parameter for proppant backflow is the liquid flow rate corresponding to the sand discharge in the diversion chamber called critical velocity, which is too simple and single to accurately characterize the movement state of proppants during the flowback process. In this paper, a physical simulation method of proppant backflow in fractures based on the measurement of flow field was proposed. It can realize the observation and fine description of the proppant backflow state and movement rule. In addition, the process of proppant backflow can be quantitatively described by a multidimensional characterization parameter. The research shows that (1) the proppant backflow is closely related to the shape of the sand bank formed during the proppant placement and the irregular voids formed; (2) the fiber increases the strength of the proppant pack significantly; (3) the critical velocity with fiber increased by 2.25 times compared with the critical velocity without fiber, the optimum fiber concentration was 0.8%, and the fiber length was 12 mm; (4) the full fiber injection was selected as the best injection mode by the experiment; and (5) the whole process of flowback can be divided into two stages. In the strong fluid shear stage, the effect of fiber sand control is more significant. However, when the flowback enters the stage of slow erosion, the difference in the sand control effect under different parameters is no longer significant.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yixin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company, No. 3, Section 1, Fuqing Road, Chenghua District, Chengdu, Sichuan 646002, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Sang", "Affiliation": "PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company, No. 3, Section 1, Fuqing Road, Chenghua District, Chengdu, Sichuan 646002, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianchun", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Southwest Petroleum University, No. 8 Xindu Road, Xindu District, Chengdu, Sichuan 610500, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company, No. 3, Section 1, Fuqing Road, Chenghua District, Chengdu, Sichuan 646002, China."}, {"First Name": "Weihua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company, No. 3, Section 1, Fuqing Road, Chenghua District, Chengdu, Sichuan 646002, China."}, {"First Name": "Botao", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company, No. 3, Section 1, Fuqing Road, Chenghua District, Chengdu, Sichuan 646002, China."}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company, No. 3, Section 1, Fuqing Road, Chenghua District, Chengdu, Sichuan 646002, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinghao", "Last Name": "Gou", "Affiliation": "PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gas Field Company, No. 3, Section 1, Fuqing Road, Chenghua District, Chengdu, Sichuan 646002, China."}, {"First Name": "Yifan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Southwest Petroleum University, No. 8 Xindu Road, Xindu District, Chengdu, Sichuan 610500, China."}], "Journal": "ACS omega", "PubDate": "2023Nov14"}, {"PMID": "38023190", "Title": "PLAC8 is an innovative biomarker for immunotherapy participating in remodeling the immune microenvironment of renal clear cell carcinoma.", "Abstract": "PLAC8 has been identified in the progression of various cancers by inducing tumorigenesis, immune response, chemotherapy resistance and metastasis.

Cardiac-specific knockdown of CTRP9 abolished the protective effects of low-dose exercise against established MI, while cardiac-specific overexpression of CTRP9 protected the heart against established MI.

Previous studies addressed these two issues with two-step separately, which caused the decrease in the performance of prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to simultaneously addresses the challenges of incomplete and imbalanced data in EHR. Based on the framework, we develop a model called Missing Value Imputation and Imbalanced Learning Generative Adversarial Network (MVIIL-GAN). We use MVIIL-GAN to perform joint learning on the imputation process of high missing rate data and the conditional generation process of EHR data. The joint learning is achieved by introducing two discriminators to distinguish the fake data from the generated data at sample-level and variable-level. MVIIL-GAN integrate the missing values imputation and data generation in one step, improving the consistency of parameter optimization and the performance of prediction tasks. We evaluate our framework using the public dataset MIMIC-IV with high missing rates data and imbalanced data.

A comprehensive genome-wide analysis of gene structure, protein motifs, chromosomal location, and cis-acting elements was also performed. Tissue-specific analysis and expression profiling under temperature, hormonal, and viral stresses were performed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after randomly selecting one gene from each group. The results revealed that all TaABCF genes had the highest expression at 25 \u00b0C and responded to methyl jasmonate induction. Notably, TaABCF2 was highly expressed in all tissues except the roots, and silencing it significantly increased the accumulation of Chinese wheat mosaic virus or wheat yellow mosaic virus in wheat leaves.

The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis and phylogenetic tree construction showed that the three strains were Bacillus tropicus, Pseudomonas multiresinivorans, and Raoultella terrigena. Under optimal degradation conditions, the maximal degradation rates were 67.30\u2009\u00b1\u20093.69%, 89.65\u2009\u00b1\u20091.08%, and 79.60\u2009\u00b1\u20095.30%, respectively, for YZQ-1, YZQ-3, and YZQ-4.

This implicates that Twist1 plays important regulatory roles in these processes. ChIP and dual luciferase assays showed that Twist1 could bind either PPAR\u03b3 or adiponectin promoter to repress their respective transcription or directly to PPAR\u03b3 protein to regulate its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Twist1 directly interacted RXR\u03b1, which usually forms heterodimer with PPAR\u03b3 to regulate adipogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that Twist1 is an inhibitory modulator of adipogenesis and its function is likely through direct interaction with PPAR\u03b3 protein or its gene promoter.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Adiponectin", "PPAR gamma", "Adipocytes", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Transcription Factors", "Adipogenesis", "3T3-L1 Cells", "Cell Differentiation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Leilei", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaoping", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Si", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaohao", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Yao", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Yahui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhenhua", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, China. anyang@henu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5E5, Canada. jian.yang@usask.ca."}], "Journal": "Cell death & disease", "PubDate": "2023Nov23"}, {"PMID": "37994730", "Title": "A novel remnant liver-first strategy for liver autotransplantation in patients with end-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis: a retrospective case series.", "Abstract": "Ex vivo liver resection combined with autotransplantation is an effective therapeutic strategy for unresectable end-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE).

reserve (FFR) is considered as the gold standard for diagnosing coronary myocardial ischemia. Existing 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods attempt to predict FFR noninvasively using coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). However, the accuracy and efficiency of the 3D CFD methods in coronary arteries are considerably limited. In this work, we introduce a multi-dimensional CFD framework that improves the accuracy of FFR prediction by estimating 0D patient-specific boundary conditions, and increases the efficiency by generating 3D initial conditions. The multi-dimensional CFD models contain the 3D vascular model for coronary simulation, the 1D vascular model for iterative optimization, and the 0D vascular model for boundary conditions expression. To improve the accuracy, we utilize clinical parameters to derive 0D patient-specific boundary conditions with an optimization algorithm. To improve the efficiency, we evaluate the convergence state using the 1D vascular model and obtain the convergence parameters to generate appropriate 3D initial conditions. The 0D patient-specific boundary conditions and the 3D initial conditions are used to predict FFR (FFRC). We conducted a retrospective study involving 40 patients (61 diseased vessels) with invasive FFR and their corresponding CTA images. The results demonstrate that the FFRC and the invasive FFR have a strong linear correlation (r = 0.80, p < 0.001) and high consistency (mean difference: 0.014 \u00b10.071). After applying the cut-off value of FFR (0.8), the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of FFRC were 88.5%, 93.3%, 83.9%, 84.8%, and 92.9%, respectively.

Although abnormal alternative splicing (AS) has been found to be an important driving force in tumor pathogenesis and progression, the regulatory mechanisms of AS that underly the adaptation of cancer cells to harsh microenvironments remain unclear. Here, we found that hypoxia- and nutrient deprivation-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) specifically cleaved DDX3X in a HIF1A-dependent manner. This cleavage yields truncated carboxyl-terminal DDX3X (tDDX3X-C), which translocates and aggregates in the nucleus. Unlike intact DDX3X, nuclear tDDX3X-C complexes with an array of splicing factors and induces AS events of many pre-mRNAs; for example, enhanced exon skipping (ES) in exon 2 of the classic tumor suppressor PRDM2 leads to a frameshift mutation of PRDM2. Intriguingly, the isoform ARRB1-\u0394exon 13 binds to glycolytic enzymes and regulates glycolysis. By utilizing in vitro assays, glioblastoma organoids, and animal models, we revealed that AEP/tDDX3X-C promoted tumor malignancy via these isoforms. More importantly, high AEP/tDDX3X-C/ARRB1-\u0394exon 13 in cancerous tissues was tightly associated with poor patient prognosis.

The core of Siamese feature matching is how to assign high feature similarity to the corresponding points between the template and the search area for precise object localization. In this article, we propose a novel point cloud registration-driven Siamese tracking framework, with the intuition that spatially aligned corresponding points (via 3-D registration) tend to achieve consistent feature representations. Specifically, our method consists of two modules, including a tracking-specific nonlocal registration (TSNR) module and a registration-aided Sinkhorn template-feature aggregation module. The registration module targets the precise spatial alignment between the template and the search area. The tracking-specific spatial distance constraint is proposed to refine the cross-attention weights in the nonlocal module for discriminative feature learning. Then, we use the weighted singular value decomposition (SVD) to compute the rigid transformation between the template and the search area and align them to achieve the desired spatially aligned corresponding points. For the feature aggregation model, we formulate the feature matching between the transformed template and the search area as an optimal transport problem and utilize the Sinkhorn optimization to search for the outlier-robust matching solution. Also, a registration-aided spatial distance map is built to improve the matching robustness in indistinguishable regions (e.g., smooth surfaces). Finally, guided by the obtained feature matching map, we aggregate the target information from the template into the search area to construct the target-specific feature, which is then fed into a CenterPoint-like detection head for object localization.

The proposed approach employs tractable and scalable factor techniques, which effectively address the disadvantages of higher computational complexity, particularly when dealing with large-scale coefficient matrices.

The G66A nucleotide mutation in NS2A gene of the wild strain SA14 prevented the ribosomal frameshift that prevented the production of NS1' protein, thus reduced the virulence. In this study, the 66th nucleotide of the NS2A gene of SA14 was mutated into A, U or C, respectively. Both the G66U and G66C mutations cause the E22D mutation of the NS2A protein. Subsequently, the expression of NS1' protein, plaque size, replication ability, and virulence to mice of the three mutant strains were examined. The results showed that the three mutant viruses could not express NS1' protein, and their proliferation ability in nerve cells and virulence to mice were significantly reduced. In addition, the SA14(G66C) was less virulent than the other two mutated viruses.

Molecular characterization revealed that the complete genome of WYSAV is divided into two segments, RNA1 and RNA2, which are 6,460 and 4,935 nucleotides (nt) in length, excluding their respective poly(A) tails. RNA1 contains one large opening reading frame (ORF), encoding a replication-associated protein. RNA2 contains six ORFs, encoding a coat protein (CP), a coat protein readthrough domain protein (CP-RTD), triple gene block protein 1 (TGB1), triple gene block protein 2 (TGB2), triple gene block protein 3 (TGB3), and a cysteine-rich protein (CRP). Phylogenetic analysis showed that WYSAV is related to members of the genus Benyvirus in the family Benyviridae. Thus, WYSAV is proposed to be a new member of the genus Benyvirus. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important food crops and ranked third in the world in terms of production, only behind rice and maize [1]. During its growth cycle, wheat faces several biotic and abiotic stresses. Wheat soil-borne virus disease is an important disease that is difficult to control and causes severe yield loss in China each year [2]. The main pathogens causing wheat soil-borne virus disease are Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) and wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), and their transmission vector is Polymyxa graminis [3-5]. Members of the viral family Benyviridae usually have two to five genomic RNA segments and are transmitted by root-infecting vectors belonging to the family \"Plasmodiophoridae\". Although few members of the family Benyviridae, of which beet necrotic yellow vein virus is the type member, have been identified [6], several recently identified viruses have been found to be phylogenetically related to benyviruses but are not classified as members of the family Benyviridae. These \"unclassified benyviruses\" include red clover RNA virus 1, Arceuthobium sichuanense virus 3, Dactylorhiza hatagirea beny-like virus, goji berry chlorosis virus [7], Guiyang benyvirus 1, Guiyang benyvirus 2, Mangifera indica latent virus [8], Rhizoctonia solani beny-like virus 1 [9], Sanya benyvirus 1 [10], and Sclerotium rolfsii beny-like virus 1 [11].In this study, we identified a novel\u2009+\u2009ssRNA virus in symptomatic leaf samples collected from cultivated wheat in the city of Zhumadian, Henan Province, China.

Previous studies have analysed single and double mutants that marginally reduced transport; however, assessing phenotypes caused by transport loss has proven enigmatic.

Leveraging inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)\u00a0and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF), we demonstrate CAX transporters work together to regulate leaf elemental content: ICP-MS analysis showed that the elemental concentrations in leaves strongly correlated with the number of CAX mutations; SXRF imaging showed changes in element partitioning not present in single CAX mutants and qKO had a 40% reduction in calcium (Ca) abundance. Reduced endogenous Ca may promote anoxia tolerance; wild-type plants grown in Ca-limited conditions were anoxia tolerant. Sequential reduction of CAXs increased mRNA expression and protein abundance changes associated with reactive oxygen species and stress signalling pathways. Multiple CAXs participate in postanoxia recovery as their concerted removal heightened changes in postanoxia Ca signalling.

Research has indicated that neuronal death, particularly apoptosis, plays a major role in the neurological impairment that follows SAH. RNA-binding protein Pum2 can interfere with translation or other biological functions by connecting to the UGUAHAUA sequence on RNA. Noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage (Norad) contains some Pum2 recognition sequences, which may bind to Pum2 protein and affect its capacity to attach to target mRNA. The time course expression of Norad and Pum2 after SAH is analyzed by establishing a mouse SAH model. Subsequently, the purpose of this study is to investigate the potential role and mechanism of the Norad-Pum2 axis after SAH using lentivirus overexpression of Pum2 and knockdown of Norad. Analysis of Pum2 and Norad levels reveal that the former is significantly reduce and the latter is significantly increased in the SAH group compared to the sham group. Subsequent overexpression of Pum2 and Norad knockdown is found to reduce SAH-induced oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, and ultimately improve behavioral and cognitive changes in SAH mice. Our study indicates that Norad-Pum2 acts as a neuromodulator in SAH, and that by increasing Pum2 and decreasing Norad levels, SAH-induced neuronal apoptosis can be reduced and neurological deficits alleviated.

The results showed that SLs application upregulated the expression of genes associated with the antioxidant defense system (Fe/Mn-SOD, PER1, PER22, SPC4, CAT2, APX1, APX7, GSTU6, GST4, GOR, GRXC1, and GRXC15), chlorophyll biogenesis (CHLH, and CPX), light-harvesting chlorophyll A-B binding proteins (WHAB1.6, and LHC Ib-21), electron transfer (PNSL2), E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (BB, CHIP, and RHY1A), heat stress transcription factor (HSFA1, HSFA4D, and HSFC2B), heat shock proteins (HSP23.2, HSP16.9A, HSP17.9A, HSP21, HSP70, HSP70-16, HSP70-17, HSP70-8, HSP90-5, and HSP90-6), DnaJ family members (ATJ1, ATJ3, and DJA6), as well as other chaperones (BAG1, CIP73, CIPB1, and CPN60I). but the expression level of genes involved in chlorophyll degradation (SGR, NOL, PPH, PAO, TIC55, and PTC52) as well as photorespiration (AGT2) was found to be downregulated by SLs priming. As a result, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) were enhanced, and chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate were increased, which indicated the alleviation of drought stress in wheat. These findings demonstrated that SLs alleviate drought stress by promoting photosynthesis through enhancing chlorophyll levels, and by facilitating ROS scavenging through modulation of the antioxidant system. The study advances understandings of the molecular mechanism underlying SLs-mediated drought alleviation and provides valuable insights for implementing sustainable farming practice under water restriction.", "Keywords": ["RNA-seq", "ROS", "antioxidation", "drought", "photosynthesis", "strigolactones", "wheat"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Miao", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Naiyue", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Sumei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Songxin", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenqi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhengkai", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenxian", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunyan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingna", "Last Name": "Bu", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiwen", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"First Name": "Dexian", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}], "Journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2023Oct20"}, {"PMID": "37885008", "Title": "Factors associated with the utilization of diagnostic tools among countries with different income levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Abstract": "Disparities in the utilization of essential medical products are a key factor contributing to inequality in health outcomes.

Therefore, in this paper, aerodynamic force and wind pressure coefficients of chamfered square cylinders of different spacing are obtained by the large eddy simulation method.

The results show that when the wall y plus value is 1, the large eddy simulation is the most accurate to simulate the wind load and wind field parameters. Besides, the aerodynamic effects, non-Gaussian characteristics and interference effects between the chamfered square cylinders are mainly controlled by the cross-wind interval and the spacing (4.0, 4.0) is the characteristic coordinate. That means, when the spacing is smaller than this coordinate, the interference effect of the square cylinder is more obvious.

Additionally, the substitution of S in the lattice significantly increased the carrier effective mass, leading to a large Seebeck coefficient of ~730 \u03bcVK-1. Moreover, S alloying yielded point defect and Umklapp scattering to significantly depress the lattice thermal conductivity, and thus brought about an ultralow \u03balat ~0.50 Wm-1K-1 at 673 K in the solid solution. Consequently, multiple effects induced by S alloying enhanced the thermoelectric performance of the Cu3SbSe4-Cu3SbS4 solid solution, resulting in a maximum ZT value of ~0.72 at 673 K for the Cu3SbSe2.8S1.2 sample, which was ~44% higher than that of pristine Cu3SbSe4.

These compounds were structurally characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. The compounds were subsequently evaluated for their inhibitory effects on HIV-1 protease and cell viability in the human cancer cell lines K562 and HeLa and the mouse cancer cell line CT26. Towards HIV-1 protease, compounds 28 and 32, which featured the introduction of heterocyclic moieties at the C3 position of GA, exhibited the highest inhibition, with inhibition rates of 76% and 70.5%, respectively, at 1 mg/mL concentration. Further molecular docking suggests that a 3-substituted polar moiety would be likely to enhance the inhibitory activity against HIV-1 protease. As for the anti-proliferative activities of the GA derivatives, incorporation of a thiazole heterocycle at the C3- position in compound 29 significantly enhanced the effect against K562 cells with an IC50 value of 8.86 \u00b1 0.93 \u00b5M. The introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents on the C3-substituted phenyl ring augmented the anti-proliferative activity against Hela and CT26 cells.

Advances in imaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, have make it possible to evaluate glymphatic structures and functions in vivo. Recently, several studies have focused on the development and alterations of the glymphatic system in pediatric disorders. This review discusses the development of the glymphatic system, advances of imaging techniques and their applications in pediatric disorders. First, the results of the reviewed studies indicate that the development of the glymphatic system is a long-lasting process that continues into adulthood. Second, there is a need for improved glymphatic imaging techniques that are non-invasive and fast to improve suitability for pediatric applications, as some of existing methods use contrast injection and are susceptible to motion artifacts from long scanning times. Several novel techniques are potentially feasible for pediatric patients and may be used in the future. Third, the glymphatic dysfunction is associated with a large number of pediatric disorders, although only a few have recently been investigated. In conclusion, research on the pediatric glymphatic system remains an emerging field. The preliminary applications of glymphatic imaging techniques have provided unique insight into the pathological mechanism of pediatric diseases, but mainly limited in visualization of enlarged perivascular spaces and morphological measurements on CSF volumes. More in-depth studies on glymphatic functions are required to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain development and pediatric diseases.

Currently, most researches focus on complex deep learning structures for MI decoding. The growing complexity of networks may result in overfitting and lead to inaccurate decoding outcomes due to the redundant information. To address this limitation and make full use of the multi-domain EEG features, a multi-domain temporal-spatial-frequency convolutional neural network (TSFCNet) is proposed for MI decoding. The proposed network provides a novel mechanism that utilize the spatial and temporal EEG features combined with frequency and time-frequency characteristics. This network enables powerful feature extraction without complicated network structure. Specifically, the TSFCNet first employs the MixConv-Residual block to extract multiscale temporal features from multi-band filtered EEG data. Next, the temporal-spatial-frequency convolution block implements three shallow, parallel and independent convolutional operations in spatial, frequency and time-frequency domain, and captures high discriminative representations from these domains respectively. Finally, these features are effectively aggregated by average pooling layers and variance layers, and the network is trained with the joint supervision of the cross-entropy and the center loss. Our experimental results show that the TSFCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy and kappa values (82.72% and 0.7695 for dataset BCI competition IV 2a, 86.39% and 0.7324 for dataset BCI competition IV 2b).

However, their functions in early development remain elusive largely due to the challenge to simultaneously manipulate thousands of retrotransposon insertions in embryos. Here, we employed epigenome editing to perturb the long terminal repeat (LTR) MT2_Mm, a well-known ZGA and totipotency marker that exists in ~2667 insertions throughout the mouse genome. CRISPRi robustly repressed 2485 (~93%) MT2_Mm insertions and 1090 (~55%) insertions of the closely related MT2C_Mm in 2-cell embryos. Remarkably, such perturbation caused down-regulation of hundreds of ZGA genes at the 2-cell stage and embryonic arrest mostly at the morula stage.

The current study reports the use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to investigate potential developmental toxicity caused by exposure to BuP. The development of Neural crest cells (NCCs) is highly active during gastrulation in Zebrafish embryos. Thus, we utilized 0.5\u00a0mg/L, 0.75\u00a0mg/L, and 1\u00a0mg/L BuP solutions, respectively, in accordance with the international safety standard dosage. We observed severe craniofacial cartilage deformities, periocular edema, cardiac dysplasia, and delayed otolith development in the Zebrafish larvae 5 days after exposure. The oxidative stress response was significantly enhanced. In addition, the biochemical analysis revealed that the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly reduced relative to the control group, whereas the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was significantly elevated. Furthermore, ALP activity, a marker of osteoblast activity, was also reduced. Moreover, the RT-qPCR results indicated that the expression of chondrocyte marker genes sox9a, sox9b, and col2a1a was down-regulated. In addition, the morphology of maxillofacial chondrocytes was altered in Zebrafish larvae, and the proliferation of cranial NCCs was inhibited. Accordingly, our findings indicate that strong oxidative stress induced by BuP inhibits the proliferation of NCCs in larval Zebrafish, leading to craniofacial deformities.", "Keywords": ["Butylparaben", "Craniofacial cartilage", "Neural crest cells", "Zebrafish"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zekun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Affiliated Stomatological Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine, Jiangxi Clinical Medical Research Center of Oral Diseases, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi,China."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Center for Drug Screening and Research, School of Geography and Environmental Engineering, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi, China; School of Marine Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaomei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Affiliated Stomatological Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine, Jiangxi Clinical Medical Research Center of Oral Diseases, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi,China."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Affiliated Stomatological Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine, Jiangxi Clinical Medical Research Center of Oral Diseases, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi,China."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Affiliated Stomatological Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine, Jiangxi Clinical Medical Research Center of Oral Diseases, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi,China."}, {"First Name": "Weihua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine, Jiangxi Clinical Medical Research Center of Oral Diseases, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi,China."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Center for Drug Screening and Research, School of Geography and Environmental Engineering, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuhao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Affiliated Stomatological Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine, Jiangxi Clinical Medical Research Center of Oral Diseases, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi,China."}, {"First Name": "Huiqiang", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Center for Drug Screening and Research, School of Geography and Environmental Engineering, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory of Zebrafish Modeling and Drug Screening for Human Diseases, Ji'an 343009, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Affiliated Stomatological Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine, Jiangxi Clinical Medical Research Center of Oral Diseases, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi,China.

The integration of our field measurements and literature data shows that in response to natural salinity decrease, potential Nr removal increases while N2O production decreases. Furthermore, denitrification-induced N2 production exhibits higher salinity sensitivity than denitrification-induced N2O production, suggesting that the contribution of N2O to Nr removal decreases with decreasing salinity. This field-investigation-based salinity response model of Nr removal indicates that under global climate change, saline lakes in the process of salinization or desalination may have distinct Nr removal and climate feedback effects: salinized lakes tend to generate a positive climate feedback, while desalinated lakes show a negative feedback.

In CM_Filter, a heuristic strategy \"Quick-Finding\" is deduced by a property of straight lines in order to get the quality-assured median values from the synopses.

Fruit dots are an important trait that affects pear quality. Abnormal fruit dots usually reduce the merchantability of pears. In this research, during cold storage, 'Danxiahong' pear fruit exhibited protrudent fruit dots on the peels. Microscopy system measurement showed that fruit dots size and height on the abnormal fruit peel were bigger and higher than the normal ones. Likewise, scanning electron microscopy observations indicated that the abnormal fruit peel, in contrast to the normal pear peel, exhibited an abnormal cell structure and fruit dots. Physiological analysis showed that the lignin content in abnormal fruit peel was significantly higher than in normal fruit peel. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that the top-enriched pathways were mainly associated with lignin synthesis and metabolism. The transcripts of lignin biosynthesis-associated genes were analyzed, and the results showed that the expression of a cascade of structural genes, including PpyPAL, PpyCCR, PpyC3H, PpyC4H, PpyHCT, PpyCAD, PpyLAC, and PpyPOD, was significantly induced in the protrudent peels. Furthermore, the expression of regulatory genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, especially the NAC-MYB-based gene regulatory network, was significantly upregulated in the abnormal peels. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis confirmed the induction of lignin biosynthesis genes. Overall, this research revealed that the abnormal fruit surface was caused by fruit dots disorder during cold storage.

Despite the great progress of pathology in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of melatonin in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Our results clearly show that oral administration of melatonin prevented the deterioration of cardiac function caused by DOX treatment, which was evaluated by left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening as well as cardiac fibrosis. The ejection fraction and fractional shortening in the DOX group were 49.48% and 25.5%, respectively, while melatonin treatment increased the ejection fraction and fractional shortening to 60.33 and 31.39 in wild-type mice. Cardiac fibrosis in the DOX group was 3.97%, while melatonin reduced cardiac fibrosis to 1.95% in wild-type mice. Sirt3 is a mitochondrial deacetylase and shows protective effects in diverse cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, to test whether Sirt3 is a key factor in protection, Sirt3 knockout mice were used, and it was found that the protective effects of melatonin in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy were partly abolished. Further analysis revealed that Sirt3 and its downstream molecule TFEB were downregulated in response to DOX treatment, while melatonin administration was able to significantly enhance the expressions of Sirt3 and TFEB. Our in vitro study demonstrated that melatonin enhanced lysosomal function by increasing the Sirt3-mediated increase at the TFEB level, and the accumulation of autolysosomes induced by DOX treatment was attenuated. Thus, autophagic flux disrupted by DOX treatment was restored by melatonin supplementation. In summary, our results demonstrate that melatonin protects the heart against DOX injury by the restoration of autophagic flux via the activation of the Sirt3/TFEB signaling pathway.", "Keywords": ["Sirt3", "TFEB", "autophagic flux", "doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy", "melatonin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanyan", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Center for Mitochondrial Biology and Medicine, The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."}, {"First Name": "Jipeng", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Linhe", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Yalan", "Last Name": "Shao", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Xijing Hospital, Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiankang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Center for Mitochondrial Biology and Medicine, The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China."}], "Journal": "Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2023Sep04"}, {"PMID": "37755488", "Title": "Plastic probe electrospray ionization mass spectrometry developed for rapid fingerprint profile of biological samples without pretreatment.", "Abstract": "A triangular-shaped flat plastic substrate probe was prepared for direct electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for analysis of untreated chemical and biological samples including liquids (Met-Arg-Phe-Ala peptide, reserpine, and dodecyl aldehyde), solids (biological samples, traditional Chinese medicine), and powders (roasted coffee, rhizoma coptidis, lotus plumule, and Schisandra sphenanthera).

Accumulating clinical evidence has considered the minimal ablative margin (MAM) as a significant predictor of local tumor progression (LTP). In clinical practice, MAM assessment is typically carried out through image registration of pre- and post-MWA images. However, this process faces two main challenges: non-homologous match between tumor and coagulation with inconsistent image appearance, and tissue shrinkage caused by thermal dehydration. These challenges result in low precision when using traditional registration methods for MAM assessment. In this paper, we present a local contractive nonrigid registration method using a biomechanical model (LC-BM) to address these challenges and precisely assess the MAM. The LC-BM contains two consecutive parts: (1) local contractive decomposition (LC-part), which reduces the incorrect match between the tumor and coagulation and quantifies the shrinkage in the external coagulation region, and (2) biomechanical model constraint (BM-part), which compensates for the shrinkage in the internal coagulation region. After quantifying and compensating for tissue shrinkage, the warped tumor is overlaid on the coagulation, and then the MAM is assessed. We evaluated the method using prospectively collected data from 36 patients with 47 liver tumors, comparing LC-BM with 11 state-of-the-art methods. LTP was diagnosed through contrast-enhanced MR follow-up images, serving as the ground truth for tumor recurrence. LC-BM achieved the highest accuracy (97.9%) in predicting LTP, outperforming other methods.

However, insufficient current density and production selectivity hinder its further application. In this case, precisely regulating the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) active sites is an excellent strategy to simultaneously reduce the reaction barrier and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) pathway. Herein, the strain regulation of atomically dispersed NiN4 active sites is investigated in helical carbon. Ni-N coordination in the curved carbon lattice displays a reduced distance compared to that in a straight lattice, inflicting local compressive strain on NiN4. The resultant catalyst shows the highest CO selectivity of up to 99.4% at -1.4 V (vs. RHE), the FECO is maintained at over 85% over a wide potential range from -0.8 to -1.8 V (vs. RHE), and the maximum partial current density for CO reaches a high of 458 mA cm-2 at -1.8 V (vs. RHE). Theoretical investigations show the superior CO2 electroreduction performance of curved NiN4 stems from its remarkable ability to generate the *COOH intermediate and to suppress the hydrogen combination simultaneously.

Moreover, intracerebral injection of the CB1R antagonist AM251 in BLA during the memory reconsolidation time window eliminates social fear memory.

Mistakes in these processes may affect cell survival, or cause cell cycle dysregulation, such as tumorigenesis, birth defects and degenerative diseases. In recent years, it has been found that histone methyltransferase DOT1L is the only H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase, which plays an important role in the process of cell fate determination through monomethylation, dimethylation and trimethylation of H3K79. DOT1L has a pro-proliferative effect in leukemia cells; however, loss of heart-specific DOT1L leads to increased proliferation of cardiac tissue. Additionally, DOT1L has carcinogenic or tumor suppressive effects in different neoplasms.

In this study, we isolated a new cypovirus from naturally diseased Clanis bilineata larvae (named CbCPV), scanned its structure, sequenced its genome, and studied its phylogenetic relationship to other cypoviruses. Microscopy showed that CbCPV polyhedral occlusion bodies were about 1.878\u00a0\u03bcm on average and contained many virions in the ultrathin sections. The complete genome sequence of CbCPV is 22,812\u00a0bp comprising 10 segmented double-stranded RNAs. Apart from segment 1 containing one open reading frame (ORF) and one sub-ORF, the other nine segments all contain one open reading frame and encoded one putative protein. The non-coding regions contained conserved sequences at 5' termini (AGUCAAA) and 3' termini (AGC), except segment 4 containing a different 5' termini (AUGUUUA). The whole sequence of the polyhedrin gene in CbCPV contained 892 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 246 amino acids. Based on amino acid sequences of polyhedrin or RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the phylogenetic analysis indicated that CbCPV was closely related to DnCPV-23. The putative function of all segments differed from each other, but the most closely related species of segments were DnCPV-23 with 98.2-99.8% nucleotide identity. Overall, the evidence of morphology, protein analysis and nucleic acids (genomic pattern) showed that CbCPV is a new isolate in the cypovirus-23 type and can be termed Clanis bilineata cypovirus type 23 (CbCPV-23).", "Keywords": ["Biological control", "Cypovirus", "Genomic characterization", "Phylogenetic analysis", "Soybean hawkmoth"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Reoviridae", "Phylogeny", "Genome, Viral", "Viral Proteins", "Moths", "Genomics", "RNA, Viral"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhigao", "Last Name": "Zhan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China. zgzhan_iom@163.com."}, {"First Name": "Junhui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Limei", "Last Name": "Guan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Wendong", "Last Name": "Kuang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinchang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhuorong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianghuai", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Zheng'an", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Jiangxi New Dragon Biotech Corp., Yichun, 336000, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological Resource, Jiangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China. jinliang079@163.com."}], "Journal": "Virus genes", "PubDate": "2023Dec"}, {"PMID": "37694153", "Title": "Erratum: Aquaporin-8 ameliorates hepatic steatosis through farnesoid X receptor in obese mice.", "Abstract": "[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2023.106561.].", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minqi", "Last Name": "Xiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luyu", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jiqiu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Weiren", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yanyun", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shuangshuang", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yifei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "iScience", "PubDate": "2023Sep15"}, {"PMID": "37690635", "Title": "N-linked glycoproteome analysis reveals central glycosylated proteins involved in response to wheat yellow mosaic virus in wheat.", "Abstract": "Glycosylation is an important proteins post-translational modification and is involved in protein folding, stability and enzymatic activity, which plays a crucial role in regulating protein function in plants. Here, we report for the first time on the changes of N-glycoproteome in wheat response to wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) infection. Quantitative analyses of N-linked glycoproteome were performed in wheat without and with WYMV infection by ZIC-HILIC enrichment method combined with LC-MS/MS. Altogether 1160 N-glycopeptides and 971 N-glycosylated sites corresponding to 734 N-glycoproteins were identified, of which 64 N-glycopeptides and 64 N-glycosylated sites in 60 N-glycoproteins were significantly differentially expressed. Two conserved typical N-glycosylation motifs N-X-T and N-X-S and a nontypical motifs N-X-C were enriched in wheat. Gene Ontology analysis showed that most differentially expressed proteins were mainly enriched in metabolic process, catalytic activity and response to stress. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that two significantly changed glycoproteins were specifically related to plant-pathogen interaction. Furthermore, we found that over-expression of TaCERK reduced WYMV accumulation. Glycosylation site mutation further suggested that N-glycosylation of TaCERK could regulate wheat resistance to WYMV.

However, there are large research deficits in accurately and finely depicting the quality of the terrestrial ecosystem (QTE) and assessing its changing triggers' contribution. Here, we summarized three major principles for selecting image sources in remote sensing data fusion. A continuous 30-m net vegetation productivity (NPP) dataset during 2000-2019 for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) was derived by using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model and pre-fused normalized difference vegetation index. The factors' contributions to the QTE changes were quantitatively assessed. The role of the QTE in affecting the socio-economic and its behind mechanisms was quantitatively investigated. The results showed that: (1) High-quality images sources are the preference for spatio-temporal fusion of remote sensing data. Images with close month, the same season and year, and sensors should be then selected. Images of different sensors with similar spectral bandwidth, the ones from adjacent years and seasons, can be alternately considered. (2) Fine-resolution NPP has higher accuracy than coarse-resolution NPP and has marked advantages in finely characterizing the QTE. In the past 20 years, the QTE in the GBA has shown a fluctuating increasing trend (0.20\u00a0Tg\u00a0C/yr). (3) Human activities contributed 54.19% of the QTE changes in the GBA, and dominates the QTE changes in the central rapidly urbanizing areas. Residual factors accounted for an overall contribution ratio of 35.71%. Climate change dominants the peripheral forest variations in the GBA. (4) In the GBA, the improvement of QTE has a significant positive socio-economic impact, it contributes to the GDP increment firstly then the GDP aggregate indirectly. Our results highlight that it is of great urgent to estimate long-term continuous NPP with high spatio-temporal resolution globally. Controlling strategies should be implemented to reduce factitious impacts on QTE.
