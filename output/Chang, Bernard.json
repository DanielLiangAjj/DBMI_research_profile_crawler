There is paucity, variability, and dissatisfaction with current parental (historically referred to as maternity and paternity) leave policies. This paper describes the development of consensus-derived recommendations to serve as a framework for emergency departments across the country for incorporating family-friendly policies. Policies that foster a family-inclusive workplace by allowing for professional advancement without sacrificing personal values regardless of sex, gender, and gender identity are critical for emergency medicine recruitment and retention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Parental Leave", "Female", "Emergency Medicine", "Pregnancy", "Adoption", "Lactation", "Consensus", "Surrogate Mothers", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Physicians", "Organizational Policy", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michelle D", "Last Name": "Lall", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.

Biomarker-enriched clinical trials have shown increased efficiency and informativeness in cancer research due to the selective exclusion of patients unlikely to benefit. In acute stress situations, clinically significant decisions are often made in time-sensitive manners and providers may be pressed to make decisions based on abbreviated clinical assessments. Up to 30% of trauma survivors admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) will develop long-lasting posttraumatic stress psychopathologies. The long-term impact of those survivors with posttraumatic stress sequelae are significant, impacting both long-term psychological and physiological recovery. An accurate prognostic model of who will develop posttraumatic stress symptoms does not exist yet. Additionally, no scalable and cost-effective method that can be easily integrated into routine care exists, even though especially the acute care setting provides a critical window of opportunity for prevention in the so-called golden hours when preventive measures are most effective. In this review, we aim to discuss emerging machine learning (ML) applications that are promising for precisely risk stratification and targeted treatments in the acute care setting. The aim of this narrative review is to present examples of digital health innovations and to discuss the potential of these new approaches for treatment selection and prevention of posttraumatic sequelae in the acute care setting. The application of artificial intelligence-based solutions have already had great success in other areas and are rapidly approaching the field of psychological care as well.

A major cause of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 has been the worsening hypoxia that, if untreated, can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.

Based on our prior experience as clinical researchers and a narrative review of the published literature, we offer nine practical strategies to help junior investigators conduct research. To successfully execute a research study, investigators must know how to motivate their team, create a brand around their study, communicate effectively, maximize clinician and patient engagement, and celebrate victory, among other skills. These skills and strategies are often missing from the formal research education and in peer-reviewed manuscripts but are, in fact, invaluable to the successful development of junior investigators.

Short sleep duration combined with disruptions to the circadian system may alter factors involved with the behavioral regulation of energy intake and expenditure. We aimed to determine how shift work affects sleep, food intake, and physical activity.Methods: This was a field-based observational study using objective assessments of sleep and physical activity and a 24-hour dietary recall in shift workers. Day (n\u2009=\u200912) and night (n\u2009=\u200912) hospital shift workers (nurses and technicians) who were women had their free-living sleep and physical activity tracked via accelerometry, and completed a computer-assisted 24-hour food recall, during a series of work shifts.Results: Compared to day workers, night workers had significantly shorter sleep duration and reported more premature awakenings and feeling less refreshed upon awakening. Daily self-reported energy and macronutrient intakes were not different between groups, although the night shift workers reported a significantly longer total daily eating duration window than day workers. Objectively recorded physical activity levels were not different between groups.Conclusions: The present findings confirm that sleep is disturbed in women night workers, while there are relatively less effects on objectively recorded physical activity and self-reported food intake. We also observed a prolonged daily eating duration in night vs. day workers. These observations can help inform the design of novel behavioral interventions, including, potentially, time restricted feeding approaches (e.g., by limiting daily eating episodes to within a 10-12\u2009h window), to optimize weight management in shift workers.", "Keywords": ["Shift work", "food intake", "obesity", "physical activity", "sleep"], "MeSH terms": ["Accelerometry", "Adult", "Diet Surveys", "Eating", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Shift Work Schedule", "Sleep", "Time Factors", "Work Schedule Tolerance", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shaza", "Last Name": "Lauren", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yichi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ciaran", "Last Name": "Friel", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bernard P", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ari", "Last Name": "Shechter", "Affiliation": "Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American College of Nutrition", "PubDate": "2020Jul"}, {"PMID": "31675448", "Title": "Stressing Out About the Heart: A Narrative Review of the Role of Psychological Stress in Acute Cardiovascular Events.", "Abstract": "Survivors of acute cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stroke, may experience significant psychological distress during and following the acute event.

In night shift workers, short sleep duration combined with circadian misalignment may contribute to altered food intake regulation, favoring positive energy balance and weight gain. Prior work investigating food intake in shift workers has suffered methodologically due to reliance on subjective self-report for dietary assessment. No study has yet been done to examine the impact of night shift work on food intake in real-life shift workers using objective measures. Female day (n = 12) and night (n = 12) shift workers from a hospital setting participated in a laboratory-based objective food intake assessment. Participants entered the laboratory in the fasted state after awakening from the sleep episode following a final work shift, and underwent an ad libitum 14-item test meal buffet to objectively quantify food choice/intake. Sleep duration (measured via wrist-accelerometry) during the sleep episode before laboratory assessment was significantly longer in day vs. night workers (373.9 \u00b1 127.5 vs. 260.6 \u00b1 102.9 min, p = 0.03). No significant group difference was observed in calories consumed during the test meal (943.08 \u00b1 469.55 vs. 878.58 \u00b1 442.68 kcal, p = 0.74). When expressed as percent of energy consumed, day workers had higher protein consumption vs. night workers (16.03 \u00b1 5.69 vs. 11.82 \u00b1 4.05%; p = 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first laboratory-based behavioral assessment of food choice/intake in actual night and day shift workers.

One of the first steps to improving the prevention and treatment of STBs is to establish risk factors (i.e., longitudinal predictors). To provide a summary of current knowledge about risk factors, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that have attempted to longitudinally predict a specific STB-related outcome. This included 365 studies (3,428 total risk factor effect sizes) from the past 50 years. The present random-effects meta-analysis produced several unexpected findings: across odds ratio, hazard ratio, and diagnostic accuracy analyses, prediction was only slightly better than chance for all outcomes; no broad category or subcategory accurately predicted far above chance levels; predictive ability has not improved across 50 years of research; studies rarely examined the combined effect of multiple risk factors; risk factors have been homogenous over time, with 5 broad categories accounting for nearly 80% of all risk factor tests; and the average study was nearly 10 years long, but longer studies did not produce better prediction. The homogeneity of existing research means that the present meta-analysis could only speak to STB risk factor associations within very narrow methodological limits-limits that have not allowed for tests that approximate most STB theories. The present meta-analysis accordingly highlights several fundamental changes needed in future studies. In particular, these findings suggest the need for a shift in focus from risk factors to machine learning-based risk algorithms.
