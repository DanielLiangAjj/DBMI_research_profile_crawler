Genetic strategies based on immediate early genes (IEGs), such as Arc/Arg3.1 , allow us to tag the ensembles active during memory encoding and compare them to those active during retrieval. However, these strategies only allow for the tagging of one neural ensemble. Here, we developed a multiple Arc (mArc) system that allows for the tagging of two Arc + ensembles. We validated this system by investigating how context, time, and valence influence neuronal ensemble reactivation in the dentate gyrus (DG). We show that similar contextual and valenced experiences are encoded in overlapping DG ensembles. We also find that ensembles are modulated by time, where experiences closer in time are encoded in more similar ensembles. These results highlight the dynamic nature of DG ensembles and show that the mArc system provides a powerful approach for investigating multiple memories in the brain.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Stackmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tushar D", "Last Name": "Yelhekar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Meizhen", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaochen", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Nthumba", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas E", "Last Name": "Bulthuis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nick", "Last Name": "Vaughan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yingxi", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine A", "Last Name": "Denny", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Feb02"}, {"PMID": "38076870", "Title": "( R,S )-ketamine's rapid-acting antidepressant effects are modulated by NR2B-containing NMDA receptors on adult-born hippocampal neurons.", "Abstract": "Standard antidepressant treatments often take weeks to reach efficacy and are ineffective for many patients. ( R,S )-ketamine, an N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has been shown to be a rapid-acting antidepressant and to decrease depressive symptoms within hours of administration. While previous studies have shown the importance of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) on interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), no study has investigated the influence of NR2B-expressing adult-born granule cells (abGCs). In this study, we examined whether ( R,S )-ketamine's efficacy depends upon these adult-born hippocampal neurons using a genetic strategy to selectively ablate the NR2B subunit of the NMDAR from Nestin + cells. To validate our findings, we also used several other transgenic lines including one in which NR2B was deleted from an interneuron (Parvalbumin (PV) + ) population. We report that in male mice, NR2B expression on 6-week-old adult-born neurons is necessary for ( R,S )-ketamine's effects on behavioral despair in the forced swim test (FST) and on hyponeophagia in the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) paradigm, as well on fear behavior following contextual fear conditioning (CFC). In female mice, NR2B expression is necessary for effects on hyponeophagia in the NSF. We also find that ablating neurogenesis increases fear expression in CFC, which is buffered by ( R,S )-ketamine administration. In line with previous studies, these results suggest that 6-week-old adult-born hippocampal neurons expressing NR2B partially modulate ( R,S )-ketamine's rapid-acting effects.

Enhancing resilience to stress could be a powerful intervention to reduce the incidence of psychiatric disease and reveal insight into the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. (R,S)-ketamine and its metabolites have recently been shown to exert protective effects when administered before or after a variety of stressors and may be effective, tractable prophylactic compounds against psychiatric disease. Drug dosing, sex, age, and strain in preclinical rodent studies, significantly influence the prophylactic effects of (R,S)-ketamine and related compounds. Due to the broad neurobiological actions of (R,S)-ketamine, a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the resilience-enhancing effects of this drug, including altering various transcription factors across the genome, enhancing inhibitory connections from the prefrontal cortex, and increasing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Promisingly, select data have shown that (R,S)-ketamine may be an effective prophylactic against psychiatric disorders, such as postpartum depression (PPD). Overall, this review will highlight a brief history of the prophylactic effects of (R,S)-ketamine, the potential mechanisms underlying its protective actions, and possible future directions for translating prophylactic compounds to the clinic.

Recent efforts have attempted to combine exposure therapies with drugs that target fear memory retrieval and memory reconsolidation, in order to improve treatment efficacy. The noradrenergic (NA) signaling system is of particular interest, due to its role in regulating the stress response and its involvement in fear and learning processes. Importantly, propranolol (P), a non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist, has shown the potential in decreasing exaggerated fear in both humans and animal models. In a previous study, we utilized an activity-dependent tagging murine model to determine the neural mechanisms by which propranolol attenuates learned fear. We found that propranolol acutely decreased memory trace reactivation specifically in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG), but not in CA3 or CA1. Here, we extended our previous study by investigating whether propranolol additionally altered activity in the hilus, a polymorphic layer that consists of neurons, mossy cells, and GABAergic interneurons. We found that propranolol acutely reduced overall hilar activity in both the dorsal and ventral hilus. Moreover, we report that propranolol significantly altered the activity of parvalbumin (PV)+ cells in the ventral (vDG), but not dorsal DG (dDG).

Unlike other kinases that are transiently stimulated by second messengers, PKM\u03b6 is persistently activated through sustained increases in protein expression of the kinase. Therefore, visualizing increases in PKM\u03b6 expression during long-term memory storage might reveal the sites of its persistent action and thus the location of memory-associated LTP maintenance in the brain. Using quantitative immunohistochemistry validated by the lack of staining in PKM\u03b6-null mice, we examined the amount and distribution of PKM\u03b6 in subregions of the hippocampal formation of wild-type mice during LTP maintenance and spatial long-term memory storage. During LTP maintenance in hippocampal slices, PKM\u03b6 increases in the pyramidal cell body and stimulated dendritic layers of CA1 for at least 2\u00a0hr. During spatial memory storage, PKM\u03b6 increases in CA1 pyramidal cells for at least 1\u00a0month, paralleling the persistence of the memory. During the initial expression of the memory, we tagged principal cells with immediate-early gene Arc promoter-driven transcription of fluorescent proteins. The subset of memory-tagged CA1 cells selectively increases expression of PKM\u03b6 during memory storage, and the increase persists in dendritic compartments within stratum radiatum for 1\u00a0month, indicating long-term storage of information in the CA3-to-CA1 pathway.

Many transgender adolescents experience gender dysphoria related to incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at birth. This dysphoria may worsen as puberty progresses. Puberty suppression by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), such as leuprolide, can help alleviate gender dysphoria and provide additional time before irreversible changes in secondary sex characteristics may be initiated through feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy congruent with the adolescent's gender experience. However, the effects of GnRH agonists on brain function and mental health are not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of leuprolide on reproductive function, social and affective behavior, cognition, and brain activity in a rodent model. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice were injected daily with saline or leuprolide (20\u2009\u03bcg) for 6 weeks and tested in several behavioral assays. We found that leuprolide increases hyperlocomotion, changes social preference, and increases neuroendocrine stress responses in male mice, while the same treatment increases hyponeophagia and despair-like behavior in females. Neuronal hyperactivity was found in the dentate gyrus (DG) of leuprolide-treated females, but not males, consistent with the elevation in hyponeophagia and despair-like behavior in females. These data show for the first time that GnRH agonist treatment after puberty onset exerts sex-specific effects on social- and affective behavior, stress regulation, and neural activity. Investigating the behavioral and neurobiological effects of GnRH agonists in mice will be important to better guide the investigation of potential consequences of this treatment for youth experiencing gender dysphoria.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Animals", "Female", "Gender Identity", "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Puberty", "Transgender Persons", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Anacker", "Affiliation": "Division of Systems Neuroscience, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc.

We have previously reported that the administration of (R,S)-ketamine prevents stress-induced depressive-like behavior in male mice, perhaps by altering \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated transmission in hippocampal CA3. However, it is still unknown whether metabolites of (R,S)-ketamine can be prophylactic in both sexes. We administered (R,S)-ketamine or its metabolites (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R,6R)-HNK) and (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine ((2S,6S)-HNK) at various doses 1 week before one of a number of stressors in male and female 129S6/SvEv mice. Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the effect of prophylactic drug administration on glutamatergic activity in CA3. To examine the interaction between ovarian hormones and stress resilience, female mice also underwent ovariectomy (OVX) surgery and a hormone replacement protocol prior to drug administration. (2S,6S)-HNK and (2R,6R)-HNK protected against distinct stress-induced behaviors in both sexes, with (2S,6S)-HNK attenuating learned fear in male mice, and (2R,6R)-HNK preventing stress-induced depressive-like behavior in both sexes. (R,S)-ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK, but not (2S,6S)-HNK, attenuated large-amplitude AMPAR-mediated bursts in hippocampal CA3.

Furthermore, ovarian-derived hormones were necessary for and sufficient to restore (R,S)-ketamine- and (2R,6R)-HNK-mediated prophylaxis in female mice. Our data provide further evidence that resilience-enhancing prophylactics may alter AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission in CA3.

It represents a way in which social interactions can immediately and potently modulate behavior. As such, social buffering is one mechanism by which strong social support increases resilience to mental illness. Although the behavioral and neuroendocrine impacts of social buffering are well studied in multiple species, including humans, the neuronal underpinnings of this behavioral phenomenon remain largely unexplored. Previous work has shown that the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) is important for processing social information and, in separate studies, for modulating fear and anxiety. Thus, we hypothesized that socially active cells within the IL-PFC may integrate social information to modulate fear responsivity. To test this hypothesis, we employed social buffering paradigms in male and female mice. Similar to prior studies in rats, we found that the presence of a cagemate reduced freezing in fear- and anxiety-provoking contexts. In accordance with previous work, we demonstrated that interaction with a novel or familiar conspecific induces activity in the IL-PFC as evidenced by increased immediate early gene (IEG) expression. We then utilized an activity-dependent tagging murine line, the ArcCreERT2 mice, to express channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in neurons active during the social encoding of a new cagemate. We found that optogenetic reactivation of these socially active neuronal ensembles phenocopied the effects of cagemate presence in male and female mice in learned and innate fear contexts without being inherently rewarding or altering locomotion. These data suggest that a social neural ensemble within the IL-PFC may contribute to social buffering of fear.

We tested if three 5-HT4R agonists with varying affinity could protect against stress in two mouse strains by utilizing chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration or contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Mice were administered saline, (R,S)-ketamine, Flx, RS-67,333, prucalopride, or PF-04995274 at varying doses, and then 1 week later were subjected to chronic CORT or CFC. In C57BL/6N mice, chronic Flx administration attenuated CORT-induced weight changes and increased open-arm entries in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Chronic RS-67,333 administration attenuated CORT-mediated weight changes and protected against depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. In 129S6/SvEv mice, RS-67,333 attenuated learned fear in male, but not female mice. RS-67,333 was ineffective against stress-induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST), but prevented anxiety-like behavior in both sexes. Prucalopride and PF-04995274 attenuated learned fear and decreased stress-induced depressive-like behavior. Electrophysiological recordings following (R,S)-ketamine or prucalopride administration revealed that both drugs alter AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in CA3.

Recently, we have also shown that ketamine acts as a prophylactic to protect against the development of stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice, indicating that a preventative treatment against mental illness using ketamine is possible. While there is significant investigation into ketamine's antidepressant mechanism of action, little is known about ketamine's underlying prophylactic mechanism. More specifically, whether ketamine's prophylactic action is molecularly similar to or divergent from its antidepressant action is entirely unknown. Here, we sought to characterize immunohistochemical signatures of cell populations governing ketamine's antidepressant and prophylactic effects. 129S6/SvEv mice were treated with saline (Sal) or ketamine (K) either before a social defeat (SD) stressor as a prophylactic, or after SD as an antidepressant, then subsequently assessed for depressive-like behavior. Post-fixed brains were processed for doublecortin (DCX), calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) expression. The number of DCX+ neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (HPC) was not affected by prophylactic or antidepressant ketamine treatment, while the number of CR+ neurons in the ventral hilus increased with antidepressant ketamine under SD conditions. Moreover, antidepressant, but not prophylactic ketamine administration significantly altered CR and CB expression in the ventral HPC (vHPC). These data show that while antidepressant ketamine treatment mediates some of its effects via adult hippocampal markers, prophylactic ketamine administration does not, at least in 129S6/SvEv mice.

We administered prophylactic ketamine in mice to buffer against fear expression. Following behavioral analyses, untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on both hemispheres of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC), and plasma.

Strikingly, these long-term metabolomic changes were not observed when no stressor was administered. Our results suggest that prophylactic treatment differentially affects purine and pyrimidine metabolism and neurotransmission in brain and plasma following stress, which may underlie the long-lasting resilience to stress induced by a single injection of ketamine.

Most recently, ketamine has also been shown to be prophylactic against stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. It remains unknown, however, when ketamine should be administered relative to a stressor in order to maximize its antidepressant and/or prophylactic effects. Moreover, it is unknown whether ketamine can be prophylactic against subsequent stressors. We systematically administered ketamine at different time points relative to a fear experience, in order to determine when ketamine is most effective at reducing fear expression or preventing fear reactivation. Using a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm, mice were administered a single dose of saline or ketamine (30\u2009mg/kg) at varying time points before or after CFC. Mice administered prophylactic ketamine 1 week, but not 1 month or 1\u2009h before CFC, exhibited reduced freezing behavior when compared with mice administered saline. In contrast, ketamine administration following CFC or during extinction did not alter subsequent fear expression.

Here, we sought to identify an improved selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM) in which we could label an individual memory trace in ArcCreER(T2) mice.

In particular, memory traces, or engrams, that are formed during encoding in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region are crucial for memory retrieval and amenable to modulation by neuroplastic mechanisms, including adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we will discuss how memory traces are being encoded at the cellular level, how they may contribute to pattern separation and pattern completion in the hippocampus, and how they can be associated with different experiences to express memories of opposite valence.

Originally, adult-born neurons were considered to have excitatory effects on the DG network, but recent studies suggest a net inhibitory effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that selective removal of newborn neurons would lead to increased susceptibility to the effects of a convulsant. This hypothesis was tested by evaluating the response to the chemoconvulsant kainic acid (KA) in mice with reduced adult neurogenesis, produced either by focal X-irradiation of the DG, or by pharmacogenetic deletion of dividing radial glial precursors. In the first 4 hrs after KA administration, when mice have the most robust seizures, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis had more severe convulsive seizures, exhibited either as a decreased latency to the first convulsive seizure, greater number of convulsive seizures, or longer convulsive seizures. Nonconvulsive seizures did not appear to change or they decreased. Four-21 hrs after KA injection, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis showed more interictal spikes (IIS) and delayed seizures than controls. Effects were greater when the anticonvulsant ethosuximide was injected 30 min prior to KA administration; ethosuximide allows forebrain seizure activity to be more easily examined in mice by suppressing seizures dominated by the brainstem.
