How HS, a highly sulfated glycan subtype that alters growth factor signaling, influences Areg repair/regeneration functions is unclear. Here we report that inhibition of HS in various cell lines and primary lung mesenchymal cells (LMC) qualitatively alters downstream signaling and highlights the existence of HS-dependent vs. -independent Areg transcriptional signatures. Utilizing a panel of cell lines with targeted deletions in HS synthesis-related genes, we found that the presence of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans is critical for Areg signaling and confirmed this dependency in primary LMC by siRNA-mediated knockdown. Furthermore, in the context of influenza A (IAV) infection in vivo , we found that an Areg-responsive subset of reparative LMC upregulate glypican-4 and HS. Conditional deletion of HS primarily within this LMC subset resulted in reduced blood oxygen saturation following infection with IAV, with no changes in viral load. Finally, we found that co-culture of HS-knockout LMC with IAV-induced Treg cells results in reduced LMC responses. Collectively, this study reveals the essentiality of HS on a specific lung mesenchymal population as a mediator of Treg cell-derived Areg reparative signaling during IAV infection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lucas F", "Last Name": "Loffredo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anmol", "Last Name": "Surpur", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Olivia R", "Last Name": "Ringham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fangda", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenia", "Last Name": "de Los Santos-Alexis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Arpaia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr28"}, {"PMID": "38668758", "Title": "Treg-tissue cell interactions in repair and regeneration.", "Abstract": "Regulatory T (Treg) cells are classically known for their critical immunosuppressive functions that support peripheral tolerance.

Based on a small RNA screen of capsular biosynthesis pathways, we constructed inducible synthetic gene circuits that regulate bacterial encapsulation in Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. These bacteria are capable of temporarily evading immune attack, whereas subsequent loss of encapsulation results in effective clearance in vivo. This dynamic delivery strategy enabled a ten-fold increase in maximum tolerated dose of bacteria and improved anti-tumor efficacy in murine models of cancer. Furthermore, in situ encapsulation increased the fraction of microbial translocation among mouse tumors, leading to efficacy in distal tumors.

Here, we sought to understand these potentially opposing functions by interrogating functional relationships among CAF subtypes, their mediators, desmoplasia, and tumor growth in a wide range of tumor types metastasizing to the liver, the most common organ site for metastasis. Depletion of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which represented the main source of CAF in mice and patients in our study, or depletion of all CAF decreased tumor growth and mortality in desmoplastic colorectal and pancreatic metastasis but not in nondesmoplastic metastatic tumors. Single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis, as well as studies in immune cell-depleted and HSC-selective knockout mice, uncovered direct CAF-tumor interactions as a tumor-promoting mechanism, mediated by myofibroblastic CAF-secreted (myCAF-secreted) hyaluronan and inflammatory CAF-secreted (iCAF-secreted) HGF. These effects were opposed by myCAF-expressed type I collagen, which suppressed tumor growth by mechanically restraining tumor spread, overriding its own stiffness-induced mechanosignals. In summary, mechanical restriction by type I collagen opposes the overall tumor-promoting effects of CAF, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for their dual functions in cancer.

The delicate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, essential for gut immune homeostasis, is affected by the composition of the commensal microbial community. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing transcription factor Foxp3 have a key role in limiting inflammatory responses in the intestine. Although specific members of the commensal microbial community have been found to potentiate the generation of anti-inflammatory Treg or pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells, the molecular cues driving this process remain elusive. Considering the vital metabolic function afforded by commensal microorganisms, we reasoned that their metabolic by-products are sensed by cells of the immune system and affect the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cells. We tested this hypothesis by exploring the effect of microbial metabolites on the generation of anti-inflammatory Treg cells. We found that in mice a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate, produced by commensal microorganisms during starch fermentation, facilitated extrathymic generation of Treg cells. A boost in Treg-cell numbers after provision of butyrate was due to potentiation of extrathymic differentiation of Treg cells, as the observed phenomenon was dependent on intronic enhancer CNS1 (conserved non-coding sequence 1), essential for extrathymic but dispensable for thymic Treg-cell differentiation. In addition to butyrate, de novo Treg-cell generation in the periphery was potentiated by propionate, another SCFA of microbial origin capable of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, but not acetate, which lacks this HDAC-inhibitory activity. Our results suggest that bacterial metabolites mediate communication between the commensal microbiota and the immune system, affecting the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Animals", "Butyrates", "Cell Differentiation", "Cytokines", "Dendritic Cells", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Fermentation", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Histone Deacetylases", "Inflammation Mediators", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Intestines", "Introns", "Lymphocyte Count", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Starch", "Symbiosis", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Arpaia", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiying", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanislav", "Last Name": "Dikiy", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joris", "Last Name": "van der Veeken", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "deRoos", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA [2] Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Donald B. and Catherine C.

The consequences of microbial recognition by the host has led to the development of compensatory mechanisms by both the host and microbe to either resist or tolerate the existence of the other.

Because of space considerations and for conceptual clarity, we have focused on detection of bacteria by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and highlight examples of bacterial strategies to evade, subvert and in some cases even utilize these receptors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteria", "Biological Evolution", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Immune Evasion", "Toll-Like Receptors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Arpaia", "Affiliation": "Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. arpaian@mskcc.org"}, {"First Name": "Gregory M", "Last Name": "Barton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Current opinion in microbiology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
