[{"PMID": "38693703", "Title": "SNAPSHOT USA 2021: A third coordinated national camera trap survey of the United States.", "Abstract": "SNAPSHOT USA is a multicontributor, long-term camera trap survey designed to survey mammals across the United States. Participants are recruited through community networks and directly through a website application (https://www.snapshot-usa.org/). The growing Snapshot dataset is useful, for example, for tracking wildlife population responses to land use, land cover, and climate changes across spatial and temporal scales. Here we present the SNAPSHOT USA 2021 dataset, the third national camera trap survey across the US. Data were collected across 109 camera trap arrays and included 1711 camera sites. The total effort equaled 71,519 camera trap nights and resulted in 172,507 sequences of animal observations. Sampling effort varied among camera trap arrays, with a minimum of 126 camera trap nights, a maximum of 3355 nights, a median 546 nights, and a mean 656\u2009\u00b1\u2009431 nights. This third dataset comprises 51 camera trap arrays that were surveyed during 2019, 2020, and 2021, along with 71 camera trap arrays that were surveyed in 2020 and 2021. All raw data and accompanying metadata are stored on Wildlife Insights (https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/), and are publicly available upon acceptance of the data papers. SNAPSHOT USA aims to sample multiple ecoregions in the United States with adequate representation of each ecoregion according to its relative size. Currently, the relative density of camera trap arrays varies by an order of magnitude for the various ecoregions (0.22-5.9 arrays per 100,000\u2009km2), emphasizing the need to increase sampling effort by further recruiting and retaining contributors. There are no copyright restrictions on these data. We request that authors cite this paper when using these data, or a subset of these data, for publication.

Research in animal models suggests that PACAP modulates entorhinal cortex (EC) input to the hippocampus, contributing to impaired contextual fear conditioning. In PTSD, PACAP is associated with higher activity of the amygdala to threat stimuli and lower functional connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus. However, PACAP-affiliated structural alterations of these regions have not been investigated in PTSD. Here, we examined whether peripheral PACAP levels were associated with neuronal morphology of the amygdala and hippocampus (primary analyses), and EC (secondary) using Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging.Methods: Sixty-four (44 female) adults (19 to 54 years old) with DSM-5 Criterion A trauma exposure completed the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), a blood draw, and magnetic resonance imaging. PACAP38 radioimmunoassay was performed and T1-weighted and multi-shell diffusion-weighted images were acquired. Neurite Density Index (NDI) and Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI) were quantified in the amygdala, hippocampus, and EC. CAPS-5 total score and anxious arousal score were used to test for clinical associations with brain structure.Results: Higher PACAP levels were associated with greater EC NDI (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.0099, q\u2009=\u20090.032) and lower EC ODI (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.0073, q\u2009=\u20090.047), and not hippocampal or amygdala measures. Neither EC NDI nor ODI was associated with clinical measures.Conclusions: Circulating PACAP levels were associated with altered neuronal density of the EC but not the hippocampus or amygdala.

Motion within the OCC is now observable due to optical coherence tomography. In a previous study (Cooper\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018), the region that includes the electro-motile outer hair cells (OHC) and Deiters cells (DC) was observed to move with larger amplitude than the basilar membrane (BM) and surrounding regions and was termed the \"hotspot.\" In addition to this quantitative distinction, the hotspot moved qualitatively differently than the BM, in that its motion scaled nonlinearly with stimulus level at all frequencies, evincing sub-BF activity. Sub-BF activity enhances non-BF motion; thus the frequency tuning of the OHC/DC region was reduced relative to the BM. In this work we further explore the motion of the gerbil basal OCC and find that regions that lack significant sub-BF activity include the BM, the medial and lateral OCC, and the reticular lamina (RL) region. The observation that the RL region does not move actively sub-BF (already observed in Cho and Puria 2022), suggests that hair cell stereocilia are not exposed to sub-BF activity in the cochlear base. The observation that the lateral and RL regions move approximately linearly sub-BF indicates that linear forces dominate non-linear OHC-based forces on these components at sub-BF frequencies. A complex difference analysis was performed to reveal the internal motion of the OHC/DC region and showed that amplitude structure and phase shifts in the directly measured OHC/DC motion emerge due to the internal OHC/DC motion destructively interfering with BM motion.", "Keywords": ["Cochlea", "Cochlear amplifier", "Deiters cell", "Gerbil", "Hair cell", "Outer hair cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Gerbillinae", "Acoustic Stimulation", "Cochlea", "Organ of Corti", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer", "Basilar Membrane", "Vibration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "C Elliott", "Last Name": "Strimbu", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 West 168th Street, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lauren A", "Last Name": "Chiriboga", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, 1210 Amsterdam Avenue, New York City, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian L", "Last Name": "Frost", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, 500 West 120th Street, New York City, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth S", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 West 168th Street, New York City, NY 10032, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, 1210 Amsterdam Avenue, New York City, NY 10027, USA.

In a sample of 4215 adults (PTSD n\u2009=\u20091642; Control n\u2009=\u20092573) across 40 sites from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD working group, we employed a new state-of-the-art deep-learning based approach for automatic cerebellar parcellation to obtain volumetric estimates for the total cerebellum and 28 subregions. Linear mixed effects models controlling for age, gender, intracranial volume, and site were used to compare cerebellum volumes in PTSD compared to healthy controls (88% trauma-exposed). PTSD was associated with significant grey and white matter reductions of the cerebellum. Compared to controls, people with PTSD demonstrated smaller total cerebellum volume, as well as reduced volume in subregions primarily within the posterior lobe (lobule VIIB, crus II), vermis (VI, VIII), flocculonodular lobe (lobule X), and corpus medullare (all p-FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). Effects of PTSD on volume were consistent, and generally more robust, when examining symptom severity rather than diagnostic status. These findings implicate regionally specific cerebellar volumetric differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The cerebellum appears to play an important role in higher-order cognitive and emotional processes, far beyond its historical association with vestibulomotor function. Further examination of the cerebellum in trauma-related psychopathology will help to clarify how cerebellar structure and function may disrupt cognitive and affective processes at the center of

landscape and its historical and contemporary recognition of young people as caregivers and their importance to public health, both as care providers and as a category of special concern for overall wellbeing. Drawing on feminist geographies of health to situate a historical analysis, we aim to answer two key questions: First, what is the history of recognition of caregiving youth in key moments of federal action to address family caregiving needs? Second, how might we use this history to better understand and analyze the patchwork geography of caregiving youth recognition in the U.S. and other countries that similarly lack formal national policy recognition to improve and enhance public health? We use the term patchwork to describe how federal recognition of caregiving youth in broader debates about public health is uneven across both time and space, and contingent upon civil society, non-profit organizations, and researchers working in and with geographically bound communities. Our results illustrate how a focus on the relationships of recognition, both in the past and the present and at local and national scales, reveals a different perspective on caregiving youth in the U.S. with a much more complex history than previously identified. The article describes how relationships established in the absence of federal policy or legislation are sometimes directed towards building more formal recognition, and other times with the goal of changing practices in a specific location.", "Keywords": ["United States", "care", "caregiving youth", "critical health geographies", "feminist geography", "history"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "United States", "Adolescent", "Caregivers", "Policy", "Motivation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leiha", "Last Name": "Edmonds", "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "PubDate": "2023Oct13"}, {"PMID": "37873430", "Title": "A frame and a hotspot in cochlear mechanics.", "Abstract": "Auditory sensation is based in nanoscale vibration of the sensory tissue of the cochlea, the organ of Corti complex (OCC). Motion within the OCC is now observable due to optical coherence tomography. In the cochlear base, in response to sound stimulation, the region that includes the electro-motile outer hair cells (OHC) was observed to move with larger amplitude than the basilar membrane (BM) and surrounding regions. The intense motion is based in active cell mechanics, and the region was termed the \"hotspot\" (Cooper et al., 2018, Nature comm). In addition to this quantitative distinction, the hotspot moved qualitatively differently than the BM, in that its motion scaled nonlinearly with stimulus level at all frequencies, evincing sub-BF activity. Sub-BF activity enhances non-BF motion; thus the frequency tuning of the hotspot was reduced relative to the BM. Regions that did not exhibit sub-BF activity are here defined as the OCC \"frame\". By this definition the frame includes the BM, the medial and lateral OCC, and most significantly, the reticular lamina (RL). The frame concept groups the majority OCC as a structure that is largely shielded from sub-BF activity. This shielding, and how it is achieved, are key to the active frequency tuning of the cochlea. The observation that the RL does not move actively sub-BF indicates that hair cell stereocilia are not exposed to sub-BF activity.

OCT's uniaxial nature leads to limitations that complicate the interpretation of data from cochlear mechanics experiments. The relationship between the optical axis (axis of motion measurement) and anatomically relevant axes in the cochlea varies across experiments, and generally is not known. This leads to characteristically different motion measurements taken from the same structure at different orientations. We present a method that can reconstruct two-dimensional (2-D) motion of intra-OCC structures in the cochlea's longitudinal-transverse plane. The method requires only a single, unmodified OCT system, and does not require any prior knowledge of precise structural locations or measurement angles. It uses the cochlea's traveling wave to register points between measurements taken at multiple viewing angles. We use this method to reconstruct 2-D motion at the outer hair cell/Deiters cell junction in the gerbil base, and show that reconstructed transverse motion resembles directly measured transverse motion, thus validating the method.

We compared the impact of four different harmonization methods on results obtained from analyses of cortical thickness data: (1) linear mixed-effects model (LME) that models site-specific random intercepts (LMEINT), (2) LME that models both site-specific random intercepts and age-related random slopes (LMEINT+SLP), (3) ComBat, and (4) ComBat with a generalized additive model (ComBat-GAM). Our test case for comparing harmonization methods was cortical thickness data aggregated from 29 sites, which included 1,340 cases with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (6.2-81.8 years old) and 2,057 trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (6.3-85.2 years old). We found that, compared to the other data harmonization methods, data processed with ComBat-GAM was more sensitive to the detection of significant case-control differences (\u03a72(3)\u00a0=\u00a063.704, p < 0.001) as well as case-control differences in age-related cortical thinning (\u03a72(3)\u00a0=\u00a012.082, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007).

ComBat-GAM also led to stronger estimates of age-related declines in cortical thickness (corrected p-values < 0.001), stronger estimates of case-related cortical thickness reduction (corrected p-values < 0.001), weaker estimates of age-related declines in cortical thickness in cases than controls (corrected p-values < 0.001), stronger estimates of cortical thickness reduction in females than males (corrected p-values < 0.001), and stronger estimates of cortical thickness reduction in females relative to males in cases than controls (corrected p-values < 0.001). Our results support the use of ComBat-GAM to minimize confounds and increase statistical power when harmonizing data with non-linear effects, and the use of either ComBat or ComBat-GAM for harmonizing data with linear effects.", "Keywords": ["ComBat", "ComBat-GAM", "Cortical Thickness", "Data Harmonization", "General Additive Model", "Linear Mixed-Effects Model", "PTSD", "Scanner Effects", "Site Effects"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Delin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Brain Imaging and Analysis Center, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.;

While the placebo and nocebo effects have become increasingly relevant in the clinical arena, little is known about the influence of biological sex on placebo and nocebo effects. This paper discusses the existing, relatively limited and sometimes conflicting evidence about how sex impacts the occurrence and magnitude of the placebo and nocebo effects, mainly focusing on pain studies. We present recent evidence that when compared to men, women suffering from chronic orofacial pain may derive greater benefit from the placebo effect for analgesia. Nonetheless, we broadly argue that the field is not currently positioned to draw definitive conclusions and propose several important factors that may explain the inconsistency in the literature and that should be taken into account in future research. These include the specific target symptom of the placebo or nocebo manipulation and whether or not the target is related to the medical condition, the placebo or nocebo induction method, the sex of the experimenter or physician, and so forth. Future research should intentionally include sex a biological variable to favor translation of placebo and nocebo mechanisms into clinical applications.", "Keywords": ["Conditioning", "Expectations", "Experimental settings", "Gender", "Randomized clinical trials", "Social learning"], "MeSH terms": ["Chronic Pain", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nocebo Effect", "Pain Management", "Placebo Effect"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roni", "Last Name": "Shafir", "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Translational Symptom Science, School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA.

However, the one-dimensional nature of OCT measurements, combined with experimental and anatomical constraints, make these data ambiguous: Both the relative positions of measured structures and their orientation relative to the direction of measured vibrations are not known a priori. We present a method by which these measurement features can be determined via the use of a volumetric OCT scan to determine the relationship between the imaging/measurement axes and the canonical anatomical axes. We provide evidence that the method is functional by replicating previously measured radial vibration patterns of the basilar membrane (BM). We used the method to compare outer hair cell and BM vibration phase in the same anatomical cross section (but different optical cross sections), and found that outer hair cell region vibrations lead those of the BM across the entire measured frequency range. In contrast, a phase lead is only present at low frequencies in measurements taken within a single optical cross section. Relative phase is critical to the workings of the cochlea, and these results emphasize the importance of anatomically oriented measurement and analysis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Basilar Membrane", "Cochlea", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer", "Organ of Corti", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vibration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian L", "Last Name": "Frost", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, 500 W. 120th St., Mudd 1310, New York, New York 1002, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clark Elliott", "Last Name": "Strimbu", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 W. 168th St., New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth S", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 W. 168th St., New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America", "PubDate": "2022Feb"}, {"PMID": "35175079", "Title": "Child and adolescent caregiving for family: Emotional, social, physical, and academic risk and individual differences.", "Abstract": "In the United States, it is estimated that more than 5.4 million children and adolescents under age 18 provide care for adult family members who are aging or have a chronic illness, disability, or other health conditions that require assistance. However, little is known about how providing care to the family during childhood and adolescence impacts youth development. We examined whether caregiving as a youth is associated with emotional challenges, peer difficulties, course grades, and physical health risk behaviors. A large, diverse sample of middle and high school students in Florida completed the first systematic school-based survey in the U.S. to date to count caregiving youth (N = 10,880; 52% female; Mage = 14.40, 40% Latinx). Youth reported the amount of caregiving they provided to the family each week, in addition to items reflecting their emotional challenges (e.g., suicidality), peer difficulties (e.g., experiences of conflict or victimization), academic course grades, and health risk behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, sleep). We found that Latinx and Black youth provided higher levels of caregiving to the family compared to youth from White non-Latinx, Asian, or Other ethnicities. Caregiving was associated with more emotional challenges, more peer difficulties, and lower course grades for all groups. In addition, providing caregiving was associated with a less healthy diet among older youth and sleeping less than 8 hr per night among White non-Latinx youth. These findings highlight a need to support caregiving youth and their families via policies and institutional supports.

We introduced salicylate, a known blocker of outer hair cell (OHC) based electromotility, into the perilymphatic space by applying sodium salicylate onto the round window membrane.

Following treatment, all regions showed a loss of vibration amplitude and tuning while OHC-region vibrations retained their wide-band nonlinearity. OC vibrations, which had been relatively confined in a region including OHCs and extending to the BM at the outer pillar foot, became less confined with structures lateral to the OHCs sometimes exhibiting the highest amplitudes.

We also examined whether GABA alterations correlated with hyperarousal and dissociation symptoms. One hundred and fourteen participants (39 PTSD, 34 TENC, 41 HC) underwent 3T MRS of the medial prefrontal, right insular, and right posterior temporal cortices, and the GABA plus macromolecule signal (GABA+) was normalized to creatine (Cr). The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale measured hyperarousal symptoms, including sleep disruption. The Dissociative Experiences Scale assessed dissociation symptoms. PTSD and TENC participants had significantly lower mPFC GABA+/Cr than HC participants, and this deficit was significantly correlated with greater dissociation. Compared with HC, PTSD patients but not TENC had significantly lower insula GABA+/Cr. Total hyperarousal symptoms and sleep disruption were not significantly associated with GABA+/Cr alterations in either region.

These forces are the result of electromotility, wherein current through the OHCs leads to conformational changes in the cells that provide stresses on surrounding structures. OHC transducer current can be detected via the voltage in the scala tympani (the cochlear microphonic, CM), and the CM can be used as an indicator of healthy cochlear operation. The CM represents a summation of OHC currents (the inner hair cell contribution is known to be small) and to use CM to probe the properties of OHC transduction requires a model that simulates that summation. We developed a finite element model for that purpose. The pattern of current generators (the model input) was initially based on basilar membrane displacement, with the current size based on in\u00a0vitro data. The model was able to reproduce the amplitude of experimental CM results reasonably well when the input tuning was enhanced slightly (peak increased by \u223c6 dB), which can be regarded as additional hair bundle tuning, and with a current/input value of 200-260\u00a0pA/nm, which is \u223c4 times greater than the largest in\u00a0vitro measures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basilar Membrane", "Cochlea", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer", "Scala Tympani"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Frost", "Affiliation": "Electrical Engineering, New York, New York.

The recent development of hollow microneedles enables safe and reliable sampling of perilymph for proteomic analysis. Using these microneedles, we investigate the effect of intratympanic (IT) versus intraperitoneal (IP) dexamethasone administration on guinea pig perilymph proteome. Guinea pigs were treated with IT dexamethasone (n = 6), IP dexamethasone (n = 8), or untreated for control (n = 8) 6 h prior to aspiration. The round window membrane (RWM) was accessed via a postauricular approach, and hollow microneedles were used to perforate the RWM and aspirate 1 \u03bcL of perilymph. Perilymph samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics. Mass spectrometry raw data files have been deposited in an international public repository (MassIVE proteomics repository at https://massive.ucsd.edu/) under data set # MSV000086887. In the 22 samples of perilymph analyzed, 632 proteins were detected, including the inner ear protein cochlin, a perilymph marker. Of these, 14 proteins were modulated by IP, and three proteins were modulated by IT dexamethasone. In both IP and IT dexamethasone groups, VGF nerve growth factor inducible was significantly upregulated compared to control. The remaining adjusted proteins modulate neurons, inflammation, or protein synthesis. Proteome analysis facilitated by the use of hollow microneedles shows that route of dexamethasone administration impacts changes seen in perilymph proteome. Compared to IT administration, the IP route was associated with greater changes in protein expression, including proteins involved in neuroprotection, inflammatory pathway, and protein synthesis.

However, findings for many regions, particularly regions outside commonly studied emotion-related prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions, are inconsistent and tentative. Also, few studies address the possibility that PTSD abnormalities may be confounded by comorbid depression. A mega-analysis investigating all cortical regions in a large sample of PTSD and control subjects can potentially provide new insight into these issues. Given this perspective, our group aggregated regional volumes data of 68 cortical regions across both hemispheres from 1379 PTSD patients to 2192 controls without PTSD after data were processed by 32 international laboratories using ENIGMA standardized procedures. We examined whether regional cortical volumes were different in PTSD vs. controls, were associated with posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) severity, or were affected by comorbid depression. Volumes of left and right lateral orbitofrontal gyri (LOFG), left superior temporal gyrus, and right insular, lingual and superior parietal gyri were significantly smaller, on average, in PTSD patients than controls (standardized coefficients\u2009=\u2009-0.111 to -0.068, FDR corrected P values\u2009<\u20090.039) and were significantly negatively correlated with PTSS severity. After adjusting for depression symptoms, the PTSD findings in left and right LOFG remained significant. These findings indicate that cortical volumes in PTSD patients are smaller in prefrontal regulatory regions, as well as in broader emotion and sensory processing cortical regions.", "Keywords": [],

identifying selection pressures and tradeoffs at different life history stages. We examined the influence of breeding habitat phenology on life history timing of the eastern willet (Tringa semipalmata semipalmata) across a latitudinal gradient of breeding sites on the east coast of North America. To describe migration and life history timing, we deployed light-level geolocators on willets at breeding sites in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maine, USA and evaluated additional data on life history timing and migratory connectivity from previous studies, eBird and band recoveries. Willets from Nova Scotia to Georgia winter exclusively on the Atlantic coast of northern South America and share common stopover sites. The timing of wintering site departure, breeding site arrival, nesting and southbound departure was later for birds breeding at higher latitudes while the duration of all life phases was similar across sites. Regardless of latitude, nesting corresponded with a consistent stage of seasonal salt marsh biomass accumulation and with peak spring temperature acceleration (GDD jerk). Temperature acceleration and salt marsh biomass were closely correlated with each other across the 11\u00b0 latitudinal gradient we examined and with the timing of nest initiation across the northern 6\u00b0 of this gradient. For this northern 6\u00b0 of latitude, these results suggest that the timing of migration and breeding events in the annual cycle of eastern willets is constrained by a phenological \"green wave\" of spring salt marsh productivity at breeding sites.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animal Migration", "Animals", "Birds", "Breeding", "Ecosystem", "Georgia", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Jersey", "North America", "Seasons", "Temperature"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph A M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Wildlife Restoration Partnerships, Greenwich, NJ, 08323, USA. smithjam@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Regan", "Affiliation": "Biodiversity Research Institute, Portland, ME, 04103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathan W", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, DC, 20007, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luanne", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "BiodiversityWorks, Vineyard Haven, MA, 02568, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "BiodiversityWorks, Vineyard Haven, MA, 02568, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "Eagle Hill School, Hardwick, MA, 01037, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeff", "Last Name": "Tash", "Affiliation": "Biodiversity Research Institute, Portland, ME, 04103, USA."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Evers", "Affiliation": "Biodiversity Research Institute, Portland, ME, 04103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter P", "Last Name": "Marra", "Affiliation": "Georgetown University, Washington, DC, 20057, USA."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020Nov26"}, {"PMID": "33103018", "Title": "Cochlear mechanics: new insights from vibrometry and Optical Coherence Tomography.", "Abstract": "The cochlea is a complex biological machine that transduces sound-induced mechanical vibrations to neural signals.

The amplifier relies on outer hair cell (OHC)-generated forces driven in part by the endocochlear potential, the \u223c+80\u00a0mV potential maintained in scala media, generated by the stria vascularis. We transiently eliminated the endocochlear potential in\u00a0vivo by an intravenous injection of furosemide and measured the vibrations of different layers in the cochlea's organ of Corti using optical coherence tomography. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions were also monitored. After furosemide injection, the vibrations of the basilar membrane lost the best frequency (BF) peak and showed broad tuning similar to a passive cochlea. The intra-organ of Corti vibrations measured in the region of the OHCs lost the BF peak and showed low-pass responses but retained nonlinearity. This strongly suggests that OHC electromotility was operating and being driven by nonlinear OHC current. Thus, although electromotility is presumably necessary to produce a healthy BF peak, the mere presence of electromotility is not sufficient. The BF peak recovered nearly fully within 2 h, along with the recovery of odd-order distortion product otoacoustic emissions.

This is due to the electromechanical properties of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). At each location along the cochlear spiral, the OHCs mediate an active process in which the sensory tissue motion is enhanced at frequencies close to the most sensitive frequency (called the characteristic frequency, CF). Previous experimental results showed an approximate 0.3 cycle phase shift in the OHC-generated extracellular voltage relative the basilar membrane displacement, which was initiated at a frequency approximately one-half octave lower than the CF. Findings in the present paper reinforce that result. This shift is significant because it brings the phase of the OHC-derived electromotile force near to that of the basilar membrane velocity at frequencies above the shift, thereby enabling the transfer of electrical to mechanical power at the basilar membrane. In order to seek a candidate physical mechanism for this phenomenon, we used a comprehensive electromechanical mathematical model of the cochlear response to sound.

In the model, this feature arises from a minimum in the radial impedance of the tectorial membrane and its limbal attachment.

Thus, it is essential to understand the mechanistic and translational aspects of sex differences in placebo outcomes. Recently, studies in healthy participants have shed light on how sex-related placebo effects might influence outcomes, yet no research has been conducted in a patient population. Herein, we used a tripartite approach to evaluate the interaction of prior therapeutic experience (eg, conditioning), expectations, and placebo effects in 280 chronic (orofacial) pain patients (215 women). In this cross-sectional study, we assessed sex differences in placebo effects, conditioning as a proxy of prior therapeutic effects, and expectations evaluated before and after the exposure to positive outcomes, taking into account participant-experimenter sex concordance and hormonal levels (estradiol and progesterone assessed in premenopausal women). We used mediation analysis to determine how conditioning strength and expectations impacted sex differences in placebo outcomes. Independent of gonadal hormone levels, women showed stronger placebo effects than men. We also found significant statistical sex differences in the conditioning strength and reinforced expectations whereby reinforced expectations mediated the sex-related placebo effects. In addition, the participant-experimenter sex concordance influenced conditioning strength, reinforced expectations, and placebo effects in women but not in men. Our findings suggest that women experience larger conditioning effects, expectations, and placebo effects emphasizing the need to consider sex as a biological variable when placebo components of any outcomes are part of drug development trials and in pain management.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chronic Pain", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Estradiol", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Placebo Effect", "Sex Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Titilola", "Last Name": "Akintola", "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Translational Symptom Science, School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jane", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Department of Neural and Pain Sciences, and Brotman Facial Pain Clinic, School of Dentistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maxie", "Last Name": "Blasini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Translational Symptom Science, School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel R", "Last Name": "Haycock", "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Translational Symptom Science, School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pedro E", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "University of Maryland Center to Advance Chronic Pain Research, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joel D", "Last Name": "Greenspan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neural and Pain Sciences, and Brotman Facial Pain Clinic, School of Dentistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Susan G", "Last Name": "Dorsey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Translational Symptom Science, School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Translational Symptom Science, School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Luana", "Last Name": "Colloca", "Affiliation": "Department of Pain and Translational Symptom Science, School of Nursing, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States."}], "Journal": "Pain", "PubDate": "2021Feb01"}, {"PMID": "32816343", "Title": "Social Anhedonia is Associated with Low Social Network Diversity in Trauma-Exposed Adults.", "Abstract": "Social anhedonia has been proposed to contribute to social isolation in several psychiatric disorders, but it has not been examined in relation to deficits in social connection that also characterize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

In the work presented here, we measured the responses of (1) the extracellular voltage generated by OHCs (VOHC) and (2) displacements within the organ of Corti complex (OCC) to a multi-tone stimulus, and to single tones. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we were able to measure displacements of different layers in the OCC simultaneously, in the base of the gerbil cochlea. We explored the effect of the two types of sound stimuli to the nonlinear behavior of voltage and displacement in two frequency regions: a frequency region below the BM nonlinearity (sub-BF region: f\u202f<\u202f\u223c0.7 BF), and in the best frequency (BF) region. In the sub-BF region, BM motion (XBM) had linear growth for both stimulus types, and the motion in the OHC region (XOHC) was mildly nonlinear for single tones, and relatively strongly nonlinear for multi-tones. Sub-BF, the nonlinear character of VOHC was similar to that of XOHC. In the BF region XBM, VOHC and XOHC all possessed the now-classic nonlinearity of the BF peak. Coupling these observations with previous findings on phasing between OHC force and traveling wave motions, we propose the following framework for cochlear nonlinearity: The BF-region nonlinearity is an amplifying nonlinearity, in which OHC forces input power into the traveling wave, allowing it to travel further apical to the region where it peaks. The sub-BF nonlinearity is a non-amplifying nonlinearity; it represents OHC electromotility, and saturates due to OHC current saturation, but the OHC forces do not possess the proper phasing to feed power into the traveling wave.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Animals", "Cochlea", "Evoked Potentials", "Gerbillinae", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer", "Hearing", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Models, Neurological", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Time Factors", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elika", "Last Name": "Fallah", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University, New York City, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "C Elliott", "Last Name": "Strimbu", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Columbia University, New York City, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth S", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University, New York City, NY, United States; Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Columbia University, New York City, NY, United States.

An early study using furosemide to reversibly reduce EP showed that distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) recovered before EP. This indicated that cochlear amplification may be able to adjust to a new, lower EP. To investigate the mechanism of this adjustment, the extracellular OHC voltage, which we term local cochlear microphonic (LCM), was measured simultaneously with DPOAE and EP while using intraperitoneal (IP) and intravenous injection of furosemide to reversibly reduce EP. With IP injection, the DPOAEs recovered fully, whereas the EP was reduced, but LCM showed a similar time course as EP. The DPOAEs failed to accurately report the variation of cochlear amplification. With intravenous injection, for which both reduction and recovery of EP are known to occur relatively quickly compared to IP, the cochlear amplification observed in LCM could attain nearly full or even full recovery with reduced EP. This showed the cochlea has an ability to adjust to diminished operating condition. Furthermore, the cochlear amplifier and EP recovered with different time courses: cochlear amplification just started to recover after the EP was nearly fully recovered and stabilized.

We measured pressure and motion in the bushcricket ear to investigate physical properties, stiffness, and mass, which govern the mechanical responses to sound. As in the mammalian cochlea, sound-induced fluid pressure and motion responses were tonotopically organized along the longitudinal axis of the crista acustica, the bushcricket's hearing organ. The fluid pressure at the crista and crista motion were used to calculate the acoustic impedance of the organ-bounded fluid mass (Zmass). We used a theoretical wave analysis of wavelength data from a previous study to predict the crista acustica stiffness. The wave analysis also predicts Zmass, and that result agreed reasonably well with the directly measured Zmass, lending support to the theoretical wave analysis. The magnitude of the crista stiffness was similar to basilar membrane stiffness in mammals, and as in mammals, the stiffness decreased from the high-frequency to the low-frequency region. At a given location, the stiffness increased with increasing frequency, corresponding to increasing curvature of the traveling wave (decreasing wavelength), indicating that longitudinal coupling plays a substantial role in determining crista stiffness.

This paper probes TM operation by applying a free field click stimulus to the gerbil ear and exploring the consequent motions of the TM and umbo. Motions of the TM were measured both on radial tracks starting close to the umbo and on a grid distal and adjacent to the umbo. The experimental results confirmed the high fidelity of sound transmission from the ear canal to the umbo. A delay of 5-15 \u03bcs was seen in the onset of TM motion between points just adjacent to the umbo and mid-radial points. The TM responded with a ringing motion, with different locations possessing different primary ringing frequencies. A simple analytic model from the literature, treating the TM as a string, was used to explore the experimental results. The click-based experiments and analysis led to the following description of TM operation: A transient sound pressure on the TM causes a transient initial TM motion that is maximal\u00a0\u223c\u00a0at the TM's radial midpoints. Mechanical forces generated by this initial prominent TM distortion then pull the umbo inward, leading to a delayed umbo response. The initial TM deformation also gives rise to prolonged mechanical ringing on the TM that does not result in significant umbo motion, likely due to destructive interference from the range of ringing frequencies. Thus, the umbo's response is a high-fidelity representation of the transient stimulus.

The nonlinear and active character of this enhancement is the fundamental manifestation of cochlear amplification. Recently, mechanical (pressure) and electrical (extracellular OHC-generated voltage) responses were simultaneously measured close to the sensory tissue's basilar membrane. Both pressure and voltage were tuned and showed traveling-wave phase accumulation, evidence that they were locally generated responses. Approximately at the frequency where nonlinearity commenced, the phase of extracellular voltage shifted up, to lead pressure by >1/4 cycle. Based on established and fundamental relationships among voltage, force, pressure, displacement, and power, the observed phase shift was identified as the activation of cochlear amplification. In this study, the operation of the cochlear amplifier was further explored, via changes in pressure and voltage responses upon delivery of a second, suppressor tone. Two different suppression paradigms were used, one with a low-frequency suppressor and a swept-frequency probe, the other with two swept-frequency tones, either of which can be considered as probe or suppressor. In the presence of a high-level low-frequency suppressor, extracellular voltage responses at probe-tone frequencies were greatly reduced, and the pressure responses were reduced nearly to their linear, passive level. On the other hand, the amplifier-activating phase shift between pressure and voltage responses was still present in probe-tone responses.

Studies are not as conclusive regarding the localization of the underlying neural substrate for language in sequential language learners. Lateralization of the neural substrate for first and second language depends on a number of factors including proficiency and early experience with each language. Similar to humans learning speech, songbirds learn their vocalizations from a conspecific tutor early in development. Here, we show mirrored patterns of lateralization in the avian analog of the mammalian auditory cortex (the caudomedial nidopallium [NCM]) in sequentially tutored zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata\u200b) in response to their first tutor song, learned early in development, and their second tutor song, learned later in development. The greater the retention of song from their first tutor, the more right-dominant the birds were when exposed to that song; the more birds learned from their second tutor, the more left-dominant they were when exposed to that song. Thus, the avian auditory cortex may preserve lateralized neuronal traces of old and new tutor song memories, which are dependent on proficiency of song learning. There is striking resemblance in humans: early-formed language representations are maintained in the brain even if exposure to that language is discontinued. The switching of hemispheric dominance related to the acquisition of early auditory memories and subsequent encoding of more recent memories may be an evolutionary adaptation in vocal learners necessary for the behavioral flexibility to acquire novel vocalizations, such as a second language.", "Keywords": ["Taeniopygia guttata", "birdsong", "memory", "sensorimotor", "songbird", "speech"], "MeSH terms": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Animals", "Auditory Cortex", "Avian Proteins", "Finches", "Functional Laterality", "Immediate-Early Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "Learning", "Male", "Memory", "Models, Animal", "Neurons", "Time Factors", "Vocalization, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Wellesley College, 106 Central Street, Wellesley, MA 02481-8203, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rie K", "Last Name": "Maeda", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Wellesley College, 106 Central Street, Wellesley, MA 02481-8203, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sharon M H", "Last Name": "Gobes", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Program, Wellesley College, 106 Central Street, Wellesley, MA 02481-8203, United States.

From a research standpoint, studying the effects of a viscous fluid in the cochlea provides data for better understanding cochlear fluid mechanics. However, cochlear perfusion with a viscous fluid may damage the cochlea. In this work we studied the physiological and anatomical effects of perfusing the cochlea with a viscous fluid. Gerbil cochleae were perfused at a rate of 2.4\u00a0\u03bcL/min with artificial perilymph (AP) and sodium hyaluronate (Healon, HA) in four different concentrations (0.0625%, 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%). The different HA concentrations were applied either sequentially in the same cochlea or individually in different cochleae. The perfusion fluid entered from the round window and was withdrawn from basal scala vestibuli, in order to perfuse the entire perilymphatic space. Compound action potentials (CAP) were measured after each perfusion. After perfusion with increasing concentrations of HA in the order of increasing viscosity, the CAP thresholds generally increased. The threshold elevation after AP and 0.0625% HA perfusion was small or almost zero, and the 0.125% HA was a borderline case, while the higher concentrations significantly elevated CAP thresholds. Histology of the cochleae perfused with the 0.0625% HA showed an intact Reissner's membrane (RM), while in cochleae perfused with 0.125% and 0.25% HA RM was torn. Thus, the CAP threshold elevation was likely due to the broken RM, likely caused by the shear stress produced by the flow of the viscous fluid. Our results and analysis indicate that the cochlea can sustain, without a significant CAP threshold shift, up to a 1.5\u00a0Pa shear stress. Beside these finding, in the 0.125% and 0.25% HA perfusion cases, a temporary CAP threshold shift was observed, perhaps due to the presence and then clearance of viscous fluid within the cochlea, or to a temporary position shift of the Organ of Corti. After 0.5% HA perfusion, a short latency positive peak (P0) appeared in the CAP waveform. This P0 might be due to a change in the cochlea's traveling-wave pattern, or distortion in the cochlear microphonic.", "Keywords": ["Cochlear implantation", "Cochlear mechanics", "Cochlear perfusion", "Compound action potential", "Sodium hyaluronate", "Viscous fluid"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cochlea", "Cochlear Duct", "Cochlear Implantation", "Cochlear Implants", "Cochlear Microphonic Potentials", "Female", "Gerbillinae", "Hyaluronic Acid", "Organ of Corti", "Perfusion", "Perilymph", "Round Window, Ear", "Scala Vestibuli", "Shear Strength", "Viscosity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10025, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth S", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10025, USA; Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

To this aim, we measured sound-evoked intracochlear pressure in SM close to the partition using micropressure sensors. All the SM pressure data are from passive cochleae, likely because the SM cochleostomy led to loss of endocochlear potential. Thus, these experiments are studies of passive cochlear mechanics. SM pressure close to the tissue showed a pattern of peaks and notches, which could be explained as an interaction between fast and slow (i.e., traveling wave) pressure modes. In several animals SM and ST pressure were measured in the same cochlea. Similar to previous studies, ST-pressure was dominated by a slow, traveling wave mode at stimulus frequencies in the vicinity of the best frequency of the measurement location, and by a fast mode above best frequency. Antisymmetric pressure between SM and ST supported the classic single-partition cochlear models, or a dual-partition model with tight coupling between partitions.

This study examined whether dACC morphology is a neural correlate of alexithymia in child maltreatment-related PTSD. Sixteen adults with PTSD and a history of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exposure to domestic violence, and 24 healthy controls (HC) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 (TAS-20) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical thickness of the dACC was measured using FreeSurfer, and values were correlated with TAS-20 scores, controlling for sex and age, in both groups. Average TAS-20 score was significantly higher in the PTSD than the HC group. TAS-20 scores were significantly positively associated with dACC thickness only in the PTSD group. This association was strongest in the left hemisphere and for TAS-20 subscales that assess difficulty identifying and describing feelings. We found that increasing dACC gray matter thickness is a neural correlate of greater alexithymia in the context of PTSD with childhood maltreatment.

Task-related fronto-parietal fMRI activation clusters during a Sternberg WM Task were localized and used as seed regions for probabilistic fiber tractography. DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity were measured in the SLF. The psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) was used to evaluate resistance to SD. We found that activation in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) positively correlated with resistance.

Using a validated backward masked facial affect paradigm, we examined the association between ES and functional brain responses to masked angry, fearful, and happy faces. Healthy adults underwent functional MRI and completed the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale as a measure of ES. Correlations between self-reported ES and brain responses to the facial affect stimuli (affective>neutral) were evaluated within the brain regions involved in emotional processing, including the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. In response to angry faces, higher trait tendency to suppress anger and anxiety was significantly correlated with increased activation within the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, whereas no correlation was observed for masked happy or fearful faces. This finding suggests that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex contributes to the unconscious suppression of emotional responses to angry facial affect and may play a role in the mediating anatomy of trait ES.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affect", "Anger", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jiaolong", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab, Department of Psychiatry, McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Belmont, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mareen", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zachary J", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Isabelle M", "Last Name": "Rosso", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott L", "Last Name": "Rauch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William D S", "Last Name": "Killgore", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuroreport", "PubDate": "2014Jul09"}, {"PMID": "24744452", "Title": "Associations between cortical thickness and general intelligence in children, adolescents and young adults.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging research indicates that human intellectual ability is related to brain structure including the thickness of the cerebral cortex. Most studies indicate that general intelligence is positively associated with cortical thickness in areas of association cortex distributed throughout both brain hemispheres. In this study, we performed a cortical thickness mapping analysis on data from 182 healthy typically developing males and females ages 9 to 24 years to identify correlates of general intelligence (g) scores. To determine if these correlates also mediate associations of specific cognitive abilities with cortical thickness, we regressed specific cognitive test scores on g scores and analyzed the residuals with respect to cortical thickness. The effect of age on the association between cortical thickness and intelligence was examined. We found a widely distributed pattern of positive associations between cortical thickness and g scores, as derived from the first unrotated principal factor of a factor analysis of Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) subtest scores. After WASI specific cognitive subtest scores were regressed on g factor scores, the residual score variances did not correlate significantly with cortical thickness in the full sample with age covaried. When participants were grouped at the age median, significant positive associations of cortical thickness were obtained in the older group for g-residualized scores on Block Design (a measure of visual-motor integrative processing) while significant negative associations of cortical thickness were observed in the younger group for g-residualized Vocabulary scores.

Recent evidence suggests that regular physical exercise may also affect the responsiveness of reward regions of the brain to food stimuli. We examined whether the total number of minutes of self-reported weekly physical exercise was related to the responsiveness of appetite and food reward-related brain regions to visual presentations of high-calorie and low-calorie food images during functional MRI. Second, we examined whether such responses would correlate with self-reported food preferences. While undergoing scanning, 37 healthy adults (22 men) viewed images of high-calorie and low-calorie foods and provided desirability ratings for each food image. The correlation between exercise minutes per week and brain responses to the primary condition contrast (high-calorie>low-calorie) was evaluated within the amygdala, insula, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, brain regions previously implicated in responses to food images. Higher levels of exercise were significantly correlated with lower responsiveness within the medial orbitofrontal cortex and left insula to high-calorie foods. Furthermore, activation of these regions was positively correlated with preference ratings for high-calorie foods, particularly those with a savory flavor. These findings suggest that physical exercise may be associated with reduced activation in food-responsive reward regions, which are in turn associated with reduced preferences for unhealthy high-calorie foods.

This active cochlear amplifier produces the impressive sensitivity and frequency resolution of mammalian hearing. The cochlear amplifier has inspired scientists since its discovery in the 1970s, and is still not well understood. To explore cochlear electromechanics at the sensory cell/tissue interface, sound-evoked intracochlear pressure and extracellular voltage were measured using a recently developed dual-sensor with a microelectrode attached to a micro-pressure sensor. The resulting coincident in\u00a0vivo observations of OHC electrical activity, pressure at the basilar membrane and basilar membrane displacement gave direct evidence for power amplification in the cochlea. Moreover, the results showed a phase shift of voltage relative to mechanical responses at frequencies slightly below the peak, near the onset of amplification. Based on the voltage-force relationship of isolated OHCs, the shift would give rise to effective OHC pumping forces within the traveling wave peak. Thus, the shift activates the cochlear amplifier, serving to localize and thus sharpen the frequency region of amplification. These results are the most concrete evidence for cochlear power amplification to date and support OHC somatic forces as its source.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cochlea", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Gerbillinae", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer", "Pressure", "Sound", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth S", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biophysical journal", "PubDate": "2013Aug20"}, {"PMID": "23183032", "Title": "Sound transmission along the ossicular chain in common wild-type laboratory mice.", "Abstract": "The use of genetically modified mice can accelerate progress in auditory research.
