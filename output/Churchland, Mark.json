However, electrode/tissue interlayer materials such as ionically conducting pastes can negatively affect recordings by introducing lateral electrode-to-electrode ionic crosstalk and reducing spatial resolution. To overcome this issue, biocompatible, anisotropic-conducting interlayer composites (ACI) that establish an electrically anisotropic interface with the skin are developed, enabling the application of dense cutaneous sensor arrays. High-density, conformable electrodes are also microfabricated that adhere to the ACI and follow the curvilinear surface of the skin. The results show that ACI significantly enhances the spatial resolution of epidermal electromyography (EMG) recording compared to conductive paste, permitting the acquisition of single muscle action potentials with distinct spatial profiles. The high-density EMG in developing mice, non-human primates, and humans is validated. Overall, high spatial-resolution epidermal electrophysiology enabled by ACI has the potential to advance clinical diagnostics of motor system disorders and enhance data quality for human-computer interface applications.", "Keywords": ["EMG", "anisotropic conductors", "conducting polymers", "organic bioelectronics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zifang", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Han", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Duncan J", "Last Name": "Wisniewski", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Cea", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric M", "Last Name": "Trautmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer N", "Last Name": "Gelinas", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dion", "Last Name": "Khodagholy", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "PubDate": "2024Apr10"}, {"PMID": "38443626", "Title": "Preparatory activity and the expansive null-space.", "Abstract": "The study of the cortical control of movement experienced a conceptual shift over recent decades, as the basic currency of understanding shifted from single-neuron tuning towards population-level factors and their dynamics.

We introduce DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data), a robust algorithm which is well suited for the registration of noisy, nonstationary extracellular electrophysiology recordings. In addition to estimating motion from spikes in the action potential (AP) frequency band, DREDge enables automated tracking of motion at high temporal resolution in the local field potential (LFP) frequency band. In human intraoperative recordings, which often feature fast (period <1s) motion, DREDge correction in the LFP band enabled reliable recovery of evoked potentials, and significantly reduced single-unit spike shape variability and spike sorting error. Applying DREDge to recordings made during deep probe insertions in nonhuman primates demonstrated the possibility of tracking probe motion of centimeters across several brain regions while simultaneously mapping single unit electrophysiological features. DREDge reliably delivered improved motion correction in acute mouse recordings, especially in those made with an recent ultra-high density probe. We also implemented a procedure for applying DREDge to recordings made across tens of days in chronic implantations in mice, reliably yielding stable motion tracking despite changes in neural activity across experimental sessions.

behavior. A prerequisite for many decoding approaches is spike sorting, the assignment of action potentials (spikes) to individual neurons. Current spike sorting algorithms, however, can be inaccurate and do not properly model uncertainty of spike assignments, therefore discarding information that could potentially improve decoding performance. Recent advances in high-density probes (e.g., Neuropixels) and computational methods now allow for extracting a rich set of spike features from unsorted data; these features can in turn be used to directly decode behavioral correlates. To this end, we propose a spike sorting-free decoding method that directly models the distribution of extracted spike features using a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) encoding the uncertainty of spike assignments, without aiming to solve the spike clustering problem explicitly. We allow the mixing proportion of the MoG to change over time in response to the behavior and develop variational inference methods to fit the resulting model and to perform decoding. We benchmark our method with an extensive suite of recordings from different animals and probe geometries, demonstrating that our proposed decoder can consistently outperform current methods based on thresholding (i.e. multi-unit activity) and spike sorting.

Recent scientific findings suggest that the intrinsic covariance structure of neural activity depends strongly on movement class, potentially necessitating different decode algorithms across classes. To address this possibility, we developed a self-motion BMI based on cortical activity as monkeys cycled a hand-held pedal to progress along a virtual track. Unlike during reaching, we found no high-variance dimensions that directly correlated with to-be-decoded variables. This was due to no neurons having consistent correlations between their responses and kinematic variables. Yet we could decode a single variable-self-motion-by nonlinearly leveraging structure that spanned multiple high-variance neural dimensions. Resulting online BMI-control success rates approached those during manual control. These findings make two broad points regarding how to build decode algorithms that harmonize with the empirical structure of neural activity in motor cortex. First, even when decoding from the same cortical region (e.g., arm-related motor cortex), different movement classes may need to employ very different strategies. Although correlations between neural activity and hand velocity are prominent during reaching tasks, they are not a fundamental property of motor cortex and cannot be counted on to be present in general. Second, although one generally desires a low-dimensional readout, it can be beneficial to leverage a multidimensional high-variance subspace. Fully embracing this approach requires highly nonlinear approaches tailored to the task at hand, but can produce near-native levels of performance.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Many brain-machine interface decoders have been constructed for controlling movements normally performed with the arm. Yet it is unclear how these will function beyond the reach-like scenarios where they were developed. Existing decoders implicitly assume that neural covariance structure, and correlations with to-be-decoded kinematic variables, will be largely preserved across tasks. We find that the correlation between neural activity and hand kinematics, a feature typically exploited when decoding reach-like movements, is essentially absent during another task performed with the arm: cycling through a virtual environment. Nevertheless, the use of a different strategy, one focused on leveraging the highest-variance neural signals, supported high performance real-time brain-machine interface control.", "Keywords": ["BMI", "motor cortex", "prosthetics", "subspaces"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Brain-Computer Interfaces", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Movement", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Psychomotor Performance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karen E", "Last Name": "Schroeder", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sean M", "Last Name": "Perkins", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York mc3502@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2022Jan12"}, {"PMID": "33619403", "Title": "Independent generation of sequence elements by motor cortex.", "Abstract": "Rapid execution of motor sequences is believed to depend on fusing movement elements into cohesive units that are executed holistically.

SMA exhibits premovement activity across a variety of contexts, including externally cued and self-initiated movements. Yet SMA lesions impair initiation primarily for self-initiated movements. Does SMA influence initiation across contexts or does it play a more specialized role, perhaps contributing only when initiation is less dependent on external cues? To address this question, we perturbed SMA activity via microstimulation at variable times before movement onset. Experiments used two adult male rhesus monkeys trained on a reaching task. We used three contexts that differed regarding how tightly movement initiation was linked to external cues. Movement kinematics were not altered by microstimulation. Instead, microstimulation induced a variety of changes in the timing of movement initiation, with different effects dominating for different contexts. Despite their diversity, these changes could be explained by a simple model where microstimulation has a stereotyped impact on the probability of initiation. Surprisingly, a unified model accounted for effects across all three contexts, regardless of whether initiation was determined more by external cues versus internal considerations. All effects were present for stimulation both contralateral and ipsilateral to the moving arm. Thus, the probability of initiating a pending movement is altered by perturbation of SMA activity. However, changes in initiation probability are independent of the balance of internal and external factors that establish the baseline initiation probability.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The role of the supplementary motor area (SMA) in initiating movement remains unclear. Lesion experiments suggest that SMA makes a critical contribution only for self-initiated movements. Yet SMA is active before movements made under a range of contexts, suggesting a less-specialized role in movement initiation. Here, we use microstimulation to probe the role of SMA across a range of behavioral contexts that vary in the degree to which movement onset is influenced by external cues. We demonstrate that microstimulation produces a temporally stereotyped change in the probability of initiation that is independent of context. These results argue that SMA participates in the computations that lead to movement initiation and does so across a variety of contexts.", "Keywords": ["macaque", "microstimulation", "reaching", "supplementary motor area"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Electric Stimulation", "Functional Laterality", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Motor Cortex", "Movement", "Psychomotor Performance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Zimnik", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience."}, {"First Name": "Antonio H", "Last Name": "Lara", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience."}, {"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, mc3502@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Apr24"}, {"PMID": "30132759", "Title": "Conservation of preparatory neural events in monkey motor cortex regardless of how movement is initiated.", "Abstract": "A time-consuming preparatory stage is hypothesized to precede voluntary movement.

The advent of large-scale population recordings affords the opportunity to do so in new ways, with the hope of distinguishing between potential explanations for why responses vary with time. We introduce a method that assesses a basic but previously unexplored form of population-level structure: when data contain responses across multiple neurons, conditions, and times, they are naturally expressed as a third-order tensor. We examined tensor structure for multiple datasets from primary visual cortex (V1) and primary motor cortex (M1). All V1 datasets were 'simplest' (there were relatively few degrees of freedom) along the neuron mode, while all M1 datasets were simplest along the condition mode. These differences could not be inferred from surface-level response features. Formal considerations suggest why tensor structure might differ across modes. For idealized linear models, structure is simplest across the neuron mode when responses reflect external variables, and simplest across the condition mode when responses reflect population dynamics. This same pattern was present for existing models that seek to explain motor cortex responses. Critically, only dynamical models displayed tensor structure that agreed with the empirical M1 data.

We considered the prediction, derived from formal considerations, that the transition from preparation to movement might be accompanied by a large overall change in the neural state that reflects when movement is made rather than which movement is made. Specifically, we examined \"components\" of the population response: time-varying patterns of activity from which each neuron's response is approximately composed. Amid the response complexity of individual M1 and PMd neurons, we identified robust response components that were \"condition-invariant\": their magnitude and time course were nearly identical regardless of reach direction or path. These condition-invariant response components occupied dimensions orthogonal to those occupied by the \"tuned\" response components. The largest condition-invariant component was much larger than any of the tuned components; i.e., it explained more of the structure in individual-neuron responses. This condition-invariant response component underwent a rapid change before movement onset. The timing of that change predicted most of the trial-by-trial variance in reaction time. Thus, although individual M1 and PMd neurons essentially always reflected which movement was made, the largest component of the population response reflected movement timing rather than movement type.", "Keywords": ["condition-invariant signal", "dPCA", "movement initiation", "movement triggering", "reaction time", "state space"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Arm", "Electromyography", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Microelectrodes", "Motor Activity", "Motor Cortex", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Neurons", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Reaction Time", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew T", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "Neurosciences Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey S", "Last Name": "Seely", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sussillo", "Affiliation": "Neurosciences Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305."}, {"First Name": "Stephen I", "Last Name": "Ryu", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Department of Neurosurgery, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Palo Alto, California 94301."}, {"First Name": "Krishna V", "Last Name": "Shenoy", "Affiliation": "Neurosciences Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305."}, {"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience; Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind, David Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior Research, Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "eNeuro", "PubDate": "2016Jul-Aug"}, {"PMID": "26220660", "Title": "Single-trial dynamics of motor cortex and their applications to brain-machine interfaces.", "Abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that neural population responses have their own internal drive, or dynamics, that describe how the neural population evolves through time. An important prediction of neural dynamical models is that previously observed neural activity is informative of noisy yet-to-be-observed activity on single-trials, and may thus have a denoising effect. To investigate this prediction, we built and characterized dynamical models of single-trial motor cortical activity. We find these models capture salient dynamical features of the neural population and are informative of future neural activity on single trials. To assess how neural dynamics may beneficially denoise single-trial neural activity, we incorporate neural dynamics into a brain-machine interface (BMI). In online experiments, we find that a neural dynamical BMI achieves substantially higher performance than its non-dynamical counterpart.

Models had to infer dynamics that could transform simple inputs into temporally and spatially complex patterns of muscle activity. Analysis of trained models revealed that the natural dynamical solution was a low-dimensional oscillator that generated the necessary multiphasic commands. This solution closely resembled, at both the single-neuron and population levels, what was observed in neural recordings from the same monkeys.

Often it is assumed that single-neuron responses reflect a preference for a particular movement or movement variable. It may be further assumed that movement is generated by (or at least accompanied by) a growing population-level preference for the relevant movement. This view has been attractive because it provides a canonical form for the single neuron, a link between preparatory and movement activity, a way of interpreting the population response, and a platform for designing analyses and couching hypotheses. However, this traditional view yields predictions that are at odds with basic features of the data. We discuss an alternative simplified model, in which outgoing commands are produced by dynamics that generate different output patterns as a function of the initial preparatory state. For reaching tasks, we hypothesized simple quasioscillatory dynamics because they provide a natural basis set for the empirical patterns of muscle activity. The predictions of the dynamical model match the data well at both the single-neuron and population levels, and the quasioscillatory patterns explain many of the otherwise odd features of the neural responses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Motor Activity", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark M", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind, David Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior Research, Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032 mc3502@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind, Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Institute for Data Science and Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}], "Journal": "Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24487233", "Title": "Cortical activity in the null space: permitting preparation without movement.", "Abstract": "Neural circuits must perform computations and then selectively output the results to other circuits.

Muscle activity is some readout of neural activity, yet it remains largely unchanged during preparation. Here we find that during preparation, while the monkey holds still, changes in motor cortical activity cancel out at the level of these population readouts. Motor cortex can thereby prepare the movement without prematurely causing it.
