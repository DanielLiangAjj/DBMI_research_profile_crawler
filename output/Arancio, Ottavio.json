[{"PMID": "38949671", "Title": "Adult-onset deactivation of autophagy leads to loss of synapse homeostasis and cognitive impairment, with implications for alzheimer disease.", "Abstract": "A growing number of studies link dysfunction of macroautophagy/autophagy to the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Given the global importance of autophagy for homeostasis, how its dysfunction can lead to specific neurological changes is puzzling. To examine this further, we compared the global deactivation of autophagy in the adult mouse using the atg7iKO with the impact of AD-associated pathogenic changes in autophagic processing of synaptic proteins. Isolated forebrain synaptosomes, rather than total homogenates, from atg7iKO mice demonstrated accumulation of synaptic proteins, suggesting that the synapse might be a vulnerable site for protein homeostasis disruption. Moreover, the deactivation of autophagy resulted in impaired cognitive performance over time, whereas gross locomotor skills remained intact. Despite deactivation of autophagy for 6.5\u2009weeks, changes in cognition were in the absence of cell death or synapse loss. In the symptomatic APP PSEN1 double-transgenic mouse model of AD, we found that the impairment in autophagosome maturation coupled with diminished presence of discrete synaptic proteins in autophagosomes isolated from these mice, leading to the accumulation of one of these proteins in the detergent insoluble protein fraction. This protein, SLC17A7/Vglut, also accumulated in atg7iKO mouse synaptosomes. Taken together, we conclude that synaptic autophagy plays a role in maintaining protein homeostasis, and that while decreasing autophagy interrupts normal cognitive function, the preservation of locomotion suggests that not all circuits are affected similarly. Our data suggest that the disruption of autophagic activity in AD may have relevance for the cognitive impairment in this adult-onset neurodegenerative disease.

In the present review, we discuss recent literature regarding the neurotoxic role of both A\u03b2 and Tau in AD, as well as their physiological function in the healthy brain. Consequently, we present studies suggesting that A\u03b2 and Tau act independently of each other in mediating neurotoxicity in AD, thereafter, re-evaluating the \"Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis\" that places Tau pathology downstream of A\u03b2. More recent studies have confirmed that both A\u03b2 and Tau could propagate the disease and induce synaptic and memory impairments via the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This finding is not only interesting from a mechanistic point of view since it provides better insights into the AD pathogenesis but also from a therapeutic point of view since it renders APP a common downstream effector for both A\u03b2 and Tau.

Astrocytes greatly internalize ex-oTau whose intracellular accumulation alters neuro/gliotransmitter handling thereby negatively affecting synaptic function. Both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are required for oTau internalization in astrocytes but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been clearly identified yet. Here we found that a specific antibody anti-glypican 4 (GPC4), a receptor belonging to the HSPG family, significantly reduced oTau uploading from astrocytes and prevented oTau-induced alterations of Ca2+-dependent gliotransmitter release. As such, anti-GPC4 spared neurons co-cultured with astrocytes from the astrocyte-mediated synaptotoxic action of ex-oTau, thus preserving synaptic vesicular release, synaptic protein expression and hippocampal LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses. Of note, the expression of GPC4 depended on APP and, in particular, on its C-terminal domain, AICD, that we found to bind Gpc4 promoter. Accordingly, GPC4 expression was significantly reduced in mice in which either APP was knocked-out or it contained the non-phosphorylatable amino acid alanine replacing threonine 688, thus becoming unable to produce AICD.

However, the mechanism of the spreading of \u03b2-amyloid action within a specific circuitry has not been elucidated yet. We have previously demonstrated that the motion of microglia-derived large extracellular vesicles carrying \u03b2-amyloid, at the neuronal surface, is crucial for the initiation and propagation of synaptic dysfunction along the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. Here, using chronic EEG recordings, we show that a single injection of extracellular vesicles carrying \u03b2-amyloid into the mouse entorhinal cortex could trigger alterations in the cortical and hippocampal activity that are reminiscent of those found in Alzheimer's disease mouse models and human patients. The development of EEG abnormalities was associated with progressive memory impairment as assessed by an associative (object-place context recognition) and non-associative (object recognition) task. Importantly, when the motility of extracellular vesicles, carrying \u03b2-amyloid, was inhibited, the effect on network stability and memory function was significantly reduced.

However, how it starts and propagates is unknown. Here we show that amyloid-\u03b2 released by microglia in association with large extracellular vesicles (A\u03b2-EVs) alters dendritic spine morphology in vitro, at the site of neuron interaction, and impairs synaptic plasticity both in vitro and in vivo in the entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus circuitry. One hour after A\u03b2-EV injection into the mouse entorhinal cortex, long-term potentiation was impaired in the entorhinal cortex but not in the dentate gyrus, its main target region, while 24\u2005h later it was also impaired in the dentate gyrus, revealing a spreading of long-term potentiation deficit between the two regions. Similar results were obtained upon injection of extracellular vesicles carrying A\u03b2 naturally secreted by CHO7PA2 cells, while neither A\u03b242 alone nor inflammatory extracellular vesicles devoid of A\u03b2 were able to propagate long-term potentiation impairment. Using optical tweezers combined to time-lapse imaging to study A\u03b2-EV-neuron interaction, we show that A\u03b2-EVs move anterogradely at the axon surface and that their motion can be blocked through annexin-V coating. Importantly, when A\u03b2-EV motility was inhibited, no propagation of long-term potentiation deficit occurred along the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, implicating large extracellular vesicle motion at the neuron surface in the spreading of long-term potentiation impairment.

To validate this hypothesis, we studied the age-dependent phenotype of \u03b17 knock out mice.

We found previously that transgenic overexpression of the PP2A methylesterase, PME-1, or the PP2A methyltransferase, LCMT-1, altered the sensitivity of mice to A\u03b2-induced impairments, suggesting that PME-1 inhibition may be an effective approach for preventing or treating these impairments. To explore this possibility, we examined the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of acutely applied synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers in male and female mice heterozygous for either a PME-1 KO or an LCMT-1 gene-trap mutation. We found that heterozygous PME-1 KO mice were resistant to A\u03b2-induced impairments in cognition and synaptic plasticity, whereas LCMT-1 gene-trap mice showed increased sensitivity to A\u03b2-induced impairments. The heterozygous PME-1 KO mice produced normal levels of endogenous A\u03b2 and exhibited normal electrophysiological responses to picomolar concentrations of A\u03b2, suggesting that reduced PME-1 expression in these animals protects against A\u03b2-induced impairments without impacting normal physiological A\u03b2 functions. Together, these data provide additional support for roles for PME-1 and LCMT-1 in regulating sensitivity to A\u03b2-induced impairments, and suggest that inhibition of PME-1 may constitute a viable therapeutic approach for selectively protecting against the pathologic actions of A\u03b2 in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Elevated levels of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in the brain are thought to contribute to the cognitive impairments observed in Alzheimer's disease patients.

In the central nervous system, the NO dual nature in neuroprotection and neurotoxicity has been explored to unveil its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A growing body of research shows that the activation of the NO signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic adenine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB) (so-called NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway) ameliorates altered neuroplasticity and memory deficits in AD animal models. In addition to NO donors, several other pharmacological agents, such as phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have been used to activate the pathway and rescue memory disorders. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, are marketed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and arterial pulmonary hypertension due to their vasodilatory properties. The ability of PDE5 inhibitors to interfere with the NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway by increasing the levels of cGMP has prompted the hypothesis that PDE5 inhibition might be used as an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. To this end, newly designed PDE5 inhibitors belonging to different chemical classes with improved pharmacologic profile (e.g. higher potency, improved selectivity, and blood-brain barrier penetration) have been synthesized and evaluated in several animal models of AD. In addition, recent medicinal chemistry effort has led to the development of agents concurrently acting on the PDE5 enzyme and a second target involved in AD. Both marketed and investigational PDE5 inhibitors have shown to reverse cognitive defects in young and aged wild type mice as well as transgenic mouse models of AD and tauopathy using a variety of behavioral tasks. These studies confirmed the therapeutic potential of PDE5 inhibitors as cognitive enhancers. However, clinical studies assessing cognitive functions using marketed PDE5 inhibitors have not been conclusive. Drug discovery efforts by our group and others are currently directed towards the development of novel PDE5 inhibitors tailored to AD with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. In summary, the present perspective reports an overview of the correlation between the NO signaling and AD, as well as an outline of the PDE5 inhibitors used as an alternative approach in altering the NO pathway leading to an improvement of learning and memory.

Such patients are immunocompetent, have low peripheral and brain HIV burdens, and show minimal brain neuropathology. Using the model of HIV-related memory impairment in EcoHIV-infected conventional mice, we investigated the neurobiological and cognitive consequences of efficient EcoHIV expression in the mouse brain after intracerebral infection. HIV integrated and persisted in an expressed state in brain tissue, was detectable in brain monocytic cells, and caused neuroinflammatory responses and lasting spatial, working, and associative memory impairment. Systemic antiretroviral treatment prevented direct brain infection and memory dysfunction indicating the requirement for HIV expression in the brain for disease. Similarly inoculated murine leukemia virus used as a control replicated in mouse brain but not in monocytic cells and was cognitively benign, linking the disease to HIV-specific functions. Memory impairment correlated in real time with hippocampal dysfunction shown by defective long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices ex vivo and with diffuse synaptodendritic injury in the hippocampus reflected in significant reduction in microtubule-associated protein 2 and synapsin II staining. In contrast, there was no evidence of overt neuronal loss in this region as determined by neuron-specific nuclear protein quantification, TUNEL assay, and histological observations. Our results reveal a novel capacity of HIV to induce neuronal dysfunction and memory impairment independent of neurotoxicity, distinct from the neurotoxicity of HIV infection in dementia.IMPORTANCE HIV neuropathogenesis has been attributed in large measure to neurotoxicity of viral proteins and inflammatory factors produced by infected monocytic cells in the brain. We show here that HIV expression in mouse brain causes lasting memory impairment by a mechanism involving injury to hippocampal synaptodendritic arbors and neuronal function but not overt neuronal loss in the region. Our results mirror the observation of minimal neurodegeneration in cognitively impaired HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy and demonstrate that HIV is nonneurotoxic in certain brain abnormalities that it causes.

To address this question, we studied the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying the neuromodulatory action of picomolar amounts of oligomeric A\u03b242 (oA\u03b242) on synaptic glutamatergic function in male and female mice. We found that 200 pm oA\u03b242 induces an increase of frequency of miniature EPSCs and a decrease of paired pulse facilitation, associated with an increase in docked vesicle number, indicating that it augments neurotransmitter release at presynaptic level. oA\u03b242 also produced postsynaptic changes as shown by an increased length of postsynaptic density, accompanied by an increased expression of plasticity-related proteins such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein phosphorylated at Ser133, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylated at Thr286, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting a role for A\u03b2 in synaptic tagging. These changes resulted in the conversion of early into late long-term potentiation through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G intracellular cascade consistent with a cGMP-dependent switch from short- to long-term memory observed in vivo after intrahippocampal administration of picomolar amounts of oA\u03b242 These effects were present upon extracellular but not intracellular application of the peptide and involved \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

glucosylceramidase beta/\u03b2-glucocerebrosidase, comprise the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD), but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Here, we show that in GbaL444P/WT knockin mice, the L444P heterozygous Gba mutation triggers mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting autophagy and mitochondrial priming, two steps critical for the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy, a process known as mitophagy. In SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, the overexpression of L444P GBA impeded mitochondrial priming and autophagy induction when endogenous lysosomal GBA activity remained intact. By contrast, genetic depletion of GBA inhibited lysosomal clearance of autophagic cargo. The link between heterozygous GBA mutations and impaired mitophagy was corroborated in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations, where we found increased mitochondrial content, mitochondria oxidative stress and impaired autophagy. Our findings thus suggest a mechanistic basis for mitochondrial dysfunction associated with GBA heterozygous mutations.

Macrophages are persistently infected with HIV but their role as HIV reservoirs in vivo has not been fully explored.

EcoHIV established latent reservoirs in CD4+ T lymphocytes in chronically-infected mice but could be induced by epigenetic modulators ex vivo and in mice. In contrast, macrophages expressed EcoHIV constitutively in mice for up to 16 months; murine leukemia virus (MLV), the donor of gp80 envelope in EcoHIV, did not infect macrophages. Both EcoHIV and MLV were found in brain tissue of infected mice but only EcoHIV induced NCI. Murine HIV-NCI was prevented by antiretroviral prophylaxis but once established neither persistent EcoHIV infection in mice nor NCI could be reversed by long-acting antiretroviral therapy.

It posits that the increase of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is the key event in AD that triggers tau pathology followed by neuronal death and eventually, the disease. However, therapeutic approaches aimed at decreasing A\u03b2 levels have so far failed, and tau-based clinical trials have not yet produced positive findings. This begs the question of whether the hypothesis is correct. Here we have examined literature on the role of A\u03b2 and tau in synaptic dysfunction, memory loss, and seeding and spreading of AD, highlighting important parallelisms between the two proteins in all of these phenomena.

We manipulate the rate of Akt stimulation by employing knock-in mice expressing a mutant form of PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) with reduced, but not abolished, ability to activate Akt. We found increased membrane localization and activity of the TACE/ADAM17 \u03b1-secretase in the brain of the PDK1 mutant mice with concomitant TNFR1 processing, which provided neurons with resistance against TNF\u03b1-induced neurotoxicity.

However, whether and how RAGE regulates A\u03b2 metabolism remains largely unknown. A\u03b2 formation arises from aberrant cleavage of amyloid pre-cursor protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase. To investigate whether RAGE modulates \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase activity potentiating A\u03b2 formation, we generated mAPP mice with genetic deletion of RAGE (mAPP/RO). These mice displayed reduced cerebral amyloid pathology, inhibited aberrant APP-A\u03b2 metabolism by reducing \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases activity, and attenuated impairment of learning and memory compared with mAPP mice. Similarly, RAGE signal transduction deficient mAPP mice (mAPP/DN-RAGE) exhibited the reduction in A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 production and decreased \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretase activity compared with mAPP mice. Furthermore, RAGE-deficient mAPP brain revealed suppression of activation of p38 MAP kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2). Finally, RAGE siRNA-mediated gene silencing or DN-RAGE-mediated signaling deficiency in the enriched human APP neuronal cells demonstrated suppression of activation of GSK3\u03b2, accompanied with reduction in A\u03b2 levels and decrease in \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases activity. Our findings highlight that RAGE-dependent signaling pathway regulates \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase cleavage of APP to generate A\u03b2, at least in part through activation of GSK3\u03b2 and p38 MAP kinase.

amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) have been related to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, in the healthy brain, low physiologically relevant concentrations of A\u03b2 are necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Because cGMP plays a key role in these processes, here we investigated whether the cyclic nucleotide cGMP influences A\u03b2 levels and function during LTP and memory. We demonstrate that the increase of cGMP levels by the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors sildenafil and vardenafil induces a parallel release of A\u03b2 due to a change in the approximation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1. Moreover, electrophysiological and behavioral studies performed on animals of both sexes showed that blocking A\u03b2 function, by using anti-murine A\u03b2 antibodies or APP knock-out mice, prevents the cGMP-dependent enhancement of LTP and memory. Our data suggest that cGMP positively regulates A\u03b2 levels in the healthy brain which, in turn, boosts synaptic plasticity and memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is a key pathogenetic factor in Alzheimer's disease. However, low concentrations of endogenous A\u03b2, mimicking levels of the peptide in the healthy brain, enhance hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Because the second messenger cGMP exerts a central role in LTP mechanisms, here we studied whether cGMP affects A\u03b2 levels and function during LTP. We show that cGMP enhances A\u03b2 production by increasing the APP/BACE-1 convergence in endolysosomal compartments. Moreover, the cGMP-induced enhancement of LTP and memory was disrupted by blockade of A\u03b2, suggesting that the physiological effect of the cyclic nucleotide on LTP and memory is dependent upon A\u03b2.", "Keywords": ["APP", "amyloid beta", "cGMP", "long-term potentiation", "memory", "synaptic plasticity"], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cyclic GMP", "Hippocampus", "Long-Term Potentiation", "Male", "Memory", "Mental Recall", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Agostino", "Last Name": "Palmeri", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, Section of Physiology, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Roberta", "Last Name": "Ricciarelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of General Pathology, School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Walter", "Last Name": "Gulisano", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, Section of Physiology, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Rivera", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of General Pathology, School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Rebosio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Section of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Genoa, 16148 Genoa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Calcagno", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of General Pathology, School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Maria Rosaria", "Last Name": "Tropea", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, Section of Physiology, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Conti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology & The Taub Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Utpal", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093."}, {"First Name": "Subhojit", "Last Name": "Roy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093."}, {"First Name": "Maria Adelaide", "Last Name": "Pronzato", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Medicine, Section of General Pathology, School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology & The Taub Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ernesto", "Last Name": "Fedele", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Section of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Genoa, 16148 Genoa, Italy, danypuzzo@yahoo.it fedele@difar.unige.it."}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Puzzo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Sciences, Section of Physiology, University of Catania, 95123 Catania, Italy, danypuzzo@yahoo.it fedele@difar.unige.it."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2017Jul19"}, {"PMID": "28519902", "Title": "Reduced gliotransmitter release from astrocytes mediates tau-induced synaptic dysfunction in cultured hippocampal neurons.", "Abstract": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein exerting several physiological functions in neurons.

Inhibition of type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4) and elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to treat cognitive deficits. However, PDE4 exists in several isoforms and pan inhibitors cannot be used in humans due to severe emesis. Here, we present GEBR-32a, a new PDE4D full inhibitor that has been characterized both in vitro and in vivo using biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioural analyses. GEBR-32a efficiently enhances cAMP in neuronal cultures and hippocampal slices. In vivo pharmacokinetic analysis shows that GEBR-32a is rapidly distributed within the central nervous system with a very favourable brain/blood ratio. Specific behavioural tests (object location and Y-maze continuous alternation tasks) demonstrate that this PDE4D inhibitor is able to enhance memory in AD transgenic mice and concomitantly rescues their hippocampal long-term potentiation deficit. Of great relevance, our preliminary toxicological analysis indicates that GEBR-32a is not cytotoxic and genotoxic, and does not seem to possess emetic-like side effects.

PP2A is regulated by protein methylation, and impaired PP2A methylation is thought to contribute to increased AD risk in hyperhomocysteinemic individuals. To examine further the link between PP2A and AD, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress the PP2A methylesterase, protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), or the PP2A methyltransferase, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 (LCMT-1), and examined the sensitivity of these animals to behavioral and electrophysiological impairments caused by exogenous A\u03b2 exposure.

Acute cGKII inhibition significantly reduces LTP, whereas cGKII KO mice show no LTP impairment. Significantly, the closely related kinase, cGKI, does not compensate for cGKII KO. Here, we describe a previously unidentified pathway in the KO hippocampus that provides functional compensation for the LTP impairment observed when cGKII is acutely inhibited. We found that in cultured cGKII KO hippocampal neurons, cGKII-dependent phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors was decreased, reducing cytoplasmic Ca(2+) signals. This led to a reduction of calcineurin activity, thereby stabilizing GluA1 phosphorylation and promoting synaptic expression of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs, which in turn induced a previously unidentified form of LTP as a compensatory response in the KO hippocampus. Calcineurin-dependent Ca(2+)-permeable AMPAR expression observed here is also used during activity-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity.

Stress kinases are of special interest in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders due to their involvement in synaptic dysfunction and complex disease susceptibility. Clinical and preclinical evidence implicates the stress related kinase p38\u03b1MAPK as a potential neurotherapeutic target, but isoform selective p38\u03b1MAPK inhibitor candidates are lacking and the mixed kinase inhibitor drugs that are promising in peripheral tissue disease indications have limitations for neurologic indications. Therefore, pursuit of the neurotherapeutic hypothesis requires kinase isoform selective inhibitors with appropriate neuropharmacology features. Synaptic dysfunction disorders offer a potential for enhanced pharmacological efficacy due to stress-induced activation of p38\u03b1MAPK in both neurons and glia, the interacting cellular components of the synaptic pathophysiological axis, to be modulated. We report a novel isoform selective p38\u03b1MAPK inhibitor, MW01-18-150SRM (=MW150), that is efficacious in suppression of hippocampal-dependent associative and spatial memory deficits in two distinct synaptic dysfunction mouse models.

Motivated by this reality, many laboratories (including our own) have focused on synaptic dysfunction in AD because synaptic changes are highly correlated with the severity of clinical dementia. In particular, memory formation is accompanied by altered synaptic strength, and this phenomenon (and its dysfunction in AD) has been a recent focus for many laboratories. The molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) is at a central converging point of pathways and mechanisms activated during the processes of synaptic strengthening and memory formation, as CREB phosphorylation leads to transcription of memory-associated genes. Disruption of these mechanisms in AD results in a reduction of CREB activation with accompanying memory impairment. Thus, it is likely that strategies aimed at these mechanisms will lead to future therapies for AD. In this review, we will summarize literature that investigates 5 possible therapeutic pathways for rescuing synaptic dysfunction in AD: 4 enzymatic pathways that lead to CREB phosphorylation (the cyclic adenosine monophosphate cascade, the serine/threonine kinases extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2, the nitric oxide cascade, and the calpains), as well as histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (2 enzymes that regulate the histone acetylation necessary for gene transcription).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Humans", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Russell E", "Last Name": "Nicholls", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Puzzo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jole", "Last Name": "Fiorito", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosa", "Last Name": "Purgatorio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mauro", "Last Name": "Fa'", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "PubDate": "2015Jan"}, {"PMID": "25448527", "Title": "Regulation of synaptic plasticity and cognition by SUMO in normal physiology and Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Learning and memory and the underlying cellular correlate, long-term synaptic plasticity, involve regulation by posttranslational modifications (PTMs).

Synaptic binding of Abeta oligomers to several putative receptor proteins is reported to inhibit long-term potentiation, affect membrane trafficking and induce reversible spine loss in neurons, leading to impaired cognitive performance and ultimately to anterograde amnesia in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have identified a receptor not previously associated with AD that mediates the binding of Abeta oligomers to neurons, and describe novel therapeutic antagonists of this receptor capable of blocking Abeta toxic effects on synapses in vitro and cognitive deficits in vivo. Knockdown of sigma-2/PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) protein expression in vitro using siRNA results in a highly correlated reduction in binding of exogenous Abeta oligomers to neurons of more than 90%. Expression of sigma-2/PGRMC1 is upregulated in vitro by treatment with Abeta oligomers, and is dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease patients' brain compared to age-matched, normal individuals. Specific, high affinity small molecule receptor antagonists and antibodies raised against specific regions on this receptor can displace synthetic Abeta oligomer binding to synaptic puncta in vitro and displace endogenous human AD patient oligomers from brain tissue sections in a dose-dependent manner.

Alterations in membrane trafficking induced by Abeta oligomers mediates reduction in neuronal surface receptor expression that is the basis for inhibition of electrophysiological measures of synaptic plasticity and thus learning and memory. We have utilized phenotypic screens in mature, in vitro cultures of rat brain cells to identify small molecules which block or prevent the binding and effects of Abeta oligomers. Synthetic Abeta oligomers bind saturably to a single site on neuronal synapses and induce deficits in membrane trafficking in neuronal cultures with an EC50 that corresponds to its binding affinity. The therapeutic lead compounds we have found are pharmacological antagonists of Abeta oligomers, reducing the binding of Abeta oligomers to neurons in vitro, preventing spine loss in neurons and preventing and treating oligomer-induced deficits in membrane trafficking. These molecules are highly brain penetrant and prevent and restore cognitive deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Counter-screening these compounds against a broad panel of potential CNS targets revealed they are highly potent and specific ligands of the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor. Brain concentrations of the compounds corresponding to greater than 80% receptor occupancy at the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor restore cognitive function in transgenic hAPP Swe/Ldn mice. These studies demonstrate that synthetic and human-derived Abeta oligomers act as pharmacologically-behaved ligands at neuronal receptors--i.e. they exhibit saturable binding to a target, they exert a functional effect related to their binding and their displacement by small molecule antagonists blocks their functional effect.

We assessed the effects of NTR1 on neuronal excitability, membrane ion channel activity, and synaptic plasticity in acute hippocampal slices by combining electrophysiological extracellular and intracellular recording techniques. We found that NTR1 increased the membrane excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices by lowering the spike threshold possibly through a mechanism involving in the inhibition of voltage-gated K(+) currents.

Reducing spontaneous firing activity with 10 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) abolished the protective effect of NTR1 against A\u03b2-induced LTP impairment.

Disruption of autophagy leads to buildup of incompletely digested substrates, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide accumulation in vacuoles and cell death. A\u03b2, in turn, has been found to affect autophagy. Thus, A\u03b2 might be part of a loop in which it is both the substrate of altered autophagy and its cause. Given the relevance of different soluble forms of A\u03b21-42 in AD, we have investigated whether monomers and oligomers of the peptide have a differential role in causing altered autophagy and cell death. Using differentiated SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, we found that monomers hamper the formation of the autophagic BCL2-BECN1/Beclin 1 complex and activate the MAPK8/JNK1-MAPK9/JNK2 pathway phosphorylating BCL2. Monomers also inhibit apoptosis and allow autophagy with intracellular accumulation of autophagosomes and elevation of levels of BECN1 and LC3-II, resulting in an inhibition of substrate degradation due to an inhibitory action on lysosomal activity. Oligomers, in turn, favor the formation of the BCL2-BECN1 complex favoring apoptosis. In addition, they cause a less profound increase in BECN1 and LC3-II levels than monomers without affecting the autophagic flux.

We assayed the developmental progression of various properties, including resting membrane potential, action potential, sodium and potassium channel currents, somatic calcium transients and synaptic activity. During the maturation of iPSC-derived neurons, the resting membrane potential became more negative, the expression of voltage-gated sodium channels increased, the membrane became capable of generating action potentials following adequate depolarization and, at day 48-55, 50% of the cells were capable of firing action potentials in response to a prolonged depolarizing current step, of which 30% produced multiple action potentials. The percentage of cells exhibiting miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents increased over time with a significant increase in their frequency and amplitude. These changes were associated with an increase of Ca2+ transient frequency. Co-culturing iPSC-derived neurons with mouse glial cells enhanced the development of electrophysiological parameters as compared to pure iPSC-derived neuronal cultures.

Histopathologically, AD features insoluble aggregates of two proteins in the brain, amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and the microtubule-associated protein tau, both of which have been linked to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). A large body of research has elucidated many of the molecular and cellular pathways that underlie AD, including those involving the abnormal A\u03b2 and tau aggregates. However, a full understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease has remained elusive. Consequently, there are currently no effective therapeutic options that can modify the disease progression and slow or stop the decline of cognitive functioning. As part of the effort to address this lacking, there needs a better understanding of the signaling pathways that become impaired under AD pathology, including the regulatory mechanisms that normally control those networks. One such mechanism involves SUMOylation, which is a post-translational modification (PTM) that is involved in regulating many aspects of cell biology and has also been found to have several critical neuron-specific roles. Early studies have indicated that the SUMO system is likely altered with AD-type pathology, which may impact A\u03b2 levels and tau aggregation. Although still a relatively unexplored topic, SUMOylation will likely emerge as a significant factor in AD pathogenesis in ways which may be somewhat analogous to other regulatory PTMs such as phosphorylation. Thus, in addition to the upstream effects on tau and A\u03b2 processing, there may also be downstream effects mediated by A\u03b2 aggregates or other AD-related factors on SUMO-regulated signaling pathways. Multiple proteins that have functions relevant to AD pathology have been identified as SUMO substrates, including those involved in synaptic physiology, mitochondrial dynamics, and inflammatory signaling. Ongoing studies will determine how these SUMO-regulated functions in neurons and glial cells may be impacted by A\u03b2 and AD pathology. Here, we present a review of the current literature on the involvement of SUMO in AD, as well as an overview of the SUMOylated proteins and pathways that are potentially dysregulated with AD pathogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Humans", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Signal Transduction", "Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins", "Sumoylation", "Synapses", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, 630W 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mikako", "Last Name": "Sakurai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shinsuke", "Last Name": "Matsuzaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Fraser", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuromolecular medicine", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}, {"PMID": "23948929", "Title": "Picomolar amyloid-\u03b2 peptides enhance spontaneous astrocyte calcium transients.", "Abstract": "Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides are constitutively produced in the brain throughout life via mechanisms that can be regulated by synaptic activity.

We previously discovered that physiologically-relevant, low picomolar amounts of A\u03b2 can enhance synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent cognition in mice. In this study, we demonstrated that astrocytes are cellular candidates for participating in this type of A\u03b2 signaling. Using calcium imaging of primary astrocyte cultures, we observed that picomolar amounts of A\u03b2 peptides can enhance spontaneous intracellular calcium transient signaling. After application of 200 pM A\u03b242 peptides, the frequency and amplitude averages of spontaneous cytosolic calcium transients were significantly increased. These effects were dependent on \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17-nAChRs), as the enhancement effects were blocked by a pharmacological \u03b17-nAChR inhibitor and in astrocytes from an \u03b17 deficient mouse strain. We additionally examined evoked intercellular calcium wave signaling but did not detect significant picomolar A\u03b2-induced alterations in propagation parameters. Overall, these results indicate that at a physiologically-relevant low picomolar concentration, A\u03b2 peptides can enhance spontaneous astrocyte calcium transient signaling via \u03b17-nAChRs.

Further, prevailing assumptions raise concerns about whether single kinase inhibitors can show in vivo efficacy for CNS pathologies, and debates over viable approaches to the development of safe and efficacious kinase inhibitors are unsettled. It is critical, therefore, that these scientific challenges be addressed in order to test hypotheses about protein kinases in neuropathology progression and the potential for in vivo modulation of their catalytic activity. Identification of molecular targets whose in vivo modulation can attenuate synaptic dysfunction would provide a foundation for future disease-modifying therapeutic development as well as insight into cellular mechanisms. Clinical and preclinical studies suggest a critical link between synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders and the activation of p38\u03b1MAPK mediated signaling cascades. Activation in both neurons and glia also offers the unusual potential to generate enhanced responses through targeting a single kinase in two distinct cell types involved in pathology progression. However, target validation has been limited by lack of highly selective inhibitors amenable to in vivo use in the CNS. Therefore, we employed high-resolution co-crystallography and pharmacoinformatics to design and develop a novel synthetic, active site targeted, CNS-active, p38\u03b1MAPK inhibitor (MW108). Selectivity was demonstrated by large-scale kinome screens, functional GPCR agonist and antagonist analyses of off-target potential, and evaluation of cellular target engagement.

The age-related changes in behaviour and dendritic spine density observed in these mice are absent when they lack caspase-2, in spite of similar levels of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition and inflammation. A similar degree of protection is observed in cultured hippocampal neurons lacking caspase-2, which are immune to the synaptotoxic effects of A\u03b2. Our studies suggest that caspase-2 is a critical mediator in the activation of the RhoA/ROCK-II signalling pathway, leading to the collapse of dendritic spines. We propose that this is controlled by an inactive caspase-2/RhoA/ROCK-II complex localized in dendrites, which dissociates in the presence of A\u03b2, allowing for their activation and entry in the spine.
