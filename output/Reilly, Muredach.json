[{"PMID": "38753486", "Title": "linc-ADAIN, a human adipose lincRNA, regulates adipogenesis by modulating KLF5 and IL-8 mRNA stability.", "Abstract": "Adipose tissue remodeling and dysfunction, characterized by elevated inflammation and insulin resistance, play a central role in obesity-related development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are important regulators of cellular functions. Here, we describe the functions of linc-ADAIN (adipose anti-inflammatory), an adipose lincRNA that is downregulated in white adipose tissue of obese humans. We demonstrate that linc-ADAIN knockdown (KD) increases KLF5 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) mRNA stability and translation by interacting with IGF2BP2. Upregulation of KLF5 and IL-8, via linc-ADAIN KD, leads to an enhanced adipogenic program and adipose tissue inflammation, mirroring the obese state, in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. KD of linc-ADAIN in human adipose stromal cell (ASC) hTERT adipocytes implanted into mice increases adipocyte size and macrophage infiltration compared to implanted control adipocytes, mimicking hallmark features of obesity-induced adipose tissue remodeling. linc-ADAIN is an anti-inflammatory lincRNA that limits adipose tissue expansion and lipid storage.", "Keywords": ["CP: Metabolism", "CP: Molecular biology", "HuR", "IGF2BP2", "IL-8", "KLF5", "adipogenesis", "linc-ADAIN", "linc-DMRT2", "linc01230", "long non-coding RNA", "obesity"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Adipogenesis", "Animals", "RNA Stability", "Interleukin-8", "Mice", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Adipocytes", "Adipose Tissue", "Obesity", "RNA, Messenger", "Male", "Inflammation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marcella E", "Last Name": "O'Reilly", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Johana", "Last Name": "Coronel", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lucie", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eunyoung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Esther", "Last Name": "Cynn", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caio V", "Last Name": "Matias", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh Kumar", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iuliana", "Last Name": "Ionita-Laza", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leila", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yiying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Corvera", "Affiliation": "Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan K", "Last Name": "Fried", "Affiliation": "Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

(ASA) and septal myectomy (SM) are 2 options for septal reduction therapy (SRT) to treat medication-resistant symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Because differences in mortality rates after these different SRT methods have not been extensively investigated in real-world settings, in this study compared the 1-year mortality rates after ASA and SM using population-based database. Methods\u2004and\u2004Results: Utilizing New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) data from 2005 to 2016, we performed a comparative effectiveness study of ASA vs. SM in patients with HCM. The outcome was all-cause death up to 360 days after SRT. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model and performed sensitivity analysis with propensity score (PS)-matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methods. We identified 755 patients with HCM who underwent SRT: 348 with ASA and 407 with SM. The multivariable analysis showed that all-cause deaths were significantly fewer in the ASA group at 360 days after SRT (adjusted odds ratio=0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.84; P=0.02). The PS-matching and IPTW methods also supported a lower mortality rate in the ASA group at 360 days post-SRT.

Murine models of CH suggest a central role of inflammasomes and IL-1\u03b2 in accelerated atherosclerosis and plaque destabilization. Here we show using single-cell RNA sequencing in human carotid plaques that inflammasome components are enriched in macrophages, while the receptor for IL-1\u03b2 is enriched in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To address the role of inflammatory crosstalk in features of plaque destabilization, we conducted SMC fate mapping in Ldlr-/- mice modeling Jak2VF or Tet2 CH treated with IL-1\u03b2 antibodies. Unexpectedly, this treatment minimally affected SMC differentiation, leading instead to a prominent expansion of fibroblast-like cells.

Both local and non-local participants discussed similar benefits and drawbacks to the use of technology in telegenetics and overall found the use of telegenetics and at-home genetic testing to be convenient. Both groups also noted having to make changes in their daily lives and future planning as a consequence of the positive genetic testing results. However, access to follow-up care differed between local and non-local participants, with more local participants having scheduled and attended appointments with the appropriate medical providers compared to non-local participants.

Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that SMC \"phenotypic switching\" plays a central role in atherosclerosis development and complications. Yet, SMC roles and mechanisms underlying the disease pathogenesis are poorly understood. Here, employing SMC lineage tracing mice, comprehensive molecular, cellular, histological, and computational profiling, coupled to genetic and pharmacological studies, we reveal that atherosclerosis, in terms of SMC behaviors, share extensive commonalities with tumors. SMC-derived cells in the disease show multiple characteristics of tumor cell biology, including genomic instability, replicative immortality, malignant proliferation, resistance to cell death, invasiveness, and activation of comprehensive cancer-associated gene regulatory networks. SMC-specific expression of oncogenic KrasG12D accelerates SMC phenotypic switching and exacerbates atherosclerosis. Moreover, we present a proof of concept showing that niraparib, an anti-cancer drug targeting DNA damage repair, attenuates atherosclerosis progression and induces regression of lesions in advanced disease in mouse models.

Despite the proliferation of CITE-seq, it is still costly to generate such data. Although data integration can increase information content, this raises computational challenges. First, combining multiple datasets is prone to batch effects that need to be addressed. Secondly, it is difficult to combine multiple CITE-seq datasets because the protein panels in different datasets may only partially overlap. Integrating multiple CITE-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets is important because this allows the utilization of as many data as possible to uncover cell population heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we present sciPENN, a multi-use deep learning approach that supports CITE-seq and scRNA-seq data integration, protein expression prediction for scRNA-seq, protein expression imputation for CITE-seq, quantification of prediction and imputation uncertainty, and cell type label transfer from CITE-seq to scRNA-seq.

Genome-wide mapping of myocardial DNA methylation in 36 patients with HF at LVAD implantation, 8 patients at LVAD explantation, and 7 nonfailing (NF) donors using a high-density bead array platform identified 2,079 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and 261 DMPs in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). LVAD support resulted in normalization of 3.2% of HF-associated DMPs. Methylation-expression correlation analysis yielded several protein-coding genes that are hypomethylated and upregulated (HTRA1, FBXO16, EFCAB13, and AKAP13) or hypermethylated and downregulated (TBX3) in HF. A potentially novel cardiac-specific super-enhancer long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) (LINC00881) is hypermethylated and downregulated in human HF. LINC00881 is an upstream regulator of sarcomere and calcium channel gene expression including MYH6, CACNA1C, and RYR2. LINC00881 knockdown reduces peak calcium amplitude in the beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).

Using an established transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) tool, FUSION, we interrogated the associations between cis-regulated expression of lincRNAs and multiple cardiometabolic traits. We found that cis-regulated expression of non-conserved lincRNAs had a strikingly similar trend of association with complex cardiometabolic traits as conserved lincRNAs.

As single-cell technologies are becoming widely applicable in human disease studies, population-level studies have become a reality. We will describe how we should go about pursuing and designing these studies, particularly how to select study subjects, how to determine the number of cells to sequence per subject, and the needed sequencing depth per cell.

However, it is largely unknown whether SRT prevents HCM-related cardiovascular events or death. The objective was to examine the effects of SRT on acute cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in HCM. We performed a propensity score (PS) -matched study using databases that capture all hospitalizations and outpatient visits in New York state. We identified patients with HCM who underwent SRT between 2007 and 2014 (i.e. the SRT group) and those who had never had SRT but had at least one hospitalization for HCM during the same period (i.e. the control group). We performed PS matching at a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was a composite of acute cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality during 0-180 days and 181-360 days. The secondary outcome was 180- and 360-day all-cause mortality. We included 846 patients with HCM (423 PS-matched pairs). Patients who underwent SRT had a lower risk of the primary outcome event (0-180 days: odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.37-0.80; P = 0.002 and 181-360 days: OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower at 180 days (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.63; P = 0.0003) and 360 days post-SRT (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51; P < 0.0001).

On the other hand, genetic testing carries socio-economical and psychological burdens. It is therefore important to identify patients with HCM who are more likely to have positive genotype. However, conventional prediction models based on clinical and echocardiographic parameters offer only modest accuracy and are subject to intra- and inter-observer variability. We therefore hypothesized that deep convolutional neural network (DCNN, a type of deep learning) analysis of echocardiographic images improves the predictive accuracy of positive genotype in patients with HCM. In each case, we obtained parasternal short- and long-axis as well as apical 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-chamber views. We employed DCNN algorithm to predict positive genotype based on the input echocardiographic images. We performed 5-fold cross-validations. We used 2 reference models-the Mayo HCM Genotype Predictor score (Mayo score) and the Toronto HCM Genotype score (Toronto score). We compared the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) between a combined model using the reference model plus DCNN-derived probability and the reference model. We calculated the p-value by performing 1,000 bootstrapping. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In addition, we examined the net reclassification improvement. We included 99 adults with HCM who underwent genetic testing. Overall, 45 patients (45%) had positive genotype. The new model combining Mayo score and DCNN-derived probability significantly outperformed Mayo score (AUC 0.86 [95% CI 0.79-0.93] vs. 0.72 [0.61-0.82]; p < 0.001). Similarly, the new model combining Toronto score and DCNN-derived probability exhibited a higher AUC compared to Toronto score alone (AUC 0.84 [0.76-0.92] vs. 0.75 [0.65-0.85]; p = 0.03).

Delineating specific inflammatory pathways and biomarkers of their activity could identify the mechanistic underpinnings of the increased risk. Plasma levels of kynurenine, a metabolite involved in inflammation, associates with cardiometabolic disease risk. We used genetic approaches to identify inflammatory mechanisms associated with kynurenine variability and their relationship to cardiometabolic disease. We identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with plasma kynurenine, including a missense-variant (rs3184504) in the inflammatory gene SH2B3/LNK. We examined the association between rs3184504 and plasma kynurenine in independent human samples, and measured kynurenine levels in SH2B3-knock-out mice and during human LPS-evoked endotoxemia. We conducted phenome scanning to identify clinical phenotypes associated with each kynurenine-related SNP and with a kynurenine polygenic score using the UK-Biobank (n\u2009=\u2009456,422), BioVU (n\u2009=\u200962,303), and Electronic Medical Records and Genetics (n\u2009=\u200932,324) databases. The SH2B3 missense variant associated with plasma kynurenine levels and SH2B3-/- mice had significant tissue-specific differences in kynurenine levels.LPS, an acute inflammatory stimulus, increased plasma kynurenine in humans. Mendelian randomization showed increased waist-circumference, a marker of central obesity, associated with increased kynurenine, and increased kynurenine associated with C-reactive protein (CRP). We found 30 diagnoses associated (FDR q\u2009<\u20090.05) with the SH2B3 variant, but not with SNPs mapping to genes known to regulate tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. Plasma kynurenine may be a biomarker of acute and chronic inflammation involving the SH2B3 pathways.

discoveries. As the scale of scRNA-seq studies increases, a major challenge in analysis is batch effects, which are inevitable in studies involving human tissues. Most existing methods remove batch effects in a low-dimensional embedding space. Although useful for clustering, batch effects are still present in the gene expression space, leaving downstream gene-level analysis susceptible to batch effects. Recent studies have shown that batch effect correction in the gene expression space is much harder than in the embedding space. Methods such as Seurat 3.0 rely on the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) approach to remove batch effects in gene expression, but MNN can only analyze two batches at a time, and it becomes computationally infeasible when the number of batches is large. Here, we present CarDEC, a joint deep learning model that simultaneously clusters and denoises scRNA-seq data while correcting batch effects both in the embedding and the gene expression space. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues showed that CarDEC outperforms Scanorama, DCA + Combat, scVI, and MNN. With CarDEC denoising, non-highly variable genes offer as much signal for clustering as the highly variable genes (HVGs), suggesting that CarDEC substantially boosted information content in scRNA-seq. We also showed that trajectory analysis using CarDEC's denoised and batch-corrected expression as input revealed marker genes and transcription factors that are otherwise obscured in the presence of batch effects.

Clonal haematopoiesis increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke independently of traditional risk factors1. Among the common genetic variants that give rise to clonal haematopoiesis, the JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) mutation, which increases JAK-STAT signalling, occurs at a younger age and imparts the strongest risk of premature coronary heart disease1,2. Here we show increased proliferation of macrophages and prominent formation of necrotic cores in atherosclerotic lesions in mice that express Jak2VF selectively in macrophages, and in chimeric mice that model clonal haematopoiesis. Deletion of the essential inflammasome components caspase 1 and 11, or of the pyroptosis executioner gasdermin D, reversed these adverse changes. Jak2VF lesions showed increased expression of AIM2, oxidative DNA damage and DNA replication stress, and Aim2 deficiency reduced atherosclerosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of Jak2VF lesions revealed a landscape that was enriched for inflammatory myeloid cells, which were suppressed by deletion of Gsdmd. Inhibition of the inflammasome product interleukin-1\u03b2 reduced macrophage proliferation and necrotic formation while increasing the thickness of fibrous caps, indicating that it stabilized plaques. Our findings suggest that increased proliferation and glycolytic metabolism in Jak2VF macrophages lead to DNA replication stress and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome, thereby aggravating atherosclerosis. Precise application of therapies that target interleukin-1\u03b2 or specific inflammasomes according to clonal haematopoiesis status could substantially reduce cardiovascular risk.", "Keywords": [],

through actin-mediated engulfment by macrophages, prevents secondary necrosis, suppresses inflammation, and promotes resolution. Impaired efferocytosis drives the formation of clinically dangerous necrotic atherosclerotic plaques, the underlying etiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). An intron of the gene encoding PHACTR1 contains rs9349379 (A>G), a common variant associated with CAD. As PHACTR1 is an actin-binding protein, we reasoned that if the rs9349379 risk allele G causes lower PHACTR1 expression in macrophages, it might link the risk allele to CAD via impaired efferocytosis. We show here that rs9349379-G/G was associated with lower levels of PHACTR1 and impaired efferocytosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages and human atherosclerotic lesional macrophages compared with rs9349379-A/A. Silencing PHACTR1 in human and mouse macrophages compromised AC engulfment, and Western diet-fed Ldlr-/- mice in which hematopoietic Phactr1 was genetically targeted showed impaired lesional efferocytosis, increased plaque necrosis, and thinner fibrous caps - all signs of vulnerable plaques in humans. Mechanistically, PHACTR1 prevented dephosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which was necessary for AC engulfment. In summary, rs9349379-G lowered PHACTR1, which, by lowering phospho-MLC, compromised efferocytosis. Thus, rs9349379-G may contribute to CAD risk, at least in part, by impairing atherosclerotic lesional macrophage efferocytosis.", "Keywords": ["Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Cell Biology", "Macrophages"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Microfilament Proteins", "Myosin Light Chains", "Phosphorylation", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Polymorphism, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Canan", "Last Name": "Kasikara", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maaike", "Last Name": "Schilperoort", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brennan", "Last Name": "Gerlach", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaobo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ze", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Kuriakose", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bernhard", "Last Name": "Dorweiler", "Affiliation": "Department of Vascular Surgery, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabrielle", "Last Name": "Fredman", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Albany Medical Center, Albany, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danish", "Last Name": "Saleheen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2021Apr15"}, {"PMID": "33532862", "Title": "Genome-wide analysis identifies novel susceptibility loci for myocardial infarction.", "Abstract": "While most patients with myocardial infarction (MI) have underlying coronary atherosclerosis, not all patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) develop MI.

The opioid cascade describes the current status of the treatment system, where only a fraction of people with OUD initiate effective medication treatment for OUD (MOUD), and of those only a fraction is retained in treatment. Regulatory changes-such as availability of larger take-home supplies of methadone and buprenorphine initiated via telemedicine (e.g., no initial in person visit; telemedicine buprenorphine permitted across state lines)-could modify the cascade, by reducing the burden and increasing the attractiveness, availability, and feasibility of MOUD both for people with OUD and for providers. We review examples of more liberal MOUD regimens, including the implementation of buprenorphine in France in the 1990s, primary care-based methadone in Canada, and low-threshold buprenorphine models. Research is needed to document whether new models implemented in the U.S. in the wake of COVID-19 are successful, and whether safety concerns, such as diversion and misuse, emerge. We discuss barriers to implementation, including racial and ethnic health disparities, and lack of knowledge and reluctance among potential providers of MOUD. We suggest that the urgency and public spiritedness of the response to COVID-19 be harnessed to make gains on the opioid cascade, inspiring prescribers, health systems, and communities to embrace the delivery of MOUD to meet the needs of an increasingly vulnerable population.", "Keywords": ["Barriers to implementation", "Buprenorphine", "COVID-19", "Disparities", "Low-threshold buprenorphine", "Medication treatment for opioid use disorder", "Methadone", "Opioid cascade", "Opioid use disorder", "Regulations", "Telemedicine"], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American", "Buprenorphine", "COVID-19", "Health Services Accessibility", "Healthcare Disparities", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Legislation, Drug", "Methadone", "Narcotic Antagonists", "Opiate Substitution Treatment", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Pandemics", "Telemedicine", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward V", "Last Name": "Nunes", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, United States of America; Columbia Center for Healing of Opioid and Other Substance Use Disorders - Enhancing Intervention Development and Implementation (CHOSEN), Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, United States of America; Columbia University Irving Medical Center, West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, United States of America.

We evaluated whether the associations between nonconserved lincRNAs and 8 complex cardiometabolic traits resemble or differ from the pattern of association for conserved lincRNAs. Approach and Results: Our investigation of over 7000 lincRNA annotations from GENCODE Release 33-GRCh38.p13 for complex trait genetic associations leveraged several large, established meta-analyses genome-wide association study summary data resources, including GIANT (Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits), UK Biobank, GLGC (Global Lipids Genetics Consortium), Cardiogram (Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis), and DIAGRAM (Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-Analysis)/DIAMANTE (Diabetes Meta-Analysis of Trans-Ethnic Association Studies).

We hypothesized that genetically determined blood subtype A1 is associated with increased risk of ARDS and markers of microvascular dysfunction and coagulation.METHODSWe conducted analyses in 3 cohorts of critically ill trauma and sepsis patients (n = 3710) genotyped on genome-wide platforms to determine the association of the A1 blood type genotype with ARDS risk. We subsequently determined whether associations were present in FUT2-defined nonsecretors who lack ABO antigens on epithelium, but not endothelium. In a patient subgroup, we determined the associations of blood type with plasma levels of endothelial glycoproteins and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Lastly, we tested whether blood type A was associated with less donor lung injury recovery during human ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP).RESULTSThe A1 genotype was associated with a higher risk of moderate to severe ARDS relative to type O in all 3 populations. In sepsis, this relationship was strongest in nonpulmonary infections. The association persisted in nonsecretors, suggesting a vascular mechanism. The A1 genotype was also associated with higher DIC risk as well as concentrations of thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor, which in turn were associated with ARDS risk. Blood type A was also associated with less lung injury recovery during EVLP.CONCLUSIONWe identified a replicable association between ABO blood type A1 and risk of ARDS among the critically ill, possibly mediated through microvascular dysfunction and coagulation.FUNDINGNIH HL122075, HL125723, HL137006, HL137915, DK097307, HL115354, HL101779, and the University of Pennsylvania McCabe Fund Fellowship Award.", "Keywords": ["Coagulation", "Epidemiology", "Pulmonology", "endothelial cells"], "MeSH terms": ["ABO Blood-Group System", "Adult", "Aged", "Critical Illness", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Risk Factors", "Sepsis", "Wounds and Injuries"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Nuala J", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Michael Gs", "Last Name": "Shashaty", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Ittner", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Thomas G", "Last Name": "Dunn", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin", "Last Name": "Forker", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Bonk", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Ethan", "Last Name": "Kotloff", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatics, and."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Cantu", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational Lung Biology."}, {"First Name": "Nilam S", "Last Name": "Mangalmurti", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn S", "Last Name": "Calfee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Matthay", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Mikacenic", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keith R", "Last Name": "Walley", "Affiliation": "Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Christiani", "Affiliation": "T.H.

Existing methods for gene-level ASE detection analyze one individual at a time, therefore failing to account for shared information across individuals. Failure to accommodate such shared information not only reduces power, but also makes it difficult to interpret results across individuals. However, when only RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data are available, ASE detection across individuals is challenging because the data often include individuals that are either heterozygous or homozygous for the unobserved cis-regulatory SNP, leading to sample heterogeneity as only those heterozygous individuals are informative for ASE, whereas those homozygous individuals have balanced expression. To simultaneously model multi-individual information and account for such heterogeneity, we developed ASEP, a mixture model with subject-specific random effect to account for multi-SNP correlations within the same gene. ASEP only requires RNA-seq data, and is able to detect gene-level ASE under one condition and differential ASE between two conditions (e.g., pre- versus post-treatment). Extensive simulations demonstrated the convincing performance of ASEP under a wide range of scenarios. We applied ASEP to a human kidney RNA-seq dataset, identified ASE genes and validated our results with two published eQTL studies. We further applied ASEP to a human macrophage RNA-seq dataset, identified genes showing evidence of differential ASE between M0 and M1 macrophages, and confirmed our findings by results from cardiometabolic trait-relevant genome-wide association studies. To the best of our knowledge, ASEP is the first method for gene-level ASE detection at the population level that only requires the use of RNA-seq data.

There are important sex differences in fat distribution that are masked when studying body mass index as a measure of obesity. From epidemiological, murine, and in vitro studies, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the sex differences in adipose distribution, including sex hormonal effects, cell-intrinsic properties, and the microenvironment in fat depots. More recently, human genetics have revealed hundreds of loci for central obesity providing disruptive opportunities for mechanistic discoveries and clinical translation. A striking feature is that over one-third of these loci have reproducible but poorly understood sexual dimorphic associations with central obesity, most having stronger effects in women.

At the same time, expansive new transcriptome data resources offer unprecedented opportunity to unravel the mechanistic underpinnings of complex disease associations. Two-stage strategies involving conditioning on a single, penalized regression imputation for transcriptome association analysis have been described for cross-sectional traits. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative two-stage approach based on stochastic regression imputation that additionally incorporates error in the predictive model. Application of a bootstrap procedure offers flexibility when a closed form predictive distribution is not available. The two-stage strategy is also generalized to longitudinally measured traits, using a linear mixed effects modeling framework and a composite test statistic to evaluate whether the genetic component of gene-level expression modifies the biomarker trajectory over time.

Antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in regulating intestinal immune homeostasis in part by surveying the gut epithelial surface for pathogens. Previously, we found that highly reactive \u03b3-ketoaldehydes or isolevuglandins (IsoLGs) accumulate in DCs and act as neoantigens, promoting an autoimmune-like state and hypertension. We hypothesized that excess dietary salt alters the gut microbiome leading to hypertension and this is associated with increased immunogenic IsoLG-adduct formation in myeloid antigen presenting cells. To test this hypothesis, we performed fecal microbiome analysis and measured blood pressure of healthy human volunteers with salt intake above or below the American Heart Association recommendations. We also performed 16S rRNA analysis on cecal samples of mice fed normal or high salt diets. In humans and mice, high salt intake was associated with changes in the gut microbiome reflecting an increase in Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and genus Prevotella bacteria. These alterations were associated with higher blood pressure in humans and predisposed mice to vascular inflammation and hypertension in response to a sub-pressor dose of angiotensin II. Mice fed a high salt diet exhibited increased intestinal inflammation including the mesenteric arterial arcade and aorta, with a marked increase in the B7 ligand CD86 and formation of IsoLG-protein adducts in CD11c+ myeloid cells. Adoptive transfer of fecal material from conventionally housed high salt-fed mice to germ-free mice predisposed them to increased intestinal inflammation and hypertension. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying inflammation and hypertension associated with excess dietary salt and may lead to interventions targeting the microbiome to prevent and treat this important disease.", "Keywords": ["Hypertension", "Inflammation"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adoptive Transfer", "Adult", "Angiotensin II", "Animals", "Aorta", "Bacteria", "Blood Pressure", "CD11c Antigen", "Colon", "Cytokines", "Dendritic Cells", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dysbiosis", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Inflammation", "Lipids", "Lymph Nodes", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Middle Aged", "Myeloid Cells", "Peyer's Patches", "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S", "Sodium Chloride", "Sodium Chloride, Dietary", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jane F", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Luul A", "Last Name": "Aden", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Natalia R", "Last Name": "Barbaro", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Justin P", "Last Name": "Van Beusecum", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Alan J", "Last Name": "Simmons", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Cassandra", "Last Name": "Warden", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Lejla", "Last Name": "Pasic", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Lauren E", "Last Name": "Himmel", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mary K", "Last Name": "Washington", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank L", "Last Name": "Revetta", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shilin", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and."}, {"First Name": "Shivani", "Last Name": "Kumaresan", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Matthew B", "Last Name": "Scholz", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics core facility, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhengzheng", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "Guanhua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annet", "Last Name": "Kirabo", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2019Jun04"}, {"PMID": "30943773", "Title": "Cell-Specific Effects of GATA (GATA Zinc Finger Transcription Factor Family)-6 in Vascular Smooth Muscle and Endothelial Cells on Vascular Injury Neointimal Formation.", "Abstract": "Objective- Transcription factor GATA (GATA zinc finger transcription factor family)-6 is highly expressed in vessels and rapidly downregulated in balloon-injured carotid arteries and viral delivery of GATA-6 to the vessels limited the neointimal formation, however, little is known about its cell-specific regulation of in vivo vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic state contributing to neointimal formation. This study aims to determine the role of vascular cell-specific GATA-6 in ligation- or injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. Approach and Results- Endothelial cell and VSMC-specific GATA-6 deletion mice are generated, and the results indicate that endothelial cell-specific GATA-6 deletion mice exhibit significant decrease of VSMC proliferation and attenuation of neointimal formation after artery ligation and injury compared with the wild-type littermate control mice. PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)-B is identified as a direct target gene, and endothelial cell-GATA-6-PDGF-B pathway regulates VSMC proliferation and migration in a paracrine manner which controls the neointimal formation. In contrast, VSMC-specific GATA-6 deletion promotes injury-induced VSMC transformation from contractile to proliferative synthetic phenotype leading to increased neointimal formation. CCN (cysteine-rich 61/connective tissue growth factor/nephroblastoma overexpressed family)-5 is identified as a novel target gene, and VSMC-specific CCN-5 overexpression in mice reverses the VSMC-GATA-6 deletion-mediated increased cell proliferation and migration and finally attenuates the neointimal formation. Conclusions- This study gives us a direct in vivo evidence of GATA-6 cell lineage-specific regulation of PDGF-B and CCN-5 on VSMC phenotypic state, proliferation and migration contributing to neointimal formation, which advances our understanding of in vivo neointimal hyperplasia, meanwhile also provides opportunities for future therapeutic interventions.", "Keywords": ["carotid arteries",

Most lincRNAs are not conserved among mammals, raising the fundamental question of whether nonconserved adipose-expressed lincRNAs are functional. To address this, we performed deep RNA sequencing of gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue from 25 healthy humans. We identified 1001 putative lincRNAs expressed in all samples through de novo reconstruction of noncoding transcriptomes and integration with existing lincRNA annotations. One hundred twenty lincRNAs had adipose-enriched expression, and 54 of these exhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) binding at their loci. Most of these adipose-enriched lincRNAs (~85%) were not conserved in mice, yet on average, they showed degrees of expression and binding of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 similar to those displayed by conserved lincRNAs. Most adipose lincRNAs differentially expressed (n = 53) in patients after bariatric surgery were nonconserved. The most abundant adipose-enriched lincRNA in our subcutaneous adipose data set, linc-ADAL, was nonconserved, up-regulated in adipose depots of obese individuals, and markedly induced during in vitro human adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrated that linc-ADAL interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU) and insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) at distinct subcellular locations to

In this paper, we interrogate this hypothesis using a single-SNP score test and a novel class-level testing strategy to characterize protein-coding gene and regulatory element-level associations with longitudinal biomarker trajectories in response to stimulus. Using the proposed class-level association score statistic for longitudinal data, which accounts for correlations induced by linkage disequilibrium, the genetic underpinnings of evoked dynamic changes in repeatedly measured biomarkers are investigated. The proposed method is applied to data on two biomarkers arising from the Genetics of Evoked Responses to Niacin and Endotoxemia study, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored investigation of the genomics of inflammatory and metabolic responses during low-grade endotoxemia. Our results suggest that the genetic basis of evoked inflammatory response is different than the genetic contributors to resting state, and several potentially novel loci are identified. A simulation study demonstrates appropriate control of type-1 error rates, relative computational efficiency, and power.

Yet functional lincRNAs often have low, context-specific and tissue-specific expression. We hypothesized that many human monocyte and adipose lincRNAs would be absent in current public annotations due to lincRNA tissue specificity, modest sequencing depth in public data, limitations of transcriptome assembly algorithms, and lack of dynamic physiological contexts. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed in peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes (monocytes; average ~247 million reads per sample) and adipose tissue (average ~378 million reads per sample) collected before and after human experimental endotoxemia, an in vivo inflammatory stress, to identify tissue-specific and clinically relevant lincRNAs. Using a stringent filtering pipeline, we identified 109 unannotated lincRNAs in monocytes and 270 unannotated lincRNAs in adipose. Most unannotated lincRNAs are not conserved in rodents and are tissue specific, while many have features of regulated expression and are enriched in transposable elements. Specific subsets have enhancer RNA characteristics or are expressed only during inflammatory stress. A subset of unannotated lincRNAs was validated and replicated for their presence and inflammatory induction in independent human samples and for their monocyte and adipocyte origins. Through interrogation of public genome-wide association data, we also found evidence of specific disease association for selective unannotated lincRNAs. Our findings highlight the critical need to perform deep RNA-Seq in a cell-, tissue-, and context-specific manner to annotate the full repertoire of human lincRNAs for a complete understanding of lincRNA roles in dynamic cell functions and in human disease.", "Keywords": ["RNA-Seq", "de novo assembly", "human", "inflammation", "lincRNA"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adolescent", "Adult", "DNA Transposable Elements", "Endotoxemia", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monocytes", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jane F", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Translational and Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christine C", "Last Name": "Hinkle", "Affiliation": "Gene Therapy Program, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Mingyao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; mpr2144@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Physiological genomics", "PubDate": "2017Jun01"}, {"PMID": "28329057", "Title": "Coronary Artery Calcification and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Death Among Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.", "Abstract": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in dialysis-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) may have systemic and adipose tissue-specific anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective action. Interactions between calgranulins and the unsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) have been reported, yet little is known about the relationship between calgranulins and the LC n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We explored tissue-specific action of calgranulins in the setting of evoked endotoxemia and n-3 PUFA supplementation. Expression of calgranulins in adipose tissue in vivo was assessed by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) before and after n-3 PUFA supplementation and evoked endotoxemia in the fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty acid modulation of endotoxemia (FFAME) Study. Subjects received n-3 PUFA (n = 8; 3600mg/day EPA/DHA) or matched placebo (n = 6) for 6-8 weeks, before completing an endotoxin challenge (LPS 0.6 ng/kg). Calgranulin genes were up-regulated post-LPS, with greater increase in n-3 PUFA (S100A8 15-fold, p = 0.003; S100A9 7-fold, p = 0.003; S100A12 28-fold, p = 0.01) compared to placebo (S100A8 2-fold, p = 0.01; S100A9 1.4-fold, p = 0.4; S100A12 5-fold, p = 0.06). In an independent evoked endotoxemia study, calgranulin gene expression correlated with the systemic inflammatory response. Through in vivo and in vitro interrogation we highlight differential responses in adipocytes and mononuclear cells during inflammation, with n-3 PUFA leading to increased calgranulin expression in adipose, but decreased expression in circulating cells. In conclusion, we present a novel relationship between n-3 PUFA anti-inflammatory action in vivo and cell-specific modulation of calgranulin expression during innate immune activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adult", "Antioxidants", "Buttocks", "Calgranulin A", "Calgranulin B", "Case-Control Studies", "Docosahexaenoic Acids", "Eicosapentaenoic Acid", "Endotoxemia", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Male", "Monocytes", "S100A12 Protein", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachana D", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sony", "Last Name": "Tuteja", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mingyao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics & Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jane F", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, and Vanderbilt Translational and Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center (VTRACC), Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "27858978", "Title": "Bayesian variable selection for post-analytic interrogation of susceptibility loci.", "Abstract": "Understanding the complex interplay among protein coding genes and regulatory elements requires rigorous interrogation with analytic tools designed for discerning the relative contributions of overlapping genomic regions. To this aim, we offer a novel application of Bayesian variable selection (BVS) for classifying genomic class level associations using existing large meta-analysis summary level resources. This approach is applied using the expectation maximization variable selection (EMVS) algorithm to typed and imputed SNPs across 502 protein coding genes (PCGs) and 220 long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that overlap 45 known loci for coronary artery disease (CAD) using publicly available Global Lipids Gentics Consortium (GLGC) (Teslovich et al., 2010; Willer et al., 2013) meta-analysis summary statistics for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The analysis reveals 33 PCGs and three lncRNAs across 11 loci with >50% posterior probabilities for inclusion in an additive model of association. The findings are consistent with previous reports, while providing some new insight into the architecture of LDL-cholesterol to be investigated further. As genomic taxonomies continue to evolve, additional classes such as enhancer elements and splicing regions, can easily be layered into the proposed analysis framework. Moreover, application of this approach to alternative publicly available meta-analysis resources, or more generally as a post-analytic strategy to further interrogate regions that are identified through single point analysis, is straightforward.

PPAR\u03b3 is a master regulator of adipocyte biology but the functions of its isoforms are poorly distinguished. Here we demonstrated that PPAR\u03b31 is preferentially expressed in catabolic fat depots while PPAR\u03b32 presents itself at a higher level in browning-resistant depots. PPAR\u03b32, but not PPAR\u03b31, responds to endogenous ligands to induce adipogenesis, and the isoforms regulate distinct sets of white and brown adipocyte genes. Moreover, PPAR\u03b31 negatively correlates while PPAR\u03b32 positively correlates with adiposity in human subcutaneous and visceral fat.

However, due to the sex-specific data structure of the X chromosome, it has been excluded from most of these analyses. While females have 2 copies of chromosome X, males have only one. Also, one of the female X chromosomes may be inactivated. Therefore, special test statistics and quality control procedures are required. Thus, little is known about the role of X-chromosomal variants in CAD. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive X-chromosome-wide meta-analysis including more than 43,000 CAD cases and 58,000 controls from 35 international study cohorts. For quality control, sex-specific filters were used to adequately take the special structure of X-chromosomal data into account. For single study analyses, several logistic regression models were calculated allowing for inactivation of one female X-chromosome, adjusting for sex and investigating interactions between sex and genetic variants. Then, meta-analyses including all 35 studies were conducted using random effects models. None of the investigated models revealed genome-wide significant associations for any variant. Although we analyzed the largest-to-date sample, currently available methods were not able to detect any associations of X-chromosomal variants with CAD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosomes,

causal is not known. We applied the Mendelian randomization framework to evaluate the causal hypothesis that elevated SBP increases risk for type 2 diabetes. We used 28 genetic variants associated with SBP and evaluated their impact on type 2 diabetes using a European-centric meta-analysis comprising 37,293 case and 125,686 control subjects. We found that elevation of SBP levels by 1 mmHg due to our genetic score was associated with a 2% increase in risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, P = 9.05 \u00d7 10-5). To limit confounding, we constructed a second score based on 13 variants exclusively associated with SBP and found a similar increase in type 2 diabetes risk per 1 mmHg of genetic elevation in SBP (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, P = 1.48 \u00d7 10-3). Sensitivity analyses using multiple, alternative causal inference measures and simulation studies demonstrated consistent association, suggesting robustness of our primary observation.

We defined a set of 54 944 human lincRNAs by drawing on four publicly available lincRNA datasets, and annotated \u223c2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from each of 15 cardiometabolic genome-wide association study datasets into these lincRNAs. We identified hundreds of lincRNAs with at least one trait-associated SNP: 898 SNPs in 343 unique lincRNAs at 5% false discovery rate, and 469 SNPs in 146 unique lincRNAs meeting Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05. An additional 64 trait-associated lincRNAs were identified using a class-level testing strategy at Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05. To better understand the genomic context and prioritize trait-associated lincRNAs, we examined the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between SNPs in the lincRNAs and SNPs that met genome-wide-significance in the region (\u00b1500 kb of lincRNAs). A subset of the lincRNA-trait association findings was replicated in independent Genome-wide association studies data from the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study study. For trait-associated lincRNAs, we also investigated synteny and conservation relative to mouse, expression patterns in five cardiometabolic-relevant tissues, and allele-specific expression in RNA sequencing data for adipose tissue and leukocytes.

However, it is often difficult to detect the subtle effects of n-3 PUFA on inflammatory biomarkers in traditional intervention studies. We aimed to identify novel n-3 PUFA modulated gene expression using unbiased adipose transcriptomics during evoked endotoxemia in a clinical trial of n-3 PUFA supplementation. We analyzed adipose gene expression using RNA sequencing in the fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty acid modulation of endotoxemia (FFAME) trial of healthy individuals at three timepoints: before and after n-3 PUFA supplementation (n=8; 3600mg/day EPA/DHA) for 6weeks compared with placebo (n=6), as well as during a subsequent evoked inflammatory challenge (lipopolysaccharide 0.6ng/kg i.v.). As expected, supplementation with n-3 PUFA vs. placebo alone had only modest effects on adipose tissue gene expression, e.g., increased expression of immediate early response IER2. In contrast, the transcriptomic response to evoked endotoxemia was significantly modified by n-3 PUFA supplementation, with several genes demonstrating significant n-3 PUFA gene-nutrient interactions, e.g., enhanced transcriptional responses in specific immune genes IER5L, HES1, IL1RN, CCL18, IL1RN, IL7R, IL8, CCL3 and others. These data highlight potential mechanisms whereby n-3 PUFA consumption may enhance the immune response to an inflammatory challenge. In conclusion, unbiased transcriptomics during evoked inflammation reveals novel immune modulating functions of n-3 PUFA nutritional intervention in a dynamic pathophysiological setting.", "Keywords": ["Adipose tissue", "Evoked endotoxemia", "Inflammation", "LPS", "RNASeq", "n-3 PUFA"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adult", "Fatty Acids, Omega-3", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jane F", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, and Vanderbilt Translational and Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

in atherosclerosis with computed tomography.", "Abstract": "Monocytes are actively recruited from the circulation into developing atherosclerotic plaques. In the plaque, monocytes differentiate into macrophages and eventually form foam cells. Continued accumulation of foam cells can lead to plaque rupture and subsequent myocardial infarction. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the best modality to image the coronary arteries non-invasively, therefore we have sought to track the accumulation of monocytes into atherosclerotic plaques using CT. Gold nanoparticles were synthesized and stabilized with a variety of ligands. Select formulations were incubated with an immortalized monocyte cell line in\u00a0vitro and evaluated for cytotoxicity, effects on cytokine release, and cell uptake. These data identified a lead formulation, 11-MUDA capped gold nanoparticles, to test for labeling primary monocytes. The formulation did not the affect the viability or cytokine release of primary monocytes and was highly taken up by these cells. Gold labeled primary monocytes were injected into apolipoprotein E deficient mice kept on Western diet for 10 weeks. Imaging was done with a microCT scanner. A significant increase in attenuation was measured in the aorta of mice receiving the gold labeled cells as compared to control animals. Following the experiment, the biodistribution of gold was evaluated in major organs. Additionally, plaques were sectioned and examined with electron microscopy. The results showed that gold nanoparticles were present inside monocytes located within plaques. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using gold nanoparticles as effective cell labeling contrast agents for non-invasive imaging of monocyte accumulation within plaques with CT.", "Keywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "Cell tracking", "Computed tomography", "Gold nanoparticles", "Monocytes"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Atherosclerosis", "Cell Line", "Cell Tracking", "Cells, Cultured", "Gold", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Monocytes", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Chhour", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pratap C", "Last Name": "Naha", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sean M", "Last Name": "O'Neill", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harold I", "Last Name": "Litt", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Victor A", "Last Name": "Ferrari", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Cormode", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St, 1 Silverstein, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

The role of ACSL1 in humans is unknown. We therefore examined common variants in the human ACSL1 locus by genetic association studies for fasting glucose, diabetes status, and preclinical atherosclerosis by using the MAGIC and DIAGRAM consortia; followed by analyses in participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, the Penn-T2D consortium, and a meta-analysis of subclinical atherosclerosis in African Americans; and finally, expression quantitative trait locus analysis and identification of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS). The results show that three SNPs in ACSL1 (rs7681334, rs735949, and rs4862423) are associated with fasting glucose or diabetes status in these large (>200,000 subjects) data sets. Furthermore, rs4862423 is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and coincides with a DHS highly accessible in human heart. SNP rs735949 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs745805, significantly associated with ACSL1 levels in skin, suggesting tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms.

Our combined analysis of 24,320 individuals from 11 populations of white European ethnicity showed an association between coronary artery disease and both the count and the size of ROHs. Individuals with coronary artery disease had approximately 0.63 (95% CI: 0.4-0.8) excess of ROHs when compared to coronary-artery-disease-free control subjects (p = 1.49 \u00d7 10(-9)). The average total length of ROHs was approximately 1,046.92 (95% CI: 634.4-1,459.5) kb greater in individuals with coronary artery disease than control subjects (p = 6.61 \u00d7 10(-7)). None of the identified individual ROHs was associated with coronary artery disease after correction for multiple testing. However, in aggregate burden analysis, ROHs favoring increased risk of coronary artery disease were much more common than those showing the opposite direction of association with coronary artery disease (p = 2.69 \u00d7 10(-33)). Individual ROHs showed significant associations with monocyte and macrophage expression of genes in their close proximity-subjects with several individual ROHs showed significant differences in the expression of 44 mRNAs in monocytes and 17 mRNAs in macrophages when compared to subjects without those ROHs.

Indeed, obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis are all closely linked inflammatory states.

Here, we describe the human experimental endotoxemia model for the specific study of innate immunity in understanding further the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disease. In a controlled, experimental setting, administration of an intravenous bolus of purified Escherichia coli endotoxin activates innate immunity in healthy human volunteers. During endotoxemia, changes emerge in glucose metabolism, lipoprotein composition, and lipoprotein functions that closely resemble those observed chronically in inflammatory cardiovascular disease risk states. In this review, we describe the transient systemic inflammation and specific metabolic consequences that develop during human endotoxemia.

When MI occurs early in life, genetic inheritance is a major component to risk. Previously, rare mutations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) genes have been shown to contribute to MI risk in individual families, whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with MI risk in the population. Here we evaluate how rare mutations contribute to early-onset MI risk in the population. We sequenced the protein-coding regions of 9,793 genomes from patients with MI at an early age (\u226450 years in males and \u226460 years in females) along with MI-free controls. We identified two genes in which rare coding-sequence mutations were more frequent in MI cases versus controls at exome-wide significance. At low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 4.2-fold increased risk for MI; carriers of null alleles at LDLR were at even higher risk (13-fold difference). Approximately 2% of early MI cases harbour a rare, damaging mutation in LDLR; this estimate is similar to one made more than 40 years ago using an analysis of total cholesterol. Among controls, about 1 in 217 carried an LDLR coding-sequence mutation and had plasma LDL cholesterol > 190\u00a0mg\u00a0dl(-1). At apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 2.2-fold increased risk for MI. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein C-III (refs 18, 19). Combined, these observations suggest that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes to MI risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Age of Onset", "Alleles", "Apolipoprotein A-V", "Apolipoproteins A", "Case-Control Studies", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Exome", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetics, Population", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Myocardial Infarction", "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (U.S.)", "Receptors, LDL", "Triglycerides", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "1] Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.

Although statins and fibrates have been reported to increase plasma PCSK9 levels, the effect of niacin on PCSK9 is unknown. We investigated the impact of niacin, atorvastatin, and fenofibrate on PCSK9 levels in 3 distinct studies. A statin-only study randomized 74 hypercholesterolemic patients to placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg/day, or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 16 weeks. A dose-related increase in PCSK9 was noted such that atorvastatin 80 mg increased PCSK9 by a mean +27% (95% confidence interval [CI] +12 to +42), confirming the effect of statin therapy on raising PCSK9. A second study randomized 70 patients with carotid atherosclerosis to simvastatin 20 mg/day, simvastatin 80 mg/day, or simvastatin 20 mg/extended-release (ER) niacin 2 g/day. PCSK9 levels were increased with statin therapy, but decreased with the simvastatin 20 mg/ER niacin combination (mean -13%, CI -3 to -23). A final study involved 19 dyslipidemic participants on atorvastatin 10 mg with serial addition of fenofibric acid 135 mg followed by ER niacin 2 g/day. Fenofibric acid led to a +23% (CI +10 to +36, p = 0.001) increase in PCSK9; the addition of niacin resulted in a subsequent -17% decrease (CI -19 to -5, p = 0.004). A positive association was noted between change in PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (r = 0.62, p = 0.006) with the addition of niacin. In conclusion, niacin therapy offsets the increase in PCSK9 levels noted with statin and fibrate therapy. A portion of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction seen with niacin therapy may be due to reduction in PCSK9.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Apoptosis", "Biomarkers", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Dyslipidemias", "Female", "Fenofibrate", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Male", "Niacin", "Proprotein Convertase 9", "Proprotein Convertases", "Serine Endopeptidases", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amit V", "Last Name": "Khera", "Affiliation": "Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

We used an integrative genomics approach to identify novel genomic determinants of the febrile response to experimental endotoxemia. We highlight multiple integrated lines of evidence establishing the clinical relevance of this novel fever locus. Through genome-wide association study (GWAS) of evoked endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1 ng/kg IV) in healthy subjects of European ancestry we discovered a locus on chr7p11.2 significantly associated with the peak febrile response to LPS (top single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7805622, P = 2.4 \u00d7 10(-12)), as well as with temperature fluctuation over time. We replicated this association in a smaller independent LPS study (rs7805622, P = 0.03). In clinical translation, this locus was also associated with temperature and mortality in critically ill patients with trauma or severe sepsis. The top GWAS SNPs are not located within protein-coding genes, but have significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associations with expression of a cluster of genes \u223c400 kb upstream, several of which (SUMF2, CCT6A, GBAS) are regulated by LPS in vivo in blood cells. LPS- and cold-treatment of adipose stromal cells in vitro suggest genotype-specific modulation of eQTL candidate genes (PSPH). Several eQTL genes were up-regulated in brown and white adipose following cold exposure in mice, highlighting a potential role in thermogenesis. Thus, through genomic interrogation of experimental endotoxemia, we identified and replicated a novel fever locus on chr7p11.2 that modulates clinical responses in trauma and sepsis, and highlight integrated in vivo and in vitro evidence for possible novel cis candidate genes conserved across human and mouse.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7", "Female", "Fever", "Genetic Loci", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Sepsis", "Stress, Physiological", "White People", "Wounds and Injuries", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jane F", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA jane.f.ferguson@vanderbilt.edu."}, {"First Name": "Nuala J", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Liming", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology."}, {"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology."}, {"First Name": "Yichuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie L", "Last Name": "DerOhannessian", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Rushefski", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Georgios K", "Last Name": "Paschos", "Affiliation": "Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soonyew", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric E", "Last Name": "Schadt", "Affiliation": "Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mingyao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology."}, {"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Christie", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, Perelman School of Medicine."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2015Mar15"}, {"PMID": "25390462", "Title": "Inactivating mutations in NPC1L1 and protection from coronary heart disease.", "Abstract": "Ezetimibe lowers plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by inhibiting the activity of the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein.

Compared to controls, Pcsk9 knockout mice displayed decreases in inflammatory cytokine production and in other physiological responses to LPS. In human liver cells, PCSK9 inhibited LPS uptake, a necessary step in systemic clearance and detoxification. Pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 improved survival and inflammation in murine polymicrobial peritonitis. Human PCSK9 loss-of-function genetic variants were associated with improved survival in septic shock patients and a decrease in inflammatory cytokine response both in septic shock patients and in healthy volunteers after LPS administration. The PCSK9 effect was abrogated in LDL receptor (LDLR) knockout mice and in humans who are homozygous for an LDLR variant that is resistant to PCSK9.

Chronic inflammation, the classical hallmark of atherogenesis is thought to play a key pathogenic role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions from initiation of fatty streaks to plaque rupture. Over-representation of mostly pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) target genes within atherosclerotic lesions has led to the common-held belief that excessive NF-kappaB activity promotes and aggravates atherogenesis. However, mouse models lacking various proteins involved in NF-kappaB signaling have often resulted in conflicting findings, fueling additional investigations to uncover the molecular involvement of NF-kappaB and its target genes in atherogenesis.

Genome-wide association studies have identified CRP-associated common variants associated in \u223c25 genes. Our aims were to apply exome sequencing to (1) assess whether the candidate loci contain rare coding variants associated with CRP levels and (2) perform an exome-wide search for rare variants in novel genes associated with CRP levels. We exome-sequenced 6050 European-Americans (EAs) and 3109 African-Americans (AAs) from the NHLBI-ESP and the CHARGE consortia, and performed association tests of sequence data with measured CRP levels. In single-variant tests across candidate loci, a novel rare (minor allele frequency = 0.16%) CRP-coding variant (rs77832441-A; p.Thr59Met) was associated with 53% lower mean CRP levels (P = 2.9 \u00d7 10(-6)). We replicated the association of rs77832441 in an exome array analysis of 11 414 EAs (P = 3.0 \u00d7 10(-15)). Despite a strong effect on CRP levels, rs77832441 was not associated with inflammation-related phenotypes including coronary heart disease. We also found evidence for an AA-specific association of APOE-\u03b52 rs7214 with higher CRP levels. At the exome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 \u00d7 10(-8)), we confirmed associations for reported common variants of HNF1A, CRP, IL6R and TOMM40-APOE. In gene-based tests, a burden of rare/lower frequency variation in CRP in EAs (P \u2264 6.8 \u00d7 10(-4)) and in retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b1 (RORA) in AAs (P = 1.7 \u00d7 10(-3)) were associated with CRP levels at the candidate gene level (P < 2.0 \u00d7 10(-3)).

Isolated populations with recent bottlenecks offer advantages for studying rare variants in complex diseases as they have deleterious variants that are present at higher frequencies as well as a substantial reduction in rare neutral variation. To explore the potential of the Finnish founder population for studying low-frequency (0.5-5%) variants in complex diseases, we compared exome sequence data on 3,000 Finns to the same number of non-Finnish Europeans and discovered that, despite having fewer variable sites overall, the average Finn has more low-frequency loss-of-function variants and complete gene knockouts. We then used several well-characterized Finnish population cohorts to study the phenotypic effects of 83 enriched loss-of-function variants across 60 phenotypes in 36,262 Finns.

Integrating functional genomic data from a variety of sources with a large-scale meta-analysis of CAD GWAS may facilitate the identification of novel biological processes and genes involved in CAD, as well as clarify the causal relationships of established processes. Towards this end, we integrated 14 GWAS from the CARDIoGRAM Consortium and two additional GWAS from the Ottawa Heart Institute (25,491 cases and 66,819 controls) with 1) genetics of gene expression studies of CAD-relevant tissues in humans, 2) metabolic and signaling pathways from public databases, and 3) data-driven, tissue-specific gene networks from a multitude of human and mouse experiments. We not only detected CAD-associated gene networks of lipid metabolism, coagulation, immunity, and additional networks with no clear functional annotation, but also revealed key driver genes for each CAD network based on the topology of the gene regulatory networks. In particular, we found a gene network involved in antigen processing to be strongly associated with CAD. The key driver genes of this network included glyoxalase I (GLO1) and peptidylprolyl isomerase I (PPIL1), which we verified as regulatory by siRNA experiments in human aortic endothelial cells. Our results suggest genetic influences on a diverse set of both known and novel biological processes that contribute to CAD risk. The key driver genes for these networks highlight potential novel targets for further mechanistic studies and therapeutic interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomics", "Humans", "Mice", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ville-Petteri", "Last Name": "M\u00e4kinen", "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America;

While the minimal model index of insulin sensitivity, SI, has been used in studies of T1D, it has not before been evaluated against gold-standard measures derived from the euglycemic clamp. We sought to determine how well minimal model SI derived from an insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT) test compared with total body and peripheral insulin sensitivity estimates derived from the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in subjects with T1D and following islet transplantation. Twenty-one T1D subjects were evaluated, including a subgroup (n = 12) studied again after intrahepatic islet transplantation, with results compared with normal controls (n = 11 for the FSIGT). The transplant recipients received 9,648 \u00b1 666 islet equivalents/kg with reduction in HbA1c from 7.1 \u00b1 0.2 to 5.5 \u00b1 0.1% (P < 0.01) and 10/12 were insulin independent. FSIGT-derived SI was reduced in T1D pre- compared with posttransplant and with normal [1.76 \u00b1 0.45 vs. 4.21 \u00b1 0.34 vs. 4.45 \u00b1 0.81 \u00d7 10(-4)(\u03bcU/ml)(-1)\u00b7min(-1); P < 0.01 for both]. Similarly, clamp-derived total body, and by the isotopic dilution method with [6,6-(2)H2]glucose, peripheral insulin sensitivity increased in T1D from pre- to posttransplant (P < 0.05 for both). The predictive power (r(2)) between volume-corrected SIC and measures of total and peripheral insulin sensitivity was 0.66 and 0.70, respectively (P < 0.00001 for both).

multiple blood-pressure-related loci.", "Abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) is a heritable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. To investigate genetic associations with systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP), we genotyped ~50,000 SNPs in up to 87,736 individuals of European ancestry and combined these in a meta-analysis. We replicated findings in an independent set of 68,368 individuals of European ancestry. Our analyses identified 11 previously undescribed associations in independent loci containing 31 genes including PDE1A, HLA-DQB1, CDK6, PRKAG2, VCL, H19, NUCB2, RELA, HOXC@ complex, FBN1, and NFAT5 at the Bonferroni-corrected array-wide significance threshold (p < 6 \u00d7 10(-7)) and confirmed 27 previously reported associations. Bioinformatic analysis of the 11 loci provided support for a putative role in hypertension of several genes, such as CDK6 and NUCB2. Analysis of potential pharmacological targets in databases of small molecules showed that ten of the genes are predicted to be a target for small molecules. In summary, we identified previously unknown loci associated with BP. Our findings extend our understanding of genes involved in BP regulation, which may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention or drug response stratification.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Arterial Pressure", "Blood Pressure", "Computational Biology", "Diastole", "Europe", "Genetic Loci", "Genetics, Population", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Quality Control", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Risk Factors", "Systole", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vinicius", "Last Name": "Tragante", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3584 CX Utrecht, the Netherlands;

It is uncertain whether the PCSK9 example represents a paradigm or an isolated exception. We used the \"Exome Array\" to genotype >200,000 low-frequency and rare coding sequence variants across the genome in 56,538 individuals (42,208 European ancestry [EA] and 14,330 African ancestry [AA]) and tested these variants for association with LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Although we did not identify new genes associated with LDL-C, we did identify four low-frequency (frequencies between 0.1% and 2%) variants (ANGPTL8 rs145464906 [c.361C>T; p.Gln121*], PAFAH1B2 rs186808413 [c.482C>T; p.Ser161Leu], COL18A1 rs114139997 [c.331G>A; p.Gly111Arg], and PCSK7 rs142953140 [c.1511G>A; p.Arg504His]) with large effects on HDL-C and/or triglycerides. None of these four variants was associated with risk for CHD, suggesting that examples of low-frequency coding variants with robust effects on both lipids and CHD will be limited.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase", "Adult", "Aged", "Alleles", "Animals", "Black People", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Cohort Studies", "Coronary Disease", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Code", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Subtilisins", "Triglycerides", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gina M", "Last Name": "Peloso", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA;

However, estimating isoform-specific gene expression is challenging because various biases present in RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing) data complicate the analysis, and if not appropriately corrected, can affect isoform expression estimation and downstream analysis. In this article, we present PennSeq, a statistical method that allows each isoform to have its own non-uniform read distribution. Instead of making parametric assumptions, we give adequate weight to the underlying data by the use of a non-parametric approach. Our rationale is that regardless what factors lead to non-uniformity, whether it is due to hexamer priming bias, local sequence bias, positional bias, RNA degradation, mapping bias or other unknown reasons, the probability that a fragment is sampled from a particular region will be reflected in the aligned data. This empirical approach thus maximally reflects the true underlying non-uniform read distribution. We evaluate the performance of PennSeq using both simulated data with known ground truth, and using two real Illumina RNA-Seq data sets including one with quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction measurements. Our results indicate superior performance of PennSeq over existing methods, particularly for isoforms demonstrating severe non-uniformity.

WC and WHR are highly heritable with multiple susceptibility loci identified to date. We assessed the association between SNPs and BMI-adjusted WC and WHR and unadjusted WC in up to 57 412 individuals of European descent from 22 cohorts collaborating with the NHLBI's Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) project. The study population consisted of women and men aged 20-80 years. Study participants were genotyped using the ITMAT/Broad/CARE array, which includes \u223c50 000 cosmopolitan tagged SNPs across \u223c2100 cardiovascular-related genes. Each trait was modeled as a function of age, study site and principal components to control for population stratification, and we conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis. No new loci for WC were observed. For WHR analyses, three novel loci were significantly associated (P < 2.4 \u00d7 10(-6)). Previously unreported rs2811337-G near TMCC1 was associated with increased WHR (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE, 0.048 \u00b1 0.008, P = 7.7 \u00d7 10(-9)) as was rs7302703-G in HOXC10 (\u03b2 = 0.044 \u00b1 0.008, P = 2.9 \u00d7 10(-7)) and rs936108-C in PEMT (\u03b2 = 0.035 \u00b1 0.007, P = 1.9 \u00d7 10(-6)).

The resulting exposure of blood to the atherosclerotic material then triggers thrombus formation, which occludes the artery. The importance of genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is best documented by the predictive value of a positive family history. Next-generation sequencing in families with several affected individuals has revolutionized mutation identification. Here we report the segregation of two private, heterozygous mutations in two functionally related genes, GUCY1A3 (p.Leu163Phefs*24) and CCT7 (p.Ser525Leu), in an extended myocardial infarction family. GUCY1A3 encodes the \u03b11 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (\u03b11-sGC), and CCT7 encodes CCT\u03b7, a member of the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex, which, among other functions, stabilizes soluble guanylyl cyclase. After stimulation with nitric oxide, soluble guanylyl cyclase generates cGMP, which induces vasodilation and inhibits platelet activation. We demonstrate in vitro that mutations in both GUCY1A3 and CCT7 severely reduce \u03b11-sGC as well as \u03b21-sGC protein content, and impair soluble guanylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, platelets from digenic mutation carriers contained less soluble guanylyl cyclase protein and consequently displayed reduced nitric-oxide-induced cGMP formation. Mice deficient in \u03b11-sGC protein displayed accelerated thrombus formation in the microcirculation after local trauma. Starting with a severely affected family, we have identified a link between impaired soluble-guanylyl-cyclase-dependent nitric oxide signalling and myocardial infarction risk, possibly through accelerated thrombus formation. Reversing this defect may provide a new therapeutic target for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Chaperonin Containing TCP-1", "Cyclic GMP", "Disease Susceptibility", "Exome", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Guanylate Cyclase", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Myocardial Infarction", "Nitric Oxide", "Pedigree", "Platelet Activation", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear", "Reproducibility of Results", "Signal Transduction", "Solubility", "Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase", "Thrombosis", "Vasodilation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeanette", "Last Name": "Erdmann", "Affiliation": "1] Institut f\u00fcr Integrative und Experimentelle Genomik, Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck, 23562 L\u00fcbeck, Germany [2] German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Hamburg/L\u00fcbeck/Kiel, 23562 L\u00fcbeck, Germany [3]."}, {"First Name": "Klaus", "Last Name": "Stark", "Affiliation": "1] Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany [2] Department of Genetic Epidemiology, University of Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany [3]."}, {"First Name": "Ulrike B", "Last Name": "Esslinger", "Affiliation": "1] Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Regensburg, 93053 Regensburg, Germany [2] Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM), UMR-S937 Paris, France [3]."}, {"First Name": "Philipp Moritz", "Last Name": "Rumpf", "Affiliation": "1] Deutsches Herzzentrum M\u00fcnchen and 1.

We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index.

However, it is unclear whether this association reflects causal processes. We used 185 common variants recently mapped for plasma lipids (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8) for each) to examine the role of triglycerides in risk for CAD. First, we highlight loci associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, and we show that the direction and magnitude of the associations with both traits are factors in determining CAD risk. Second, we consider loci with only a strong association with triglycerides and show that these loci are also associated with CAD. Finally, in a model accounting for effects on LDL-C and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the strength of a polymorphism's effect on triglyceride levels is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on CAD risk. These results suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins causally influence risk for CAD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Transport", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Humans", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "1] Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A subset of participants from the Penn Diabetes Heart Study (n = 672; mean age 59 \u00b1 8 years; 67% male; 60% Caucasian) underwent a standard 2-h, 75-g OGTT. Insulin sensitivity was estimated using the Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI), and \u03b2-cell function was estimated using the Insulinogenic Index. Multivariable modeling was used to analyze associations between quartiles of each index with coronary artery calcification (CAC) and microalbuminuria. RESULTS The Insulinogenic Index and Matsuda ISI had distinct associations with cardiometabolic risk factors. The top quartile of the Matsuda ISI had a negative association with CAC that remained significant after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (Tobit ratio -0.78 [95% CI -1.51 to -0.05]; P = 0.035), but the Insulinogenic Index was not associated with CAC. Conversely, the highest quartile of the Insulinogenic Index, but not the Matsuda ISI, was associated with lower odds of microalbuminuria (OR 0.52 [95% CI 0.30-0.91]; P = 0.022); however, this association was attenuated in models that included duration of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Lower \u03b2-cell function is associated with microalbuminuria, a microvascular complication, while impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with higher CAC, a predictor of macrovascular complications. Despite these pathophysiological insights, the Matsuda ISI and Insulinogenic Index are unlikely to be translated into clinical use in type 2 diabetes beyond established clinical variables, such as obesity or duration of diabetes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Albuminuria", "Blood Glucose", "Body Mass Index", "Calcinosis", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Glucose Tolerance Test", "Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claire K", "Last Name": "Mulvey", "Affiliation": "Corresponding author: Muredach P.

Tissue and cell specific transcriptome changes during pathophysiological stress in disease cases versus controls and in response to therapies are of particular interest to investigators studying cardiometabolic diseases. Thus, knowledge on the relationships between sequencing depth and detection of transcriptomic variation is needed for designing RNA-Seq experiments and for interpreting results of analyses. Using deeply sequenced Illumina HiSeq 2000 101 bp paired-end RNA-Seq data derived from adipose of a healthy individual before and after systemic administration of endotoxin (LPS), we investigated the sequencing depths needed for studies of gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). In order to detect expressed genes and AS events, we found that \u223c100 to 150 million (M) filtered reads were needed. However, the requirement on sequencing depth for the detection of LPS modulated differential expression (DE) and differential alternative splicing (DAS) was much higher. To detect 80% of events, \u223c300 M filtered reads were needed for DE analysis whereas at least 400 M filtered reads were necessary for detecting DAS. Although the majority of expressed genes and AS events can be detected with modest sequencing depths (\u223c100 M filtered reads), the estimated gene expression levels and exon/intron inclusion levels were less accurate. We report the first study that evaluates the relationship between RNA-Seq depth and the ability to detect DE and DAS in human adipose. Our results suggest that a much higher sequencing depth is needed to reliably identify DAS events than for DE genes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Alternative Splicing",

The average relative coronary artery disease risk increase per each of the multiple blood pressure-raising alleles observed in the consortium was 3.0% for systolic blood pressure-associated polymorphisms (95% confidence interval, 1.8%-4.3%) and 2.9% for diastolic blood pressure-associated polymorphisms (95% confidence interval, 1.7%-4.1%).

To this aim, we introduce a novel strategy, termed Mixed modeling of Meta-Analysis P-values (MixMAP), that draws on a principled statistical modeling framework and the vast array of summary data now available from genetic association studies, to test formally for locus level association. The primary inputs to this approach are: (a) single SNP level p-values for tests of association; and (b) the mapping of SNPs to genomic regions. The output of MixMAP is comprised of locus level estimates and tests of association. In application of MixMAP to summary data from the Global Lipids Gene Consortium, we suggest twelve new loci (PKN, FN1, UGT1A1, PPARG, DMDGH, PPARD, CDK6, VPS13B, GAD2, GAB2, APOH and NPC1) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease and we also demonstrate the potential utility of MixMAP in small data settings.

As a potential mediating mechanism, FGF23 induces left ventricular hypertrophy; however, its role in arterial calcification is less clear. In order to study this, we quantified coronary artery and thoracic aorta calcium by computed tomography in 1501 patients from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study within a median of 376 days (interquartile range 331-420 days) of baseline. Baseline plasma FGF23 was not associated with the prevalence or severity of coronary artery calcium after multivariable adjustment. In contrast, higher serum phosphate levels were associated with prevalence and severity of coronary artery calcium, even after adjustment for FGF23. Neither FGF23 nor serum phosphate were consistently associated with thoracic aorta calcium. We could not detect mRNA expression of FGF23 or its coreceptor, klotho, in human or mouse vascular smooth muscle cells, or normal or calcified mouse aorta. Whereas elevated phosphate concentrations induced calcification in vitro, FGF23 had no effect on phosphate uptake or phosphate-induced calcification regardless of phosphate concentration or even in the presence of soluble klotho. Thus, in contrast to serum phosphate, FGF23 is not associated with arterial calcification and does not promote calcification experimentally.

We also confirmed 10 previously known loci associated with SBP, DBP, MAP or PP (ADRB1, ATP2B1, SH2B3/ATXN2, CSK, CYP17A1, FURIN, HFE, LSP1, MTHFR, SOX6) at array-wide significance (P < 2.4 \u00d7 10(-6)).

We did not find any evidence of association of the two novel SNPs in MDM4 and HRH1 with sequelae of high BP including coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or stroke.

Here, we report an association analysis in 63,746 CAD cases and 130,681 controls identifying 15 loci reaching genome-wide significance, taking the number of susceptibility loci for CAD to 46, and a further 104 independent variants (r(2) < 0.2) strongly associated with CAD at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Together, these variants explain approximately 10.6% of CAD heritability. Of the 46 genome-wide significant lead SNPs, 12 show a significant association with a lipid trait, and 5 show a significant association with blood pressure, but none is significantly associated with diabetes. Network analysis with 233 candidate genes (loci at 10% FDR) generated 5 interaction networks comprising 85% of these putative genes involved in CAD. The four most significant pathways mapping to these networks are linked to lipid metabolism and inflammation, underscoring the causal role of these activities in the genetic etiology of CAD. Our study provides insights into the genetic basis of CAD and identifies key biological pathways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Asian People", "Cell Line", "Coronary Artery
