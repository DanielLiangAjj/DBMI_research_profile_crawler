We examine the effect of protein conformational distributions on 15N chemical shifts for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), comparing QM/MM predicted shifts with experimental shifts in solution as well as frozen distributions. Representative snapshots from MD trajectories exhibit variation in predicted 15N chemical shifts of up to 25 ppm. The average over the fluctuations is in significantly better agreement with room temperature solution experimental values than the prediction for any single optimal conformations.

TIA1 contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are capable of binding nucleic acids and a C-terminal Q/N-rich prion-related domain (PRD) which has been variously described as intrinsically disordered or prion inducing and is believed to play a role in promoting liquid-liquid phase separation connected with the assembly of stress granule formation. Motivated by the fact that our prior work shows RRMs 2 and 3 are well-ordered in an oligomeric full-length form, while RRM1 and the PRD appear to phase separate, the present work addresses whether the oligomeric form is functional and competent for binding, and probes the consequences of nucleic acid binding for oligomerization and protein conformation change. New SSNMR data show that ssDNA binds to full-length oligomeric TIA1 primarily at the RRM2 domain, but also weakly at the RRM3 domain, and Zn 2+ binds primarily to RRM3. Binding of Zn 2+ and DNA was reversible for the full-length wild type oligomeric form, and did not lead to formation of amyloid fibrils, despite the presence of the C-terminal prion-related domain. While TIA1:DNA complexes appear as long \"daisy chained\" structures, the addition of Zn 2+ caused the structures to collapse. We surmise that this points to a regulatory role for Zn 2+ . By occupying various \"half\" binding sites on RRM3 Zn 2+ may shift the nucleic acid binding off RRM3 and onto RRM2. More importantly, the use of different half sites on different monomers may introduce a mesh of crosslinks in the supramolecular complex rendering it compact and markedly reducing the access to the nucleic acids (including transcripts) from solution.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yizhuo", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Keith J", "Last Name": "Fritzsching", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sasha", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ann E", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Jan25"}, {"PMID": "36747635", "Title": "Predicted and Experimental NMR Chemical Shifts at Variable Temperatures: The Effect of Protein Conformational Dynamics.", "Abstract": "NMR chemical shifts provide a sensitive probe of protein structure and dynamics. Prediction of shifts, and therefore interpretation of shifts, particularly for the frequently measured amidic 15 N sites, remains a tall challenge. We demonstrate that protein 15 N chemical shift prediction from QM/MM predictions can be improved if conformational variation is included via MD sampling, focusing on the antibiotic target, E. coli Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Variations of up to 25 ppm in predicted 15 N chemical shifts are observed over the trajectory. For solution shifts the average of fluctuations on the low picosecond timescale results in a superior prediction to a single optimal conformation. For low temperature solid state measurements, the histogram of predicted shifts for locally minimized snapshots with specific solvent arrangements sampled from the trajectory explains the heterogeneous linewidths; in other words, the conformations and associated solvent are 'frozen out' at low temperatures and result in inhomogeneously broadened NMR peaks. We identified conformational degrees of freedom that contribute to chemical shift variation. Backbone torsion angles show high amplitude fluctuations during the trajectory on the low picosecond timescale. For a number of residues, including I60, \u03c8 varies by up to 60\u00ba within a conformational basin during the MD simulations, despite the fact that I60 (and other sites studied) are in a secondary structure element and remain well folded during the trajectory. Fluctuations in \u03c8 appear to be compensated by other degrees of freedom in the protein, including \u03c6 of the succeeding residue, resulting in \"rocking\" of the amide plane with changes in hydrogen bonding interactions.

Crystal structures for FtsZ from some Gram-positive bacteria in the presence of GTP analogs suggest the possibility of a high-energy, \"tense\" conformation. It remains important to elucidate whether this tense form is the dominant form in filaments. Using dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and differential isotopic labeling, we directly detected residues located at the intermonomer interface of GTP-bound wild-type (WT) Escherichia coli FtsZ filaments. We combined chemical shift prediction, homology modeling, and heteronuclear dipolar recoupling techniques to characterize the E. coli FtsZ filament interface and demonstrated that the monomers in active filaments assume a tense conformation. IMPORTANCE Bacterial replication is dependent on the cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, which forms filaments that scaffold and recruit other essential division proteins. While the FtsZ monomer is well studied across organisms, many questions remain about how the filaments form and function. Recently, a second monomer form was identified in Staphylococcus aureus that has far-reaching implications for FtsZ structure and function. However, to date, this form has not been directly observed outside S. aureus. In this study, we used solid-state NMR and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to directly study the filaments of E. coli FtsZ to demonstrate that E. coli FtsZ filaments are primarily composed of this second, \"tense\" form of the monomer.

Since these studies have required mutations, complexation with antibodies, and substitution of detergents in place of lipids, examining the channel under more native conditions is desirable. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) can be used to study the wild-type protein under activating conditions (low pH), at room temperature, and in bacteriomimetic liposomes. In this work, we sought to structurally assign the activated state present in SSNMR experiments. We used a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, chemical shift prediction algorithms, and Bayesian inference techniques to determine which of the most plausible x-ray structures resolved to date best represents the activated state captured in SSNMR. We first identified specific nuclei with simulated NMR chemical shifts that differed significantly when comparing partially open vs fully open ensembles from MD simulations. The simulated NMR chemical shifts for those specific nuclei were then compared to experimental ones, revealing that the simulation of the partially open state was in good agreement with the SSNMR data. Nuclei that discriminate effectively between partially and fully open states belong to residues spread over the sequence and provide a molecular level description of the conformational change.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sergio", "Last Name": "P\u00e9rez-Conesa", "Affiliation": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Eric G", "Last Name": "Keeler", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dongyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lucie", "Last Name": "Delemotte", "Affiliation": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Ann E", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of chemical physics", "PubDate": "2021Apr28"}, {"PMID": "33909608", "Title": "Phe-Gly motifs drive fibrillization of TDP-43's prion-like domain condensates.", "Abstract": "Transactive response DNA-binding Protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) assembles various aggregate forms, including biomolecular condensates or functional and pathological amyloids, with roles in disparate scenarios (e.g., muscle regeneration versus neurodegeneration).

NMR pulse sequences that allow measurement of CSA values in an indirect dimension of a protein correlation spectrum have been employed for aliphatic groups, but for practical reasons, carbonyl functional groups have been little studied, despite the fact that carbonyls are expected to give particularly varied and informative CSA values. Specifically, the wide spectral widths of carbonyl tensors make their measurements difficult with typically attainable spectrometer settings. We present here an extended family of experiments that enable the recovery of static CSA lineshapes in an indirect dimension of magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR experiments, except for various real valued scaling factors. The experiment is suitable for uniformly labeled material, at moderate MAS rates (10 kHz-30 kHz) and at higher magnetic fields (\u03bd0H > 600 MHz). Specifically, the experiments are based on pulse sequence elements from a previous commonly used pulse sequence for CSA measurement, recoupling of chemical shift anisotropy (ROCSA), while modification of scaling factors is achieved by interspersing different blocks of C-elements of the same Cnn 1 cycle. Using experimental conditions similar to the parent ROCSA sequence, a CSA scaling factor between 0 and 0.272 can be obtained, thus allowing a useful practical range of possibilities in experimental conditions for measurement of larger CSA values. Using these blocks, it is also possible to make a constant-time CSA recoupling sequence.

Activation of KcsA is initiated by proton binding to the pH gate upon an intracellular drop in pH. Numerous studies have suggested that this proton binding also prompts a conformational switch, leading to a loss of affinity for potassium ions at the selectivity filter and therefore to channel inactivation. We tested this mechanism for inactivation using a KcsA mutant (H25R/E118A) that exhibits an open pH gate across a broad range of pH values. We present solid-state NMR measurements of this open mutant at neutral pH to probe the affinity for potassium at the selectivity filter. The potassium binding affinity in the selectivity filter of this mutant, 81 mM, is about four orders of magnitude weaker than that of wild-type KcsA at neutral pH and is comparable to the value for wild-type KcsA at low pH (pH \u2248 3.5). This result strongly supports our assertion that the open pH gate allosterically affects the potassium binding affinity of the selectivity filter.

Dynamic nuclear polarization methods enhance the signal-to-noise of solid state NMR experiments by transferring polarization from unpaired electrons of biradicals to nuclei. There has been recent interest in colocalizing the paramagnetic polarizing agents with the analyte of interest through covalent or noncovalent specific interactions. This experimental approach broadens the scope of dynamic nuclear polarization methods by offering the possibility of selective signal enhancements and the potential to work in a broad range of environments. Paramagnetic compounds can have other effects on the NMR spectroscopy of nearby nuclei, including broadening of nuclear resonances due to the proximity of the paramagnetic agent. Understanding the distance dependence of these interactions is important for the success of the technique. Here we explore paramagnetic signal quenching due to a bound biradical, specifically a biradical-derivatized trimethoprim ligand of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase. Biradical-derivatized trimethoprim has nanomolar affinity for its target, and affords strong and selective signal enhancements in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. In this work, we show that, although the trimethoprim fragment is well ordered, the biradical (TOTAPOL) moiety is disordered when bound to the protein. The distance dependence in bleaching of NMR signal intensity allows us to detect numerous NMR signals in the protein. We present the possibility that static disorder and electron spin diffusion play roles in this observation, among other contributions.

Consequently, both the low potassium state and the low pH state of the system could provide useful models for the inactivated state. Unique NMR studies of full-length KcsA in hydrated bilayers provide strong evidence for such a mutual coupling across the bilayer: namely, upon removing ambient potassium ions, changes are seen in the NMR shifts of carboxylates E118 and E120 in the pH gate in the hinges of the inner transmembrane helix (98-103), and in the selectivity filter, all of which resemble changes seen upon acid-induced opening and inhibition and suggest that ion release can trigger channel helix opening.", "Keywords": ["C-type inactivation", "chemical shift assignments", "membrane protein", "protein dynamics", "solid-state NMR"], "MeSH terms": ["Allosteric Site", "Bacterial Proteins", "Carboxylic Acids", "Cell Membrane", "Escherichia coli", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Lipid Bilayers", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Potassium", "Potassium Channels", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benjamin J", "Last Name": "Wylie", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Manasi P", "Last Name": "Bhate", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ann E", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2014Jan07"}, {"PMID": "24228196", "Title": "Navigating the current job market--grab hold of your future now!", "Abstract": "Although the U.S. federal government, the National Science Foundation, and other influential groups have called for American universities to educate and train more scientists, a recent article in the Washington Post and broadcasting on National Public Radio affirmed a harsh reality: there are too few jobs for today's young scientists.

The presence of liposomes is confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy images and the effect of magic angle spinning on liposome packing is shown. High-resolution solid-state NMR spectra of uniformly isotope labeled KcsA in these liposomes reveal that our protocol yields to a very homogenous KcsA sample with high signal to noise and several well-resolved residues in NMR spectra.

Enzyme-substrate binding and dynamics has been an important topic of study for cytochromes P450 because most of the crystal structures of substrate-bound structures show the complex in an inactive state. We have determined a new crystal structure for cytochrome P450 BM-3 in complex with N-palmitoylglycine (NPG), which unexpectedly showed a direct bidentate ion pair between NPG and arginine 47 (R47). We further explored the role of R47, the only charged residue in the binding pocket in cytochrome P450 BM-3, through mutagenesis and crystallographic studies. The mutations of R47 to glutamine (R47Q), glutamic acid (R47E), and lysine (R47K) were designed to investigate the role of its charge in binding and catalysis. The oppositely charged R47E mutation had the greatest effect on activity and binding. The crystal structure of R47E BMP shows that the glutamic acid side chain is blocking the entrance to the binding pocket, accounting for NPG's low binding affinity and charge repulsion. For R47Q and R47K BM-3, the mutations caused only a slight change in kcat and a large change in Km and Kd, which suggests that R47 mostly is involved in binding and that our crystal structure, 4KPA , represents an initial binding step in the P450 cycle.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacillus megaterium", "Binding Sites", "Biocatalysis", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Static Electricity", "Substrate Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jaclyn", "Last Name": "Catalano", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University , 3000 Broadway, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kianoush", "Last Name": "Sadre-Bazzaz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriele A", "Last Name": "Amodeo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ann", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2013Oct01"}, {"PMID": "23435382", "Title": "Characterization of prion-like conformational changes of the neuronal isoform of Aplysia CPEB.", "Abstract": "The neuronal isoform of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) is a regulator of local protein synthesis at synapses and is critical in maintaining learning-related synaptic plasticity in Aplysia.

Solid-state NMR analyses of the fibers indicated a relatively rigid N-terminal prion domain. The fiber form of Aplysia CPEB showed enhanced binding to target mRNAs as compared to the soluble form.
