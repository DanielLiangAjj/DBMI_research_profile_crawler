To understand the pathogenesis of AKI and CKD in preterm humans, we generated potentially novel mouse models with a 30%-70% reduction in nephron number by inhibiting or deleting Ret tyrosine kinase in the developing ureteric bud. These mice developed glomerular and tubular hypertrophy, followed by the transition to CKD, recapitulating the renal pathological changes seen in humans born preterm. We injected neonatal mice with gentamicin, a ubiquitous nephrotoxic exposure in preterm infants, and detected more severe proximal tubular injury in mice with low nephron number compared with controls with normal nephron number. Mice with low nephron number had reduced proliferative repair with more rapid development of CKD. Furthermore, mice had more profound inflammation with highly elevated levels of MCP-1 and CXCL10, produced in part by damaged proximal tubules. Our study directly links low nephron endowment with postnatal renal hypertrophy, which in this model is maladaptive and results in CKD. Underdeveloped kidneys are more susceptible to gentamicin-induced AKI, suggesting that AKI in the setting of low nephron number is more severe and further increases the risk of CKD in this vulnerable population.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Nephrology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Acute Kidney Injury", "Gentamicins", "Hypertrophy", "Infant, Premature", "Kidney", "Nephrons", "Premature Birth", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pamela I", "Last Name": "Good", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Holly A", "Last Name": "Hurst", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Ileana", "Last Name": "Serrano Herrera", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meenakshi", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Qais", "Last Name": "Al-Awqati", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivette D", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Costantini", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fangming", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2023Feb08"}, {"PMID": "33549589", "Title": "Uromodulin fights UTI with sugars.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["cell signaling", "inflammation", "microbiology"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Sugars", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Uromodulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Beenken", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.

We investigated the tubular stress response to hypoxia and demonstrated that a stress responsive transcription factor, FoxO3, was regulated by prolyl hydroxylase. Hypoxia inhibited FoxO3 prolyl hydroxylation and FoxO3 degradation, thus leading to FoxO3 accumulation and activation in tubular cells. Hypoxia-activated Hif-1\u03b1 contributed to FoxO3 activation and functioned to protect kidneys, as tubular deletion of Hif-1\u03b1 decreased hypoxia-induced FoxO3 activation, and resulted in more severe tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis following ischemic injury. Strikingly, tubular deletion of FoxO3 during the AKI to CKD transition aggravated renal structural and functional damage leading to a more profound CKD phenotype. We showed that tubular deletion of FoxO3 resulted in decreased autophagic response and increased oxidative injury, which may explain renal protection by FoxO3.

There are two canonical IC forms: acid-secreting \u03b1-ICs and HCO3-secreting \u03b2-ICs. Chronic acidosis increases \u03b1-ICs at the expense of \u03b2-ICs, thereby increasing net acid secretion by the CCD. We found by growth factor quantitative PCR array that acidosis increases expression of mRNA encoding SDF1 (or CXCL12) in kidney cortex and isolated CCDs from mouse and rabbit kidney cortex. Exogenous SDF1 or pH 6.8 media increased H+ secretion and decreased HCO3 secretion in isolated perfused rabbit CCDs. Acid-dependent changes in H+ and HCO3 secretion were largely blunted by AMD3100, which selectively blocks the SDF1 receptor CXCR4. In mice, diet-induced chronic acidosis increased \u03b1-ICs and decreased \u03b2-ICs. Additionally, IC-specific Cxcr4 deletion prevented IC subtype alterations and magnified metabolic acidosis. SDF1 was transcriptionally regulated and a target of the hypoxia-sensing transcription factor HIF1\u03b1. IC-specific deletion of Hif1a produced no effect on mice fed an acid diet, as \u03b1-ICs increased and \u03b2-ICs decreased similarly to that observed in WT littermates. However, Hif1a deletion in all CCD cells prevented acidosis-induced IC subtype distribution, resulting in more severe acidosis.

Branching regulation is poorly understood, as is the source of a 10-fold variation in nephron number. Notably, low nephron count increases the risk for developing hypertension and renal failure. To better understand the source of this variation, we analyzed the complete gestational trajectory of mouse kidney development. We constructed a computerized architectural map of the branching process throughout fetal life and found that organogenesis is composed of two distinct developmental phases, each with stage-specific rate and morphologic parameters. The early phase is characterized by a rapid acceleration in branching rate and by branching divisions that repeat with relatively reproducible morphology. The latter phase, however, is notable for a significantly decreased yet constant branching rate and the presence of nonstereotyped branching events that generate progressive variability in tree morphology until birth. Our map identifies and quantitates the contribution of four developmental mechanisms that guide organogenesis: growth, patterning, branching rate, and nephron induction. When applied to organs that developed under conditions of malnutrition or in the setting of growth factor mutation, our normative map provided an essential link between kidney architecture and the fundamental morphogenetic mechanisms that guide development.

They exist in two forms; one specialized for acid secretion and the other secretes HCO3 into the urine. We discovered many years ago that feeding animals an acid diet converts the HCO3 secreting form to an acid secreting type. Here I discuss the molecular basis of this transformation. The conversion of the cell types is mediated by an extracellular matrix protein hensin (also known as DMBT1). However much remains to be identified in the differentiation of these cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult Stem Cells", "Animals", "Bicarbonates", "Cell Differentiation", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Tubules, Collecting"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qais", "Last Name": "Al-Awqati", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia University, 630 W 168th Str., New York, NY 10032, USA. qa1@columbia.edu"}], "Journal": "FEBS letters", "PubDate": "2013Jun27"}, {"PMID": "23334395", "Title": "Salt and pepper distribution of cell types in the collecting duct.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aquaporin 2", "Female", "Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase", "Kidney Tubules, Collecting", "Male", "Methyltransferases", "Water-Electrolyte Balance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rosemary V", "Last Name": "Sampogna", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qais", "Last Name": "Al-Awqati", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
