Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors' outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (N = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants' mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White).

Effect modification by sex and romantic attachment style was also explored. Method: Participants were pregnant adolescent and young adult couples recruited from 4 university-affiliated hospitals in Connecticut. Participants self-reported demographics, emergency medical care utilization (emergency room or overnight hospitalization), romantic attachment style, and psychological distress at baseline during the second or third trimester. Multilevel models were estimated to account for interdependence within couples. Results: One's own and one's partner's emergency medical care was associated with higher levels of psychological distress only at low levels of avoidant attachment (-1 SD), B = 2.20, p < .001, and, B = 1.15, p = .097, respectively (associations were not significant at high levels of attachment avoidance, ps > .12). No significant interactions emerged for medical care utilization with sex or attachment anxiety. Conclusions: Emergency medical care utilization during pregnancy was associated with higher psychological distress only for individuals reporting lower avoidant attachment. These individuals may have more resources to deal with distress (e.g., coping, social support), and may therefore also be more capable of experiencing it. Tailoring interventions to bolster healthy romantic attachment and relational wellbeing could improve mental health outcomes in at-risk pregnant adolescent and young adult couples.

To address this gap, I propose Dyadic Disruption Theory to guide research on couples' reactions to acute medical events and their consequences for individual and dyadic mental health, physical health, and behavior.

However, this survival benefit attenuates with increased acculturation to Western lifestyles, potentially due to adoption of unhealthy behaviors. Accordingly, we assessed whether Hispanic ethnicity and linguistic acculturation, as measured by English proficiency, were associated with nonadherence to cardiovascular medications. We enrolled patients presenting to an academic medical center emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome between May 2014 and November 2017. Ethnicity, native language, and English proficiency were self-reported. Cardiovascular medication adherence was assessed using an electronic pill bottle that recorded the date and time of each bottle opening. Generalized linear models with a logit link were used to examine the association of Hispanic ethnicity and English proficiency with daily cardiovascular medication adherence, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and dosing frequency of the electronically-monitored medication. Among 332 included patients, mean age was 61.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.05\u00a0years, 43.07% were women, and 62.95% were Hispanic, of whom 80.38% were native Spanish-speakers. Overall, Hispanics had higher odds of medication adherence than non-Hispanics (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.49, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, among native Spanish-speaking Hispanics, greater English proficiency was associated with lower odds of medication adherence (adjusted OR 0.80 per 1-point increase in English proficiency, 95% CI 0.75-0.86, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Couples were randomized as a dyad into a traditional weight loss program or a program that also included training in providing support to one's partner throughout the weight loss process. Structured conversations between partners about weight management were videotaped at baseline and 6\u00a0months. Participants provided saliva samples before and after the conversations, which were assayed for cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) to determine physiological stress and anxiety responses to conversations about weight. The results indicated that receiving support from one's partner when discussing weight-related issues was associated with greater physiological stress, as indicated by higher cortisol and sAA levels, whereas providing support to one's partner was associated with lower cortisol levels and higher sAA levels. The findings suggest that receiving support is not a universally positive experience, especially for populations facing health issues.

Using a dyadic multilevel linear modeling approach, treating body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) and lung function as paired, within-person outcomes, we tested the hypothesis that persons with more rapid increase in BMI exhibit more rapid decline in lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and their ratio (FEV1:FVC).

We hypothesized that, among partners who were present during the ACE, those who were also present during (1) transportation to the hospital and (2) initial medical treatment would experience greater (a) anxiety early post-event and (b) posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) related to the event 4 months later. The associations between partner presence with patient anxiety and PSS were also explored. Methods: Participants were ACE patients and their partners recruited between March 2015 and December 2016 from the Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) of the Sheba Medical Center in Israel (N = 143; all patients were males and partners were females). Partners self-reported whether or not they were present during the cardiac event, the hospital drive, and initial care. Patients and partners self-reported anxiety in-hospital and PSS, keyed to the ACE, an average of 4 months later. Data were analyzed using General Estimating Equations (GEE) and Multilevel Modeling. Results: Neither patient anxiety nor PSS differed according to partner presence during the drive to the hospital. In contrast, partners had higher anxiety when they were not present at all (difference = 3.65, p = 0.019) and when present during the event and during the drive (difference = 2.93, p = 0.029) as compared to when they were present for the event but not for the drive. Partners who were present during the event, but not the drive, had lower PSS than those who were present for both the event and the drive (difference = -4.64, p = 0.026). Conclusions: Partners who accompany patients on the drive to the hospital may inadvertently put themselves at risk for greater distress following their loved one's cardiac event.

Few data exist on the sedentary behavior patterns of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Methods and Results We characterized patterns of sedentary time and their correlates in 149 patients with acute coronary syndrome over the first month postdischarge, a critical period when lifestyle behaviors are formed. Sedentary time was measured by accelerometry for 28 days postdischarge. Group-based modeling at the day level was used to characterize sedentary patterns. Participants spent a mean of 9.7\u00b12.0\u00a0hours per day sedentary during the 28 days postdischarge, with significant decreases in sedentary time observed in each consecutive week (P<0.01 for all). Three distinct sedentary patterns were identified: high (20.6% of participants), moderate (47.9%), and low (31.5%). The high and moderate sedentary groups spent a mean of 12.6\u00b10.8 and 10.0\u00b10.7\u00a0hours per day sedentary, respectively, and had only minimal decreases in their sedentary time (<3\u00a0minutes per day) over the 28 days. The low sedentary group spent a mean of 7.3\u00b10.8\u00a0hours per day sedentary, with a rapid decrease in sedentary time (14\u00a0minutes per day) observed during the first week postdischarge followed by a relatively smaller decrease (\u22485\u00a0minutes per day) that persisted until day 21 postdischarge.

However, high levels of adherence must be maintained. Lack of access to basic resources (food, transportation, and housing) has been consistently associated with suboptimal ART adherence. Moving beyond such direct effects, this study takes a hierarchical resources approach in which the effects of access to basic resources on ART adherence are mediated through interpersonal resources (social support and care services) and personal resources (self-efficacy). Participants were 915 HIV-positive men and women living in Atlanta, GA, recruited from community centers and infectious disease clinics. Participants answered baseline questionnaires, and provided prospective data on ART adherence. Across a series of nested models, a consistent pattern emerged whereby lack of access to basic resources had indirect, negative effects on adherence, mediated through both lack of access to social support and services, and through lower treatment self-efficacy. There was also a significant direct effect of lack of access to transportation on adherence. Lack of access to basic resources negatively impacts ART adherence. Effects for housing instability and food insecurity were fully mediated through social support, access to services, and self-efficacy, highlighting these as important targets for intervention. Targeting service supports could be especially beneficial due to the potential to both promote adherence and to link clients with other services to supplement food, housing, and transportation. Inability to access transportation had a direct negative effect on adherence, suggesting that free or reduced cost transportation could positively impact ART adherence among disadvantaged populations.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "adherence", "poverty", "self-efficacy", "social support"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Female", "Food Supply", "Georgia", "HIV Infections", "Housing", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Self Efficacy", "Social Support", "Social Work", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Transportation", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Talea", "Last Name": "Cornelius", "Affiliation": "a Department of Psychological Sciences , University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA."}, {"First Name": "Maranda", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "a Department of Psychological Sciences , University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Merly", "Affiliation": "b Institute for Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy, University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandi", "Last Name": "Welles", "Affiliation": "b Institute for Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy, University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA."}, {"First Name": "Moira O", "Last Name": "Kalichman", "Affiliation": "b Institute for Collaboration on Health, Intervention, and Policy, University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA."}, {"First Name": "Seth C", "Last Name": "Kalichman", "Affiliation": "a Department of Psychological Sciences , University of Connecticut , Storrs , CT , USA."}], "Journal": "AIDS care", "PubDate": "2017Apr"}, {"PMID": "27494239", "Title": "Spread of health behaviors in young couples: How relationship power shapes relational influence.", "Abstract": "Romantic relationships provide a context in which partners can influence each other's health behaviors (e.g., weight-related behaviors, substance use).

Such reactive emotional experience may be characterized by frequent and intense fluctuations in emotion, a construct known as \"emotional instability.\" The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between positive emotional instability and weight loss activities in anorexia nervosa, and to investigate the synergistic effects of positive and negative emotional instability on promoting weight loss activities. Using ecological momentary assessment methods, 118 participants with anorexia nervosa reported their emotional experiences and behaviors at least six times daily over 2 weeks using a portable digital device. Using generalized linear modeling, results indicated that high levels of both positive and negative emotional instability, and the interaction between the two, were associated with more frequent weight-loss activities, beyond anorexia subtype and mean levels of emotional intensity. These findings indicate that when women with anorexia exhibit both high levels of both positive and negative emotional instability they are more prone to a variety of weight loss activities.
