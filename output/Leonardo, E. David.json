Arousal is supported by norepinephrine (NE) released from specialized brainstem nuclei, including the locus coeruleus (LC) neurons into cortical and limbic areas. During development, the NE system matures in concert with increased exploration of the animal's environment. While several psychiatric medications target the NE system, the possibility that its modulation during discreet developmental periods can have long-lasting consequences has not yet been explored. We used a chemogenetic strategy in mice to reversibly inhibit NE signaling during brief developmental periods and then evaluated any long-lasting impact of our intervention on adult NE circuit function and on emotional behavior. We also tested whether developmental exposure to the \u03b12 receptor agonist guanfacine, which is commonly used in the pediatric population and is not contraindicated during pregnancy and nursing, recapitulates the effect seen with the chemogenetic strategy. Our results reveal that postnatal days 10-21 constitute a sensitive period during which alterations in NE signaling lead to changes in baseline anxiety, increased anhedonia, and passive coping behaviors in adulthood. Disruption of NE signaling during this sensitive period also caused altered LC autoreceptor function, along with circuit specific changes in LC-NE target regions at baseline, and in response to stress. Our findings indicate an early critical role for NE in sculpting brain circuits that support adult emotional function. Interfering with this role by guanfacine and similar clinically used drugs can have lasting implications for mental health.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Mice", "Humans", "Animals", "Norepinephrine", "Locus Coeruleus", "Guanfacine", "Neurons", "Anxiety"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qingyuan", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab (ADL Lab), Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Dr. Box 87, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alvaro L", "Last Name": "Garcia-Garcia", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab (ADL Lab), Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Dr. Box 87, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Dranovsky", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab (ADL Lab), Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Dr. Box 87, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ad722@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "E David", "Last Name": "Leonardo", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab (ADL Lab), Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Dr. Box 87, New York, NY, 10032, USA. el367@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2023Feb22"}, {"PMID": "35058566", "Title": "Developmental impact of glutamate transporter overexpression on dopaminergic neuron activity and stereotypic behavior.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition that often begins in childhood. Genetic studies in OCD have pointed to SLC1A1, which encodes the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, with evidence suggesting that increased expression contributes to risk. In mice, midbrain Slc1a1 expression supports repetitive behavior in response to dopaminergic agonists, aligning with neuroimaging and pharmacologic challenge studies that have implicated the dopaminergic system in OCD. These findings suggest that Slc1a1 may contribute to compulsive behavior through altered dopaminergic transmission; however, this theory has not been mechanistically tested. To examine the developmental impact of Slc1a1 overexpression on compulsive-like behaviors, we, therefore, generated a novel mouse model to perform targeted, reversible overexpression of Slc1a1 in dopaminergic neurons. Mice with life-long overexpression of Slc1a1 showed a significant increase in amphetamine (AMPH)-induced stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Single-unit recordings demonstrated that Slc1a1 overexpression was associated with increased firing of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, dLight1.1 fiber photometry showed that these behavioral abnormalities were associated with increased dorsal striatum dopamine release. In contrast, no impact of overexpression was observed on anxiety-like behaviors or SKF-38393-induced grooming. Importantly, overexpression solely in adulthood failed to recapitulate these behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that overexpression during development is necessary to generate AMPH-induced phenotypes. However, doxycycline-induced reversal of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression in adulthood normalized both the increased dopaminergic firing and AMPH-induced responses. These data indicate that the pathologic effects of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression on dopaminergic neurotransmission and AMPH-induced stereotyped behavior are developmentally mediated, and support normalization of EAAT3 activity as a potential treatment target for basal ganglia-mediated repetitive behaviors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Compulsive Behavior", "Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3", "Mice", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Stereotyped Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Muhammad O", "Last Name": "Chohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared M", "Last Name": "Kopelman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Translational Neuroscience Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Yueh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeinab", "Last Name": "Fazlali", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natasha", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander Z", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Balsam", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "E David", "Last Name": "Leonardo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edgar R", "Last Name": "Kramer", "Affiliation": "Peninsula Medical School, Faculty of Health, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. jeremy.veenstra@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Susanne E", "Last Name": "Ahmari", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Translational Neuroscience Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. ahmarise@upmc.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "30858462", "Title": "Early life stress delays hippocampal development and diminishes the adult stem cell pool in mice.", "Abstract": "Early life stress predisposes to mental illness and behavioral dysfunction in adulthood, but the mechanisms underlying these persistent effects are poorly understood.

The mechanisms by which early life exposures lead to long-term deficits in neurogenesis remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether targeted ablation of dividing neural stem cells during early life is sufficient to produce long-term decreases in DG neurogenesis. Having previously found that the stem cell lineage is resistant to long-term effects of transient ablation of dividing stem cells during adolescence or adulthood (Kirshenbaum, Lieberman, Briner, Leonardo, & Dranovsky, ), we used a similar pharmacogenetic approach to target dividing neural stem cells for elimination during early life periods sensitive to environmental insults. We then assessed the Nestin stem cell lineage in adulthood. We found that the adult neural stem cell reservoir was depleted following ablation during the first postnatal week, when stem cells were highly proliferative, but not during the third postnatal week, when stem cells were more quiescent. Remarkably, ablating proliferating stem cells during either the first or third postnatal week led to reduced adult neurogenesis out of proportion to the changes in the stem cell pool, indicating a disruption of the stem cell function or niche following stem cell ablation in early life. These results highlight the first three postnatal weeks as a series of sensitive periods during which elimination of dividing stem cells leads to lasting alterations in adult DG neurogenesis and stem cell function.

Hippocampal neurogenesis occurs across the lifespan, however the rate of cell birth is up to 300% higher in adolescent mice compared to adults. Adolescence is a sensitive period in development where emotional circuitry and stress reactivity undergo plasticity establishing life-long set points. Therefore neurogenesis occurring during adolescence may be particularly important for emotional behavior. However, little is known about the function of hippocampal neurons born during adolescence. In order to assess the contribution of neurons born in adolescence to the adult stress response and depression-related behavior, we transiently reduced cell proliferation either during adolescence, or during adulthood in GFAP-Tk mice. We found that the intervention in adolescence did not change adult baseline behavioral response in the forced swim test, sucrose preference test or social affiliation test, and did not change adult corticosterone responses to an acute stressor. However following chronic social defeat, adult mice with reduced adolescent neurogenesis showed a resilient phenotype. A similar transient reduction in adult neurogenesis did not affect depression-like behaviors or stress induced corticosterone. Our study demonstrates that hippocampal neurons born during adolescence, but not in adulthood are important to confer susceptibility to chronic social defeat.", "Keywords": ["GFAP-Tk", "adolescent", "chronic social defeat", "neurogenesis", "resilient"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Greer S", "Last Name": "Kirshenbaum", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sophie R", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamara J", "Last Name": "Briner", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "E David", "Last Name": "Leonardo", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Dranovsky", "Affiliation": "Dranovsky-Leonardo Lab, Department of Psychiatry, Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24465494", "Title": "Global state measures of the dentate gyrus gene expression system predict antidepressant-sensitive behaviors.", "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine are the most common form of medication treatment for major depression.

Previous studies have shown that knockout of 5-HT1A selectively in the raphe leads to higher levels of anxiety during adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether this phenotype is due to variation in receptor levels specifically during development or throughout life. To test the hypothesis that developmental sensitivity may underlie the effects of 5-HT1A on anxiety, we used an inducible transgenic system to selectively suppress 5-HT1A levels in serotonergic raphe neurons from post-natal days (P) 14 to P30, with a maximal reduction of 40% at P21 and return to regular levels by P30. This developmental decrease in receptor levels has long-lasting consequences, increasing anxiety and decreasing social investigation in adulthood. In addition, post-natal knockdown of autoreceptors leads to long-term increases in the excitability of serotonergic neurons, which may represent a mechanism underlying the effects of post-natal receptor variation on behavior later in life. Finally, we also examined the interplay between receptor variation and juvenile exposure to stress (applied from P14 to P21). Similar to receptor knockdown, juvenile exposure to stress led to increased anxiety phenotypes but did not exacerbate 5-HT1A knockdown-mediated anxiety levels. This work indicates that the effects of 5-HT1A autoreceptors on anxiety and social behaviors are developmentally mediated and suggests that natural variations in the expression of 5-HT1A may act during development to influence individual anxiety levels and contribute to susceptibility to anxiety disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Anxiety Disorders", "Autoreceptors", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Inbred CBA", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A", "Social Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zoe R", "Last Name": "Donaldson", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Piel", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tabia L", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Barnard College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jesse", "Last Name": "Richardson-Jones", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "E David", "Last Name": "Leonardo", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheryl G", "Last Name": "Beck", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frances A", "Last Name": "Champagne", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "1] Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA [2] Division of Integrative Neuroscience, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "23336046", "Title": "Rethinking 5-HT1A receptors: emerging modes of inhibitory feedback of relevance to emotion-related behavior.", "Abstract": "The complexities of the involvement of the serotonin transmitter system in numerous biological processes and psychiatric disorders is, to a substantial degree, attributable to the large number of serotonin receptor families and subtypes that have been identified and characterized for over four decades.

Recent research has implicated distinct roles for these two populations of receptors in mediating emotion-related behavior.
