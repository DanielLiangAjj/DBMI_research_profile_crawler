Here, we explored pathological changes in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the familial AD APPV717I mutation after cell injection into the mouse forebrain. APPV717I mutant iPSCs and isogenic controls were differentiated into neurons revealing enhanced A\u03b242 production, elevated phospho-tau, and impaired neurite outgrowth in APPV717I neurons. Two months after transplantation, APPV717I and control neural cells showed robust engraftment but at 12\u00a0months post-injection, APPV717I grafts were smaller and demonstrated impaired neurite outgrowth compared to controls, while plaque and tangle pathology were not seen. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of micro-dissected grafts, performed 2 months after cell injection, identified significantly altered transcriptome signatures in APPV717I iPSC-derived neurons pointing towards dysregulated synaptic function and axon guidance. Interestingly, APPV717I neurons showed an increased expression of genes, many of which are also upregulated in postmortem neurons of AD patients including the transmembrane protein LINGO2. Downregulation of LINGO2 in cultured APPV717I neurons rescued neurite outgrowth deficits and reversed key AD-associated transcriptional changes related but not limited to synaptic function, apoptosis and cellular senescence. These results provide important insights into transcriptional dysregulation in xenografted APPV717I neurons linked to synaptic function, and they indicate that LINGO2 may represent a potential therapeutic target in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Disease modeling", "Grafts", "Induced pluripotent stem cells", "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing", "Transplantation", "iPSCs", "snRNA-seq"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Alzheimer Disease", "Neurons", "Transcriptome", "Animals", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Mice", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Mutation", "Membrane Proteins", "Synapses", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie J", "Last Name": "McInvale", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Mares", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sam", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nelson", "Last Name": "Humala", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trang", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Jakubiak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeong-Yeon", "Last Name": "Mun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas G", "Last Name": "Tedesco", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Syed A", "Last Name": "Hussaini", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus D", "Last Name": "Siegelin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. vm2545@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University, 650W 168th Street, New York, NY, USA. gh2374@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38626772", "Title": "Osteopontin drives neuroinflammation and cell loss in MAPT-N279K frontotemporal dementia patient neurons.", "Abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an incurable group of early-onset dementias that can be caused by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in patient brains.

The need for effective therapies and avenues for disease prevention and monitoring is of paramount importance. Fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases have gained a variety of uses, including informing participant selection for clinical trials, lending confidence to clinical diagnosis and disease staging, determining prognosis, and monitoring therapeutic response. Their role is expected to grow as disease-modifying therapies start to be available to a broader range of patients and as prevention strategies become established. Many of the underlying molecular mechanisms of currently used biomarkers are incompletely understood. Animal models and in vitro systems using cell lines have been extensively employed but face important translatability limitations. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, where a theoretically unlimited range of cell\u00a0types can be reprogrammed from peripheral cells sampled from patients or healthy individuals, has gained prominence over the last decade. It is a promising avenue to study physiological and pathological biomarker function and response to experimental therapeutics. Such systems are amenable to high-throughput drug screening or multiomics readouts such as transcriptomics, lipidomics, and proteomics for biomarker discovery, investigation, and validation. The present review describes the current state of biomarkers in the clinical context of neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. We include a discussion of how iPSC models have been used to investigate and test biomarkers such as amyloid-\u03b2, phosphorylated tau, neurofilament light chain or complement proteins, and even nominate novel biomarkers. We discuss the limitations of current iPSC methods, mentioning alternatives such as coculture systems and three-dimensional organoids which address some of these concerns.

The burden of pathology is most pronounced in the brain stem including the medulla oblongata. Hypoxic/ischemic damage is the most frequent neuropathologic abnormality. Other neuropathologic features include neuronophagia, microglial nodules, and hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases: astrogliosis and microglial reactivity. It is still unknown if these pathologies are secondary to hypoxia versus a combination of inflammatory response combined with hypoxia. It is also unknown how astrocytes react to neuroinflammation in COVID-19, especially considering evidence supporting the neurotoxicity of certain astrocytic phenotypes. This study aims to define the link between astrocytic and microglial pathology in COVID-19 victims in the inferior olivary nucleus, which is one of the most severely affected brain regions in COVID-19, and establish whether COVID-19 pathology is driven by hypoxic damage. Here, we conducted neuropathologic assessments and multiplex-immunofluorescence studies on the medulla oblongata of 18 COVID-19, 10 pre-pandemic patients who died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 7-8 control patients with no ARDS or COVID-19. The comparison of ARDS and COVID-19 allows us to identify whether the pathology in COVID-19 can be explained by hypoxia alone, which is common to both conditions. Our results showed increased olivary astrogliosis in ARDS and COVID-19. However, microglial density and microglial reactivity were increased only in COVID-19, in a region-specific manner. Also, olivary hilar astrocytes increased YKL-40 (CHI3L1) in COVID-19, but to a lesser extent than ARDS astrocytes. COVID-19 astrocytes also showed lower levels of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and Metallothionein-3 in subsets of COVID-19 brain regions. Cluster analysis on immunohistochemical attributes of astrocytes and microglia identified ARDS and COVID-19 clusters with correlations to clinical history and disease course. Our results indicate that olivary glial pathology and neuroinflammation in the COVID-19 cannot be explained solely by hypoxia and suggest that failure of astrocytes to upregulate the anti-inflammatory YKL-40 may contribute to the neuroinflammation. Notwithstanding the limitations of retrospective studies in establishing causality, our experimental design cannot adequately control for factors external to our design.

The identification of RNA-modifying enzymes has opened the possibility of investigating the role epitranscriptomic changes play in the disease process. NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 (NSun2) is one of the few known brain-enriched methyltransferases able to methylate mammalian non-coding RNAs. NSun2 loss of function due to autosomal-recessive mutations has been associated with neurological abnormalities in humans. Here, we show NSun2 is expressed in adult human neurons in the hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex. Strikingly, we unravel decreased NSun2 protein expression and an increased ratio of pTau/NSun2 in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as demonstrated by Western blotting and immunostaining, respectively. In a well-established Drosophila melanogaster model of tau-induced toxicity, reduction of NSun2 exacerbated tau toxicity, while overexpression of NSun2 partially abrogated the toxic effects. Conditional ablation of NSun2 in the mouse brain promoted a decrease in the miR-125b m6A levels and tau hyperphosphorylation. Utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal cultures, we confirmed NSun2 deficiency results in tau hyperphosphorylation. We also found that neuronal NSun2 levels decrease in response to amyloid-beta oligomers (A\u03b2O). Notably, A\u03b2O-induced tau phosphorylation and cell toxicity in human neurons could be rescued by overexpression of NSun2.

Glutamatergic neurons are preferentially affected in AD and pronounced gliosis contributes to the progression of AD in both a cell-autonomous and a non-cell-autonomous manner. Much has been discovered through genetically modified animal models, yet frequently failed translational attempts to clinical applications call for better disease models. Emerging evidence supports the significance of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived brain cells in modeling disease development and progression, opening new avenues for the discovery of molecular mechanisms. This review summarizes the function of different cell types in the pathogenesis of AD, such as neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, and recognizes the potential of utilizing the rapidly growing iPSC technology in modeling AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid", "disease modeling", "induced pluripotent stem cells", "tau"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Neurons", "Brain", "Astrocytes", "Amyloid beta-Peptides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

One of these diseases is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), an early onset dementia and one of the leading causes of dementia in people under the age of 60. FTD is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with pathological accumulation of particular proteins in neurons and glial cells including the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is deposited in its hyperphosphorylated form in about half of all patients with FTD. As for other patients with dementia, there is currently no cure for patients with FTD and thus several lines of research focus on the characterization of underlying pathogenic mechanisms with the goal to identify therapeutic targets. In this review, we provide an overview of reported disease phenotypes in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and glial cells from patients with tau-associated FTD with the aim to highlight recent progress in this fast-moving field of iPSC disease modeling. We put a particular focus on genetic forms of the disease that are linked to mutations in the gene encoding tau and summarize mutation-associated changes in FTD patient cells related to tau splicing and tau phosphorylation, microtubule function and cell metabolism as well as calcium homeostasis and cellular stress. In addition, we discuss challenges and limitations but also opportunities using differentiated patient-derived iPSCs for disease modeling and biomedical research on neurodegenerative diseases including FTD.", "Keywords": ["disease modeling", "frontotemporal dementia (FTD)", "frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)", "induced pluriopotent stem cells", "neurodegenenerative diseases", "neurodegeneration", "tau", "tauopathy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebekka", "Last Name": "K\u00fchn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Aayushi", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cell and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34587990", "Title": "Synchronous supratentorial and infratentorial oligodendrogliomas with incongruous IDH1 mutations, a case report.", "Abstract": "Infratentorial oligodendrogliomas, a rare pathological entity, are generally considered metastatic lesions from supratentorial primary tumors. Here, we report the case of a 23-year-old man presenting with a histopathologically confirmed right precentral gyrus grade 2 oligodendroglioma and a concurrent pontine grade 3 oligodendroglioma. The pontine lesion was biopsied approximately a year after the biopsy of the precentral lesion due to disease progression despite 4 cycles of procarbazine-CCNU-vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy and stable supratentorial disease. Histology and genetic analysis of the pontine biopsy were consistent with grade 3 oligodendroglioma, and comparison of the two lesions demonstrated common 1p/19q co-deletions and TERT promoter mutations but distinct IDH1 mutations, with a non-canonical IDH1 R132G mutation identified in the infratentorial lesion and a R132H mutation identified in the cortical lesion. Initiation of Temozolomide led to complete response of the supratentorial lesion and durable disease control, while Temozolomide with subsequent radiation therapy of 54\u00a0Gy in 30 fractions resulted in partial response of the pontine lesion. This case report supports possible distinct molecular pathogenesis in supratentorial and infratentorial oligodendrogliomas and raises questions about the role of different IDH1 mutant isoforms in explaining treatment resistance to different chemotherapy regimens.

Developmentally, interneurons migrate from a distal progenitor domain in order to populate the neocortex - a process that occurs at a slower rate in humans than in mice. In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures. Moreover, pre-treatment of human stem cell-derived interneurons (hSC-interneurons) with SPARC and SerpinE1 prior to transplantation into neonatal mouse cortex enhanced their migration and morphological elaboration in the host cortex. Further, SPARC and SerpinE1-treated hSC-interneurons also exhibited more mature electrophysiological characteristics compared to controls.

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

Adult-onset cases have been infrequently reported. While typically benign, TAs may be locally aggressive. Complete physical examination and hematological workup are recommended in patients with TA to exclude the presence of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP). The authors describe the case of a 69-year-old man with a contrast-enhancing frontal lobe lesion, with surrounding vasogenic edema, which was treated by gross-total resection. Characteristic histological features of a TA were demonstrated, with multiple cannonball-like tufts of densely packed capillaries emanating from intraparenchymal vessels in cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter. Tumor recurrence was detected after 4 months and treated with adjuvant Gamma Knife radiosurgery. To the extent of the authors' knowledge, this case illustrates the first report of TA presenting in an adult as an intracranial intraaxial tumor without associated KMP.

We provide evidence that the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-R (TNR) - which is predominantly expressed by a subpopulation of interneurons - plays a role in the generation of GABAergic and granule neurons in the murine dentate gyrus by regulating fate determination of neural stem or progenitor cells (NSCs). During development, absence of TNR in constitutively TNR-deficient (TNR(-/-)) mice results in increased numbers of dentate gyrus GABAergic neurons, decreased expression of its receptor \u03b21 integrin, increased activation of p38 MAPK and increased expression of the GABAergic specification gene Ascl1. Postnatally, increased GABAergic input to adult hippocampal NSCs in TNR(-/-) mice is associated not only with increased numbers of GABAergic and, particularly, parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons, as seen during development, but also with increased numbers of granule neurons, thus contributing to the increased differentiation of NSCs into granule cells. These findings indicate the importance of TNR in the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest that TNR acts through distinct direct and indirect mechanisms during development and in the adult.", "Keywords": ["Dentate gyrus", "Extracellular matrix", "Mouse", "Neural stem cells", "Neurogenesis", "Tenascin-R"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Dentate Gyrus", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Embryonic Development", "Extracellular Matrix", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Hippocampus", "Mice", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Stem Cells", "Tenascin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jin-Chong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zentrum f\u00fcr Molekulare Neurobiologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20246 Hamburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mei-Fang", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Jakovcevski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Sivukhina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yi-Fang", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrey", "Last Name": "Irintchev", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melitta", "Last Name": "Schachner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Bernreuther", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of cell science", "PubDate": "2014Feb01"}, {"PMID": "24306942", "Title": "Human stem cell models of neurodegeneration: a novel approach to study mechanisms of disease development.", "Abstract": "The number of patients with neurodegenerative diseases is increasing significantly worldwide. Thus, intense research is being pursued to uncover mechanisms of disease development in an effort to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Analysis of postmortem tissue from patients has yielded important histological and biochemical markers of disease progression. However, this approach is inherently limited because it is not possible to study patient neurons prior to degeneration. As such, transgenic and knockout models of neurodegenerative diseases are commonly employed. While these animal models have yielded important insights into some molecular mechanisms of disease development, they do not provide the opportunity to study mechanisms of neurodegeneration in human neurons at risk and thus, it is often difficult or even impossible to replicate human pathogenesis with this approach. The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells offers a unique opportunity to overcome these obstacles. By expanding and differentiating iPS cells, it is possible to generate large numbers of functional neurons in vitro, which can then be used to study the disease of the donating patient. Here, we provide an overview of human stem cell models of neurodegeneration using iPS cells from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Rarely, ganglioglioma develop in cranial nerves, almost exclusively in the optic pathway, where they usually present as singular space-occupying masses. Here, we report on an 83-year-old patient who presented with unusual symmetrical, bilateral gangliogliomas of the trigeminal nerves. These tumors showed an exophytic growth within the subarachnoid space toward the Gasserian ganglion and surprisingly appeared as isointense masses on T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Due to their bilateral appearance, we performed array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on the gangliogliomas to address the possibility of an underlying tumor syndrome in this patient.

We demonstrate that gene correction resulted in phenotypic rescue in differentiated neurons and uncovered expression changes associated with LRRK2 G2019S. We found that LRRK2 G2019S induced dysregulation of CPNE8, MAP7, UHRF2, ANXA1, and CADPS2. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that four of these genes contribute to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. LRRK2 G2019S induced increased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) phosphorylation. Transcriptional dysregulation of CADPS2, CPNE8, and UHRF2 was dependent on ERK activity.
