Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been suggested to facilitate this outcome. We aimed to compare the clinical and radiographic failure and success rates of MTA and rhBMP2 as pulpotomy medicaments. Materials and Methods: Sixty-eight teeth from 3-6-year-old children were randomly assigned to two groups using a split-mouth design. Cervical pulpotomy was performed using MTA in one group and rhBMP2 in the other. Subsequently, the teeth were restored with stainless-steel crowns. Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-up intervals to evaluate success and failure rates. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P<0.05) Results: At six and nine months, one tooth in the BMP2 group and one tooth in the MTA group showed internal resorption, respectively. After 12 months, one tooth in the BMP2 group exhibited PDL widening. The radiographic success rate was 100% for the MTA- and 97.1% for the BMP2-group at six months, 96.7% for both groups at nine months, and 96.7% and 93.3%, respectively, at 12 months. No clinical failure criteria were observed in any of the teeth. Survival analysis revealed no significant difference between the two groups.

This research particularly focuses on hydrocarbon polymeric materials, such as asphalt binders. Ten different asphalt materials with distinct fracture characteristics were investigated. An innovative integrated experimental-computational framework coupling acoustic emissions (AE) approach in conjunction with a machine learning-based Digital Image Analysis (DIA) method was employed to precisely determine the crack geometry and characterize the material fracture behavior. Cylindrical-shaped samples (25 mm in diameter and 20 mm in height) bonded to a rigid substrate were employed as the testing specimens. A cooling rate of -1 \u00b0C/min was applied to produce the spiral cracks. Various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and regression were utilized in the DIA to automatically analyze the spiral patterns. A new parameter, \"Spiral Cracking Energy (ESpiral)\", was introduced to assess the fracture performance of soft adhesives. The compact tension (CT) test was conducted at -20 \u00b0C with a loading rate of 0.2 mm/min to determine the material's fracture energy (Gf). The embrittlement temperature (TEMB) of the material was measured by performing an AE test. This study explored the relationship between the spiral tightness parameter (\"b\"), ESpiral, Gf, and TEMB of the material. The findings of this study showed a strong positive correlation between the ESpiral and fracture energies of the asphalt materials.

Here, we use the FlyWire adult whole-brain connectome to identify inputs to visual Kenyon cells. The types of visual neurons we identify are similar across hemispheres and connectomes with certain inputs highly overrepresented. Many visual projection neurons presynaptic to Kenyon cells receive input from large swathes of visual space, while local visual interneurons, providing smaller fractions of input, receive more spatially restricted signals that may be tuned to specific features of the visual scene. Like olfactory Kenyon cells, visual Kenyon cells receive sparse inputs from different combinations of visual channels, including inputs from multiple optic lobe neuropils. The sets of inputs to individual visual Kenyon cells are consistent with random sampling of available inputs. These connectivity patterns suggest that visual coding in the mushroom body, like olfactory coding, is sparse, distributed, and combinatorial.

Umklapp scattering is identified as the origin of momentum loss due to e-e scattering in dense metals. However, in dilute metals like lightly doped strontium titanate, the origin of T-square electrical resistivity in the absence of umklapp events is yet to be pinned down. Here, by separating electron and phonon contributions to heat transport, we extract the electronic thermal resistivity in niobium-doped strontium titanate and show that it also displays a T-square temperature dependence. Its amplitude correlates with the T-square electrical resistivity.

Methodology: We aim to review focus on governing and constitutive equations describing MCC geometry followed by description of mathematical modeling of ciliary forces, mucus rheology properties, and numerical approaches to solve modified time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations. We also review mathematical modeling of particle deposition in ASL influenced by MCC, particle transport in ASL in terms of Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches, and discuss the corresponding mass transport issues in this layer.

Results: Results indicate that mean mucus and periciliary liquid velocities are strongly influenced by mucus rheological characteristics as well as ciliary abnormalities. However, most of the currently available literature on mucus fiber spacing, ciliary beat frequency, and particle surface chemistry is based on particle deposition on ASL by considering a fixed value of ASL velocity. The effects of real ASL flow regimes on particle deposition in this layer are limited.

Our hardware-agnostic approach incorporates photoreceptor models within the framework of the principle of univariance. This enables experimenters to identify the most effective way to combine multiple light sources to create desired distributions of light, and thus easily construct relevant stimuli for mapping the colour space of an organism.

Here, we show that the amplitude of the THE is extremely sensitive to stoichiometry. It drastically decreases upon substitution of a tiny fraction of Sr atoms with Ca, which stabilizes the ferroelectric order. It drastically increases by an even lower density of oxygen vacancies, which turn the system to a dilute metal. The enhancement in the metallic state exceeds by far the sum of the electronic and the phononic contributions. We explain this observation as an outcome of three features: 1) Heat is mostly transported by phonons; 2) the electronic Hall angle is extremely large; and 3) there is substantial momentum exchange between electrons and phonons. Starting from Herring's picture of phonon drag, we arrive to a quantitative account of the enhanced THE. Thus, phonon drag, hitherto detected as an amplifier of thermoelectric coefficients, can generate a purely thermal transverse response in a dilute metal with a large Hall angle. Our results reveal a hitherto-unknown consequence of momentum-conserving collisions between electrons and phonons.", "Keywords": ["Hall angle", "dilute metal", "phonon drag", "quantum paralectric", "thermal Hall effect"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physique et d'\u00c9tude des Mat\u00e9riaux, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de la Physique et de la Chimie Industrielles (ESPCI) Paris-CNRS-Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, PSL University, 75005 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Xiaokang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physique et d'\u00c9tude des Mat\u00e9riaux, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de la Physique et de la Chimie Industrielles (ESPCI) Paris-CNRS-Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, PSL University, 75005 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Beno\u00eet", "Last Name": "Fauqu\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Jeunes Equipes de l'Institut de Physique (JEIP), Unit\u00e9 de Service et de Recherche (USR) 3573 CNRS, Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) University, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France."}, {"First Name": "Kamran", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physique et d'\u00c9tude des Mat\u00e9riaux, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de la Physique et de la Chimie Industrielles (ESPCI) Paris-CNRS-Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, PSL University, 75005 Paris, France."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2022Aug30"}, {"PMID": "35965719", "Title": "Efficacy of Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound for Orthodontic Pain Control: A Randomized Clinical Trial.", "Abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) for orthodontic pain control. Materials and Methods: This spilt-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on 44 mandibular first molars of 22 orthodontic patients at the Orthodontics Department of Shahid Beheshti Dental University. Elastomeric separators were placed at the mesial and distal of mandibular right and left first molars by separating pliers. Randomly, LIPUS was used at one side for 7 min and the same device with 0-degree intensity was used as sham for the other side on the facial skin. The same procedure was repeated after 24 h. Patients recorded their level of pain at 1, 6, and 24 h, and also on days 2 to 7 after, using a visual analog scale (VAS). Results: The effect of type of treatment (P=0.019), time of assessment (P<0.000) and the interaction effect of type of treatment and time of assessment (P=0.055) on the pain score were all significant. The mean pain score in the LIPUS group was significantly lower than that in the control group at 24 h (P=0.002), 4 days (P=0.031) and 5 days (P=0.035).

However, motor behavior in adults with ASD has scarcely been quantitatively characterized. In this pilot study, we aim to quantitatively examine motor signature of adults with ASD without intellectual impairment using marker-less visual-perceptive motion capture. 82 individuals (37 ASD and 45 healthy controls, HC) with an IQ\u2009>\u200985 and aged 18 to 65\u00a0years performed nine movement tasks and were filmed by a 3D-infrared camera. Anatomical models were quantified via custom-made software and resulting kinematic parameters were compared between individuals with ASD and HCs. Furthermore, the association between specific motor behaviour and severity of autistic symptoms (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2, Autism Spectrum Quotient) was explored. Adults with ASD showed a greater mediolateral deviation while walking, greater sway during normal, tandem and single leg stance, a reduced walking speed and cadence, a greater arrhythmicity during jumping jack tasks and an impaired manual dexterity during finger tapping tasks (p\u2009<\u20090.05 and |D|>\u20090.48) compared to HC. Furthermore, in the ASD group, some of these parameters correlated moderately to severity of ASD symptoms. Adults with ASD seem to display a specific motor signature in this disorder affecting movement timing and aspects of balance. The data appear to reinforce knowledge about motor signs reported in children and adolescents with ASD. Also, quantitative motor assessment via visual-perceptive computing may be a feasible instrument to detect subtle motor signs in ASD and perhaps suitable in the diagnosis of ASD in the future.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Apraxias", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Gait", "Humans", "Pilot Projects"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "An Bin", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Berlin, Germany. an-bin.cho@charite.de."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Otte", "Affiliation": "Motognosis GmbH, Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee 177, 10119, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Irina", "Last Name": "Baskow", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Felicitas", "Last Name": "Ehlen", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tolou", "Last Name": "Maslahati", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Mansow-Model", "Affiliation": "Motognosis GmbH, Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee 177, 10119, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tanja", "Last Name": "Schmitz-H\u00fcbsch", "Affiliation": "Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Lindenberger Weg 80, 13125, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Behnoush", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Roepke", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203, Berlin, Germany."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2022May10"}, {"PMID": "35363150", "Title": "Proposal for Post Hoc Quality Control in Instrumented Motion Analysis Using Markerless Motion Capture: Development and Usability Study.", "Abstract": "Instrumented assessment of motor symptoms has emerged as a promising extension to the clinical assessment of several movement disorders.

The viral genome of positive-strand RNA viruses is infectious, as it produces infectious virus upon introduction into a cell. VEEV is a select agent and samples containing viral RNA are subject to additional regulations due to their infectious nature. Therefore, RNA isolated from cells infected with BSL-3 select agent strains of VEEV or other positive-strand viruses must be inactivated before removal from high-containment laboratories. In this study, we tested the inactivation of the viral genome after RNA fragmentation or cDNA synthesis, using the Trinidad Donkey and TC-83 strains of VEEV. We successfully inactivated VEEV genomic RNA utilizing these two protocols. Our cDNA synthesis method also inactivated the genomic RNA of eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses (EEEV and WEEV). We also tested whether the purified VEEV genomic RNA can produce infectious virions in the absence of transfection.

The effect is absent in antimony, which has an identical crystal symmetry, a similar Fermi surface structure and equally ballistic carriers, but an inverted band symmetry and a topological invariant of opposite sign.

These lesions show varying degrees of FDG uptake. Malignancies are generally more FDG avid than are benign lesions, but many exceptions exist. Although aggressive lesions tend to be more FDG avid than nonaggressive lesions, this concept holds true particularly for lesions of the same histologic subtype. In addition, some benign osseous processes such as Paget disease have variable degrees of FDG avidity on the basis of disease metabolic activity. This creates a diagnostic dilemma for radiologists and clinicians, especially in patients with known malignancies, and can result in unnecessary diagnostic imaging or interventions for incidental osseous lesions. Evaluation of morphologic CT characteristics of osseous lesions at FDG PET/CT can be a valuable adjunct to metabolic analysis to further characterize lesions, enhance diagnostic and staging accuracy, and avoid unnecessary invasive biopsy procedures. The authors review the common primary and metastatic bone lesions at FDG PET/CT, with an emphasis on morphologic CT assessment of lesions to help narrow the differential diagnosis. Imaging manifestations of common incidental nonneoplastic bone lesions at FDG PET/CT are discussed to provide information on differentiation of these lesions from osseous neoplasms.

This study investigates how oxytocin influences the acquisition and consolidation of trauma-associated memories and whether these effects are influenced by individual neurobiological and genetic differences. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 220 healthy women received either a single dose of intranasal 24IU oxytocin or a placebo before exposure to a trauma film paradigm that solicits intrusive memories. We used a \"general random forest\" machine learning approach to examine whether differences in the noradrenergic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders, and genetic polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor influence the effect of oxytocin on the acquisition and consolidation of intrusive memories. Oxytocin induced significantly more intrusive memories than placebo did (t(188.33)\u2009=\u20092.12, p\u2009=\u20090.035, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% CI 0.16-0.44). As hypothesized, we found that the effect of oxytocin on intrusive memories was influenced by biological covariates, such as salivary cortisol, heart rate variability, and PTSD polygenic risk scores. The five factors that were most relevant to the oxytocin effect on intrusive memories were included in a Poisson regression, which showed that, besides oxytocin administration, higher polygenic loadings for PTSD and major depressive disorder were directly associated with a higher number of reported intrusions after exposure to the trauma film stressor. These results suggest that intranasal oxytocin amplifies the acquisition and consolidation of intrusive memories and that this effect is modulated by neurobiological and genetic factors.

Here we measured the filtering properties of neural inputs to the OFF motion-detecting T5 cell in Drosophila. We report state- and stimulus-dependent changes in the shape of these signals, which become more biphasic under specific conditions. Summing these inputs within the framework of a connectomic-constrained model of the circuit demonstrates that these shapes are sufficient to explain T5 responses to various motion stimuli.

Such critical fluctuations usually occur in a very narrow temperature window in contrast to Gaussian fluctuations. Here, we report on a study of specific heat in graphite subject to a high magnetic field when all carriers are confined in the lowest Landau levels. The observation of a BCS-like specific heat jump in both temperature and field sweeps establishes that the phase transition discovered decades ago in graphite is of the second order. The jump is preceded by a steady field-induced enhancement of the electronic specific heat. A modest (20%) reduction in the amplitude of the magnetic field (from 33 to 27\u00a0T) leads to a threefold decrease of T_{c} and a drastic widening of the specific heat anomaly, which acquires a tail spreading to two times T_{c}. We argue that the steady departure from the mean-field BCS behavior is the consequence of an exceptionally large Ginzburg number in this dilute metal, which grows steadily as the field lowers.

Whole-body imaging extending from the vertex of the head to the toes is considered the standard 18F-FDG PET/CT protocol for Merkel cell carcinoma, though the evidence establishing this standard is scant. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical impact of PET/CT of the lower extremities in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 101 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (mean age, 70.9 years) who underwent whole-body PET/CT were included. PET/CT findings in the lower extremities were evaluated on a per-patient basis, and the results were compared between patients with the primary lesion in the lower extremities (lower extremity primary) and those with the primary lesion located between the head and inguinal regions (body primary). Subsequent clinical evaluation and follow-up imaging were used as the reference standard. RESULTS. In the lower extremity (n = 22) and body (n = 79) primary groups, five and eight patients had true metastases in the lower extremities (p = .15). In the body primary group, all metastases in the lower extremities were part of widespread metastases in the body. In contrast, three of five patients (60%) in the lower extremity primary group had isolated metastases in the lower extremities, which differed significantly from the rate in the body primary group (p = .04). Subgroup analysis that included 48 patients who underwent initial staging examinations showed no metastases in the lower extremities regardless of primary location. CONCLUSION.

Six different scenarios including a baseline scenario (landfilling) were applied for NSW waste management for energy production and their impacts on environment. The initial results showed that the scenario 3 that employed anaerobic digestion for food waste, incineration for combustible waste and plastic waste, and landfilling for non-combustible waste produced electricity of 625\u00a0kWh/t, which was maximum compared to the other scenarios. LCA results further suggested that among all scenarios, scenario 5 (similar to scenario 3 except combustible waste was treated through gasification and plastic waste was recycled) has the lowest level of environmental burdens in global warming, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity. The sensitivity analysis for energy conversion rates (23-30%) for incineration and plastic recycling rate (66-91.3%) for MSW was further conducted and the results showed that energy conversion rate of 30% makes scenario 3 more valuable for electricity generation and less impactful for ecosystems damage category compared to scenario 5. On the other hand, plastic recycling rate of 91.3% has the lowest environmental burdens and by decreasing recycling rate to 66% the environmental impacts increase; however, it was noticed that reduction in recycling rate does not make any change in the order of scenarios.

At this critical field, hole and electron Landau subbands simultaneously cross the Fermi level and allow exciton formation. By quantifying the effective mass and the spatial separation of the excitons in the basal plane, we show that the degeneracy temperature of the excitonic fluid corresponds to this critical temperature.

Although PTB and pPROM have common etiologies, they arise from distinct pathophysiologic pathways. Inflammation is a common underlying mechanism in both conditions. Balanced inflammation is required for fetoplacental growth; however, overwhelming inflammation (physiologic at term and pathologic at preterm) can lead to term and preterm parturition. A lack of effective strategies to control inflammation and reduce the risk of PTB and pPROM suggests that there are several modes of the generation of inflammation which may be dependent on the type of uterine tissue. The avascular fetal membrane (amniochorion), which provides structure, support, and protection to the intrauterine cavity, is one of the key contributors of inflammation. Localized membrane inflammation helps tissue remodeling during pregnancy. Two unique mechanisms that generate balanced inflammation are the progressive development of senescence (aging) and cyclic cellular transitions: epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial (MET). The intrauterine build-up of oxidative stress at term or in response to risk factors (preterm) can accelerate senescence and promote a terminal state of EMT, resulting in the accumulation of inflammation. Inflammation degrades the matrix and destabilizes membrane function. Inflammatory mediators from damaged membranes are propagated via extracellular vesicles (EV) to maternal uterine tissues and transition quiescent maternal uterine tissues into an active state of labor. Membrane inflammation and its propagation are fetal signals that may promote parturition. This review summarizes the mechanisms of fetal membrane cellular senescence, transitions, and the generation of inflammation that contributes to term and preterm parturitions.", "Keywords": ["Amniochorion", "Cytokines", "EMT", "Exosome", "Fetal membranes", "Inflammation", "Mesenchymal cells", "Progesterone", "p38MAPK"], "MeSH terms": ["Extraembryonic Membranes", "Female", "Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Inflammation", "Inflammation Mediators", "Pregnancy", "Premature Birth"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ramkumar", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Perinatal Research Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine & Perinatal Research, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, MRB 11.138, 301 301 University Blvd, Galveston, TX, 77555-1062, USA. ra2menon@utmb.edu."}, {"First Name": "Faranak", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, UT Health, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jossimara", "Last Name": "Polettini", "Affiliation": "Universidade Federal da Fronteira Sul, Campus Passo Fundo, Rua Capit\u00e3o Araujo, 20, Centro, Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Lauren S", "Last Name": "Richardson", "Affiliation": "Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Perinatal Research Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine & Perinatal Research, The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, MRB 11.138, 301 301 University Blvd, Galveston, TX, 77555-1062, USA."}], "Journal": "Seminars in immunopathology", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32737301", "Title": "T-square resistivity without Umklapp scattering in dilute metallic Bi2O2Se.", "Abstract": "Fermi liquids (FLs) display a quadratic temperature (T) dependent resistivity.

For Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1), zinc stabilizes the native structure of each Sod1 monomer, promotes homo-dimerization and plays an important role in activity by \"softening\" the active site so that copper cycling between Cu(I) and Cu(II) can rapidly occur. Previously, we have reported that binding of Sod1 by its copper chaperone (Ccs) stabilizes a conformation of Sod1 that promotes site-specific high-affinity zinc binding. While there are a multitude of Sod1 mutations linked to the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), characterizations by multiple research groups have been unable to realize strong commonalities among mutants. Here, we examine a set of fALS-linked Sod1 mutations that have been well-characterized and are known to possess variation in their biophysical characteristics. The zinc affinities of these mutants are evaluated here for the first time and then compared with the previously established value for wild-type Sod1 zinc affinity. Ccs does not have the same ability to promote zinc binding to these mutants as it does for the wild-type version of Sod1.

Approximately 40% of MCC patients have nodal or distant metastasis at initial presentation, and one-third of patients will develop distant metastatic disease over their clinical course. Although MCC is rare, its incidence has been steadily increasing. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of MCC and its diagnostic and therapeutic application have made MCC one of the most rapidly developing topics in dermatology and oncology. Owing to the aggressive and complex nature of MCC, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for management of this tumor, including dermatologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and nuclear medicine physicians. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis, planning for surgery or radiation therapy, and assessment of treatment response and surveillance. However, MCC is still not well recognized among radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians, likely owing to its rarity. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness of MCC among imaging experts by describing the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of MCC and current clinical management with a focus on the role of imaging. The authors highlight imaging findings characteristic of MCC, as well as the clinical significance of CT, MRI, sentinel lymph node mapping, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT, and other nuclear medicine studies such as bone scintigraphy and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. \u00a9RSNA, 2019.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Viral", "Bone Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Merkel Cell", "Humans", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Merkel cell polyomavirus", "Neoplasm Staging", "Oncogene Proteins", "Polyomavirus Infections", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Prognosis", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Receptors, Somatostatin", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Skin Neoplasms", "Tumor Virus Infections", "Viral Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gensuke", "Last Name": "Akaike", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology (G.A., F.B.), and Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine (T.A., K.L., P.N.), University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St, Box 356113, Seattle, WA 98195-6113; and Department of Radiology, Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, Va (S.A.F.)."}, {"First Name": "Tomoko", "Last Name": "Akaike", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology (G.A., F.B.), and Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine (T.A., K.L., P.N.), University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St, Box 356113, Seattle, WA 98195-6113; and Department of Radiology, Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, Va (S.A.F.)."}, {"First Name": "Shaimaa A", "Last Name": "Fadl", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology (G.A., F.B.), and Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine (T.A., K.L., P.N.), University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St, Box 356113, Seattle, WA 98195-6113; and Department of Radiology, Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, Va (S.A.F.)."}, {"First Name": "Kristina", "Last Name": "Lachance", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology (G.A., F.B.), and Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine (T.A., K.L., P.N.), University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St, Box 356113, Seattle, WA 98195-6113; and Department of Radiology, Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, Va (S.A.F.)."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Nghiem", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology (G.A., F.B.), and Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine (T.A., K.L., P.N.), University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St, Box 356113, Seattle, WA 98195-6113; and Department of Radiology, Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, Va (S.A.F.)."}, {"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology (G.A., F.B.), and Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine (T.A., K.L., P.N.), University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St, Box 356113, Seattle, WA 98195-6113; and Department of Radiology, Virginia Commonwealth University Health System, Richmond, Va (S.A.F.)."}], "Journal": "Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc", "PubDate": "2019Nov-Dec"}, {"PMID": "31519373", "Title": "Benzothiazole-based compounds as potent endothelial lipase inhibitors.", "Abstract": "A series of benzothiazoles with a cyano group was synthesized and evaluated as endothelial lipase (EL) inhibitors for the potential treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

vaccines are announcing themselves as the future of melanoma treatment. Herein, high immunogenic regions of transmembrane protein 31 (TMEM31) antigen were selected according to cytotoxic T lymphocytes' (CTL) epitopes and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding affinity through in silico analyses. The 32-62, 77-105, and 125-165 residues of the TMEM31 were selected as the immunodominant fragments. They were linked together by RVRR and HEYGAEALERAG motifs to improve epitopes separation and presentation. In addition, to activate helper T lymphocytes (HTL), Pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) peptide sequence and tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFrC) were incorporated into the final construct. Also, the Beta-defensin conserved domain was utilized in the final construct as a novel adjuvant for Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor (TLR4-MD) activation. The CTL epitopes, cleavage sites, post-translational modifications, TAP transport efficiency, and B cells epitopes were predicted for the peptide vaccine. The final construct contained multiple CTL and B cell epitopes. In addition, it showed 93.55% and 99.13% population coverage in the world for HLA I and HLA II, respectively. According to these preliminary results, the multiepitope cancer vaccine can be an appropriate choice for further experimental investigations.", "Keywords": ["Cancer vaccine", "Cancer/testis antigen", "In silico", "Melanoma", "TMEM31"], "MeSH terms": ["Cancer Vaccines", "Computer Simulation", "DNA", "Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "Humans", "Malaria Vaccines", "Melanoma", "Membrane Proteins", "Peptide Fragments", "Peptides", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer", "Tetanus Toxin", "Vaccines, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashkan", "Last Name": "Safavi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.

Here we report an unusual case of recurrent hypoglycemia in a 53-year-old woman with TS. Biochemical work-up following a 72h fast revealed detectable, inappropriate for low glucose insulin levels and elevated proinsulin and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) levels. MR and multiphase CT showed a solid 2.5 cm pancreatic tail mass with absent uptake in the 111In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan) scan. Subsequent hepatic vein blood sampling after intra-arterial calcium stimulation showed sharp increase in insulin and modest increase in proinsulin levels. The patient underwent excision of the mass with resolution of symptoms. Histopathologic examination confirmed the neuroendocrine etiology of the tumor. This is, to our knowledge, the third report of TS and concomitant insulinoma. Impaired counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia in patients with TS may result in symptomatic hypoglycemia with only mild insulin elevation and elevated proinsulin in setting of hypoglycemia may be the only indication of insulinoma in these patients.

Radial pulsations of a cluster of encapsulated microbubbles under the action of an ultrasound field are complex and highly nonlinear, particularly for drug and gene delivery applications with high acoustic pressure amplitudes. In this paper, based on Qin-Ferrara's model (Qin and Ferrara, 2010), the complete synchronization and cluster formation in targeted microbubbles network are studied. Also, association schemes as a novel approach are suggested for finding a relationship between coupled microbubbles elements which are immersed in blood or surrounding soft tissue. A significant advantage of this method is that the stability of the synchronized state (or symmetric eigenmode of mutual bubble oscillation) with respect to another state (another eigenmode) can now predict. More interestingly, we find a significant relationship between an isolated and multiple microbubbles. The results show that the problem of studying the dynamics of encapsulated microbubble cluster at synchronization state is dependent on the dynamical characteristics of isolated cases, shell thickness, density. Also, the distance between microbubbles has an important role in their synchronous modes.", "Keywords": ["Associated scheme", "Bose-Mesner algebra", "Encapsulated microbubbles", "Globally coupled map", "Lyapunov exponent", "Synchronization", "Targeted drug delivery"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "S", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Urmia University of Technology, Orumieh, Iran.

Lung and intrathoracic lymph nodes are classic sites of involvement; however, sarcoidosis can affect any site in the body. The clinical course is extremely variable, and the imaging features are diverse and dependent on the affected site, degree of inflammation, and treatment the patient receives. Atypical manifestations and imaging findings can make diagnosis and/or management challenging. In addition, assessment of treatment response can be difficult in the setting of chronic disease. Fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is sensitive for assessment of the inflammatory activity of sarcoidosis in any organ. Although FDG PET/CT is not included in the standard workup for sarcoidosis, there has been growing evidence that supports the value of this examination in guiding diagnosis and management. FDG PET/CT may be especially useful for assessing reversible granuloma, treatment response, disease extent, occult disease, and cardiac or osseous sarcoidosis, and determining the most suitable biopsy site. Capability to image the entire body during a single examination is advantageous in cases of systemic disease such as sarcoidosis.

In rare circumstances, momentum-conserving collision events dominate, and thermal transport becomes hydrodynamic. One of these cases, dubbed the Poiseuille flow of phonons, can occur in a temperature window just below the peak temperature of thermal conductivity. We report on a study of heat flow in bulk black phosphorus between 0.1 and 80 K. We find a thermal conductivity showing a faster than cubic temperature dependence between 5 and 12 K. Consequently, the effective phonon mean free path shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence at the onset of the ballistic regime, with a size-dependent Knudsen minimum. These are hallmarks of Poiseuille flow previously observed in a handful of solids. Comparing the phonon dispersion in black phosphorus and silicon, we show that the phase space for normal scattering events in black phosphorus is much larger. Our results imply that the most important requirement for the emergence of Poiseuille flow is the facility of momentum exchange between acoustic phonon branches.

Then we will review experimental evidence and theoretical understanding of magnetoresistance in an archetypal multi-valley system, where the electric conductivity is set by the sum of the contributions of different valleys. Bulk bismuth has three valleys with an extremely anisotropic effective mass. As a consequence the magnetoconductivity in each valley is extremely sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field. Therefore, a rotating magnetic field plays the role of a valley valve tuning the contribution of each valley to the total conductivity. In addition to this simple semiclassical effect, other phenomena arise in the high-field limit as a consequence of an intricate Landau spectrum. In the vicinity of the quantum limit, the orientation of magnetic field significantly affects the distribution of carriers in each valley, namely, the valley polarization is induced by the magnetic field. Moreover, experiment has found that well beyond the quantum limit, one or two valleys become totally empty. This is the only case in condensed matter physics where a Fermi sea is completely dried up by a magnetic field without a metal-insulator transition. There have been two long-standing problems on bismuth near the quantum limit: the large anisotropic Zeeman splitting of holes, and the extra peaks in quantum oscillations, which cannot be assigned to any known Landau levels. These problems are solved by taking into account the interband effect due to the spin-orbit couplings for the former, and the contributions from the twinned crystal for the latter. Up to here, the whole spectrum can be interpreted within the one-particle theory. Finally, we will discuss transport and thermodynamic signatures of breaking of the valley symmetry in this system. By this term, we refer to the observed spontaneous loss of threefold symmetry at high magnetic field and low temperature. Its theoretical understanding is still missing.

In undoped SrTiO_{3}, \u03ba evolves faster than cubic with temperature below its peak and in a narrow temperature window. Such behavior, previously observed in a handful of solids, has been attributed to a Poiseuille flow of phonons, expected to arise when momentum-conserving scattering events outweigh momentum-degrading ones. The effect disappears in the presence of dopants. In SrTi_{1-x}Nb_{x}O_{3}, a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity starts below the temperature at which the average inter-dopant distance and the thermal wavelength of acoustic phonons become comparable.

As a detailed physical example, dynamics of microbubble cluster in an ultrasonic field are studied using coupled maps. Microbubble cluster dynamics have an indicative highly active nonlinear phenomenon, were not easy to be explained. In this paper, a cluster of microbubbles with a thin elastic shell based on the modified Keller-Herring equation in an ultrasonic field is demonstrated in the framework of the globally coupled map. On the other hand, a relation between the microbubble elements is replaced by a relation between the vertices. Based on this method, the stability region of microbubbles pulsations at complete synchronization state has been obtained analytically. In this way, distances between microbubbles as coupling strength play the crucial role. In the stability region, we thus observe that the problem of study of dynamics of N-microbubble oscillators reduce to that of a single microbubble.

Our analysis indicates that the electron-electron interaction is not the sole driving force of these transitions and that lattice degrees of freedom play an important role.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "D", "Last Name": "LeBoeuf", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire National des Champs Magn\u00e9tiques Intenses (LNCMI-EMFL), CNRS, UGA, UPS, INSA, Grenoble/Toulouse, France. david.leboeuf@lncmi.cnrs.fr."}, {"First Name": "C W", "Last Name": "Rischau", "Affiliation": "ESPCI ParisTech, PSL Research University; CNRS; Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Univ.

A review of the literature was done to elucidate the prevalence of anatomic variations in the palatal canal of maxillary first and second\u00a0molars. An uncertain or indefinite radiographic appearance of the palatal canal, or eccentric deviation of the master cone or previous root canal filling was considered an indication of a bifurcated palatal canal. Five maxillary molars with a bifurcated palatal canal were identified. A MEDLINE database search was performed to identify studies on the palatal canal morphology of maxillary first and second\u00a0molars. Data were categorized based on the methodology used in each study. The overall prevalence of anatomic variations in the palatal canal of maxillary first and second\u00a0molars was less than 2%; however, anatomic variations occurred more frequently in certain ethnic groups, reaching up to 33% in maxillary first molars and up to 14% in maxillary second\u00a0molars. This case series showed that even experienced endodontic clinicians can miss a bifurcated palatal canal if they are not aware of or overlook the hidden clues for these anatomic variations. The traditional assumption of an exclusively single-canal anatomy in palatal canals of maxillary molars needs to be changed, even though it is the most prevalent anatomy. The overall low percentage of more than 1 palatal canal in maxillary molars is disturbingly misleading, because in certain ethnic groups this prevalence can be considerably higher.", "Keywords": ["Anatomic variation", "maxillary first molar", "maxillary second\u00a0molar", "palatal canal", "root canal anatomy", "root canal treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Dental Pulp Cavity", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Maxilla", "Middle Aged", "Molar", "Palate", "Radiography, Dental", "Root Canal Preparation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Nosrat", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Periodontics, and Prosthodontics, School of Dentistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland; Iranian Center for Endodontic Research, Dental Research Center, School of Dentistry, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

The secondary outcome was a composite of maternal morbidity, including need for mechanical ventilation, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, and postpartum infection. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables, and a chi-squared test was used for categorical variables with significance of p\u2009<\u20090.05. Results\u2003Of the 165 women who had a peripartum hysterectomy during the study period, 62 received four units or more of PRBC. No significant differences were noted in EBL or blood product replacement between the pre-MTP (n\u2009=\u200939) and post-MTP (n\u2009=\u200923) groups. Similarly, the MTP (n\u2009=\u20096) and no MTP (n\u2009=\u200917) subgroups showed no significant difference between EBL and overall blood product replacement. Significant differences were seen in transfusion of individual blood products, such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (MTP\u2009=\u20094, no MTP\u2009=\u20092; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and platelets (plts) (MTP\u2009=\u20096, no MTP\u2009=\u20090; p\u2009=\u20090.03). The use of high ratio replacement therapy for both plasma and plts was more common in the MTP group (FFP/PRBC ratio [MTP\u2009=\u20090.5, no MTP\u2009=\u20090.3; p\u2009=\u20090.02]; plts/PRBC ratio [MTP\u2009=\u20090.7, no MTP\u2009=\u20090; p\u2009=\u20090.03]). There were no differences in the secondary outcome between pre- and post-MTP or MTP and no MTP. Conclusion\u2003Initiation of the MTP did result in an increase in transfusion of FFP and plts intraoperatively. At our institution, the MTP is underutilized, but it appears that providers are more cognizant of the use of high transfusion ratios.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Blood Component Transfusion", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Female", "Hemostasis", "Humans", "Hysterectomy", "Peripartum Period", "Postoperative Hemorrhage", "Resuscitation", "Retrospective Studies", "Texas"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eryn H", "Last Name": "Dutta", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Aaron T", "Last Name": "Poole", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Faranak", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Holly E", "Last Name": "Dunn", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Shannon M", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Luis D", "Last Name": "Pacheco", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "George R", "Last Name": "Saade", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Gary D V", "Last Name": "Hankins", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas."}], "Journal": "American journal of perinatology", "PubDate": "2017Jul"}, {"PMID": "28240754", "Title": "Coordination chemistry of mercury(ii) with 2-pyridylnitrones: monomers to polymers.", "Abstract": "The coordination chemistry of mercury(ii) halides, HgX2, X = Cl, Br, I, with N-methyl-\u03b1-(2-pyridyl)nitrone, L1, and N-t-butyl-\u03b1-(2-pyridyl)nitrone, L2, is reported.

The medulla contains over 80 types of neuron, which belong to two classes: uni-columnar neurons have a stoichiometry of one per column, while multi-columnar neurons contact multiple columns. Here we show that combinatorial inputs from temporal and spatial axes generate this neuronal diversity: all neuroblasts switch fates over time to produce different neurons; the neuroepithelium that generates neuroblasts is also subdivided into six compartments by the expression of specific factors. Uni-columnar neurons are produced in all spatial compartments independently of spatial input; they innervate the neuropil where they are generated. Multi-columnar neurons are generated in smaller numbers in restricted compartments and require spatial input; the majority of their cell bodies subsequently move to cover the entire medulla.

Prior to the VO2max testing, subjects underwent a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan to estimate total lean body mass. Subsequently, VO2max was quantified during a maximal exercise test on a rowing ergometer as well as a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer. The test protocol included a pre-exercise stage followed by incremental exercise until VO2max was reached. The order of exercise modes was randomized and there was a wash-out period between the two tests. Oxygen uptake was obtained via a breath-by-breath metabolic cart (Vmax\u2122 Encore, San Diego, CA). Rowing VO2max was higher than cycling VO2max in both groups (p<0.05). Older subjects had less of an increase in VO2max from cycling to rowing (p<0.05). There was a significant relationship between muscle mass and VO2max for both groups (p<0.05). After correcting for muscle mass, the difference in cycling VO2max between groups disappeared (p>0.05), however, older subjects still demonstrated a lower rowing VO2max relative to younger subjects (p<0.05).

A pharmacological alternative is doxazosin, which has a longer half-life and fewer side effects. However, doxazosin is currently being used without solid empirical evidence. Furthermore, no study so far has assessed the effects of \u03b1-1-antagonists on nightmares in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). We retrospectively assessed the effectiveness of doxazosin on nightmares in PTSD and BPD. Method: A retrospective chart review of patients treated with doxazosin for trauma-associated nightmares in our clinic was performed. As in previous prazosin studies, the B2 score of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was used as the primary outcome measure. Furthermore, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Addendum for PTSD (PSQI-A) and sleep logs were analyzed. Results: We identified 51 patients with PTSD and/or BPD (mean age 35.7 years, 92.3% women) who received doxazosin for nightmares. Of these, 46 patients continued doxazosin over a 4-week period and 31 patients over a 12-week period. Within the 12-week period, doxazosin treatment significantly reduced nightmares regardless of PTSD/BPD. 25 percent of patients treated for 12 weeks had full remission of nightmares. PSQI-A scores indicated that additional trauma-associated sleep symptoms improved over 12 weeks. Furthermore, recuperation of sleep improved with doxazosin within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

At the beginning of this century, Nernst experiments on cuprates were analyzed assuming that: (i) the contribution of quasi-particles to the Nernst signal is negligible; and (ii) Gaussian superconducting fluctuations cannot produce a Nernst signal well above the critical temperature. Both these assumptions were contradicted by subsequent experiments. This paper reviews experiments documenting multiple sources of a Nernst signal, which, according to the Bridgman relation, measures the flow of transverse entropy caused by a longitudinal particle flow. Along the lines of Landauer's approach to transport phenomena, the magnitude of the transverse magneto-thermoelectric response is linked to the quantum of thermoelectric conductance and a number of material-dependent length scales: the mean free path, the Fermi wavelength, the de Broglie thermal wavelength and the superconducting coherence length. Extremely mobile quasi-particles in dilute metals generate a widely-documented Nernst signal. Fluctuating Cooper pairs in the normal state of superconductors have been found to produce a detectable Nernst signal with an amplitude conforming to the Gaussian theory, first conceived by Ussishkin, Sondhi and Huse. In addition to these microscopic sources, mobile Abrikosov vortices, mesoscopic objects simultaneously carrying entropy and magnetic flux, can produce a sizeable Nernst response. Finally, in metals subject to a magnetic field strong enough to truncate the Fermi surface to a few Landau tubes, each exiting tube generates a peak in the Nernst response. The survey of these well-established sources of the Nernst signal is a helpful guide to identify the origin of the Nernst signal in other controversial cases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kamran", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Physique et d'Etude des Mat\u00e9riaux, (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie), Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles, 75005 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Herv\u00e9", "Last Name": "Aubin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Reports on progress in physics.

Overwhelming intrauterine inflammatory load promotes quiescent feto-maternal tissues into a contractile phenotype. Like inflammation, oxidative stress is an inevitable component of both pregnancy and parturition. Pathologic activation of host innate immune response to adverse pregnancy conditions can lead to premature activation of inflammatory and oxidative stress. Inflammation and oxidative stress markers seen with both sterile and infectious inflammation are often similar; therefore, it is difficult to understand causality of conditions like spontaneous preterm birth. This review demonstrates potential mechanistic pathways of activation of sterile and infectious inflammation. We demonstrate the activation of two unique pathways of inflammation by factors that are well-documented proxies for oxidative stress (cigarette smoke extract) and infection (lipopolysaccharide). Sterile inflammation seen after exposure to an oxidative stress inducer is due to cellular elemental damage resulting in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced cellular senescence. Infectious inflammation is through activation of transcription factor NF-\u03baB and independent of oxidative stress-associated damages and p38 MAPK-induced senescence.

It is challenging to reconstruct the entire vascular network of any organ experimentally, in particular the pulmonary vasculature, because of its very high number of vessels, complexity of the branching pattern and poor accessibility in vivo. The objective of our research is to develop an innovative approach for the reconstruction of the full pulmonary vascular tree from available morphometric data. Our method consists of the use of morphometric data on those parts of the pulmonary vascular tree that are too small to reconstruct by medical imaging methods. This method is a three-step technique that reconstructs the entire pulmonary arterial tree down to the capillary bed. Vessels greater than 2 mm are reconstructed from direct volume and surface analysis using contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Vessels smaller than 2 mm are reconstructed from available morphometric and distensibility data and rearranged by applying Murray's laws. Implementation of morphometric data to reconstruct the branching pattern and applying Murray's laws to every vessel bifurcation simultaneously leads to an accurate vascular tree reconstruction. The reconstruction algorithm generates full arterial tree topography down to the \ufb01rst capillary bifurcation. Geometry of each order of the vascular tree is generated separately to minimize the construction and simulation time. The node-to-node connectivity along with the diameter and length of every vessel segment is established and order numbers, according to the diameter-de\ufb01ned Strahler system, are assigned. In conclusion, the present model provides a morphological foundation for future analysis of blood flow in the pulmonary circulation.", "Keywords": ["Strahler system", "morphometric data", "pulmonary circulation", "vascular reconstruction", "vascular tree"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Capillaries", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Lung", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Pulmonary Artery"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Houman", "Last Name": "Tamaddon", "Affiliation": "a Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Sydney , Sydney , New South Wales , Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mehrdad", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "a Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Sydney , Sydney , New South Wales , Australia."}, {"First Name": "Masud", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "a Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Sydney , Sydney , New South Wales , Australia."}, {"First Name": "Leonard", "Last Name": "Kritharides", "Affiliation": "a Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Sydney , Sydney , New South Wales , Australia."}], "Journal": "Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "26190312", "Title": "Environmental Pollutant Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether, a Flame Retardant, Induces Primary Amnion Cell Senescence.", "Abstract": "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are documented to increase the risk for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB).

Bone metastases are associated with considerable morbidity, and accurate imaging of the skeleton is important in determining the appropriate therapeutic plan. Sodium fluoride labeled with fluorine 18 (sodium fluoride F 18 [(18)F-NaF]) is a positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical first introduced several decades ago for skeletal imaging. (18)F-NaF was approved for clinical use as a positron emission tomographic (PET) agent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1972. The early use of this agent was limited, given the difficulties of imaging its high-energy photons on the available gamma cameras. For skeletal imaging, it was eventually replaced by technetium 99m ((99m)Tc)-labeled agents because of the technical limitations of (18)F-NaF. During the past several years, the widespread availability and implementation of hybrid PET and computed tomographic (CT) dual-modality systems (PET/CT) have encouraged a renewed interest in (18)F-NaF PET/CT for routine clinical use in bone imaging. Because current PET/CT systems offer high sensitivity and spatial resolution, the use of (18)F-NaF has been reevaluated for the detection of malignant and nonmalignant osseous disease. Growing evidence suggests that (18)F-NaF PET/CT provides increased sensitivity and specificity in the detection of bone metastases. Furthermore, the favorable pharmacokinetics of (18)F-NaF, combined with the superior imaging characteristics of PET/CT, supports the routine clinical use of (18)F-NaF PET/CT for oncologic imaging for skeletal metastases.

An influential model, the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, relies on differential temporal filtering of two spatially separated input channels, delaying one input signal with respect to the other. Motion in a particular direction causes these delayed and non-delayed luminance signals to arrive simultaneously at a subsequent processing step in the brain; these signals are then nonlinearly amplified to produce a direction-selective response. Recent work in Drosophila has identified two parallel pathways that selectively respond to either moving light or dark edges. Each of these pathways requires two critical processing steps to be applied to incoming signals: differential delay between the spatial input channels, and distinct processing of brightness increment and decrement signals. Here we demonstrate, using in vivo patch-clamp recordings, that four medulla neurons implement these two processing steps. The neurons Mi1 and Tm3 respond selectively to brightness increments, with the response of Mi1 delayed relative to Tm3. Conversely, Tm1 and Tm2 respond selectively to brightness decrements, with the response of Tm1 delayed compared with Tm2. Remarkably, constraining Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator models using these measurements produces outputs consistent with previously measured properties of motion detectors, including temporal frequency tuning and specificity for light versus dark edges. We propose that Mi1 and Tm3 perform critical processing of the delayed and non-delayed input channels of the correlator responsible for the detection of light edges, while Tm1 and Tm2 play analogous roles in the detection of moving dark edges. Our data show that specific medulla neurons possess response properties that allow them to implement the algorithmic steps that precede the correlative operation in the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, revealing elements of the long-sought neural substrates of motion detection in the fly.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Darkness", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Lighting", "Models, Neurological", "Motion Perception", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Photic Stimulation", "Retina", "Visual Pathways"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rudy", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Center for Developmental Genetics, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York 10003-6688, USA."}, {"First Name": "Damon A", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511, USA [2] Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam G", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Center for Neural Science, New York University, New York, New York 10003, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas R", "Last Name": "Clandinin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claude", "Last Name": "Desplan", "Affiliation": "1] Center for Developmental Genetics, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York 10003-6688, USA [2] Center for Genomics &Systems Biology, New York University Abu Dhabi Institute, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2014Aug28"}, {"PMID": "24926720", "Title": "Stabilization of premaxilla repositioned during secondary bone grafting in complete bilateral cleft lip and palate patients.", "Abstract": "Secondary bone grafting simultaneous to premaxillary repositioning is a well-recognized surgical procedure for the management of bilateral cleft lip and palate patients.

The existence of three anisotropic valleys offers electrons an additional degree of freedom, a subject of recent attention. Here, we map the Landau spectrum by angle-resolved magnetostriction, and quantify the carrier number in each valley: while the electron valleys keep identical spectra, they substantially differ in their density of states at the Fermi level.

Based on our previous studies, we hypothesize that OXT should be able to positively influence parameters of sexual function and couple interactions. Employing a naturalistic setting involving 29 healthy heterosexual couples (n=58 participants), we analyzed the acute effects of intranasally administered OXT (24IU) on sexual drive, arousal, orgasm and refractory aspects of sexual behavior together with partner interactions. Data were assessed by psychometric instruments (Acute Sexual Experiences Scale, Arizona Sexual Experience Scale) as well as biomarkers, such as cortisol, \u03b1-amylase and heart rate. Intranasal OXT administration did not alter \"classical\" parameters of sexual function, such as sexual drive, arousal or penile erection and lubrication. However, analysis of variance and a hierarchical linear model (HLM) revealed specific effects related to the orgasmic/post-orgasmic interval as well as parameters of partner interactions. According to HLM analysis, OXT increased the intensity of orgasm, contentment after sexual intercourse and the effect of study participation. According to ANOVA analysis, these effects were more pronounced in men. Men additionally indicated higher levels of sexual satiety after sexual intercourse with OXT administration. Women felt more relaxed and subgroups indicated better abilities to share sexual desires or to empathize with their partners. The effect sizes were small to moderate. Biomarkers indicated moderate psychophysiological activation but were not affected by OXT, gender or method of contraception.

AMPA and NMDA receptors generate both synaptic potentials and calcium (Ca) signals in the spine head. These responses can in turn activate a variety of Ca, sodium (Na), and potassium (K) channels at spines. In principle, the roles of these receptors and channels can be strongly regulated by the subthreshold membrane potential. However, the impact of different receptors and channels has usually been studied at the level of dendrites. Much less is known about their influence at spines, where synaptic transmission and plasticity primarily occur. Here we examine single-spine responses in the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Using two-photon microscopy and two-photon uncaging, we first show that synaptic potentials and Ca signals differ at resting and near-threshold potentials. We then determine how subthreshold depolarizations alter the contributions of AMPA and NMDA receptors to synaptic responses. We show that voltage-sensitive Ca channels enhance synaptic Ca signals but fail to engage small-conductance Ca-activated K (SK) channels, which require greater numbers of inputs. Finally, we establish how the subthreshold membrane potential controls the ability of voltage-sensitive Na channels and K channels to influence synaptic responses. Our findings reveal how subthreshold depolarizations promote electrical and biochemical signaling at dendritic spines by regulating the contributions of multiple glutamate receptors and ion channels.", "Keywords": ["calcium signaling", "dendrite", "prefrontal cortex", "pyramidal neuron", "spine", "synapse", "two-photon microscopy", "two-photon uncaging"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Dendrites", "Dendritic Spines", "Female", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Mice", "Optical Imaging", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Pyramidal Cells", "Receptors, AMPA", "Receptors, Glutamate", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Small-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels", "Synapses", "Tissue Culture Techniques", "Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hannah J", "Last Name": "Seong", "Affiliation": "Center for Neural Science, New York University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Rudy", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Center for Developmental Genetics, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adam G", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Center for Neural Science, New York University, New York, New York; and adam.carter@nyu.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "PubDate": "2014May"}, {"PMID": "24454437", "Title": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis in suspected patients referred to the center for research and training in skin diseases and leprosy, tehran, iran from 2008 to 2011.", "Abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a major health problem in many parts of Iran, although diagnosis of CL especially in the endemic area is easy, but treatment and management of the disease is a global dilemma.

Third passage subculture cells (5 \u00d7 10\u2075 cells) were loaded on 20 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 mm\u00b3 and incubated for 48 h. The presence of MSCs in the pores was evaluated by scanning electron microscope. Bilateral mandibular premolar teeth were extracted in four dogs and the buccal and lingual bone plates were reduced to make a vertical defect. Cell-loaded scaffolds were fixed in right side and left side received pure PCL-TCP scaffolds as a control side defects. Histomorphometric analysis after 8 weeks of the scaffold implantation showed higher amount of lamellar bone in the test side (48.63%) than control side (17.27%) (p < 0.05).The results suggest that PCL-TCP may be an appropriate scaffold for loading MSCs in bone regeneration.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alveolar Ridge Augmentation", "Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Bone Regeneration", "Calcium Phosphates", "Dogs", "Male", "Mandible", "Materials Testing", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Osseointegration", "Polyesters", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arash", "Last Name": "Khojasteh", "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental Research Center, Research Institute of Dental Sciences, Dental Faculty, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. arashkhojasteh@yahoo.com"}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fatemeh Sadat", "Last Name": "Hosseini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohammad Mehdi", "Last Name": "Dehghan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pegah", "Last Name": "Abbasnia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fatemeh Mashhadi", "Last Name": "Abbas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of biomedical materials research.

The experimental groups received oral alendronate (ALN, 3.5 mg/kg/wk) or IV pamidronate (PAM, 1 mg/kg/wk) for 12 months. Animals were randomly tested for serum C-terminal telopeptide of collagen I (CTx). The right first and second premolars were extracted. After 8 weeks, extraction sites were evaluated for healing. Subsequently, 3-wall defects were created in ridges and filled with human mineralized cortical particulate bone. Two months post-augmentation, animals were sacrificed and mandibles were collected for cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and histomorphometric appraisal. The obtained data were compared using 1-way ANOVA test. CTx test results in both experimental groups were comparable (<10 pg/mL) but lower than that of the control group (minimum 159.2 pg/mL). Two months post-extraction, bone sequestra were noticed in extraction sites in BP-treated groups, involving the entire alveolar bone in the PAM group and the upper rim of the alveoli in the ALN group. Histologically, bone sequestra from the PAM group demonstrated empty osteocyte lacunae, while in the ALN group areas of necrotic bone along with evidence of active bone remodeling was distinguished. Eight weeks post-augmentation, the experimental groups showed no evidence of bone formation in the augmented area, while bone formation ratio was measured to be 18.32% in the control group. The mean amount of pixel intensity calculated from the CBCT images of the ALN, PAM, and control group was 113.69 \u00b1 11.04, 124.94 \u00b1 4.72, and 113.69 \u00b1 6.63, respectively.

Most cases occur after rapid rise in blood pressure. We report a 56 year-old Caucasian male with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung who presented with a pleural effusion for which thoracocentesis and thoracotomy were performed. He developed PRES on the third post-operative day following relatively moderate increase in blood pressure. It was diagnosed with diffuse weighted imaging (DWI) MRI. He eventually fully recovered from the event. PRES is a reversible syndrome, in most cases, that can be diagnosed with appropriate imaging studies such as MRI with DWI. This case report is of clinical importance to surgeons as well as neurologists. We speculate that post surgical patients are more prone to developing PRES at lower blood pressures than blood pressures required in healthy individuals to develop PRES. Patients' post surgical blood pressure should be monitored closely and maintained at lower levels to prevent PRES. It is essential to control and diagnose PRES at an early stage since it can be easily prevented and some cases proceed to irreversible damage. It should also be differentiated from an acute cerebrovascular event since its treatment and prognosis are markedly different from PRES.", "Keywords": ["Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nashmia", "Last Name": "Riaz", "Affiliation": "Doctors Hospital of Augusta, Augusta, GA-USA."}, {"First Name": "Mehrdad M", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "Doctors Hospital of Augusta, Augusta, GA-USA."}, {"First Name": "Phillip W", "Last Name": "Catalano", "Affiliation": "Doctors Hospital of Augusta, Augusta, GA-USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Doctors Hospital of Augusta, Augusta, GA-USA."}], "Journal": "Tanaffos", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "24991602", "Title": "Evaluation of Glucosamine sulfate and Ibuprofen effects in patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis symptom.", "Abstract": "Ibuprofen - a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)- and glucosamine sulfate - a natural compound and a food supplement- are two therapeutic agents which have been widely used for treatment of patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.

The interaction between stenosis severity and lesion eccentricity in determining the length of flow recirculation zones and peak shear rate in human coronary arteries in vivo is unclear. Computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed under resting and hyperemic conditions on computer-generated models and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of coronary arteriograms of 25 patients. Boundary conditions for 3-D reconstructions simulations were obtained by direct measurements using a pressure-temperature sensor guidewire. In the computer-generated models, stenosis severity and lesion eccentricity were strongly associated with recirculation zone length and maximum shear rate. In the 3-D reconstructions, eccentricity increased recirculation zone length and shear rate when lesions of the same stenosis severity were compared. However, across the whole population of coronary lesions, eccentricity did not correlate with recirculation zone length or shear rate (P = not signficant for both), whereas stenosis severity correlated strongly with both parameters (r = 0.97, P < 0.001, and r = 0.96, P < 0.001, respectively). Nonlinear regression analyses demonstrated that the relationship between stenosis severity and peak shear was exponential, whereas the relationship between stenosis severity and recirculation zone length was sigmoidal, with an apparent threshold effect, demonstrating a steep increase in recirculation zone length between 40% and 60% diameter stenosis. Increasing stenosis severity and lesion eccentricity can both increase flow recirculation and shear rate in human coronary arteries. Flow recirculation is much more sensitive to mild changes in the severity of intermediate stenoses than is peak shear.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Computer Simulation", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Circulation", "Coronary Stenosis", "Female", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Hydrodynamics", "Hyperemia", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Regression Analysis", "Severity of Illness Index", "Shear Strength"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashkan", "Last Name": "Javadzadegan", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andy S C", "Last Name": "Yong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Austin C C", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Yiannikas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin K C", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masud", "Last Name": "Behnia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leonard", "Last Name": "Kritharides", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.
