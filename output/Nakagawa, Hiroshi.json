[{"PMID": "38893510", "Title": "In Vitro Study of Tumor-Homing Peptide-Modified Magnetic Nanoparticles for Magnetic Hyperthermia.", "Abstract": "Cancer cells have higher heat sensitivity compared to normal cells; therefore, hyperthermia is a promising approach for cancer therapy because of its ability to selectively kill cancer cells by heating them. However, the specific and rapid heating of tumor tissues remains challenging. This study investigated the potential of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) modified with tumor-homing peptides (THPs), specifically PL1 and PL3, for tumor-specific magnetic hyperthermia therapy. The synthesis of THP-modified MNPs involved the attachment of PL1 and PL3 peptides to the surface of the MNPs, which facilitated enhanced tumor cell binding and internalization. Cell specificity studies revealed an increased uptake of PL1- and PL3-MNPs by tumor cells compared to unmodified MNPs, indicating their potential for targeted delivery. In vitro hyperthermia experiments demonstrated the efficacy of PL3-MNPs in inducing tumor cell death when exposed to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). Even without exposure to an AMF, an additional ferroptotic pathway was suggested to be mediated by the nanoparticles. Thus, this study suggests that THP-modified MNPs, particularly PL3-MNPs, hold promise as a targeted approach for tumor-specific magnetic hyperthermia therapy.", "Keywords": ["ferroptosis", "magnetic

Previous reports have shown that 24-h exposure to arsenate (as pentavalent arsenic) potentiates erythropoietin (EPO) production via reactive oxygen species (ROS) in EPO-producing HepG2 cells. However, the effects of long-term arsenate exposure on EPO production remain unclear. In HepG2 cells subcultured for 3\u00a0weeks in the presence of arsenate, EPO mRNA levels were lower than those in untreated cells. Levels of ARSENITE METHYLTRANSFERASE mRNA, as well as those of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase proteins, were increased compared to untreated cells, but levels of malondialdehyde were not significantly altered. Thus, long-term exposure to arsenate enhances ROS scavenging, suggesting that the ROS-induced accumulation of EPO mRNA is attenuated by arsenate exposure. The induction of EPO accumulation by hypoxia also was attenuated by long-term arsenate exposure, suggesting an impairment in responsivity of EPO production. Furthermore, mRNA levels of SIRTUIN-1, which affects EPO transcription, were potentiated by long-term arsenate exposure.

The X-ray single crystal structure of destruxin E (1a) revealed a stable three-dimensional (3D) structure, including a s-cis amide bond at the MeVal-MeAla moiety and two intramolecular hydrogen bonds between NH(\u03b2-Ala) and OC(Ile) and between NH(Ile) and OC(\u03b2-Ala). N-Desmethyl analogs 2a (MeAla\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Ala) and 2b (MeVal\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Val) were synthesized through macrolactonization similar to our previously reported synthesis of 1a. Conversely, for the synthesis of N-methyl analogs 2c (Ile\u00a0\u2192\u00a0MeIle) and 2d (\u03b2-Ala\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Me\u03b2-Ala), macrolactonization did not proceed; therefore, cyclization precursors 10c and 10d were designed to maintain the intramolecular hydrogen bonds described above during their cyclization. The macrolactamization proceeded despite the presence of a less reactive N-methylamino group at the N-terminus in both cases. Analog 2a, which exhibits multiple conformers in solutions, was inactive at 50\u00a0\u03bcM, whereas analog 2b, which exhibits a conformation similar to that of 1a in solutions, exhibited morphological changes against osteoclast-like multinuclear cells at 1.6\u00a0\u03bcM. The activity of the MeIle analog 2c, which cannot take the intramolecular hydrogen bond (Ile)NH\u2022\u2022\u2022OC(\u03b2-Ala) in 1a, was markedly diminished compared with that of 1a, and that of the Me\u03b2-Ala analog 2d, which cannot take the intramolecular hydrogen bond (\u03b2-Ala)NH\u2022\u2022\u2022OC(Ile) in 1a, was further reduced to one-fourth of that of 2c. The overall results indicate that both the s-cis amide bond at the MeVal-MeAla moiety and two intramolecular hydrogen bonds (\u03b2-Ala)NH\u2022\u2022\u2022OC(Ile) and (Ile)NH\u2022\u2022\u2022OC(\u03b2-Ala) are important for constraining the conformation of the macrocyclic peptide backbone in destruxin E, thereby exhibiting its potent biological activity.", "Keywords": ["Cyclic peptides", "Natural Products", "Osteoclasts", "Synthesis", "X-ray crystallographic analysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Structure-Activity Relationship", "Osteoclasts", "Mice", "Animals", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Molecular Structure", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Models, Molecular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3 Aza-Aoba, Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8578, Japan; Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, 1-1-1, Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8205, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hayato", "Last Name": "Murase", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Chubu University, 1200 Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai, Aichi 487-8501, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yoshitaka", "Last Name": "Ishida", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3 Aza-Aoba, Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8578, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Haruki", "Last Name": "Sugiyama", "Affiliation": "Research and Education Center for Natural Sciences, Keio University, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Kohoku 223-8521, Japan; Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro, Tokyo 152-8551, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hidehiro", "Last Name": "Uekusa", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro, Tokyo 152-8551, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Chubu University, 1200 Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai, Aichi 487-8501, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Masahito", "Last Name": "Yoshida", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3 Aza-Aoba, Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8578, Japan; Degree Programs in Pure and Applied Sciences, Graduate School of Science and Technology, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukba, Ibaraki 305-8571, Japan; Department of Chemistry, Institute of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8571, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Doi", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3 Aza-Aoba, Aramaki, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8578, Japan.

ESCC arises from esophageal epithelial cells that undergo malignant transformation and features a perturbed squamous cell differentiation program. Understanding the dose- and radiation quality-dependence of the esophageal epithelium response to radiation may provide insights into the ability of radiation to promote ESCC. We have explored factors that may play a role in esophageal epithelial radiosensitivity and their potential relationship to ESCC risk. We have utilized a murine three-dimensional (3D) organoid model that recapitulates the morphology and functions of the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus to study persistent dose- and radiation quality-dependent changes. Interestingly, although high-linear energy transfer (LET) Fe ion exposure induced a more intense and persistent alteration of squamous differentiation and 53BP1 DNA damage foci levels as compared to Cs, the MAPK/SAPK stress pathway signaling showed similar altered levels for most phospho-proteins with both radiation qualities. In addition, the lower dose of high-LET exposure also revealed nearly the same degree of morphological changes, even though only ~36% of the cells were predicted to be hit at the lower 0.1 Gy dose, suggesting that a bystander effect may be induced. Although p38 and ERK/MAPK revealed the highest levels following high-LET exposure, the findings reveal that even a low dose (0.1 Gy) of both radiation qualities can elicit a persistent stress signaling response that may critically impact the differentiation gradient of the esophageal epithelium, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of radiation-induced esophageal injury and early stage esophageal carcinogenesis.", "Keywords": ["3D organoid culture", "DNA damage", "esophageal", "high-LET radiation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Organoids", "Mice", "Esophagus", "Epithelial Cells", "DNA Damage", "Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Linear Energy Transfer", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Cell Differentiation", "Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Radiation Tolerance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Latisha", "Last Name": "Carswell", "Affiliation": "Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA 31207, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deepa M", "Last Name": "Sridharan", "Affiliation": "Soley Theraperutics, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lung-Chang", "Last Name": "Chien", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wataru", "Last Name": "Hirose", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "V\u00e9ronique", "Last Name": "Giroux", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC J1E 4K8, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janice M", "Last Name": "Pluth", "Affiliation": "Health Physics and Diagnostic Sciences, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV 89154, USA."}], "Journal": "Biomolecules", "PubDate": "2024Apr25"}, {"PMID": "38741711", "Title": "Tumor niche network-defined subtypes predict immunotherapy response of esophageal squamous cell cancer.", "Abstract": "Despite the promising outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), resistance to ICI presents a new challenge.

The molecular mechanism by which de novo DNA methyltransferase(s) catalyze CpG methylation at PRC-regulated regions remains unclear. Here we report a cryo-EM structure of the DNMT3A long isoform (DNMT3A1) N-terminal region in complex with a nucleosome carrying PRC1-mediated histone H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub). We identify regions within the DNMT3A1 N-terminus that bind H2AK119Ub and the nucleosome acidic patch. This bidentate interaction is required for effective DNMT3A1 engagement with H2AK119Ub-modified chromatin in cells. Furthermore, aberrant redistribution of DNMT3A1 to Polycomb target genes inhibits their transcriptional activation during cell differentiation and recapitulates the cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation signature. This effect is rescued by disruption of the DNMT3A1-acidic patch interaction. Together, our analyses reveal a binding interface critical for countering promoter CGI DNA hypermethylation, a major molecular hallmark of cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kristjan H", "Last Name": "Gretarsson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Abini-Agbomson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan L", "Last Name": "Gloor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel N", "Last Name": "Weinberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jamie L", "Last Name": "McCuiston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vishnu Udayakumar Sunitha", "Last Name": "Kumary", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Allison R", "Last Name": "Hickman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Varun", "Last Name": "Sahu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xinjing", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Lipieta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Flashner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oluwatobi A", "Last Name": "Adeleke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Irina K", "Last Name": "Popova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hailey F", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelsey", "Last Name": "Noll", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carolina Lin", "Last Name": "Windham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Danielle N", "Last Name": "Maryanski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bryan J", "Last Name": "Venters", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael-Christopher", "Last Name": "Keogh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karim-Jean", "Last Name": "Armache", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Mar20"}, {"PMID": "38555748", "Title": "Polyelectrolyte-protein synergism: pH-responsive polyelectrolyte/insulin complexes as versatile carriers for targeted protein and drug delivery.", "Abstract": "The co-assembly of polyelectrolytes (PE) with proteins offers a promising approach for designing complex structures with customizable morphologies, charge distribution, and stability for targeted cargo delivery. However, the complexity of protein structure limits our ability to predict the properties of the formed nanoparticles, and our goal is to identify the key triggers of the morphological transition in protein/PE complexes and evaluate their ability to encapsulate multivalent ionic drugs. A positively charged PE can assemble with a protein at pH above isoelectric point due to the electrostatic attraction and disassemble at pH below isoelectric point due to the repulsion. The additional hydrophilic block of the polymer should stabilize the particles in solution and enable them to encapsulate a negatively charged drug in the presence of PE excess. We demonstrated that diblock copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) and poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(N,N,N-trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate), consisting of a polycation block and a neutral hydrophilic block, reversibly co-assemble with insulin in pH range between 5 and 8. Using small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), we showed that insulin arrangement within formed particles is controlled by intermolecular electrostatic forces between protein molecules, and can be tuned by varying ionic strength. For the first time, we observed by fluorescence that formed protein/PE complexes with excess of positive charges exhibited potential for encapsulating and controlled release of negatively charged bivalent drugs, protoporphyrin-IX and zinc(II) protoporphyrin-IX, enabling the development of nanocarriers for combination therapies with adjustable charge, stability, internal structure, and size.", "Keywords": ["Block polyelectrolyte", "Core/shell particles", "Electrostatic co-assembly", "Insulin", "Protein", "Small-angle scattering"], "MeSH terms": ["Polyelectrolytes", "Protoporphyrins", "Insulin", "Ethylene Oxide", "Scattering, Small Angle", "X-Ray Diffraction", "Polymers", "Proteins", "Isoelectric Point"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anastasiia", "Last Name": "Murmiliuk", "Affiliation": "J\u00fclich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS) at Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ), Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, Lichtenbergstra\u00dfe 1, 85747 Garching, Germany.

Recently, Cr(III) reportedly modulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) expression. Our previous study reported that increased PPAR\u03b3 after 24\u00a0h Cr(III) treatment promoted erythropoietin (EPO) production in HepG2 cells. In the current study, we analyzed 4-week Cr(III) treatment effects on PPAR\u03b3 and EPO production in HepG2 cells. Long-term Cr(III) treatment resulted in significantly elevated mRNA expression levels of PPAR\u03b3 and EPO compared to controls. Additionally, treatment with a PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor suppressed EPO mRNA expression. Increased EPO mRNA expression due to stimulation with hypoxia or cobalt was unaffected by long-term Cr(III) treatment. Administration of lipopolysaccharide and pyocyanin which causes oxidative stress, promoted EPO production, but this effect was attenuated in cells treated with Cr(III). Long-term Cr(III) treatment increased hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and 2\u03b1 mRNA expression and protein levels. Increased PPAR\u03b3, induced by long-term Cr(III) treatment, suppressed sirtuin1 (SIRT1) mRNA expression and increased EPO mRNA expression, suggesting that increased PPAR\u03b3 attenuated the suppressive effect of SIRT1 on HIF.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is the primary enzyme that detoxifies acetaldehyde in the mitochondria. Acetaldehyde accumulation causes genotoxic stress in cells expressing the dysfunctional ALDH2E487K dominant negative mutant protein linked to ALDH2*2, the single nucleotide polymorphism highly prevalent among East Asians. Heterozygous ALDH2*2 increases the risk for the development of ESCC and other alcohol-related cancers. Despite its prevalence and link to malignant transformation, how ALDH2 dysfunction influences ESCC pathobiology is incompletely understood. Herein, we characterize how ESCC and preneoplastic cells respond to alcohol exposure using cell lines, three-dimensional organoids and xenograft models. We find that alcohol exposure and ALDH2*2 cooperate to increase putative ESCC cancer stem cells with high CD44 expression (CD44H cells) linked to tumor initiation, repopulation and therapy resistance. Concurrently, ALHD2*2 augmented alcohol-induced reactive oxygen species and DNA damage to promote apoptosis in the non-CD44H cell population. Pharmacological activation of ALDH2 by Alda-1 inhibits this phenotype, suggesting that acetaldehyde is the primary driver of these changes. Additionally, we find that Aldh2 dysfunction affects the response to cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic commonly used for the treatment of ESCC. Aldh2 dysfunction facilitated enrichment of CD44H cells following cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and cell death in murine organoids, highlighting a potential mechanism driving cisplatin resistance. Together, these data provide evidence that ALDH2 dysfunction accelerates ESCC pathogenesis through enrichment of CD44H cells in response to genotoxic stressors such as environmental carcinogens and chemotherapeutic agents.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Risk Factors", "Alcohol Drinking", "Cisplatin", "Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial", "Ethanol", "Acetaldehyde", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Alcohol Dehydrogenase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Flashner", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masataka", "Last Name": "Shimonosono", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yasuto", "Last Name": "Tomita", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norihiro", "Last Name": "Matsuura", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shinya", "Last Name": "Ohashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Therapeutic Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Shogoin, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Manabu", "Last Name": "Muto", "Affiliation": "Department of Therapeutic Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Shogoin, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Andres J", "Last Name": "Klein-Szanto", "Affiliation": "Histopathology Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA."}, {"First Name": "J", "Last Name": "Alan Diehl", "Affiliation": "Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA."}, {"First Name": "Che-Hong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daria", "Last Name": "Mochly-Rosen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth I", "Last Name": "Weinberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Carcinogenesis", "PubDate": "2024Feb12"}, {"PMID": "37848806", "Title": "Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in elderly and very elderly patients: safety, outcomes, and quality of life.", "Abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) risk increases with age.

It is beneficial for targets where matching the timing of structural changes between experiments is difficult, but the issue is that samples suitable for SANS are too thick for the typical transmission FTIR method.

The L2-IL-1\u03b2 transgenic mice, expressing human interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in the oral, esophageal and forestomach squamous epithelia feature chronic inflammation and a stepwise development of Barrett's esophagus-like metaplasia, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma at the squamo-columnar junction. However, the functional consequences of IL-1\u03b2-mediated chronic inflammation in the oral and esophageal squamous epithelia remain elusive. We report for the first time that in addition to the previously described Barrett's esophagus-like metaplasia, the L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice also develop squamous epithelial dysplasia with progression to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the esophagus and the tongue. L2-IL-1\u03b2 showed age-dependent progression of squamous dysplasia to SCC with approximately 40% (n\u2009=\u200949) and 23.5% (n\u2009=\u200917) incidence rates for esophageal and tongue invasive SCC respectively, by 12-15\u00a0months of age. Interestingly, SCC development and progression in L2-IL-1\u03b2 was similar in both Germ Free (GF) and Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) conditions. Immunohistochemistry revealed a T cell predominant inflammatory profile with enhanced expression of Ki67, Sox2 and the DNA double-strand break marker, \u03b3-H2AX, in the dysplastic squamous epithelia of L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, immunomodulatory players, chemoattractants for inflammatory cells (T cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages) and oxidative damage marker, iNOS, were significantly increased in the esophageal and tongue tissues of L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice.

Our objective was to identify secreted factor(s) that mediate the communication between CAFs and ESCC tumor cells with the aim of identifying potential druggable targets. Through unbiased cytokine arrays, we have identified CC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) as a secreted factor that is increased upon co-culture of ESCC cells and CAFs, which we replicated in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) with CAFs. Loss of tumor-cell-derived CCL5 reduces ESCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and we propose this is mediated, in part, by a reduction in ERK1/2 signaling. Loss of tumor-derived CCL5 reduces the percentage of CAFs recruited to xenograft tumors in vivo. CCL5 is a ligand for the CC motif receptor 5 (CCR5), for which a clinically approved inhibitor exists, namely Maraviroc. Maraviroc treatment reduced tumor volume, CAF recruitment, and ERK1/2 signaling in vivo, thus, mimicking the effects observed with genetic loss of CCL5.

In this review, we introduce the differences in the quantum beam properties of the two methods and their associated advantages and disadvantages in molecular spectroscopy. Neutrons are scattered via interaction with nuclei; one characteristic of neutron scattering is a large incoherent scattering cross-section of a hydrogen atom. INS records the auto-correlation functions of atomic positions. By using the difference in neutron scattering cross-sections of isotopes in multi-component systems, some molecules can be selectively observed. In contrast, THz-TDS observes the cross-correlation function of dipole moments. In water-containing biomolecular samples, the absorption of water molecules is particularly large. While INS requires large-scale experimental facilities, such as accelerators and nuclear reactors, THz-TDS can be performed at the laboratory level. In the analysis of water molecule dynamics, INS is primarily sensitive to translational diffusion motion, while THz-TDS observes rotational motion in the spectrum.

The importance of tumor heterogeneity as an independent predictor of outcomes and treatment failure in HNSCC has recently come to light. With this understanding, 3D culture systems, including patient derived organoids (PDO) and organotypic culture (OTC), that capture this heterogeneity may allow for modeling and manipulation of critical subpopulations, such as p-EMT, as well as interactions between cancer cells and immune and stromal cells in the microenvironment. Here, we review work that has been done using PDO and OTC models of HNSCC, which demonstrates that these 3D culture models capture in vivo tumor heterogeneity and can be used to model tumor biology and treatment response in a way that faithfully recapitulates in vivo characteristics. As such, in vitro 3D culture models represent an important bridge between 2D monolayer culture and in vivo models such as patient derived xenografts.", "Keywords": ["EMT", "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma", "Heterogeneity", "Organoids", "Organotypic culture", "Three-dimensional culture"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Culture Techniques", "Organoids", "Stromal Cells", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anuraag S", "Last Name": "Parikh", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Victoria X", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Flashner", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ogoegbunam B", "Last Name": "Okolo", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brian S", "Last Name": "Henick", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia Unversity, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Momen-Heravi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sidharth V", "Last Name": "Puram", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States; Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States."}, {"First Name": "Theodoros", "Last Name": "Teknos", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States."}, {"First Name": "Quintin", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

Previous studies have shown that Irxs genes are expressed during tooth development. However, the precise roles of genes in teeth remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that Irx3 is an essential molecule for the proliferation and differentiation of odontoblasts. Using cDNA synthesized from postnatal day 1 (P1) tooth germs, we examined the expression of all Irx genes (Irx1-Irx6) by RT-PCR and found that all genes except Irx4 were expressed in the tooth tissue. Irx1-Irx3 a were expressed in the dental epithelial cell line M3H1 cells, while Irx3 and Irx5 were expressed in the dental mesenchymal cell line mDP cells. Only Irx3 was expressed in both undifferentiated cell lines. Immunostaining also revealed the presence of IRX3 in the dental epithelial cells and mesenchymal condensation. Inhibition of endogenous Irx3 by siRNA blocks the proliferation and differentiation of mDP cells. Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and Bmp4 are factors involved in odontoblast differentiation and were highly expressed in mDP cells by quantitative PCR analysis. Interestingly, the expression of Wnt5a (but not Wnt3a or Bmp4) was suppressed by Irx3 siRNA. These results suggest that Irx3 plays an essential role in part through the regulation of Wnt5a expression during odontoblast proliferation and differentiation.", "Keywords": ["Cell differentiation", "Cell proliferation", "Iroquois homeobox genes", "Irx3", "Odontoblasts", "Wnt5a"], "MeSH terms": ["Homeodomain Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Odontoblasts", "Genes, Homeobox", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anrizandy", "Last Name": "Narwidina", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Graduate School of Oral Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan; Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Aya", "Last Name": "Miyazaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kokoro", "Last Name": "Iwata", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry / Special Needs Dentistry, Division of Oral Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 113-8549, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Rika", "Last Name": "Kurogoushi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry / Special Needs Dentistry, Division of Oral Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 113-8549, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Asuna", "Last Name": "Sugimoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry / Special Needs Dentistry, Division of Oral Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 113-8549, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yasusei", "Last Name": "Kudo", "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Bioscience, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Keita", "Last Name": "Kawarabayashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yoshihito", "Last Name": "Yamakawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Graduate School of Oral Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan; Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yuki", "Last Name": "Akazawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Takamasa", "Last Name": "Kitamura", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kimiko", "Last Name": "Yamaguchi-Ueda", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tomokazu", "Last Name": "Hasegawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Keigo", "Last Name": "Yoshizaki", "Affiliation": "Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics Section, Division of Oral Health, Growth and Development, Kyushu University Faculty of Dental Science, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Satoshi", "Last Name": "Fukumoto", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Dentistry Section, Division of Oral Health, Growth and Development, Kyushu University Faculty of Dental Science, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Akihito", "Last Name": "Yamamoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Tissue Regeneration, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Naozumi", "Last Name": "Ishimaru", "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Molecular Pathology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tomonori", "Last Name": "Iwasaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, 770-8504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tsutomu", "Last Name": "Iwamoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry / Special Needs Dentistry, Division of Oral Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 113-8549, Japan.

Despite recent progress in defining the molecular changes accompanying ESCC initiation and development, patient prognosis remains poor. The functional annotation of these molecular changes is the necessary next step and requires models that both capture the molecular features of ESCC and can be readily and inexpensively manipulated for functional annotation. Mice treated with the tobacco smoke mimetic 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) predictably form ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia. Of note, 4NQO lesions also arise in the oral cavity, most commonly in the tongue, as well as the forestomach, which all share the stratified squamous epithelium. However, these mice cannot be simply manipulated for functional hypothesis testing, as generating isogenic mouse models is time- and resource-intensive. Herein, we overcome this limitation by generating single cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoids from mice treated with 4NQO to characterize murine ESCC or preneoplastic cells ex vivo. These organoids capture the salient features of ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia, can be cheaply and quickly leveraged to form isogenic models, and can be utilized for syngeneic transplantation experiments. We demonstrate how to generate 3D organoids from normal, preneoplastic, and SCC murine esophageal tissue and maintain and cryopreserve these organoids. The applications of these versatile organoids are broad and include the utilization of genetically engineered mice and further characterization by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, the generation of isogeneic organoid lines using CRISPR technologies, and drug screening or syngeneic transplantation. We believe that the widespread adoption of the techniques demonstrated in this protocol will accelerate progress in this field to combat the severe burden of ESCC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck", "Mouth Neoplasms", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Organoids", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Flashner", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Cecilia", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Organoid and Cell Culture Core, Columbia University Digestive and Liver Diseases Research Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Norihiro", "Last Name": "Matsuura", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Masataka", "Last Name": "Shimonosono", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Yasuto", "Last Name": "Tomita", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Masaki", "Last Name": "Morimoto", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Ogoegbunam", "Last Name": "Okolo", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Victoria X", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Anuraag S", "Last Name": "Parikh", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Andres J P", "Last Name": "Klein-Szanto", "Affiliation": "Histopathology Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center."}, {"First Name": "Kelley", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Organoid and Cell Culture Core, Columbia University Digestive and Liver Diseases Research Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Joel T", "Last Name": "Gabre", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Momen-Heravi", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Section of Oral, Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Dental Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University; Organoid and Cell Culture Core, Columbia University Digestive and Liver Diseases Research Center, Columbia University; Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University; hn2360@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2022Dec23"}, {"PMID": "36600652", "Title": "SP140 inhibits STAT1 signaling, induces IFN-\u03b3 in tumor-associated macrophages, and is a predictive biomarker of immunotherapy response.", "Abstract": "Understanding the role and potential therapeutic targeting of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is crucial to developing new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for cancer immunotherapies.

While there are reports that show the effects of EPO on autophagy induction, the relationship between EPO production and autophagy induction is unclear. Therefore, this study analyzed the effect of the pentavalent inorganic arsenic salt arsenate on EPO production in vitro and in vivo and EPO-induced autophagy in HepG2 cells. Exposure of HepG2 cells to low-concentration arsenate was observed to increase EPO production and induced autophagy. Moreover, a ROS scavenger suppressed the arsenate-induced increase in autophagy and EPO mRNA levels. Both EPO production and autophagy induction contributed to protection from arsenate-induced cytotoxic stress. HepG2 cells expressed the EPO receptor and production of EPO by HepG2 cells acted in an autoregulatory manner to suppress autophagy induction.

To explore why these standard treatments fail for some patients, we evaluated whether the variation in HPV oncoprotein levels among HPV+ OPSCCs affects mitochondrial metabolism, a source of antioxidant capacity. In cell line and patient-derived xenograft models, levels of HPV full-length E6 (fl-E6) inversely correlated with oxidative phosphorylation, antioxidant capacity, and therapy resistance, and fl-E6 was the only HPV oncoprotein to display such correlations. Ectopically expressing fl-E6 in models with low baseline levels reduced mitochondrial mass, depleted antioxidant capacity, and sensitized to therapy. In this setting, fl-E6 repressed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1\u03b1/estrogen-related receptor \u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1/ERR\u03b1) pathway for mitochondrial biogenesis by reducing p53-dependent PGC-1\u03b1 transcription. Concordant observations were made in 3 clinical cohorts, where expression of mitochondrial components was higher in tumors of patients with reduced survival. These tumors contained the lowest fl-E6 levels, the highest p53 target gene expression, and an activated PGC-1\u03b1/ERR\u03b1 pathway. Our findings demonstrate that E6 can potentiate treatment responses by depleting mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and provide evidence for low E6 negatively affecting patient survival.

From the water sorption isotherm (298 K) for C. sakazakii, monolayer water content and monolayer aw were determined to be 0.0724 g/g-dry matter and 0.252, respectively. Mechanical relaxation was investigated at 298 K. In a higher aw range of over 0.529, the degree of mechanical relaxation increased with an increase in aw. From the effect of aw on the degree of mechanical relaxation, the mechanical awc (aw at which mechanical glass transition occurs at 298 K) was determined to be 0.667. Mean-square displacement of atoms in the bacteria was investigated by incoherent elastic neutron scattering. The mean-square displacement increased gradually with an increase in temperature depending on the aw of samples. From the linear fitting, two or three dynamical transition temperatures (low, middle, and high Tds) were determined at each aw. The low-Td values (142-158 K) were almost independent from aw. There was a minor effect of aw on the middle Td (214-234 K) except for the anhydrous sample (261 K). The high Td (252-322 K) largely increased with the decrease in aw. From the aw dependence of the high Td, the dynamical awc was determined to be 0.675, which was almost equivalent to the mechanical awc. The high Td was assumed to be the glass-transition temperature (Tg), and anhydrous Tg was estimated to be 409 K. In addition, molecular relaxation time (\u03c4) of the bacteria was calculated as a function of aw. From the result, it is suggested that the progress of metabolism in the bacterial system requires a lower \u03c4 than approximately 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-5 s.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Water", "Vitrification", "Temperature", "Transition Temperature", "Bacteria", "Glass"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tomochika", "Last Name": "Sogabe", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Materials Sciences Research Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan; J-PARC Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Takeshi", "Last Name": "Yamada", "Affiliation": "Neutron Science and Technology Center, Comprehensive Research Organization for Science and Society (CROSS), Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Shigenobu", "Last Name": "Koseki", "Affiliation": "Research Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kiyoshi", "Last Name": "Kawai", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Integrated Sciences for Life, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan.

In the present study, we applied retrograde transsynaptic labeling with rabies virus to a monkey model of spinal cord injury. By injecting the virus into the spinal forelimb segments immediately after the monosynaptic CSP lesion, we showed that the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), especially its caudal and bank region (so-called \"new\" M1), was the principal origin of the CSP linking the motor cortex to the spinal forelimb segments disynaptically (disynaptic CSP). This forms a striking contrast to the architecture of the monosynaptic CSP that involves extensively other motor-related areas, together with M1. Next, the rabies injections were made at the recovery period of 3 months after the monosynaptic CSP lesion. The second-order labeled neurons were located in the ipsilateral as well as in the contralateral \"new\" M1. This indicates that the disynaptic CSP input from the ipsilateral \"new\" M1 is recruited during the motor recovery from the monosynaptic CSP lesion.

Myc is homogeneously expressed in basal cells of the esophageal epithelium and Myc positively regulates their self-renewal by maintaining their undifferentiated state. Indeed, Myc knockout induced a loss of the undifferentiated state of esophageal epithelial cells resulting in cellular senescence while forced MYC expression promoted oncogenic cell proliferation. A superoxide scavenger counteracted Myc knockout-induced senescence, therefore suggesting that a mitochondrial superoxide takes part in inducing senescence.

Activity of the ventral midbrain (VM), consisting of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the retrorubral field (RRF), plays an important role in processing motivation. However, little is known about the neural substrate bridging the VM and the spinal motor output. We hypothesized that the VM might exert a modulatory influence over the descending motor pathways. By retrograde transneuronal labelling with rabies virus, we demonstrated the existence of multisynaptic projections from the VM to the cervical enlargement in monkeys. The distribution pattern of spinal projection neurons in the VM exhibited a caudorostral gradient, in that the RRF and the caudal part of the SNc contained more retrogradely labelled neurons than the VTA and the rostral part of the SNc. Electrical stimulation of the VM induced muscle responses in the contralateral forelimb with a delay of a few milliseconds following the responses of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1). The magnitude and number of evoked muscle responses were associated with the stimulus intensity and number of pulses. The muscle responses were diminished during M1 inactivation. Thus, the present study has identified a multisynaptic VM-spinal pathway that is mediated, at least in part, by the M1 and might play a pivotal role in modulatory control of the spinal motor output. KEY POINTS: Motivation to obtain reward is thought to boost motor performance, and activity in the ventral midbrain is important to the motivational process. Little is known about a neural substrate bridging the ventral midbrain and the spinal motor output. Retrograde trans-synaptic experiments revealed that the ventral midbrain projects multisynaptically to the spinal cord in macaque monkeys. Ventral midbrain activation by electrical stimulation generated cortical activity in the motor cortex and forelimb muscle activity. A multisynaptic ventral midbrain-spinal pathway most probably plays a pivotal role in modulatory control of the spinal motor output.", "Keywords": ["motivation", "non-human primate", "rabies virus", "retrorubral field", "spinal cord", "transneuronal labelling"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Haplorhini", "Mesencephalon", "Motor Cortex", "Motor Neurons", "Ventral Tegmental Area"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michiaki", "Last Name": "Suzuki", "Affiliation": "Neural Prosthetics Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Ken-Ichi", "Last Name": "Inoue", "Affiliation": "Systems Neuroscience Section, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Systems Neuroscience Section, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroaki", "Last Name": "Ishida", "Affiliation": "Neural Prosthetics Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kenta", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "Section of Viral Vector Development, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Aichi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tadashi", "Last Name": "Isa", "Affiliation": "Department of Developmental Physiology, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Aichi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Masahiko", "Last Name": "Takada", "Affiliation": "Systems Neuroscience Section, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yukio", "Last Name": "Nishimura", "Affiliation": "Neural Prosthetics Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Journal": "The Journal of physiology", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "35108658", "Title": "CD73+ Epithelial Progenitor Cells That Contribute to Homeostasis and Renewal Are Depleted in Eosinophilic Esophagitis.", "Abstract": "Although basal cell hyperplasia is a histologic hallmark of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), little is known about the capabilities of epithelial renewal and differentiation in the EoE inflammatory milieu.

This critical knowledge gap is partially due to inadequate modeling of host-microbiome interactions in the etiology of esophageal cancers. Recent advances have enabled progress in this field. Three dimensional (3D) organoids faithfully recapitulate the structure and function of the normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic epithelia of the esophagus ex vivo and serve as a platform translatable for applications in precision medicine.

In its functional state, a single \u03b2-casein monomer is unfolded, which creates a high structural flexibility, which is supposed to play a major role in preventing the precipitation of calcium phosphate particles. We characterize the structural flexibility in terms of nanosecond molecular motions, depending on the temperature by quasielastic neutron scattering. Our major questions are: Does the self-association reduce the chain flexibility? How does the dynamic spectrum of disordered caseins differ from a compactly globular protein? How does the dynamic spectrum of \u03b2-casein in solution differ from that of a protein in hydrated powder states? We report on two relaxation processes on a nanosecond and a sub-nanosecond timescale for \u03b2-casein in solution. Both processes are analyzed by Brownian oscillator model, by which the spring constant can be defined in the isotropic parabolic potential. The slower process, which is analyzed by neutron spin echo, seems a characteristic feature of the unfolded structure. It requires bulk solvent and is not seen in hydrated protein powders. The faster process, which is analyzed by neutron backscattering, has a smaller amplitude and requires hydration water, which is also observed with folded proteins in the hydrated state. The self-association had no significant influence on internal relaxation, and thus, a \u03b2-casein protein monomer flexibility is preserved in the micelle.

Tissue regeneration has been associated not only with the differentiation of MSCs, but also with the microenvironment of the stem cell niche that involves various cytokines and immune cells in the tissue regeneration site. In the present study, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), the principal growth factor for tooth development, dental pulp homeostasis and dentin repair, was reported to affect the expression of cytokines in human dental pulp-derived MSCs. FGF2 significantly inhibited the expression of chemokine C-C motif ligand 11 (CCL11) in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the SDP11 human dental pulp-derived MSC line. This inhibition was diminished following treatment with the AZD4547 FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, indicating that FGF2 negatively regulated the expression of CCL11 in SDP11 cells. Furthermore, FGF2 activated the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in SDP11 cells. The mechanism of the FGFR-downstream signaling pathway was then studied using the SB203580, U0126 and SP600125 inhibitors for p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK, respectively.

The FA DNA repair pathway is activated upon DNA damage induced by acetaldehyde, a chief alcohol metabolite and one of the major carcinogens in humans. However, the molecular basis of acetaldehyde-induced genomic instability in SCCs of the head and neck and of the esophagus in FA remains elusive. Here, we report the effects of acetaldehyde on replication stress response in esophageal epithelial cells (keratinocytes). Acetaldehyde-exposed esophageal keratinocytes displayed accumulation of DNA damage foci consisting of 53BP1 and BRCA1. At physiologically relevant concentrations, acetaldehyde activated the ATR-Chk1 pathway, leading to S- and G2/M-phase delay with accumulation of the FA complementation group D2 protein (FANCD2) at the sites of DNA synthesis, suggesting that acetaldehyde impedes replication fork progression. Consistently, depletion of the replication fork protection protein Timeless led to elevated DNA damage upon acetaldehyde exposure. Furthermore, FANCD2 depletion exacerbated replication abnormalities, elevated DNA damage, and led to apoptotic cell death, indicating that FANCD2 prevents acetaldehyde-induced genomic instability in esophageal keratinocytes. These observations contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that drive genomic instability in FA patients and alcohol-related carcinogenesis, thereby providing a translational implication in the development of more effective therapies for SCCs.", "Keywords": ["FANCD2", "Fanconi anemia", "acetaldehyde", "alcohol", "esophageal squamous cell carcinoma", "genomic instability"], "MeSH terms":

Although MurD, a 47-kDa protein that consists of three domains, sequentially changes its domain conformation from an open form to a closed form through a semiclosed form in its enzymatic reaction, the domain dynamics in each conformation remains unclear. In this study, we verify the conformational dynamics of MurD in the corresponding three states (apo and ATP- and inhibitor-bound states) with a combination of small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), neutron backscattering (NBS), neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Applying principal component analysis of the MD trajectories, twisting and open-closed domain modes are identified as the major collective coordinates. The deviations of the experimental SAXS profiles from the theoretical calculations based on the known crystal structures become smaller in the ATP-bound state than in the apo state, and a further decrease is evident upon inhibitor binding. These results suggest that domain motions of the protein are suppressed step by step of each ligand binding. The DLS and NBS data yield collective and self-translational diffusion constants, respectively, and we used them to extract collective domain motions in nanometer and nanosecond scales from the NSE data. In the apo state, MurD shows both twisting and open-closed domain modes, whereas an ATP binding suppresses twisting domain motions, and a further reduction of open-closed mode is seen in the inhibitor-binding state. These observations are consistent with the structure modifications measured by the small-angle scattering as well as the MD simulations. Such changes in the domain dynamics associated with the sequential enzymatic reactions should be related to the affinity and reaction efficiency with a ligand that binds specifically to each reaction state.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Neutrons", "Protein Conformation", "Proteins", "Scattering, Small Angle", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Materials Sciences Research Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan; 2 J-PARC Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan.

MurD, a 47-kDa protein enzyme responsible for peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is one of those proteins whose conformational states and changes during their catalytic cycle are not well understood. Although it has been considered that MurD takes a single conformational state in solution as shown by a crystal structure, the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study suggested the existence of multiple conformational state of apo MurD in solution. However, the conformational distribution has not been evaluated. In this work, we investigate the conformational states of MurD by the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), especially intergadolinium distance measurement using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measurement. The gadolinium ions are fixed on specific positions on MurD via a rigid double-arm paramagnetic lanthanide tag that has been originally developed for paramagnetic NMR. The combined use of NMR and EPR enables accurate interpretation of the DEER distance information to the structural information of MurD. The DEER distance measurement for apo MurD shows a broad distance distribution, whereas the presence of the inhibitor narrows the distance distribution. The results suggest that MurD exists in a wide variety of conformational states in the absence of ligands, whereas binding of the inhibitor eliminates variation in conformational states.

On the other hand, treatment with antibody against repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) has been shown to ameliorate motor deficits after SCI in rodents and primates. Facilitating activity of the corticospinal tract (CST) by rTMS following rewiring of CST fibers by anti-RGMa antibody treatment may exert an enhanced effect on motor recovery in a primate model of SCI. To address this issue, we examined whether such a combined therapeutic strategy could contribute to accelerating functional restoration from SCI. In our SCI model, unilateral lesions were made between the C6 and the C7 level. Two macaque monkeys were used for each of the combined therapy and antibody treatment alone, while one monkey was for rTMS alone. The antibody treatment was continuously carried out for four weeks immediately after SCI, and rTMS trials applying a thermoplastic mask and a laser distance meter lasted ten weeks. Behavioral assessment was performed over 14 weeks after SCI to investigate the extent to which motor functions were restored with the antibody treatment and/or rTMS. While rTMS without the preceding antibody treatment produced no discernible sign for functional recovery, a combination of the antibody and rTMS exhibited a greater effect, especially at an early stage of rTMS trials, on restoration of dexterous hand movements.

To investigate p53R175H-mediated molecular mechanisms, we used a carcinogen-induced approach in Trp53R172H/- mice to model ESCC. In the primary Trp53R172H/- tumor cell lines, we depleted Trp53R172H (shTrp53) and observed a marked reduction in cell invasion in vitro and lung metastasis burden in a tail-vein injection model in comparing isogenic cells (shCtrl). Furthermore, we performed bulk RNA-seq to compare gene expression profiles of metastatic and primary shCtrl and shTrp53 cells. We identified the YAP-BIRC5 axis as a potential mediator of Trp53R172H -mediated metastasis. We demonstrate that expression of Survivin, an antiapoptotic protein encoded by BIRC5, increases in the presence of Trp53R172H Furthermore, depletion of Survivin specifically decreases Trp53R172H-driven lung metastasis.

We evaluated the efficacy of various treatment regimens in terms of survival benefit compared to surgery only in patients stratified into high (risk score \u22650) versus low (risk score <0) mortality risk categories. For the high-risk group, surgery with neck dissection significantly improved the 5-year survival to 75% from 46% with surgery only (p < 0.001); a Cox proportional hazard model on time-to-death demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.37 for surgery with neck dissection (95% CI: 0.2-0.6; p=0.0005). For the low-risk group, surgery only was the treatment of choice associated with 5-year survival benefit. Regardless of treatment selected, those with risk score \u22652 may benefit from additional therapy to prevent cancer relapse. We also identified hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) as a gene target common to the prognostic miRNAs. There was 22-fold increase in the hTERT expression level in patients with risk score \u22652 compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0005). Overexpression of hTERT was also observed in the patient-derived OSCC organoid compared to that of normal organoid.

T1 relaxation times measured immediately after death differed by the presence or absence of soaking water, except in case of cold water temperature. In the drowning groups, T1 relaxation time showed a linear dependency on water temperature. By contrast, T2 relaxation time was almost constant regardless of the presence of drowning under the same temperature condition; when compared in the lung areas of the same individuals, the times were uniformly reduced in drowning models.

Loss of Rab11-FIP1 increases tumor cell invasion in part through mutant p53 but also in an independent manner. Furthermore, loss of Rab11-FIP1 in human ESCC cell lines decreases E-cadherin expression and increases mesenchymal lineage-specific markers, suggesting induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

(GWAS) needs to have a suitable population. The factors that affect a GWAS (e.g. population structure, sample size, and sequence analysis and field testing costs) need to be considered. Mixed populations containing subpopulations of different genetic backgrounds may be suitable populations. We conducted simulation experiments to see if a population with high genetic diversity, such as a diversity panel, should be added to a target population, especially when the target population harbors small genetic diversity. The target population was 112 accessions of Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica, mainly developed in Japan. We combined the target population with three populations that had higher genetic diversity. These were 100 indica accessions, 100 japonica accessions, and 100 accessions with various genetic backgrounds. The results showed that the GWAS's power with a mixed population was generally higher than with a separate population. Also, the optimal GWAS populations varied depending on the fixation index (FST ) of the quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) and the polymorphism of QTNs in each population. When a QTN was polymorphic in a target population, a target population combined with a higher diversity population improved the QTN's detection power. By investigating FST and the expected heterozygosity (He ) as factors influencing the detection power, we showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms with high FST or low He are less likely to be detected by GWAS with mixed populations. Sequenced or genotyped germplasm collections can improve the GWAS's detection power by using a subset of the collections with a target population.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Japan", "Oryza", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kosuke", "Last Name": "Hamazaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The Univ. of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiromi", "Last Name": "Kajiya-Kanegae", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The Univ. of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Masanori", "Last Name": "Yamasaki", "Affiliation": "Food Resources Education and Research Center, Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Kobe Univ., 1348 Uzurano, Kasai, Hyogo, 675-2103, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kaworu", "Last Name": "Ebana", "Affiliation": "Genetic Resources Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Shiori", "Last Name": "Yabe", "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8518, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8604, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroyoshi", "Last Name": "Iwata", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The Univ. of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan."}], "Journal": "The plant genome", "PubDate": "2020Mar"}, {"PMID": "32966340", "Title": "Autophagy mitigates ethanol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in esophageal keratinocytes.", "Abstract": "During alcohol consumption, the esophageal mucosa is directly exposed to high concentrations of ethanol (EtOH). We therefore investigated the response of normal human esophageal epithelial cell lines EPC1, EPC2 and EPC3 to acute EtOH exposure. While these cells were able to tolerate 2% EtOH for 8 h in both three-dimensional organoids and monolayer culture conditions, RNA sequencing suggested that EtOH induced mitochondrial dysfunction. With EtOH treatment, EPC1 and EPC2 cells also demonstrated decreased mitochondrial ATPB protein expression by immunofluorescence and swollen mitochondria lacking intact cristae by transmission electron microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) was decreased in a subset of EPC1 and EPC2 cells stained with \u0394\u03a8m-sensitive dye MitoTracker Deep Red. In EPC2, EtOH decreased ATP level while impairing mitochondrial respiration and electron transportation chain functions, as determined by ATP fluorometric assay, respirometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, EPC2 cells demonstrated enhanced oxidative stress by flow cytometry for mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), which was antagonized by the mitochondria-specific antioxidant MitoCP. Concurrently, EPC1 and EPC2 cells underwent autophagy following EtOH exposure, as evidenced by flow cytometry for Cyto-ID, which detects autophagic vesicles, and immunoblots demonstrating induction of the lipidated and cleaved form of LC3B and downregulation of SQSTM1/p62. In EPC1 and EPC2, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy flux by chloroquine increased mitochondrial oxidative stress while decreasing cell viability. In EPC2, autophagy induction was coupled with phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, and dephosphorylation of downstream substrates of mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex (mTORC)-1 signaling. Pharmacological AMPK activation by AICAR decreased EtOH-induced reduction of \u0394\u03a8m and ATP in EPC2. Taken together, acute EtOH exposure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in esophageal keratinocytes, where the AMPK-mTORC1 axis may serve as a regulatory mechanism to activate

granulation is important to control drug product qualities. In this study, a practical scale-free soft sensor to predict water content was proposed to cope with the manufacturing scale changes in drug product development. The proposed method exploits two key ideas to construct a scale-free soft sensor. First, to accommodate the changes in the manufacturing scale, the process parameters (PPs) that are critical to water content at different manufacturing scales were selected as input variables. Second, to construct an accurate statistical model, locally weighted partial least squares regression (LW-PLSR), which can cope with collinearity and nonlinearity, was utilized. The soft sensor was developed using both laboratory (approx. 4\u2009kg) data and pilot (approx. 25\u2009kg) scale data, and the prediction accuracy in the commercial (approx. 100\u2009kg) scale was evaluated based on the assumption that the process was scaled-up from the pilot scale to the commercial scale. The developed soft sensor exhibited a high prediction accuracy, which was equivalent to the commonly used near-infrared (NIR) spectra-based method.

GS might deliver high-rank correlations but incurring in serious bias. Days to heading (DTH) is a crucial development stage in rice for regional adaptability with a significant impact on yield potential. The objective of this research consisted in develop a novel method that accurately predicts time-related traits such as DTH in unobserved environments. For this, we propose an implementation that incorporates day length information (DL) in the prediction process for two relevant scenarios: CV0, predicting tested genotypes in unobserved environments (C method); and CV00, predicting untested genotypes in unobserved environments (CB method). The use of DL has advantages over weather data since it can be determined in advance just by knowing the location and planting date. The proposed methods showed that DL information significantly helps to improve the predictive ability of DTH in unobserved environments. Under CV0, the C method returned a root-mean-square\u00a0error (RMSE) of 3.9\u00a0days, a Pearson correlation (PC) of 0.98 and the differences between the predicted and observed environmental means (EMD) ranged between -4.95 and 4.67\u00a0days.

We further show that Olig2+ cells are essential for SCI-induced semaphorin expression, and that Olig2 binds to putative enhancer regions of the semaphorin genes. Finally, conditional deletion of Olig2 in the spinal cord reduces the expression of semaphorins, alleviating the axon retraction.

Our study establishes the first well-characterized panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids from HPV+ HNSCCs while determining fidelity of the models to the distinguishing genetic features of this cancer type. Despite low engraftment rates, whole exome sequencing showed that PDXs retain multiple distinguishing features of HPV+ HNSCC lost in existing cell lines, including PIK3CA mutations, TRAF3 deletion and the absence of EGFR amplifications. Engrafted HPV+ tumors frequently contained NOTCH1 mutations, thus providing new models for a negatively prognostic alteration in this disease. Genotype-phenotype associations in the models were then tested for prediction of tumor progression and survival in published clinical cohorts. Observation of high tumor mutational burdens (TMBs) in the faster-growing models facilitated identification of a novel association between TMB and local progression in both HPV+ and HPV- patients that was prognostic in HPV- cases. In addition, reduced E7 and p16INK4A levels found in a PDX from an outlier case with lethal outcome led to detection of similar profiles among recurrent HPV+ HNSCCs. Transcriptional data from the Cancer Genome Atlas was used to demonstrate that the lower E2F target gene expression predicted by reduced E7 levels has potential as a biomarker of disease recurrence risk. Our findings bridge a critical gap in preclinical models for HPV+ HNSCCs and simultaneously reveal novel potential applications of quantifying mutational burden and viral oncogene functions for

At this timescale, protein dynamics is highly coupled with hydration, which is observed as protein dynamical transition (PDT). INS is very sensitive to hydrogen atomic dynamics because of the large incoherent scattering cross section of hydrogen atom, and thus, the INS of a hydrated protein provides overall dynamic information about the protein, including hydration water. Separation of hydration water dynamics is essential for understanding hydration-related protein dynamics. H2O/D2O exchange is an effective method in the context of INS experiments for observing the dynamics of protein and hydration water separately. Neutron scattering is directly related to the van Hove space-time correlation function, which can be calculated quantitatively by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Diffusion and hydrogen bond dynamics of hydration water can be analyzed by performing MD simulation. MD simulation is useful for analyzing the dynamic coupling mechanism in hydration-related protein dynamics from the viewpoint of interpreting INS data because PDT is induced by hydration.

This experimental technique can provide information about protein dynamics in timescales of pico- to nanoseconds and at spatial scales of nanometers; these dynamics can help quantify the rigidity of a protein by indices such as force constant, Boson peak, dynamical transition, and dynamical heterogeneity. These indicators also reflect the rigidity of a protein's secondary and tertiary structures. In addition, the indices reveal how rigidity is influenced by different environmental parameters, such as hydration, temperature, pressure, and protein-protein interactions.

In the present study, we investigated the interactions between epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and ABCG2 by MTT assay, intracellular drug accumulation assay, and FACS. This study showed that four epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) (gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, and afatinib) were transported from tumor cells as substrates of ABCG2. Q141K is a common single-nucleotide polymorphism of ABCG2 in Asians. We demonstrated that the extracellular efflux of gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib was reduced by Q141K, whereas afatinib transport was not affected. In addition, all four EGFR TKIs inhibited the transport of other substrates by both wild-type and variant ABCG2 at 0.1 \u03bcM concentrations.

Prolonged experimental hypoxia or HIF1A knockdown suppressed HIF-1\u03b1-dependent claudin-1 expression and epithelial barrier function, as documented in 3D organotypic epithelial cultures. L2-IL5OXA mice with EoE-relevant allergic inflammation displayed localized eosinophil oxygen metabolism, tissue hypoxia, and impaired claudin-1 barrier via repression of HIF-1\u03b1/claudin-1 signaling, which was restored by transgenic expression of esophageal epithelial-targeted stabilized HIF-1\u03b1. EoE patient biopsy analysis identified a repressed HIF-1\u03b1/claudin-1 axis, which was restored via pharmacologic HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization ex vivo.

Hydration, pressurization, and cooling shift the boson peak position to higher energy and depress the peak intensity and decreases the protein and cavity volumes.

A cassette of 19 epithelial and immune cell markers was used to detect differences between cellular compartments in normal and BE tissues. We found that the BE microenvironment has an immunological landscape distinct from adjacent normal epithelium. BE has an increased percentage of epithelial cells with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of immune cells, accompanied by a shift in the immune landscape from a predominantly T cell rich microenvironment in normal tissue to a B cell rich landscape in BE tissue. Hierarchical clustering separates BE and normal samples into two discrete groups based upon our 19-marker panel, but also reveals unexpected, shared phenotypes for three patients.

extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway in human gingival fibroblasts.", "Abstract": "Wound healing is a dynamic process that involves highly coordinated cellular events, including proliferation and migration. Oral gingival fibroblasts serve a central role in maintaining oral mucosa homeostasis, and their functions include the coordination of physiological tissue repair. Recently, surface pre\u2011reacted glass\u2011ionomer (S\u2011PRG) fillers have been widely applied in the field of dental materials for the prevention of dental caries, due to an excellent ability to release fluoride (F). In addition to F, S\u2011PRG fillers are known to release several types of ions, including aluminum (Al), boron (B), sodium (Na), silicon (Si) and strontium (Sr). However, the influence of these ions on gingival fibroblasts remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of various concentrations of an S\u2011PRG filler eluate on the growth and migration of gingival fibroblasts. The human gingival fibroblast cell line HGF\u20111 was treated with various dilutions of an eluent solution of S\u2011PRG, which contained 32.0\u00a0ppm Al, 1,488.6\u00a0ppm B, 505.0\u00a0ppm Na, 12.9\u00a0ppm Si, 156.5\u00a0ppm Sr and 136.5\u00a0ppm F. Treatment with eluate at a dilution of 1:10,000 was observed to significantly promote the migration of HGF\u20111 cells. In addition, the current study evaluated the mechanism underlying the mediated cell migration by the S\u2011PRG solution and revealed that it activated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), but not of p38. Furthermore, treatment with a MEK inhibitor blocked the cell migration induced by the solution. Taken together, these results suggest that S\u2011PRG fillers can stimulate HGF\u20111 cell migration via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, indicating that a dental material containing this type of filler is useful for oral mucosa homeostasis and wound healing.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aluminum", "Boron", "Cell Line", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Fibroblasts", "Gingiva", "Humans", "Ions", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3", "Phosphorylation", "Signal Transduction", "Silicon", "Sodium", "Strontium", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kimiko", "Last Name": "Yamaguchi-Ueda", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yuki", "Last Name": "Akazawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Keita", "Last Name": "Kawarabayashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Asuna", "Last Name": "Sugimoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Aya", "Last Name": "Miyazaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Rika", "Last Name": "Kurogoushi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kokoro", "Last Name": "Iwata", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Takamasa", "Last Name": "Kitamura", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Aya", "Last Name": "Yamada", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Dentistry, Department of Oral Health and Development Sciences, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Sendai 980\u20118575, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tomokazu", "Last Name": "Hasegawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Satoshi", "Last Name": "Fukumoto", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Dentistry, Department of Oral Health and Development Sciences, Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Sendai 980\u20118575, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tsutomu", "Last Name": "Iwamoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima 770\u20118504, Japan."}], "Journal": "Molecular medicine reports", "PubDate": "2019Jun"}, {"PMID": "31041783", "Title": "Mutations in foregut SOX2+ cells induce efficient proliferation via CXCR2 pathway.", "Abstract": "Identification of the precise molecular pathways involved in oncogene-induced transformation may help us gain a better understanding of tumor initiation and promotion.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the association between ABCC11 rs17822931 and breast cancer risk in a Japanese population. We conducted a case-control study in 697 patients with breast cancer and 1394 age- and menopausal status-matched controls within the framework of the Hospital-based Epidemiological Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center II (HERPACC II). The association was evaluated with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using a conditional logistic model adjusted for potential confounders. In the per allele model, compared with the A allele, the G allele was inversely associated with breast cancer: OR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.62-0.95 and P = 0.013. The stratified analyses showed that this polymorphism had a high impact on estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer risk and conditions assumed to correlate with high exposure to estrogen, namely no lactation and low soy intake. Our data showed that a significant association between rs17822931 and the risk of breast cancer, especially ER-positive breast cancer, in Japanese women.

We developed a method for describing grain weight distribution, which is the probability density function of single grain weight in a panicle, using 128 Japanese rice varieties. With this method, we quantitively analyzed genotypic differences in grain-filling ability and used the grain weight distribution parameters for genomic prediction subject to genetic improvement in grain yield in rice. The novel description method could represent the observed grain weight distribution with five genotype-specific parameters of a mixture of two gamma distributions. The estimated genotype-specific parameters representing the proportion of filled grains had applicability to explain the grain filling ability of genotypes comparable to that of sink-filling rate and the conventionally measured proportion of filled grains, which suggested the efficiency and flexibility of grain weight distribution parameters to handle several genotypes. We revealed that perfectly filled grains have to be prioritized over partially filled grains for the optimum allocation of the source of yield in a panicle, from the analysis for obtaining an ideal shape of grain weight distribution. We conducted genomic prediction of grain weight distribution considering five genotype-specific parameters of the distribution as phenotypes relating to grain filling ability. The proportion of filled grains, average weight of filled grains, and variance of filled grain weight, which were considered to control grain yield to a certain degree, were predicted with accuracies of 0.30, 0.28, and 0.53, respectively.

Accelerated telomere loss has been associated with premature aging syndromes such as Werner's syndrome and Dyskeratosis Congenita, while, progressive telomere loss activates a DNA damage response leading to chromosomal instability, typically observed in cancer cells and senescent cells. Therefore, identifying mechanisms of telomere length maintenance is critical for understanding human pathologies. In this paper we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a causal role in telomere shortening. Furthermore, hnRNPA2, a mitochondrial stress responsive lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) acetylates telomere histone H4at lysine 8 of (H4K8) and this acetylation is associated with telomere attrition. Cells containing dysfunctional mitochondria have higher telomere H4K8 acetylation and shorter telomeres independent of cell proliferation rates. Ectopic expression of KAT mutant hnRNPA2 rescued telomere length possibly due to impaired H4K8 acetylation coupled with inability to activate telomerase expression. The phenotypic outcome of telomere shortening in immortalized cells included chromosomal instability (end-fusions) and telomerase activation, typical of an oncogenic transformation; while in non-telomerase expressing fibroblasts, mitochondrial dysfunction induced-telomere attrition resulted in senescence.

Methods Consecutive patients with slow/fast AVNRT were included. During stable slow/fast AVNRT, a single late atrial extrastimulus (AES) was delivered at the inferolateral left atrium near the mitral annulus. Advancing the next His bundle potential by \u22655 ms, followed by resetting of the tachycardia cycle length, indicated that the AES engaged the anterograde slow pathway. The latest AES resetting AVNRT was considered to be in close proximity to the atrial end of the anterograde slow pathway and was selected as the ablation target. Results In 10 of 843 (1.2%) patients, ablation at the inferolateral left atrium was required. All patients had had failed ablation at the inferior triangle of Koch and roof of the coronary sinus. In all 10 patients, a late AES advanced the His bundle potential by \u226510 ms and reset the tachycardia. Ablation at that site eliminated slow pathway conduction and terminated the tachycardia. Ablation was successful at the site of the latest AES, delivered 49\u00b112 ms after the onset of the His bundle potential. No recurrent tachycardia was noted at 1 year of follow-up. Conclusions The inferolateral left atrium slow pathway is used in a small subset of patients with slow/fast AVNRT. Accurate localization of the ablation target can be achieved by delivering late AES during AVNRT (resetting response).", "Keywords": ["bundle of His", "catheter ablation", "electrophysiology", "heart atria", "tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentry"], "MeSH terms": ["Accessory Atrioventricular Bundle", "Action Potentials", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Atrioventricular Node", "Catheter Ablation", "Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Tachycardia, Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Stavrakis", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (S.S., W.M.J., D.L., H.N., K.B., K.E., S.S.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Warren M", "Last Name": "Jackman", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (S.S., W.M.J., D.L., H.N., K.B., K.E., S.S.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Lockwood", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (S.S., W.M.J., D.L., H.N., K.B., K.E., S.S.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (S.S., W.M.J., D.L., H.N., K.B., K.E., S.S.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Beckman", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (S.S., W.M.J., D.L., H.N., K.B., K.E., S.S.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Khaled", "Last Name": "Elkholey", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (S.S., W.M.J., D.L., H.N., K.B., K.E., S.S.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Zulu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Shengyang Northern Hospital, China (Z.W.)."}, {"First Name": "Sunny S", "Last Name": "Po", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (S.S., W.M.J., D.L., H.N., K.B., K.E., S.S.P.)."}], "Journal": "Circulation.

Since Hakuba reported the method of trans-unco-discal approach in 1976, it was designed as keyhole foraminotomy which was called transuncal approach, transpedicular approach or transvertebral approach. In the anterior approach, we usually use the right-sided approach because most of us are right-handed surgeons. We retrospectively investigated our patients who had the right foraminal stenosis causing radiculopathy and were treated with microdiscectomy, cage fixation, and right keyhole transuncal foraminotomy. Since 2011, 23 patients were treated with the manner. All of the 23 patients who had central canal stenosis and among the 23 patients, 8 patients showed only right radiculopathy and 15 patients showed radiculo-myelopathy. In all patients, the radiculopathy disappeared or significantly improved without any complications postoperatively.

EoE is increasingly recognized as a cause of swallowing dysfunction, food impaction and esophageal stricture. Inflammation of the esophageal mucosa involves immune cell infiltrate, reactive epithelial changes and fibroblast activation, culminating in robust tissue remodeling toward esophageal fibrosis characterized by excess collagen deposition in the subepithelial lamina propria. Fibrosis contributes to a unique mechanical property of the EoE-affected esophagus that is substantially stiffer than the normal esophagus. There is a great need to better understand the processes behind esophageal fibrosis in order to foster improved diagnostic tools and novel therapeutics for EoE-related esophageal fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the role of esophageal inflammatory microenvironment that promotes esophageal fibrosis, with specific emphasis upon cytokines-mediated functional epithelial-stromal interplays, recruitment and activation of a variety of effector cells, and tissue stiffness.

Herein we report a study on the mechanism through which TF recognizes the proline residue in the unfolded client protein during the cis/trans isomerization process. The solution structure of TF in complex with the client protein showed that TF recognizes the proline-aromatic motif located in the hydrophobic stretch of the unfolded client protein through its conserved hydrophobic cleft, which suggests that TF preferentially accelerates the isomerization of the peptidyl-prolyl bond that is eventually folded into the core of the protein in its native fold. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that TF exploits the backbone amide group of Ile195 to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the amino acid residue preceding the proline residue at the transition state, which presumably stabilizes the transition state and thus accelerates the isomerization. The importance of such intermolecular hydrogen-bond formation during the catalysis was further corroborated by the activity assay and NMR relaxation analysis.", "Keywords": ["hydrophobic interaction", "molecular chaperone", "molecular dynamics", "nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)", "peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain", "prolyl isomerase", "protein folding", "structure-function", "trigger factor"], "MeSH terms": ["Catalysis", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Isomerism", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Chaperones", "Peptidylprolyl Isomerase", "Proline", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Folding", "Ribosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Soichiro", "Last Name": "Kawagoe", "Affiliation": "From the Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-8628, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "the Materials Sciences Research Center, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Tokai, Ibaraki 319-1195, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroyuki", "Last Name": "Kumeta", "Affiliation": "the Faculty of Advanced Life Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 011-0021, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Koichiro", "Last Name": "Ishimori", "Affiliation": "From the Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-8628, Japan, koichiro@sci.hokudai.ac.jp."}, {"First Name": "Tomohide", "Last Name": "Saio", "Affiliation": "From the Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-8628, Japan, saio@sci.hokudai.ac.jp."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2018Sep28"}, {"PMID": "29926821", "Title": "Promoting functional recovery by inhibition of repulsive guidance molecule-a after spinal cord injury.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London, Queen Square, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Masahiko", "Last Name": "Takada", "Affiliation": "Systems Neuroscience Section, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Japan."}], "Journal": "Neural regeneration research", "PubDate": "2018Jun"}, {"PMID": "32494496", "Title": "Catheter Ablation of Ischemic Ventricular Tachycardia Originating from an Inferobasal Right Ventricular Scar Using Substrate Mapping: A Case Report.", "Abstract": "Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) has emerged as a superior alternative to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, with the vast majority of ischemic VT being ablation from the endocardial surface of the left ventricle (LV).

From then, a biennial meeting was held every other year in Korea or Japan until 2009. In September 2010, the next generation of spinal neurosurgeons decided to organize the first meeting of ASIA SPINE in Incheon, Korea, in order to represent all Asian spine specialists. This meeting has been since held annually around the region including in Taiwan. Remembering the pioneers in the field of spinal surgery is invaluable and extremely important.

Abnormal growth of stratified keratinized squamous epithelium in the temporal bone causes destruction of the outer and middle ear, potentially leading to hearing impairment, facial palsy, vertigo, lateral sinus thrombosis, and intracranial complications. Although cholesteatoma is effectively treated by surgical resection (mastoidectomy), the lack of effective and nonsurgical therapies potentially results in fatal consequences, establishing the need for a comprehensive investigation of cholesteatoma pathogenesis. Although its etiology is still being debated, interestingly, we found that the trend associated with the 538G allele frequency of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter C11 (ABCC11) gene, the determinant of wet-type earwax, and ethnic groups was similar to that between the incidence of cholesteatoma and ethnic groups (countries). The incidences of cholesteatoma in Europe (Denmark, Finland, and Scotland) are higher than in East Asia (Japan), and the frequencies of the ABCC11 538G allele in African, American, and European (Finland and Scotland) populations are higher than those in East Asian populations (Japan). Additionally, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the ABCC11 gene (rs17822931, 538G\u202f>\u202fA; Gly180Arg) is closely related to earwax morphotypes. While earwax is often beneficial to ear health, it is sometimes harmful in cases where it causes hearing impairment.

However, the utility of emerging JARID1 family inhibitors remains uncertain, in part because JARID1B's functions in normal development and malignancy are diverse and highly context-specific. In this study, responses of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) to catalytic inhibition of JARID1B were assessed using CPI-455, the first tool compound with true JARID1 family selectivity. CPI-455 attenuated clonal sphere and tumor formation by stem-like cells that highly express JARID1B while also depleting the CD44-positive and Aldefluor-high fractions conventionally used to designate OSCC stem cells. Silencing JARID1B abrogated CPI-455's effects on sphere formation, supporting that the drug acted through this isoform. To further delineate CPI-455's capacity to block JARID1B's functions, its biologic effects were compared against those indicated by pathway analysis of the transcriptional profile produced by JARID1B knockdown. Downregulation of multiple gene sets related to stem cell function was consistent with the drug's observed actions. However, strong E-Cadherin upregulation seen upon silencing JARID1B surprisingly could not be reproduced using CPI-455. Expressing a demethylase-inactive mutant of JARID1B demonstrated suppression of this transcript to be demethylase-independent, and the capacity of mutant JARID1B but not CPI-455 to modulate invasion provided a functional correlate of this finding. These results show that JARID1B catalytic inhibition effectively targets some stem cell-like features of malignancy but also reveal demethylase-independent actions refractory to inhibition.

experiments.", "Abstract": "The CO2 fertilization effect is a major source of uncertainty in crop models for future yield forecasts, but coordinated efforts to determine the mechanisms of this uncertainty have been lacking. Here, we studied causes of uncertainty among 16 crop models in predicting rice yield in response to elevated [CO2] (E-[CO2]) by comparison to free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) and chamber experiments. The model ensemble reproduced the experimental results well. However, yield prediction in response to E-[CO2] varied significantly among the rice models. The variation was not random: models that overestimated at one experiment simulated greater yield enhancements at the others. The variation was not associated with model structure or magnitude of photosynthetic response to E-[CO2] but was significantly associated with the predictions of leaf area. This suggests that modelled secondary effects of E-[CO2] on morphological development, primarily leaf area, are the sources of model uncertainty. Rice morphological development is conservative to carbon acquisition. Uncertainty will be reduced by incorporating this conservative nature of the morphological response to E-[CO2] into the models. Nitrogen levels, particularly under limited situations, make the prediction more uncertain. Improving models to account for [CO2]\u2009\u00d7\u2009N interactions is necessary to better evaluate management practices under climate change.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Carbon Dioxide", "Climate Change", "Crops, Agricultural", "Models, Biological", "Nitrogen", "Oryza", "Plant Leaves"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Toshihiro", "Last Name": "Hasegawa", "Affiliation": "Tohoku Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Morioka, Iwate, 020-0198, Japan. thase@affrc.go.jp."}, {"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "International Rice Research Institute, DAPO Box, 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines. t.li@irri.org."}, {"First Name": "Xinyou", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Centre for Crop Systems Analysis, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, PO Box 430, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "National Engineering and Technology Center for Information Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210095, China."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Boote", "Affiliation": "University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32611-0500, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Big Spring, Texas, 79720, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Bregaglio", "Affiliation": "CREA, Research Center for Agriculture and Environment, Bologna, 40128, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Buis", "Affiliation": "INRA, UMR1114 EMMAH, F-84914, Avignon, France."}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Confalonieri", "Affiliation": "University of Milan, Cassandra lab, Milan, 20133, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Job", "Last Name": "Fugice", "Affiliation": "International Fertilizer Development Center, Muscle Shoals, Alabama, 35662, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamon", "Last Name": "Fumoto", "Affiliation": "Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8604, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Gaydon", "Affiliation": "CSIRO Agriculture and Food, St Lucia, QLD, 4067, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Soora Naresh", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, 110012, India."}, {"First Name": "Tanguy", "Last Name": "Lafarge", "Affiliation": "Cirad, UMR AGAP, F-34398, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Manuel", "Last Name": "Marcaida Iii", "Affiliation": "International Rice Research Institute, DAPO Box, 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines."}, {"First Name": "Yuji", "Last Name": "Masutomi", "Affiliation": "Ibaraki University, College of Agriculture, Inashiki, Ibaraki, 300-0393, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Ibaraki University, College of Agriculture, Inashiki, Ibaraki, 300-0393, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Oriol", "Affiliation": "Cirad, UMR AGAP, F-34398, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Fran\u00e7oise", "Last Name": "Ruget", "Affiliation": "INRA, UMR1114 EMMAH, F-84914, Avignon, France."}, {"First Name": "Upendra", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "International Fertilizer Development Center, Muscle Shoals, Alabama, 35662, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "National Engineering and Technology Center for Information Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210095, China."}, {"First Name": "Fulu", "Last Name": "Tao", "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Beijing, 100101, P.R.

The relation of queretin's cytoprotective and cytotoxic effects are unknown. Quercetin has been shown to induce expression of hypoxia-inducible factor, a protein that is known to regulate transcription of the erythropoietin (EPO) gene, and EPO is known to have a cytoprotective effect. This study used HepG2 cells to assess whether the cell-protective and/or cytotoxic roles of quercetin are mediated by promotion of EPO production. Increases in the levels of HIF-1\u03b1 protein and EPO mRNA were quercetin concentration-dependent, with significant increases observed from 10\u00a0\u03bcM quercetin. Silencing of EPO expression by si-EPO RNA attenuated quercetin-induced cytoprotection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity. Cytotoxicity, evidenced by the induction of apoptosis, was significantly increased by exposure to 50\u00a0\u03bcM quercetin. Specifically, the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax and the rate of cell death increased, and the level of Bcl-2 decreased, in cells treated with 50\u00a0\u03bcM quercetin. In contrast, exposure to 10\u00a0\u03bcM quercetin attenuated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. However, quercetin's ability to protect cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis was eliminated when EPO expression was silenced using si-EPO RNA. Together, these results suggested that quercetin's cytoprotective effects in HepG2 cells are mediated via EPO production.", "Keywords": ["Cytoprotection", "Cytotoxicity", "Erythropoietin", "Quercetin"], "MeSH terms": ["Caspase 3", "Cytoprotection", "Cytotoxins", "Erythropoietin", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Quercetin", "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kazuhiko", "Last Name": "Nishimura", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioenvironmental Sciences, Course of Veterinary Science, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Izumisano, Osaka 598-8531, Japan.

inducers of oesophageal epithelial cell invasion.", "Abstract": "Oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas and oesophageal adenocarcinomas show distinct patterns of ErbB expression and dimers. The functional effects of specific ErbB homodimers or heterodimers on oesophageal (cancer) cell behaviour, particularly invasion during early carcinogenesis, remain unknown. Here, a new cellular model system for controlled activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and EGFR-HER2 or HER2-human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) homodimers and heterodimers was studied in non-neoplastic squamous oesophageal epithelial Het-1A cells. EGFR, HER2 and HER3 intracellular domains (ICDs) were fused to dimerization domains (DmrA/DmrA and DmrC), and transduced into Het-1A cells lacking ErbB expression. Dimerization of EGFR, HER2 or EGFR-HER2 and HER2-HER3 ICDs was induced by synthetic ligands (A/A or A/C dimerizers). This was accompanied by phosphorylation of the respective EGFR, HER2 and HER3 ICDs and activation of distinct downstream signalling pathways, such as phospholipase C\u03b31, Akt, STAT and Src family kinases. Phenotypically, ErbB dimers caused cell rounding and non-apoptotic blebbing, specifically in EGFR-HER2 and HER2-HER3 heterodimer cells. In a Transwell assay, cell migration velocity was elevated in HER2 dimer cells as compared with empty vector cells. In addition, HER2 dimer cells showed in increased cell invasion, reaching significance for induced HER2-HER3 heterodimers (P\u2009=\u20090.015). Importantly, in three-dimensional organotypic cultures, empty vector cells grew as a superficial cell layer, resembling oesophageal squamous epithelium. In contrast, induced HER2 homodimer cells were highly invasive into the matrix and formed cell clusters. This was associated with partial loss of cytokeratin 7 (when HER2 homodimers were modelled) and p63 (when EGFR-HER2 heterodimers were modelled), which suggests a change or loss of squamous cell differentiation. Controlled activation of specific EGFR, HER2 and HER3 homodimers and heterodimers caused oesophageal squamous epithelial cell migration and/or invasion, especially in a three-dimensional microenvironment, thereby functionally identifying ErbB homodimers and heterodimers as important drivers of oesophageal carcinogenesis.

Novel therapies directly targeting CSCs have the potential to improve prognosis of ESCC patients. Although fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) expression correlates with recurrence and poor survival in ESCC patients, the role of FGF-2 in regulation of ESCC CSCs has yet to be elucidated. We report that FGF-2 is significantly upregulated in CSCs and significantly increases CSC content in ESCC cell lines by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conversely, the FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547, sharply diminishes CSCs via induction of mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Further experiments revealed that MAPK/Erk kinase (Mek)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) pathway is crucial for FGF-2-mediated CSC regulation. Pharmacological inhibition of FGF receptor (FGFR)-mediated signaling via AZD4547 did not affect CSCs in Ras mutated cells, implying that Mek/Erk pathway, downstream of FGFR signaling, might be an important regulator of CSCs. Indeed, the Mek inhibitor, trametinib, efficiently suppressed ESCC CSCs even in the context of Ras mutation. Consistent with these findings in vitro, xenotransplantation studies demonstrated that inhibition of FGF-2-mediated FGFR/Erk signaling significantly delayed tumor growth. Taken together, these findings indicate that FGF-2 is an essential factor regulating CSCs via Mek/Erk signaling in ESCC. Additionally, inhibition of FGFR and/or Mek signaling represents a potential novel therapeutic option for targeting CSCs in ESCC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Benzamides", "Carcinoma, Squamous

Accumulation of protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen causes ER stress. Although ER stress is a principal cause of apoptosis and autophagy, the relationship between PLD activity and ER stress remains unclear. Protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus is conducted by coat complex II (COPII) transport vesicles. Here, we demonstrated that inhibition of PLD1 activity or PLD1 knockdown suppressed COPII vesicle transport in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. COPII vesicle coat proteins are composed of Sar1 as well as Sec23/24 and Sec13/31 complexes. For COPII vesicle formation on the ER membrane, Sar1, Sec23/24, and Sec13/31 are sequentially recruited from the cytosol to the ER membrane. Using a cell-free COPII coat protein recruitment assay, we demonstrated that inhibition of PLD1 activity suppressed Sec13/31 recruitment from the cytosol to the ER membrane in COPII vesicle formation. PLD1 knockdown in NRK cells was associated with increased expression of the ER stress marker GRP78 and apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that PLD1 activity regulates COPII vesicle transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by regulating Sec13/31 recruitment from the cytosol to the ER membrane during COPII vesicle formation.", "Keywords": ["Apoptosis", "COPII transport", "ER stress", "Phospholipase D"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "COP-Coated Vesicles", "Cell Line", "Cytosol", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Golgi Apparatus", "Male", "Phospholipase D", "Protein Transport", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan.

The flow resistivity was calculated by using the finite element method for a two-dimensional incompressible viscous fluid approximated by Oseen flow. The tortuosity and characteristic lengths were calculated by using the complex variable boundary element method for a two-dimensional potential flow. These calculations showed that the flow resistivity was inversely proportional to the porosity multiplied by the three-halves power of the compression ratio, that the tortuosity can be represented by a linear expression of the porosity, and that both characteristic lengths changed in the same manner with respect to the porosity. These tendencies agreed well with measurements of real glass wools of various bulk densities.

Rapid epithelial renewal occurs, but the specific cell of origin that supports this high proliferative demand remains unknown. Herein, we have described a long-lived progenitor cell population in the mouse esophageal epithelium that is characterized by expression of keratin 15 (Krt15). Genetic in vivo lineage tracing revealed that the Krt15 promoter marks a long-lived basal cell population able to self-renew, proliferate, and generate differentiated cells, consistent with a progenitor/stem cell population. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Krt15+ basal cells are molecularly distinct from Krt15- basal cells. Depletion of Krt15-derived cells resulted in decreased proliferation, thereby leading to atrophy of the esophageal epithelium. Further, Krt15+ cells were radioresistant and contributed to esophageal epithelial regeneration following radiation-induced injury. These results establish the presence of a long-lived and indispensable Krt15+ progenitor cell population that provides additional perspective on esophageal epithelial biology and the widely prevalent diseases that afflict this epithelium.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Esophagus", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Keratin-15", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mucous Membrane", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Radiation Injuries, Experimental", "Regeneration", "Stem Cells", "Transcriptional Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "V\u00e9ronique", "Last Name": "Giroux", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Ashley A", "Last Name": "Lento", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Mirazul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason R", "Last Name": "Pitarresi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Akriti", "Last Name": "Kharbanda", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn E", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Whelan", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Apple", "Last Name": "Long", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Ben", "Last Name": "Rhoades", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Qiaosi", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Lengner", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, and Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bass", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "E Paul", "Last Name": "Wileyto", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andres J", "Last Name": "Klein-Szanto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2017Jun01"}, {"PMID": "28381417", "Title": "Determinants of Acute and Late Pulmonary Vein Reconnection in Contact Force-Guided Pulmonary Vein Isolation: Identifying the Weakest Link in the Ablation Chain.", "Abstract": "Pulmonary vein reconnection (PVR) still determines recurrences of atrial fibrillation after contact force (CF)-guided pulmonary vein isolation.

Dysphagia is a post-ACDF complication. When it coincides with prevertebral space enlargement and inflammation, surgical site infection and pharyngoesophageal perforation must be considered. The association between dysphagia and prevertebral inflammation has not been reported. The authors investigated factors eliciting severe dysphagia and its relationship with prevertebral inflammation in patients who had undergone ACDF. MATERIALS The clinical data of 299 patients who underwent 307 ACDF procedures for cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy at Kushiro Kojinkai Memorial Hospital and Kushiro Neurosurgical Hospital between December 2007 and August 2014 were reviewed. RESULTS After 7 ACDF procedures (2.3%), 7 patients suffered severe prolonged and/or delayed dysphagia and odynophagia that prevented ingestion. In all 7 patients the prevertebral space was enlarged. In 5 (1.6%) the symptom was thought to be associated with prevertebral soft-tissue edema; in all 5 an inflammatory response, hyperthermia, and an increase in the white blood cell count and in C-reactive protein level was observed. After 2 procedures (0.7%), we noted prevertebral hematoma without an inflammatory response. None of the patients who had undergone 307 ACDF procedures manifested pharyngoesophageal perforation or surgical site infection. CONCLUSIONS Severe dysphagia and odynophagia are post-ACDF complications. In most instances they are attributable to prevertebral soft-tissue edema accompanied by inflammatory responses such as fever and an increase in the white blood cell count and in C-reactive protein.

Recent studies suggest that these mitochondrial changes cause transcriptional reprogramming of nuclear genes although the mechanism of this cross talk remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling regulates chromatin acetylation and alters nuclear gene expression through the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNAP2). These processes are reversed when mitochondrial DNA content is restored to near normal cell levels. We show that the mitochondrial stress-induced transcription coactivator hnRNAP2 acetylates Lys 8 of H4 through an intrinsic histone lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity with Arg 48 and Arg 50 of hnRNAP2 being essential for acetyl-CoA binding and acetyltransferase activity. H4K8 acetylation at the mitochondrial stress-responsive promoters by hnRNAP2 is essential for transcriptional activation. We found that the previously described mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling-mediated transformation of C2C12 cells caused an increased expression of genes involved in various oncogenic processes, which is retarded in hnRNAP2 silenced or hnRNAP2 KAT mutant cells.

Indeed, chronic alcohol consumption accounts for approximately 3.6% of all cancers worldwide. However, how the adducts are prevented and repaired after acetaldehyde exposure is not well understood. In this report, we used the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model organism to comprehensively understand the genetic controls of DNA damage avoidance in response to acetaldehyde. We demonstrate that Atd1 functions as a major acetaldehyde detoxification enzyme that prevents accumulation of Rad52-DNA repair foci, while Atd2 and Atd3 have minor roles in acetaldehyde detoxification. We found that acetaldehyde causes DNA damage at the replication fork and activates the cell cycle checkpoint to coordinate cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Our investigation suggests that acetaldehyde-mediated DNA adducts include interstrand-crosslinks and DNA-protein crosslinks. We also demonstrate that acetaldehyde activates multiple DNA repair pathways. Nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination, which are both epistatically linked to the Fanconi anemia pathway, have major roles in acetaldehyde tolerance, while base excision repair and translesion synthesis also contribute to the prevention of acetaldehyde-dependent genomic instability. We also show the involvement of Wss1-related metalloproteases, Wss1 and Wss2, in acetaldehyde tolerance. These results indicate that acetaldehyde causes cellular stresses that require cells to coordinate multiple cellular processes in order to prevent genomic instability.

Evaluation of oral cancers for such heterogeneity identified two compartments within the CSC pool. One compartment was detected using a reporter for expression of the H3K4me3 demethylase JARID1B to isolate a JARID1B(high) fraction of cells with stem cell-like function. JARID1B(high) cells expressed oral CSC markers including CD44 and ALDH1 and showed increased PI3K pathway activation. They were distinguished from a fraction in a G0-like cell-cycle state characterized by low reactive oxygen species and suppressed PI3K/AKT signaling. G0-like cells lacked conventional CSC markers but were primed to acquire stem cell-like function by upregulating JARID1B, which directly mediated transition to a state expressing known oral CSC markers. The transition was regulated by PI3K signals acting upstream of JARID1B expression, resulting in PI3K inhibition depleting JARID1B(high) cells but expanding the G0-like subset. These findings define a novel developmental relationship between two cell phenotypes that may jointly contribute to CSC maintenance. Expansion of the G0-like subset during targeted depletion of JARID1B(high) cells implicates it as a candidate therapeutic target within the oral CSC pool.

Mice subjected to alcohol drinking show increased oxidative stress and DNA adduct formation in esophageal epithelia where Aldh2 loss augments alcohol-induced genotoxic effects; however, it remains elusive as to how esophageal epithelial cells with dysfunctional Aldh2 cope with oxidative stress related to alcohol metabolism. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy in murine esophageal epithelial cells (keratinocytes) exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde. We find that ethanol and acetaldehyde trigger oxidative stress via mitochondrial superoxide in esophageal keratinocytes. Aldh2-deficient cells appeared to be highly susceptible to ethanol- or acetaldehyde-mediated toxicity. Alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated acetaldehyde production was implicated in ethanol-induced cell injury in Aldh2 deficient cells as ethanol-induced oxidative stress and cell death was partially inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole. Acetaldehyde activated autophagy flux in esophageal keratinocytes where Aldh2 deficiency increased dependence on autophagy to cope with ethanol-induced acetaldehyde-mediated oxidative stress. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy flux by chloroquine stabilized p62/SQSTM1, and increased basal and acetaldehyde-mediate oxidative stress in Aldh2 deficient cells as documented in monolayer culture as well as single-cell derived three-dimensional esophageal organoids, recapitulating a physiological esophageal epithelial proliferation-differentiation gradient. Our innovative approach indicates, for the first time, that autophagy may provide cytoprotection to esophageal epithelial cells responding to oxidative stress that is induced by ethanol and its major metabolite acetaldehyde.

This study was particularly focused on the efficiencies of real-time PCR assays in detecting stx and O-antigen genes of the six serogroups and of IMS-plating methods onto selective agar media including chromogenic agar. Ground beef and radish sprouts samples were inoculated with the six STEC serogroups either at 4-6CFU/25g (low levels) or at 22-29CFU/25g (high levels). The sensitivity of stx detection in ground beef at both levels of inoculation with all six STEC serogroups was 100%. The sensitivity of stx detection was also 100% in radish sprouts at high levels of inoculation with all six STEC serogroups, and 66.7%-91.7% at low levels of inoculation. The sensitivity of detection of O-antigen genes was 100% in both ground beef and radish sprouts at high inoculation levels, while at low inoculation levels, it was 95.8%-100% in ground beef and 66.7%-91.7% in radish sprouts. The sensitivity of detection with IMS-plating was either the same or lower than those of the real-time PCR assays targeting stx and O-antigen genes. The relationship between the results of IMS-plating methods and Ct values of real-time PCR assays were firstly analyzed in detail. Ct values in most samples that tested negative in the IMS-plating method were higher than the maximum Ct values in samples that tested positive in the IMS-plating method. This study indicates that all six STEC serogroups in food contaminated with more than 29CFU/25g were detected by real-time PCR assays targeting stx and O-antigen genes and IMS-plating onto selective agar media. Therefore, screening of stx and O-antigen genes followed by isolation of STECs by IMS-plating methods may be an efficient method to detect the six STEC serogroups.", "Keywords": ["Detection", "Interlaboratory study", "Method", "Non-O157", "O157", "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cattle", "Escherichia coli O157", "Food Contamination", "Food Microbiology", "Immunomagnetic Separation", "Meat", "Molecular Typing", "O Antigens", "Raphanus", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Serogroup"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yukiko", "Last Name": "Hara-Kudo", "Affiliation": "Division of Microbiology, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan.

Genetic polymorphisms associated with potential risks of various human genetic diseases as well as drug-induced adverse reactions have recently been well studied, and their underlying molecular mechanisms are being uncovered by functional genomics as well as genome-wide association studies. Knowledge of certain genetic polymorphisms is clinically important for our understanding of interindividual differences in drug response and/or disease risk. As such evidence accumulates, new clinical applications and practices are needed. In this context, the development of new technologies for simple, fast, accurate, and cost-effective genotyping is imperative. Here, we describe a simple isothermal genotyping method capable of detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC11 gene and its application to the clinical diagnosis of axillary osmidrosis. We have recently reported that axillary osmidrosis is linked with one SNP 538G>A in the ABCC11 gene. Our molecular biological and biochemical studies have revealed that this SNP greatly affects the protein expression level and the function of ABCC11.

Thymic stromal lymphopoetin (TSLP), an epithelial derived cytokine which bridges innate and Th2-type adaptive immune responses in other allergic conditions, is overexpressed in esophageal biopsies of EoE subjects. However, the triggers of TSLP expression in the esophageal epithelium are unknown. The objective of the current study was to characterize TSLP expression in human esophageal epithelium in EoE in vivo and to determine the role of food antigens upon epithelial TSLP expression in vitro. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we localized TSLP in esophageal biopsies of active EoE (\u226515 eos/hpf), inactive EoE (<15 eos/hpf) and non-EoE control subjects, and found that TSLP expression was restricted to the differentiated suprabasal layer of the epithelium in actively inflamed EoE biopsies. Consistent with these results in vivo, inducible TSLP protein secretion was higher in CaCl2 differentiated telomerase-immortalized esophageal epithelial cells (EPC2-hTERT) compared to undifferentiated cells of the basal phenotype, following stimulation with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C). To determine whether food antigens could directly induce epithelial TSLP secretion, differentiated and undifferentiated primary esophageal epithelial cells from EoE and non-EoE subjects were challenged with food antigens clinically relevant to EoE: Chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA), wheat, and milk proteins beta-lactoglobulin (blg) and beta-casein. Food antigens failed to induce TSLP secretion by undifferentiated cells; in contrast, only OVA induced TSLP secretion in differentiated epithelial cells from both EoE and control cell lines, an effect abolished by budesonide and NF-\u03bab inhibition. Together, our study shows that specific food antigens can trigger innate immune mediated esophageal TSLP secretion, suggesting that esophageal epithelial cells at the barrier surface may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of EoE by regulating TSLP expression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antigens", "Budesonide", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line, Transformed", "Cytokines", "Eosinophilic Esophagitis", "Epithelial Cells", "Esophagus", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "NF-kappa B", "Poly I-C", "Toll-Like Receptor 3", "Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Prasanna M", "Last Name": "Chandramouleeswaran", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Dawen", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Anna J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alain", "Last Name": "Benitez", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kara", "Last Name": "Dods", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Fiona", "Last Name": "Gambanga", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin J", "Last Name": "Wilkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jamie", "Last Name": "Merves", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yuliana", "Last Name": "Noah", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sarit", "Last Name": "Toltzis", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer H", "Last Name": "Yearley", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Merck Research Labs, Palo Alto, California 94304, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan M", "Last Name": "Spergel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rene deWaal", "Last Name": "Malefyt", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Merck Research Labs, Palo Alto, California 94304, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Amanda B", "Last Name": "Muir", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mei-Lun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "26969222", "Title": "Remote Magnetic Navigation: A Focus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias.", "Abstract": "VT ablation is based on percutaneous catheter insertion under fluoroscopic guidance to selectively destroy (i.e., ablate) myocardial tissue regions responsible for the initiation or propagation of ventricular arrhythmias. Although the last decade has witnessed a rapid evolution of ablation equipment and techniques, the control over catheter movement during manual ablation has remained largely unchanged. Moreover, the procedures are long, and require ergonomically unfavorable positions, which can lead to operator fatigue. In an attempt to overcome these constraints, several technical advancements, including remote magnetic navigation (RMN), have been developed. RMN utilizes a magnetic field to remotely manipulate specially designed soft-tip ablation catheters anywhere in the x, y, or z plane inside the patient's chest. RMN also facilitates titration of the contact force between the catheter and the myocardial tissue, which may reduce the risk of complications while ensuring adequate lesion formation. There are several non-randomized studies showing that RMN has similar efficacy to manual ablation, while complication rates and total radiation exposure appears to be lower.

genomic selection with crop modelling: the development of an integrated approach to predicting rice heading dates.", "Abstract": "It is suggested that accuracy in predicting plant phenotypes can be improved by integrating genomic prediction with crop modelling in a single hierarchical model. Accurate prediction of phenotypes is important for plant breeding and management. Although genomic prediction/selection aims to predict phenotypes on the basis of whole-genome marker information, it is often difficult to predict phenotypes of complex traits in diverse environments, because plant phenotypes are often influenced by genotype-environment interaction. A possible remedy is to integrate genomic prediction with crop/ecophysiological modelling, which enables us to predict plant phenotypes using environmental and management information. To this end, in the present study, we developed a novel method for integrating genomic prediction with phenological modelling of Asian rice (Oryza sativa, L.), allowing the heading date of untested genotypes in untested environments to be predicted. The method simultaneously infers the phenological model parameters and whole-genome marker effects on the parameters in a Bayesian framework. By cultivating backcross inbred lines of Koshihikari \u00d7 Kasalath in nine environments, we evaluated the potential of the proposed method in comparison with conventional genomic prediction, phenological modelling, and two-step methods that applied genomic prediction to phenological model parameters inferred from Nelder-Mead or Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. In predicting heading dates of untested lines in untested environments, the proposed and two-step methods tended to provide more accurate predictions than the conventional genomic prediction methods, particularly in environments where phenotypes from environments similar to the target environment were unavailable for training genomic prediction. The proposed method showed greater accuracy in prediction than the two-step methods in all cross-validation schemes tested, suggesting the potential of the integrated approach in the prediction of phenotypes of plants.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bayes Theorem", "Environment", "Genomics", "Genotype", "Markov Chains", "Models, Genetic", "Monte Carlo Method", "Oryza", "Phenotype", "Plant Breeding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Akio", "Last Name": "Onogi", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Maya", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Toshihiro", "Last Name": "Mochizuki", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8581, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Takeshi", "Last Name": "Hayashi", "Affiliation": "National Agriculture and Food Research Organization Agricultural Research Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8666, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "National Agriculture and Food Research Organization Agricultural Research Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8666, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Toshihiro", "Last Name": "Hasegawa", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8604, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroyoshi", "Last Name": "Iwata", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan. aiwata@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp."}], "Journal": "TAG.

Among the TRPC subfamily, TRPC3 and TRPC6 channels activated directly by diacylglycerol (DAG) play important roles in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, promoting neuronal development and survival. In various disease models, BDNF restores neurologic deficits, but its therapeutic potential is limited by its poor pharmacokinetic profile. Elucidation of a framework for designing small molecules, which elicit BDNF-like activity via TRPC3 and TRPC6, establishes a solid basis to overcome this limitation. We discovered, through library screening, a group of piperazine-derived compounds that activate DAG-activated TRPC3/TRPC6/TRPC7 channels. The compounds [4-(5-chloro-2-methylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl](3-fluorophenyl)methanone (PPZ1) and 2-[4-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-N-(2-ethoxyphenyl)acetamide (PPZ2) activated, in a dose-dependent manner, recombinant TRPC3/TRPC6/TRPC7 channels, but not other TRPCs, in human embryonic kidney cells. PPZ2 activated native TRPC6-like channels in smooth muscle cells isolated from rabbit portal vein. Also, PPZ2 evoked cation currents and Ca(2+) influx in rat cultured central neurons. Strikingly, both compounds induced BDNF-like neurite growth and neuroprotection, which were abolished by a knockdown or inhibition of TRPC3/TRPC6/TRPC7 in cultured neurons. Inhibitors of Ca(2+) signaling pathways, except calcineurin, impaired neurite outgrowth promotion induced by PPZ compounds. PPZ2 increased activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein. These findings suggest that Ca(2+) signaling mediated by activation of DAG-activated TRPC channels underlies neurotrophic effects of PPZ compounds. Thus, piperazine-derived activators of DAG-activated TRPC channels provide important insights for future development of a new class of synthetic neurotrophic drugs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium Signaling", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Piperazines", "Rabbits", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "TRPC Cation Channels"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seishiro", "Last Name": "Sawamura", "Affiliation": "Department of Synthetic Chemistry and Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering (S.S., Ma.H., Y.T., H.H., Mi.H., R.R., S.K., M.X.M., Y.M.), and Department of Technology and Ecology, Hall of Global Environmental Studies (S.K., Y.M.), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;

For irrigated rice, ponded water is an important temperature environment, but few open-field evaluations are available on the combined effects of temperature and [CO2 ], which limits our ability to predict future rice production. We conducted free-air CO2 enrichment and soil and water warming experiments, for three growing seasons to determine the yield and quality response to elevated [CO2 ] (+200\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mol(-1) , E-[CO2 ]) and soil and water temperatures (+2\u00a0\u00b0C, E-T). E-[CO2 ] significantly increased biomass and grain yield by approximately 14% averaged over 3\u00a0years, mainly because of increased panicle and spikelet density. E-T significantly increased biomass but had no significant effect on the grain yield. E-T decreased days from transplanting to heading by approximately 1%, but days to the maximum tiller number (MTN) stage were reduced by approximately 8%, which limited the panicle density and therefore sink capacity. On the other hand, E-[CO2 ] increased days to the MTN stage by approximately 4%, leading to a greater number of tillers. Grain appearance quality was decreased by both treatments, but E-[CO2 ] showed a much larger effect than did E-T. The significant decrease in undamaged grains (UDG) by E-[CO2 ] was mainly the result of an increased percentage of white-base grains (WBSG), which were negatively correlated with grain protein content. A significant decrease in grain protein content by E-[CO2 ] accounted in part for the increased WBSG. The dependence of WBSG on grain protein content, however, was different among years; the slope and intercept of the relationship were positively correlated with a heat dose above 26\u00a0\u00b0C. Year-to-year variation in the response of grain appearance quality demonstrated that E-[CO2 ] and rising air temperatures synergistically reduce grain appearance quality of rice.", "Keywords": ["Oryza sativa", "chalky grain", "free-air CO2 enrichment", "grain quality", "heat dose", "protein content", "soil and water warming"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomass", "Carbon Dioxide", "Hot Temperature", "Japan", "Oryza", "Seasons", "Water", "Weather"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yasuhiro", "Last Name": "Usui", "Affiliation": "Agro-Meteorology Division, National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8604, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hidemitsu", "Last Name": "Sakai", "Affiliation": "Agro-Meteorology Division, National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8604, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Takeshi", "Last Name": "Tokida", "Affiliation": "Agro-Meteorology Division, National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, 3-1-3 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8604, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hirofumi", "Last Name": "Nakamura", "Affiliation": "Taiyo Keiki Co.

We sought to determine if esophageal Cdx2 expression would accelerate the onset of metaplasia in the L2-IL-1\u03b2 transgenic mouse model for Barrett's-like metaplasia. The K14-Cdx2::L2-IL-1\u03b2 double transgenic mice had half as many metaplastic nodules as control L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. This effect was not due to a reduction in esophageal IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels nor diminished systemic inflammation. The diminished metaplasia was due to an increase in apoptosis in the K14-Cdx2::L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. Fluorescence activated cell sorting of immune cells infiltrating the metaplasia identified a population of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells that are significantly reduced in K14-Cdx2::L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. These cells have features of immature granulocytes and have immune-suppressing capacity.

The half maximal inhibitory concentration of 5-FU showed that TE-5R cells were 15.6-fold more resistant to 5-FU in comparison with parental TE-5 cells. TE-5R cells showed regional copy number amplification of chromosome 1p including the DPYD gene, as well as high mRNA and protein expressions of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), an enzyme involved in 5-FU degradation. 5-FU treatment resulted in a significant decrease of the intracellular 5-FU concentration and increase of the concentration of \u03b1-fluoro-ureidopropionic acid (FUPA), a metabolite of 5-FU, in TE-5R compared with TE-5 cells in vitro. Conversely, gimeracil, a DPD inhibitor, markedly increased the intracellular 5-FU concentration, decreased the intracellular FUPA concentration, and attenuated 5-FU resistance of TE-5R cells. These results indicate that 5-FU resistance of TE-5R cells is due to the rapid degradation of 5-FU by DPD overexpression.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a key enzyme that eliminates acetaldehyde, and impairment of ALDH2 increases the risk of ESCC. ALDH2 is produced in various tissues including the liver, heart, and kidney, but the generation and functional roles of ALDH2 in the oesophagus remain elusive. Here, we report that ethanol drinking increased ALDH2 production in the oesophagus of wild-type mice. Notably, levels of acetaldehyde-derived DNA damage represented by N(2)-ethylidene-2'-deoxyguanosine were higher in the oesophagus of Aldh2-knockout mice than in wild-type mice upon ethanol consumption. In vitro experiments revealed that acetaldehyde induced ALDH2 production in both mouse and human oesophageal keratinocytes.

We hypothesized that autophagy may be induced by acid reflux, which causes injury, and inflammation, and therefore, contributes to the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Currently, the role of autophagy in BE and EAC is poorly studied. We quantitatively define autophagy levels in human BE cell lines, a transgenic mouse model of BE, and human BE, and EAC biopsies. Human non-dysplastic BE had the highest basal number of autophagic vesicles (AVs), while AVs were reduced in normal squamous cells and dysplastic BE cells, and nearly absent in EAC. To demonstrate a functional role for autophagy in BE pathogenesis, normal squamous (STR), non-dysplastic BE (CPA), dysplastic BE (CPD), and EAC (OE19) cell lines were exposed to an acid pulse (pH\u20093.5) followed by incubation in the presence or absence of chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. Acid exposure increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in STR and CPA cells. Chloroquine alone had a small impact on intracellular ROS or cell survival. However, combination of chloroquine with the acid pulse resulted in a significant increase in ROS levels at 6\u2009h in STR and CPA cells, and increased cell death in all cell lines. These findings establish increased numbers of AVs in human BE compared to normal squamous or EAC, and suggest that autophagy functions to improve cell survival after acid reflux injury. Autophagy may thus play a critical role in BE pathogenesis and progression. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "Keywords": ["Barrett's esophagus", "autophagy", "chloroquine", "esophageal adenocarcinoma", "oxidative stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Acids", "Adenocarcinoma", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Barrett Esophagus", "Cell Line", "Cell Survival", "Chloroquine", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Mice", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianping", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Kelly A", "Last Name": "Whelan", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Dorottya", "Last Name": "Laczk\u00f3", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Brendan", "Last Name": "Dang", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Angeliz", "Last Name": "Caro Monroig", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Soroush", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Falcone", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Ravi K", "Last Name": "Amaravadi", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Gregory G", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Falk", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. lynchj@mail.med.upenn.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular carcinogenesis", "PubDate": "2016Nov"}, {"PMID": "26301262", "Title": "The role of the autonomic ganglia in atrial fibrillation.", "Abstract": "Recent experimental and clinical studies have shown that the epicardial autonomic ganglia play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). In this review, we present the current data on the role of the autonomic ganglia in the pathogenesis of AF and discuss potential therapeutic implications. Experimental studies have demonstrated that acute autonomic remodeling may play a crucial role in AF maintenance in the very early stages. The benefit of adding ablation of the autonomic ganglia to the standard pulmonary vein (PV) isolation procedure for patients with paroxysmal AF is supported by both experimental and clinical data. The interruption of axons from these hyperactive autonomic ganglia to the PV myocardial sleeves may be an important factor in the success of PV isolation procedures. The vagus nerve exerts an inhibitory control over the autonomic ganglia and attenuation or loss of this control may allow these ganglia to become hyperactive. Autonomic neuromodulation using low-level vagus nerve stimulation inhibits the activity of the autonomic ganglia and reverses acute electrical atrial remodeling during rapid atrial pacing and may provide an alternative non-ablative approach for the treatment of AF, especially in the early stages. This notion is supported by a preliminary human study.

Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) regulates many factors involved in cell cycle, migration, inflammation, angiogenesis and stemness and has cancer-promoting effects in some cancers. While some reports have indicated that KLF5 may have important roles in regulation of CSCs, what role, if any, KLF5 plays in regulation of CSCs in HCC remains to be elucidated. Flow cytometric analysis of CD44 and CD133 in HCC cell lines revealed subpopulations of CD44(High)/CD133(High) and CD44(Low)/CD133(Low) cells. We subsequently sorted these subpopulations and identified KLF5 as a gene that is significantly upregulated in CD44(High)/CD44(High) cells via RNA sequencing using next generation sequencing technology. Moreover, KLF5 overexpression enriched the CD44(High)/CD133(High) subpopulation and, consistent with the up-regulation of CD44(High)/CD133(High) cells, KLF5 overexpressing cells were more resistant to anti-cancer drugs and displayed enhanced colony-formation capacity. By contrast, knock-down of KLF5 by siRNA diminished the CD44(High)/CD133(High) subpopulation. When KLF5 was acetylated by TGF-\u03b21, the KLF5-mediated CD44(High)/CD133(High) subpopulation enrichment was abrogated. Oppositely, ectopic expression of an acetylation-deficient KLF5 mutant further increased CD44(High)/CD133(High) subpopulations as compared to cell expressing wild-type KLF5.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that all cell lines (SDP11, UE7T-13 MG-63 and HuO9) were positive for both SDF1 and CXCR4 mRNA expression. Moreover, immunocytochemical analysis indicated that SDF1 and CXCR4 proteins were expressed in the SDP11 and UE7T-13 cells. SDF1 was also detected in the cell lysates (CLs) and conditioned medium (CM) collected from the SDP11 and UE7T-13 cells, and AMD3100, a specific antagonist of CXCR4, inhibited the migration of the UE7T-13 cells; this migration was induced by treatment with CM, which was collected from the SDP11 cells. In addition, real-time PCR showed that the expression of SDF1 in the SDP11 cells was inhibited by treatment with 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, and exposure to AZD4547, an inhibitor of the FGF receptor, blocked this inhibition.

A novel therapy targeting these cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is needed to improve prognosis of ESCC. CSCs of ESCC have a mesenchymal phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical to enrich and maintain CSCs. EGFR, frequently overexpressed in ESCC, has pivotal roles in EMT induced by TGF-\u03b2 in invasive fronts. Thus, EMT in invasive fronts of ESCC might be important for CSCs and EGFR could be a target of a novel therapy eliminating CSCs. However, effects of EGFR inhibitors on CSCs in ESCC have not been fully examined. EGFR inhibitors, erlotinib and cetuximab, significantly suppressed enrichment of CSCs via TGF-\u03b21-mediated EMT. Importantly, EGFR inhibitors sharply suppressed ZEB1 that is essential for EMT in ESCC. Further, EGFR inhibitors activated Notch1 and Notch3, leading to squamous cell differentiation. EGFR inhibition may suppress expression of ZEB1 and induce differentiation, thereby blocking EMT-mediated enrichment of CSCs. In organotypic 3D culture, a form of human tissue engineering, tumor cells in invasive nests showed high expression of CD44. Erlotinib significantly blocked invasion into the matrix and CD44 high expressing CSCs were markedly suppressed by erlotinib in organotypic 3D culture. In conclusion, EMT is a critical process for generation of CSCs and the invasive front of ESCC, where EMT occurs, might form a CSC niche in ESCC.

We have performed laser capture microdissection with RNA microarray analysis on the invasive and non-invasive tumor cells of p53(R175H)-overexpressing OTC samples to determine candidate genes facilitating tumor invasion. WNT10A was found to be >4-fold upregulated in the invasive front. Since WNT10A is also prominently upregulated during placode promotion in hair follicle development, a process that requires epithelial cells to thicken and elongate, in order to allow downward growth, we hypothesized that WNT10A may be important in mediating a similar mechanism of tumor cell invasion in ESCC. We have found that WNT10A expression is significantly upregulated in human ESCC, when compared with normal adjacent tissue. Furthermore, high WNT10A expression levels correlate with poor survival. Interestingly, we observe that WNT10A is expressed early in embryogenesis, but is reduced dramatically postnatally. We demonstrate that overexpression of WNT10a promotes migration and invasion, and proliferation of transformed esophageal cells. Lastly, we show that WNT10A overexpression induces a greater CD44(High)/CD24(Low) population, which are putative markers of cancer stem cells, and increases self-renewal capability. Taken together, we propose that WNT10A acts as an oncofetal factor that is highly expressed and may promote proper development of the esophagus.

self-renewal and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells, especially in tissues that are constantly replenished like the esophagus. Disruption of this balance is associated with pathological conditions, including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), in which basal progenitor cells become hyperplastic upon proinflammatory stimulation. However, how basal cells respond to the inflammatory environment at the molecular level remains undetermined. We previously reported that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is critical for epithelial morphogenesis in the embryonic esophagus. Here, we address how this pathway regulates tissue homeostasis and EoE development in the adult esophagus. BMP signaling was specifically activated in differentiated squamous epithelium, but not in basal progenitor cells, which express the BMP antagonist follistatin. Previous reports indicate that increased BMP activity promotes Barrett's intestinal differentiation; however, in mice, basal progenitor cell-specific expression of constitutively active BMP promoted squamous differentiation. Moreover, BMP activation increased intracellular ROS levels, initiating an NRF2-mediated oxidative response during basal progenitor cell differentiation. In both a mouse EoE model and human biopsies, reduced squamous differentiation was associated with high levels of follistatin and disrupted BMP/NRF2 pathways. We therefore propose a model in which normal squamous differentiation of basal progenitor cells is mediated by BMP-driven NRF2 activation and basal cell hyperplasia is promoted by disruption of BMP signaling in EoE.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I", "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Eosinophilic Esophagitis", "Epithelial Cells", "Esophagus", "Follistatin", "Genes, Reporter", "Humans", "Hyperplasia", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Morphogenesis", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Oxidative Stress", "Protein Precursors", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wei-Yao", "Last Name": "Ku", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhongren", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Evan S", "Last Name": "Dellon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Falk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mei-Lun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kuancan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Katzka", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey H", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaopeng", "Last Name": "Lan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}, {"PMID": "25744003", "Title": "Low-level transcutaneous electrical vagus nerve stimulation suppresses atrial\u00a0fibrillation.", "Abstract": "Transcutaneous low-level tragus electrical stimulation (LLTS) suppresses atrial fibrillation (AF) in canines.", "Keywords": ["atrial fibrillation", "autonomic nervous system", "inflammation", "neuromodulation"], "MeSH terms": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "C-Reactive Protein", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Vagus Nerve Stimulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stavros", "Last Name": "Stavrakis", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Mary Beth", "Last Name": "Humphrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin J", "Last Name": "Scherlag", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Yanqing", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Warren M", "Last Name": "Jackman", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Lockwood", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Ralph", "Last Name": "Lazzara", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Sunny S", "Last Name": "Po", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

We previously showed that the induction of apoptosis by ER-stress was related to the presence or absence of CHOP expression; nevertheless, how ATF4 expression is elicited without downstream CHOP expression is unknown. We studied the role of GADD34 on the induction of autophagy and/or apoptosis by NaF- or tunicamycin-induced ER-stress in HepG2 cells transfected with GADD34 siRNA. Although NaF and tunicamycin both induced PERK activation followed by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and ATF4 expression, CHOP expression was only induced by tunicamycin. Concomitant with the signaling change, autophagy was activated both by NaF and tunicamycin, and apoptosis was induced only by tunicamycin. After 4\u2009h, GADD34 mRNA expression was also increased by NaF and tunicamycin. Suppression of GADD34 by GADD34 siRNA increased ATF4 expression in both NaF- and tunicamycin-treated cells. The GADD34 siRNA increased CHOP expression, which corresponded to increased ATF4 in tunicamycin-treated cells; however, the increased ATF4 did not induce CHOP expression in NaF-treated cells. In concert with signal changes, siRNA treatment additively increased the autophagic activity of both NaF- and tunicamycin-treated cells; however, apoptosis was produced and accelerated only for tunicamycin-treated cells. These findings indicate that GADD34 expression induced by ER-stress delays CHOP expression and retards apoptotic cell death, and that an ATF4-signal-modulating machine other than GADD34 acts on ATF4-to-CHOP signaling to block ATF4-induced CHOP expression in ER-stress related autophagy.", "Keywords": ["APOPTOSIS", "AUTOPHAGY", "CHOP EXPRESSION", "ER-STRESS", "GADD34", "PERK PATHWAY"], "MeSH terms": ["Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Autophagy", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Protein Phosphatase 1", "Signal Transduction", "Sodium Fluoride", "Transcription Factor CHOP", "Tunicamycin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Noboru", "Last Name": "Iwasaki", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Course of Veterinary Bioscience, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-58 Rinku-Orai-Kita, Izumisano, 598-8531, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yoshiki", "Last Name": "Sugiyama", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Course of Veterinary Bioscience, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-58 Rinku-Orai-Kita, Izumisano, 598-8531, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Shuichi", "Last Name": "Miyazaki", "Affiliation": "The Center for Advanced Research, Graduate School of Medical Science, Toho University of Medicine, Ota-ku Omori-Nishi, 5-21-16, Tokyo, 143-8540, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Course of Veterinary Bioscience, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-58 Rinku-Orai-Kita, Izumisano, 598-8531, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kazuhiko", "Last Name": "Nishimura", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Course of Veterinary Bioscience, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-58 Rinku-Orai-Kita, Izumisano, 598-8531, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Saburo", "Last Name": "Matsuo", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Course of Veterinary Bioscience, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-58 Rinku-Orai-Kita, Izumisano, 598-8531, Japan."}], "Journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "PubDate": "2015Jul"}, {"PMID": "25723478", "Title": "Altered esophageal histamine receptor expression in Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE): implications on disease pathogenesis.", "Abstract": "Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic disorder, whose pathobiology is incompletely understood. Histamine-producing cells including mast cells and basophils have been implicated in EoE. However, very little is currently known about the role of histamine and histamine receptor (HR) expression and signaling in the esophageal epithelium. Herein, we characterized HR (H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R) expression in human esophageal biopsies and investigate the role of histamine signaling in inducible cytokine expression in human esophageal epithelial cells in vitro. HR expression was quantified in esophageal biopsies from non-EoE control (N = 23), inactive EoE (<15 eos/hpf, N = 26) and active EoE (>15 eos/hpf, N = 22) subjects using qRT-PCR and immunofluorescent localization. HR expression and histamine-mediated cytokine secretion were evaluated in human primary and telomerase-immortalized esophageal epithelial cells. H1R, H2R, and H4R expression were increased in active EoE biopsies compared to inactive EoE and controls. H2R was the most abundantly expressed receptor, and H3R expression was negligible in all 3 cohorts. Infiltrating eosinophils expressed H1R, H2R, and H4R, which contributed to the observed increase in HR in active subjects. H1R and H2R, but not H3R or H4R, were constitutively expressed by primary and immortalized cells, and epithelial histamine stimulation induced GM-CSF, TNF\u03b1, and IL-8, but not TSLP or eotaxin-3 secretion. Epithelial priming with the TLR3 ligand poly (I:C) induced H1R and H2R expression, and enhanced histamine-induced GM-CSF, TNF\u03b1, and IL-8 secretion. These effects were primarily suppressed by H1R antagonists, but unaffected by H2R antagonism. Histamine directly activates esophageal epithelial cytokine secretion in vitro in an H1R dependent fashion. However, H1R, H2R and H4R are induced in active inflammation in EoE in vivo.

Bivalves such as clams and oysters are the major seafood varieties associated with the infections. In this study, the prevalence of strains possessing the tdh and trh genes was investigated in Japan in 74 samples collected in 2007-2008 and in 177 samples collected in 2010 of domestic bivalves, bloody clams, hen clams, short-neck clams, and rock oysters.

BE is known as a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Currently, the cell of origin for human BE has yet to be clearly identified. Therefore, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the initiation of BE metaplasia. Affymetrix gene expression microarray revealed that BE samples express decreased levels of Notch receptors (NOTCH2 and NOTCH3) and one of the the ligands (JAG1). Furthermore, BE tissue microarray showed decreased expression of NOTCH1 and its downstream target HES1. Therefore, Notch signaling was inhibited in human esophageal epithelial cells by expression of dominant-negative-Mastermind-like (dnMAML), in concert with MYC and CDX1 overexpression. Cell transdifferentiation was then assessed by 3D organotypic culture and evaluation of BE-lineage specific gene expression. Notch inhibition promoted transdifferentiation of esophageal epithelial cells toward columnar-like cells as demonstrated by increased expression of columnar keratins (K8, K18, K19, K20) and glandular mucins (MUC2, MUC3B, MUC5B, MUC17) and decreased expression of squamous keratins (K5, K13, K14). In 3D culture, elongated cells were observed in the basal layer of the epithelium with Notch inhibition. Furthermore, we observed increased expression of KLF4, a potential driver of the changes observed by Notch inhibition. Interestingly, knockdown of KLF4 reversed the effects of Notch inhibition on BE-like metaplasia. Overall, Notch signaling inhibition promotes transdifferentiation of esophageal cells toward BE-like metaplasia in part via upregulation of KLF4.

We also examined whether a use of an ensemble of crop models can reduce the uncertainties. Individual models did not consistently reproduce both experimental and regional yields well, and uncertainty was larger at the warmest and coolest sites. The variation in yield projections was larger among crop models than variation resulting from 16 global climate model-based scenarios. However, the mean of predictions of all crop models reproduced experimental data, with an uncertainty of less than 10% of measured yields. Using an ensemble of eight models calibrated only for phenology or five models calibrated in detail resulted in the uncertainty equivalent to that of the measured yield in well-controlled agronomic field experiments.

The present research proposes new efficient spectral dividing and wavenumber selection methods to significantly reduce the computational load required by conventional wavenumber selection methods such as interval partial least squares (iPLS). The proposed method, named spectral fluctuation dividing (SFD), divides a whole spectrum into multiple spectral intervals at local minimum points of the spectral fluctuation profile, which consists of the standard deviation of absorbance at each wavenumber in a calibration set. SFD is combined with PLS (SFD-PLS) to select the spectral intervals at which input variables have significant influence on a target response. The usefulness of SFD-PLS was demonstrated through its application to the problems of estimating water and drug content in granules. PLS models based on SFD-PLS achieved higher estimation accuracy than those based on conventional methods including iPLS, PLS-beta, and variable influence on projection (VIP). In addition, SFD-PLS was more than 10 times faster than the conventional variable selection methods including PLS-beta and VIP; in particular, SFD-PLS was more than 25 times faster than iPLS.

Recently, ablation catheters using two technologies have been developed to measure real-time catheter-tissue CF. One catheter uses three optical fibers to measure microdeformation of a deformable body in the catheter tip. The other catheter uses a small spring connecting the ablation tip electrode to the catheter shaft with a magnetic transmitter and sensors to measure microdeflection of the spring. Pre-clinical experimental studies have shown that 1) at constant RF power and application time, RF lesion size significantly increases with increasing CF; 2) the incidence of steam pop and thrombus also increase with increasing CF; 3) modulating RF power based on CF (i.e, high RF power at low CF and lower RF power at high CF) results in a similar and predictable RF lesion size. In clinical studies in patients undergoing pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, CF during mapping in the left atrium and PVs showed a wide range of CF and transient high CF. The most common high CF site was located at the anterior/rightward left atrial roof, directly beneath the ascending aorta. There was a poor relationship between CF and previously used surrogate parameters for CF (unipolar or bipolar atrial potential amplitude and impedance). Patients who underwent PV isolation with an average CF of <10 g experienced higher AF recurrence, whereas patients with ablation using an average CF of > 20g had lower AF recurrence. AF recurred within 12 months in 6 of 8 patients (75%) who had a mean Force-Time Integral (FTI, area under the curve for contact force vs. time) < 500 gs. In contrast, AF recurred in only 4 of 13 patients (21%) with ablation using a mean FTI >1000 gs. In another study, controlling RF power based on CF prevented steam pop and impedance rise without loss of lesion effectiveness. These studies confirm that CF is a major determinant of RF lesion size and future systems combining CF, RF power and application time may provide real-time assessment of lesion formation.", "Keywords": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Catheter Ablation", "Contact Force", "Electrophysiology", "Mapping", "Radiofrequency"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute and Department of Medicine University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Warren M", "Last Name": "Jackman", "Affiliation": "Heart Rhythm Institute and Department of Medicine University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}], "Journal": "Journal of atrial fibrillation", "PubDate": "2014Jun-Jul"}, {"PMID": "24962609", "Title": "The effect of hemin-induced oxidative stress on erythropoietin production in HepG2 cells.", "Abstract": "Erythropoietin (EPO) and iron are both indispensable hematopoietic factors and are often studied in humans and rodents. Iron activates prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and promotes the degradation of the \u03b1-subunit of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which regulates EPO production. Iron also causes oxidative stress. Oxidative stress leads to alterations in the levels of multiple factors that regulate HIF and EPO production. It is thought that iron influences EPO production by altering two pathways, namely PHDs activity and oxidative stress. We studied the differential effect of varying concentrations of hemin, an iron-containing porphyrin, on EPO production in HepG2 cells. Hemin at 100\u2009\u00b5M reduced EPO mRNA expression. The hemin-induced reduction of EPO mRNA levels was attenuated at concentrations greater than 200\u2009\u00b5M and EPO production increased in the presence of 500\u2009\u00b5M hemin. In comparison, protoporphyrin IX, iron-free hemin did not influence EPO mRNA expression. Additionally, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity significantly increased with 300\u2009\u00b5M hemin. Importantly, the antioxidant tempol inhibited the hemin-induced (500\u2009\u00b5M) increase in EPO mRNA levels. In conclusion, these results suggest that restraint of EPO production by hemin was offset by the promotion of EPO production by hemin-induced oxidative stress at hemin concentrations greater than 300\u2009\u00b5M.", "Keywords": ["erythropoietin production", "iron", "oxidative stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Antioxidants", "Cyclic N-Oxides", "Erythropoietin", "Hemin", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1", "Malondialdehyde", "Oxidative Stress", "RNA, Messenger", "Spin Labels", "Superoxide Dismutase", "Up-Regulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kazuhiko", "Last Name": "Nishimura", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioenvironmental Sciences, Course of Veterinary Science, Graduate School of Life Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-58 Rinku Ohrai-Kita, Izumisano, Osaka, 598-8531, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Masahiro", "Last Name": "Tokida", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hideaki", "Last Name": "Katsuyama", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saburo", "Last Name": "Matsuo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cell biology international", "PubDate": "2014Nov"}, {"PMID": "24920972", "Title": "Heat-tolerant rice cultivars retain grain appearance quality under free-air CO2 enrichment.", "Abstract": "Heat-tolerant rice cultivars have been developed as a countermeasure to poor grain appearance quality under high temperatures.

IGFBP3 has been linked to the pathogenesis of cancers. Most previous studies focus upon proapoptotic tumor suppressor activities of IGFBP3. Nevertheless, IGFBP3 is overexpressed in certain cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), one of the most aggressive forms of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The tumor-promoting activities of IGFBP3 remain poorly understood in part due to a lack of understanding as to how the tumor microenvironment may influence IGFBP3 expression and how IGFBP3 may in turn influence heterogeneous intratumoral cell populations. Here, we show that IGFBP3 overexpression is associated with poor postsurgical prognosis in ESCC patients. In xenograft transplantation models with genetically engineered ESCC cells, IGFBP3 contributes to tumor progression with a concurrent induction of a subset of tumor cells showing high expression of CD44 (CD44H), a major cell surface receptor for hyaluronic acid, implicated in invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. Our gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments reveal that IGFBP3 mediates the induction of intratumoral CD44H cells. IGFBP3 cooperates with hypoxia to mediate the induction of CD44H cells by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an insulin-like growth factor-independent fashion. Thus, our study sheds light on the growth stimulatory functions of IGFPB3 in cancer, gaining a novel mechanistic insight into the functional interplay between the tumor microenvironment and IGFBP3.", "Keywords": ["CD44", "IGFBP3 and reactive oxygen species", "esophageal", "hypoxia", "squamous cell carcinoma"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mitsuteru", "Last Name": "Natsuizaka", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA, USA ;

In the present study, we examined the possibility of interaction between human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1 and four guanidine alkaloids isolated from P. nitens (i.e., galegine, nitensidine A, pterogynidine, and pterogynine) using human T cell lymphoblast-like leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM and its multi-drug resistant (MDR) counterpart CEM/ADR5000. In XTT assays, CEM/ADR5000 cells were resistant to the four guanidine alkaloids compared to CCRF-CEM cells, although the four guanidine alkaloids exhibited some level of cytotoxicity against both CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cells. In ATPase assays, three of the four guanidine alkaloids were found to stimulate the ATPase activity of ABCB1. Notably, nitensidine A was clearly found to stimulate the ATPase activity of ABCB1 as strongly as the control drug, verapamil.

Moreover, the TRPV1-expressing neurons have been suggested to be the main sensors and mediators of itching. 2) Histaminergic TRPV1-negative pathway: The scratching behavior caused by itching was not different between capsaicin-pre-treated and vehicle-treated (control) mast cell-rich NC mice. This result suggests the existence of a capsaicin-insensitive (TRPV1-negative) histaminergic pathway. 3) Non-histaminergic PAR-2 pathway: Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) has been shown to play a role in the itching of atopic dermatitis (AD). The itch evoked by cowhage (a non-histaminergic pruritogen that activates PAR-2) is very similar in characteristics to the itch evoked by conditions such as AD. 4) Non-histaminergic serotonin (5-HT) pathway: 5-HT alone applied to the human skin evokes an itching sensation and has been suggested to be involved in the itching associated with pruritic diseases, such as polycythemia vera and cholestasis.", "Keywords": ["PAR-2", "TRPV1", "histamine", "itch", "serotonin"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Dentistry for Persons with Disability, Tokushima University Hospital, 3-18-15 Kuramoto cho, Tokushima 770, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Akio", "Last Name": "Hiura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "23939378", "Title": "EGFR inhibition promotes an aggressive invasion pattern mediated by mesenchymal-like tumor cells within squamous cell carcinomas.", "Abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) with an infiltrative invasion pattern carry a higher risk of treatment failure. Such infiltrative invasion may be mediated by a mesenchymal-like subpopulation of malignant cells that we have previously shown to arise from epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and resist epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting. Here, we show that SCCs with infiltrative, high-risk invasion patterns contain abundant mesenchymal-like cells, which are rare in tumors with low-risk patterns. This cellular heterogeneity was modeled accurately in three-dimensional culture using collagen-embedded SCC spheroids, which revealed distinct invasive fronts created by collective migration of E-cadherin-positive cells versus infiltrative migration of individual mesenchymal-like cells. Because EGFR expression by mesenchymal-like cells was diminished in the spheroid model and in human SCCs, we hypothesized that SCCs shift toward infiltrative invasion mediated by this subpopulation during anti-EGFR therapy. Anti-EGFR treatment of spheroids using erlotinib or cetuximab enhanced infiltrative invasion by targeting collective migration by E-cadherin-positive cells while sparing mesenchymal-like cells; by contrast, spheroid invasion in absence of mesenchymal-like cells was abrogated by erlotinib. Similarly, cetuximab treatment of xenografts containing mesenchymal-like cells created an infiltrative invasive front composed of this subpopulation, whereas no such shift was observed upon treating xenografts lacking these cells. These results implicate mesenchymal-like SCC cells as key mediators of the infiltrative invasion seen in tumors with locally aggressive behavior.

In response to oxidative stress, NF-E2-related transcription factor (Nrf2) encoded by the NFE2L2 gene plays a key role in transcriptional upregulation of many target genes, including those for metabolizing enzymes and transporters essential for cellular defense. Recent studies have provided evidence that Nrf2 regulates the transcription of the human ABC transporter ABCG2 gene, which is critically involved in the cellular accumulation of porphyrins in PDT. Nrf2 interacts with the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) located in the promoter region of human ABCG2 gene. Nrf2-specific siRNA treatments suppressed the induction of ABCG2 expression after the photoactivation of porphyrins in vitro. One SNP (-617C>A; rs6721961) in the ARE-like loci of the human Nrf2 gene is considered to affect the positive feedback loop of transcriptional activation of the Nrf2 gene as well as its target genes including ABCG2. Since patients have demonstrated individual differences in their response to PDT, Nrf2-mediated transcriptional activation of the ABCG2 gene in cancer may affect patients' responses to PDT as well as chemotherapy.", "Keywords": ["ABC transporters", "Nrf2", "aminolevulinic acid (ALA)", "cancer", "gefitinib", "mRNA", "metabolism", "oxidative stress", "porphyrin", "single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)"], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Animals", "Humans", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neoplasms", "Photochemotherapy", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Porphyrins", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Transcriptional Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Toshihisa", "Last Name": "Ishikawa", "Affiliation": "RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan. toshihisa.ishikawa.r@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "Yoshinaga", "Last Name": "Kajimoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yutaka", "Last Name": "Inoue", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yoji", "Last Name": "Ikegami", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shin-Ichi", "Last Name": "Miyatake", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Toshihiko", "Last Name": "Kuroiwa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23541754", "Title": "The necessity of multimodality workup in cervical spine injury.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["CT", "Cervical spine clearance", "Computed tomography", "Ligamentous instability", "MRI", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Spine trauma", "Unevaluable patient"], "MeSH terms": ["Cervical Vertebrae", "Humans", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "Kushiro Kojinkai Memorial Hospital Spine Center, Kushiro City, Japan.

Conditional overexpression of Sox2 in basal cells expands the progenitor population in both the esophagus and forestomach. Significantly, carcinoma only develops in the forestomach, where pathological progression correlates with inflammation and nuclear localization of Stat3 in progenitor cells. Importantly, co-overexpression of Sox2 and activated Stat3 (Stat3C) also transforms esophageal basal cells but not the differentiated suprabasal cells.

The lubrication properties of Mg-St are defined by its concentration distribution and flatting state in a mixture.

Thus, the absorbance area in this region after baseline correction was selected as a monitoring index (MI). In laboratory-scale experiments, the difference of Mg-St concentration distribution could be detected by the proposed MI with high sensitivity. In addition, experimental results using spherical mannitol granules confirmed that the changes of the flatting state of Mg-St could also be detected by the proposed MI. Similar experiments with spherical mannitol granules and the thermal effusivity sensor confirmed that effusivity could also be used to detect the changes of the flatting state of Mg-St. The applicability of these monitoring techniques was verified using a 2000 L commercial-scale blender equipped with the NIR spectrometer and the thermal effusivity sensor.
