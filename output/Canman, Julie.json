Because insulin resistance and diabetes are both associated with obesity, which also affects fertility, the role of insulin signaling itself in embryo development is not well understood. A key downstream target of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway is the forkhead family transcription factor FoxO (DAF-16 in C. elegans ). Here, we used quantitative live imaging to measure the patterning of endogenously tagged FoxO/DAF-16 in the early worm embryo. In 2-4-cell stage embryos, FoxO/DAF-16 initially localized uniformly to all cell nuclei, then became dramatically enriched in germ precursor cell nuclei beginning at the 8-cell stage. This nuclear enrichment in early germ precursor cells required germ fate specification, PI3K (AGE-1)- and PTEN (DAF-18)-mediated phospholipid regulation, and the deubiquitylase USP7 (MATH-33), yet was unexpectedly insulin receptor (DAF-2)- and AKT-independent. Functional analysis revealed that FoxO/DAF-16 acts as a cell cycle pacer for early cleavage divisions-without FoxO/DAF-16 cell cycles were shorter than in controls, especially in germ lineage cells. These results reveal the germ lineage specific patterning, upstream regulation, and cell cycle role for FoxO/DAF-16 during early C. elegans embryogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Mauro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sophia L", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mimi", "Last Name": "Shirasu-Hiza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May14"}, {"PMID": "38696255", "Title": "Germ fate determinants protect germ precursor cell division by reducing septin and anillin levels at the cell division plane.", "Abstract": "Animal cell cytokinesis, or the physical division of one cell into two, is thought to be driven by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring at the division plane.

Because sleep defects and ASD are linked to metabolic dysregulation, we tested the starvation response of neuronal Cul3 knockdown flies; they starved faster and had lower triacylglyceride levels than controls, suggesting defects in metabolic homeostasis. ASD is also characterized by increased biomarkers of oxidative stress; we found that neuronal Cul3 knockdown increased sensitivity to hyperoxia, an exogenous oxidative stress.

Here, we investigated the genetic loss of a similar enzyme in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Because the enzyme Ebony modifies and inactivates amine neurotransmitters, its loss is assumed to increase neurotransmitter levels, increasing behaviors such as aggression and courtship and decreasing sleep. Indeed, ebony mutants have been described since 1960 as \"aggressive mutants,\" though this behavior has not been quantified. Using automated machine learning-based analyses, we quantitatively confirmed that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggressive behaviors such as boxing\u00a0but also decreased courtship behaviors and increased sleep. Through tissue-specific knockdown, we found that ebony's role in these behaviors was specific to glia. Unexpectedly, direct measurement of amine neurotransmitters in ebony brains revealed that their levels were not increased but reduced. Thus, increased aggression is the anomalous behavior for this neurotransmitter profile. We further found that ebony mutants exhibited increased aggression only when fighting each other, not when fighting wild-type controls. Moreover, fights between ebony mutants were less likely to end with a clear winner than fights between controls or fights between ebony mutants and controls. In ebony vs. control fights, ebony mutants were more likely to win.

CLS-2 targeting is mediated by the CENP-F-like HCP-1/2, but their roles in cytokinesis and midbody assembly are not known. We found that although HCP-1 and HCP-2 mostly function cooperatively, HCP-1 plays a more primary role in promoting CLS-2-dependent central spindle microtubule assembly. HCP-1/2 codisrupted embryos did not form central spindles but completed cytokinesis and formed functional midbodies capable of supporting abscission. These central spindle-independent midbodies appeared to form via contractile ring constriction-driven bundling of astral microtubules at the furrow tip. This work suggests that, in the absence of a central spindle, astral microtubules can support midbody assembly and that midbody assembly is more predictive of successful cytokinesis than central spindle assembly.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Microtubules", "Spindle Apparatus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sophia M", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Frances", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Mimi", "Last Name": "Shirasu-Hiza", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Universit\u00e9 de Paris, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "The Journal of cell biology", "PubDate": "2022Mar07"}, {"PMID": "34588695", "Title": "Circadian autophagy drives iTRF-mediated longevity.", "Abstract": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has recently gained interest as a potential anti-ageing treatment for organisms from\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0to humans1-5.

Rho, activated by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor ECT-2, is upstream of both myosin-II activation and diaphanous formin-mediated filamentous actin (f-actin) assembly, which drive ring constriction. The role for Rac and its regulators is more controversial, but, based on the finding that Rac inactivation can rescue cytokinesis failure when the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) CYK-4 is disrupted, Rac activity was proposed to be inhibitory to contractile ring constriction and thus specifically inactivated by CYK-4 at the division plane. An alternative model proposes that Rac inactivation generally rescues cytokinesis failure by reducing cortical tension, thus making it easier for the cell to divide when ring constriction is compromised. In this alternative model, CYK-4 was instead proposed to activate Rho by binding ECT-2. Using a combination of time-lapse in vivo single-cell analysis and Caenorhabditis elegans genetics, our evidence does not support this alternative model. First, we found that Rac disruption does not generally rescue cytokinesis failure: inhibition of Rac specifically rescues cytokinesis failure due to disruption of CYK-4 or ECT-2 but does not rescue cytokinesis failure due to disruption of two other contractile ring components, the Rho effectors diaphanous formin and myosin-II. Second, if CYK-4 regulates cytokinesis through Rho rather than Rac, then CYK-4 inhibition should decrease levels of downstream targets of Rho. Inconsistent with this, we found no change in the levels of f-actin or myosin-II at the division plane when CYK-4 GAP activity was reduced, suggesting that CYK-4 is not upstream of ECT-2/Rho activation. Instead, we found that the rescue of cytokinesis in CYK-4 mutants by Rac inactivation was Cdc42 dependent.

For example, many fields of biology are developing the use of NIR for optogenetics, in which an NIR laser induces a change in gene expression and/or protein function. One major technical barrier in working with both NIR and visible light on an optical microscope is obtaining their precise coalignment at the imaging plane position. Photon upconverting particles (UCPs) can bridge this gap as they are excited by NIR light but emit in the visible range via an anti-Stokes luminescence mechanism. Here, two different UCPs have been identified, high-efficiency micro540-UCPs and lower efficiency nano545-UCPs, that respond to NIR light and emit visible light with high photostability even at very high NIR power densities (>25\u202f000 Suns). Both of these UCPs can be rapidly and reversibly excited by visible and NIR light and emit light at visible wavelengths detectable with standard emission settings used for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a commonly used genetically encoded fluorophore. However, the high efficiency micro540-UCPs were suboptimal for NIR and visible light coalignment, due to their larger size and spatial broadening from particle-to-particle energy transfer consistent with a long-lived excited state and saturated power dependence. In contrast, the lower efficiency nano-UCPs were superior for precise coalignment of the NIR beam with the visible light path (\u223c2 \u03bcm versus \u223c8 \u03bcm beam broadening, respectively) consistent with limited particle-to-particle energy transfer, superlinear power dependence for emission, and much smaller particle size. Furthermore, the nano-UCPs were superior to a traditional two-camera method for NIR and visible light path alignment in an in vivo Infrared-Laser-Evoked Gene Operator (IR-LEGO) optogenetics assay in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In summary, nano-UCPs are powerful new tools for coaligning NIR and visible light paths on a light microscope.", "Keywords": ["IR-LEGO", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "budding yeast", "infrared laser", "laser alignment", "light-path coalignment", "microscope", "optogenetics", "upconverter", "upconverting particle", "visible light"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sriramkumar", "Last Name": "Sundaramoorthy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University , New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adrian", "Last Name": "Garcia Badaracco", "Affiliation": "Section of Chemical and Materials Science, University of California, San Diego , La Jolla, California 92093, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sophia M", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University , New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jun Hong", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Section of Chemical and Materials Science, University of California, San Diego , La Jolla, California 92093, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Davies", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University , New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot , Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, F-75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Mimi", "Last Name": "Shirasu-Hiza", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University , New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew C", "Last Name": "Kummel", "Affiliation": "Section of Chemical and Materials Science, University of California, San Diego , La Jolla, California 92093, United States."}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University , New York, New York 10032, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2017Mar08"}, {"PMID": "27916531", "Title": "Dietary Restriction Extends the Lifespan of Circadian Mutants tim and per.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["aging", "circadian rhythm", "clock", "dietary restriction", "lifespan", "longevity", "metabolism", "pdf", "period", "timeless"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Circadian Rhythm", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Nuclear Proteins", "Period Circadian Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matt", "Last Name": "Ulgherait", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10025, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miles K", "Last Name": "Oliva", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10025, USA."}, {"First Name": "Han X", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "William W", "Last Name": "Ja", "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolism and Aging, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL 33458, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mimi", "Last Name": "Shirasu-Hiza", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Here, we show that in asymmetrically dividing Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the cortical PAR proteins (including the small guanosine triphosphatase CDC-42) have an active role in regulating recruitment of a critical component of the contractile ring, filamentous actin (F-actin). We found that the cortical PAR proteins are required for the retention of anillin and septin in the anterior pole, which are cytokinesis proteins that our genetic data suggest act as inhibitors of F-actin at the contractile ring. Collectively, our results suggest that the cortical PAR proteins coordinate the establishment of cell polarity with the physical process of cytokinesis during asymmetric cell division to ensure the fidelity of daughter cell formation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Polarity", "Cytokinesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shawn N", "Last Name": "Jordan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Davies", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Yelena", "Last Name": "Zhuravlev", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032 Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unites Mixtes de Recherche 7592, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, 75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Mimi", "Last Name": "Shirasu-Hiza", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032 jcc2210@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of cell biology", "PubDate": "2016Jan04"}, {"PMID": "26123112", "Title": "Kinetochore components are required for central spindle assembly.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gilliane", "Last Name": "Maton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frances", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Lacroix", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marine", "Last Name": "Stefanutti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kimberley", "Last Name": "Laband", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Lieury", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taekyung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Espeut", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature cell biology", "PubDate": "2015Jul"}, {"PMID": "25866924", "Title": "Kinetochore components are required for central spindle assembly.", "Abstract": "A critical structure poised to coordinate chromosome segregation with division plane specification is the central spindle that forms between separating chromosomes after anaphase onset. The central spindle acts as a signalling centre that concentrates proteins essential for division plane specification and contractile ring constriction. However, the molecular mechanisms that control the initial stages of central spindle assembly remain elusive. Using Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, we found that the microtubule-bundling protein SPD-1(PRC1) and the motor ZEN-4(MKLP-1) are required for proper central spindle structure during its elongation. In contrast, we found that the kinetochore controls the initiation of central spindle assembly. Specifically, central spindle microtubule assembly is dependent on kinetochore recruitment of the scaffold protein KNL-1, as well as downstream partners BUB-1, HCP-1/2(CENP-F) and CLS-2(CLASP); and is negatively regulated by kinetochore-associated protein phosphatase 1 activity. This in turn promotes central spindle localization of CLS-2(CLASP) and initial central spindle microtubule assembly through its microtubule polymerase activity. Together, our results reveal an unexpected role for a conserved kinetochore protein network in coupling two critical events of cell division: chromosome segregation and cytokinesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Division", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "Chromosome Segregation", "Cytokinesis", "Kinesins", "Kinetochores", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Microscopy, Video", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "RNA Interference", "Signal Transduction", "Spindle Apparatus", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gilliane", "Last Name": "Maton", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 F-75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Frances", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 F-75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Lacroix", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 F-75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Marine", "Last Name": "Stefanutti", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 F-75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Kimberley", "Last Name": "Laband", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 F-75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Lieury", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 F-75205 Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Taekyung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research/Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Espeut", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Montpellier, CRBM, CNRS UMR 5237, 34293 Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Julie C", "Last Name": "Canman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, New York, New York 10033, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julien", "Last Name": "Dumont", "Affiliation": "Institut Jacques Monod, CNRS, UMR 7592, University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 F-75205 Paris, France."}], "Journal": "Nature cell biology", "PubDate": "2015May"}, {"PMID": "25073157", "Title": "High-resolution temporal analysis reveals a functional timeline for the molecular regulation of cytokinesis.", "Abstract": "To take full advantage of fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutations, thermal control must be extremely rapid. We developed the Therminator, a device capable of shifting sample temperature in ~17 s while simultaneously imaging cell division in vivo. Applying this technology to six key regulators of cytokinesis, we found that each has a distinct temporal requirement in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. Specifically, myosin-II is required throughout cytokinesis until contractile ring closure. In contrast, formin-mediated actin nucleation is only required during assembly and early contractile ring constriction. Centralspindlin is required to maintain division after ring closure, although its GAP activity is only required until just prior to closure. Finally, the chromosomal passenger complex is required for cytokinesis only early in mitosis, but not during metaphase or cytokinesis.
