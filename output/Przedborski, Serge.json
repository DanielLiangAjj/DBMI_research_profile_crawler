[{"PMID": "38948777", "Title": "The Role of Alpha-Synuclein in Synucleinopathy: Impact on Lipid Regulation at Mitochondria-ER Membranes.", "Abstract": "The protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy, which includes Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and mounting evidence suggests that lipid dyshomeostasis is a critical phenotype in these neurodegenerative conditions. Previously, we identified that \u03b1Syn localizes to mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), temporary functional domains containing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, including the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we have analyzed the lipid composition of postmortem human samples, focusing on the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease and controls, as well as three less affected brain regions of Parkinson's donors. To further assess synucleinopathy-related lipidome alterations, similar analyses were performed on the striatum of multiple system atrophy cases. Our data show region-and disease-specific changes in the levels of lipid species. Specifically, our data revealed alterations in the levels of specific phosphatidylserine species in brain areas most affected in Parkinson's disease. Some of these alterations, albeit to a lesser degree, are also observed multiples system atrophy. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we show that \u03b1Syn contributes to regulating phosphatidylserine metabolism at MAM domains, and that \u03b1Syn dosage parallels the perturbation in phosphatidylserine levels. Our results support the notion that \u03b1Syn pathophysiology is linked to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which may contribute to the vulnerability of specific brain regions in synucleinopathy. These findings have significant therapeutic implications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Barbuti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Guardia-Laguarta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taekyung", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zena K", "Last Name": "Chatila", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xena", "Last Name": "Flowers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bruno Fr", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simone B", "Last Name": "Larsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nobutaka", "Last Name": "Hattori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ulf", "Last Name": "Dettmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saranna", "Last Name": "Fanning", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manon", "Last Name": "Vilas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hasini", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rejko", "Last Name": "Kr\u00fcger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Estela", "Last Name": "Area-Gomez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Przedborski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun17"}, {"PMID": "38636436", "Title": "Improved synthesis and application of an alkyne-functionalized isoprenoid analogue to study the prenylomes of motor neurons, astrocytes and their stem cell progenitors.", "Abstract": "Protein prenylation is one example of a broad class of post-translational modifications where proteins are covalently linked to various hydrophobic moieties.

Post-transcriptional gene regulation can control RNA's fate, and defects in RNA processing are critical determinants of MN degeneration. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a post-transcriptional RNA modification that controls diverse aspects of RNA metabolism. To assess the m6A requirement in MNs, we depleted the m6A methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in cells and mice. METTL3 depletion in embryonic stem cell-derived MNs has profound and selective effects on survival and neurite outgrowth. Mice with cholinergic neuron-specific METTL3 depletion display a progressive decline in motor behavior, accompanied by MN loss and muscle denervation, culminating in paralysis and death. Reader proteins convey m6A effects, and their silencing phenocopies METTL3 depletion. Among the m6A targets, we identified transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and discovered that its expression is under epitranscriptomic control.

from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasingly investigated in search of biomarkers. However, the lipid profiles in genetic PD remain to be determined, a gap of knowledge of particular interest in PD associated with mutant \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA), given the known relationship between this protein and lipids. The objective of this research is to identify serum lipid composition from SNCA A53T mutation carriers and to compare these alterations to those found in cells and transgenic mice carrying the same genetic mutation. We conducted an unbiased lipidomic analysis of 530 lipid species from 34 lipid classes in serum of 30 participants with SNCA mutation with and without PD and 30 healthy controls. The primary analysis was done between 22 PD patients with SNCA+ (SNCA+/PD+) and 30 controls using machine-learning algorithms and traditional statistics. We also analyzed the lipid composition of human clonal-cell lines and tissue from transgenic mice overexpressing the same SNCA mutation. We identified specific lipid classes that best discriminate between SNCA+/PD+ patients and healthy controls and found certain lipid species, mainly from the glycerophosphatidylcholine and triradylglycerol classes, that are most contributory to this discrimination. Most of these alterations were also present in human derived cells and transgenic mice carrying the same mutation. Our combination of lipidomic and machine learning analyses revealed alterations in glycerophosphatidylcholine and triradylglycerol in sera from PD patients as well as cells and tissues expressing mutant \u03b1-Syn.

SMN deficiency causes the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMN interacts with itself and other proteins to form a complex that functions in the assembly of ribonucleoproteins. SMN is modified by SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier), but whether sumoylation is required for the functions of SMN that are relevant to SMA pathogenesis is not known. Here, we show that inactivation of a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) alters SMN sub-cellular distribution, the integrity of its complex, and its function in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins biogenesis. Expression of a SIM-inactivated mutant of SMN in a mouse model of SMA slightly extends survival rate with limited and transient correction of motor deficits. Remarkably, although SIM-inactivated SMN attenuates motor neuron loss and improves neuromuscular junction synapses, it fails to prevent the loss of sensory-motor synapses.

Here, we show that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are selectively permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vitro and upon transplantation in vivo, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a DA neuron inflammatory and cellular senescence response. A high-throughput screen in hPSC-derived DA neurons identified several FDA approved drugs, including riluzole, metformin, and imatinib, that can rescue the cellular senescence phenotype and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RNA-seq analysis of human ventral midbrain tissue from COVID-19 patients, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded autopsy samples, confirmed the induction of an inflammatory and cellular senescence signature and identified low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Our findings demonstrate that hPSC-derived DA neurons can serve as a disease model to study neuronal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and to identify candidate neuroprotective drugs for COVID-19 patients.

These cells have been developed primarily to replace dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra that are progressively lost in the disease process. The aim is to largely restore lost motor functions, whilst not ever being curative. We discuss cell-based strategies that will have to fulfill important criteria to become effective and competitive therapies for PD. These criteria include reproducibly producing sufficient numbers of cells with an authentic substantia nigra dopamine neuron A9 phenotype, which can integrate into the host brain after transplantation and form synapses (considered crucial for long-term functional benefits). Furthermore, it is essential that transplanted cells exhibit no, or only very low levels of, proliferation without tumor formation at the site of grafting. Cumulative research has shown that stem cell-based approaches continue to have great potential in PD, but key questions remain to be answered.

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the international community, very little is known about its impact on the health and day-to-day activities of people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). To better understand the emotional and behavioral consequences of the public health policies implemented to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in PwPD, and to explore the factors contributing to accessing alternative health care mechanisms, such as telehealth, we administered an anonymous knowledge, attitude, and practice survey to PwPD and care partners, via the mailing lists of the Parkinson's Foundation and Columbia University Parkinson's Disease Center of Excellence with an average response rate of 19.3%. Sufficient information was provided by 1,342 PwPD to be included in the final analysis. Approximately half of respondents reported a negative change in PD symptoms, with 45-66% reporting mood disturbances. Telehealth use increased from 9.7% prior to the pandemic to 63.5% during the pandemic. Higher income and higher education were associated with telehealth use. Services were more often used for doctor's appointment than physical, occupational, speech, or mental health therapies. Almost half (46%) of PwPD preferred to continue using telehealth always or sometimes after the coronavirus outbreak had ended. Having received support/instruction for telehealth and having a care partner, friend, or family member to help them with the telehealth visit increased the likelihood of continuous use of telehealth after the pandemic ended. Taken together, PD symptoms and management practices were markedly affected by COVID-19. Given the observed demographic limitations of telehealth, expanding its implementation to include additional physical, occupational, psychological, and speech therapies, increasing support for telehealth, as well as reaching underserved (low income) populations is urgently required.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Megan P", "Last Name": "Feeney", "Affiliation": "Parkinson's Foundation, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaqian", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Surface", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiral", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nora", "Last Name": "Vanegas-Arroyave", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Parkinson's Disease Center and Movement Disorder Clinic, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda K", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Delaney", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Przedborski", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, Pathology & Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James C", "Last Name": "Beck", "Affiliation": "Parkinson's Foundation, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roy N", "Last Name": "Alcalay", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. rna2104@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "NPJ Parkinson's disease", "PubDate": "2021Jan21"}, {"PMID": "33149111", "Title": "Systematic elucidation of neuron-astrocyte interaction in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using multi-modal integrated bioinformatics workflow.", "Abstract": "Cell-to-cell communications are critical determinants of pathophysiological phenotypes, but methodologies for their systematic elucidation are lacking. Herein, we propose an approach for the Systematic Elucidation and Assessment of Regulatory Cell-to-cell Interaction Networks (SEARCHIN) to identify\u00a0ligand-mediated interactions between distinct cellular compartments. To test this approach, we selected a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which astrocytes expressing mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (mutSOD1) kill wild-type motor neurons (MNs) by an unknown mechanism. Our\u00a0integrative analysis that combines proteomics and regulatory network analysis infers the interaction between astrocyte-released amyloid precursor protein (APP) and death receptor-6 (DR6) on MNs as the top predicted ligand-receptor pair. The inferred deleterious role of APP and DR6 is confirmed in vitro in models of ALS. Moreover, the DR6 knockdown in MNs of transgenic mutSOD1 mice attenuates the ALS-like phenotype. Our results support the usefulness of integrative, systems biology approach to gain insights into complex neurobiological disease processes as in ALS and posit that the proposed methodology is not restricted to this biological context and could be used in a variety of other non-cell-autonomous communication mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor",

directly to the brain, allowing for a more homogenous distribution in targeted locations compared to IN delivery alone. However, whether such a strategy has therapeutic values, especially in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be established. Herein, we evaluated whether the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine catalysis, could be enhanced by IN\u2009+\u2009FUS delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a toxin-based PD mouse model. Mice were put on the subacute dosing regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), producing bilateral degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway consistent with early-stage PD. MPTP mice then received BDNF intranasally followed by multiple unilateral FUS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) openings in the left basal ganglia for three consecutive weeks. Subsequently, mice were survived for two months and were evaluated morphologically and behaviorally to determine the integrity of their nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Mice receiving IN\u2009+\u2009FUS had significantly increased TH immunoreactivity in the treated hemisphere compared to the untreated hemisphere while mice receiving only FUS-induced BBB opening or no treatment at all did not show any differences. Additionally, behavioral changes were only observed in the IN\u2009+\u2009FUS treated mice, indicating improved motor control function in the treated hemisphere.

Using both human female and monkey cell lines, we now demonstrate that once generated within the mitochondria, 52 kDa PINK1 adopts a mitochondrial topology most consistent with it being at the mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interface. From this particular submitochondrial location, PINK1 interacts with components of the ER-associated degradation pathway, such as the E3 ligases gp78 and HRD1, which cooperate to catalyze PINK1 ubiquitination.

Supporting this view, investigations in both in vitro and in vivo models of ALS have implicated key molecular determinants of necroptosis in the death of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Consistent with a pathogenic role of necroptosis in ALS, we showed increased mRNA levels for the three main necroptosis effectors Ripk1, Ripk3, and Mlkl in the spinal cord of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1G93A) transgenic mice (Tg), an established model of ALS. In addition, protein levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1; but not of RIPK3, MLKL or activated MLKL) were elevated in spinal cord extracts from these Tg SOD1G93A mice. In postmortem motor cortex samples from sporadic and familial ALS patients, no change in protein levels of RIPK1 were detected. Silencing of Ripk3 in cultured MNs protected them from toxicity associated with SOD1G93A astrocytes. However, constitutive deletion of Ripk3 in Tg SOD1G93A mice failed to provide behavioral or neuropathological improvement, demonstrating no similar benefit of Ripk3 silencing in vivo. Lastly, we detected no genotype-specific myelin decompaction, proposed to be a proxy of necroptosis in ALS, in either Tg SOD1G93A or Optineurin knock-out mice, another ALS mouse model.

A key to elucidating these processes may lie within the subset of DA neurons that corelease glutamate and express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. Here, we addressed the potential relationship between VGLUT expression and DA neuronal vulnerability by overexpressing VGLUT in DA neurons of flies and mice. In Drosophila, VGLUT overexpression led to loss of select DA neuron populations. Similarly, expression of VGLUT2 specifically in murine SNc DA neurons led to neuronal loss and Parkinsonian behaviors. Other neuronal cell types showed no such sensitivity, suggesting that DA neurons are distinctively vulnerable to VGLUT2 expression. Additionally, most DA neurons expressed VGLUT2 during development, and coexpression of VGLUT2 with DA markers increased following injury in the adult. Finally, conditional deletion of VGLUT2 made DA neurons more susceptible to Parkinsonian neurotoxins. These data suggest that the balance of VGLUT2 expression is a crucial determinant of DA neuron survival.

Necdin strongly stabilizes PGC-1\u03b1 by inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Forced expression of necdin enhances mitochondrial function in primary cortical neurons and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to prevent mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor-induced degeneration. Moreover, overexpression of necdin in the substantia nigra in vivo of adult mice protects dopaminergic neurons against degeneration in experimental Parkinson's disease.

To further explore how endolysosomal dysfunction causes PD-related neurodegeneration, we generated a murine model of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), characterized by early-onset Parkinsonism with additional neurological features. KRS is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in the ATP13A2 gene encoding the endolysosomal ATPase ATP13A2.

We report here that wild-type \u03b1-syn from cell lines, and brain tissue from humans and mice, is present not in mitochondria but rather in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a structurally and functionally distinct subdomain of the ER. Remarkably, we found that pathogenic point mutations in human \u03b1-syn result in its reduced association with MAM, coincident with a lower degree of apposition of ER with mitochondria, a decrease in MAM function, and an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation compared with wild-type. Although overexpression of wild-type \u03b1-syn in mutant \u03b1-syn-expressing cells reverted the fragmentation phenotype, neither overexpression of the mitochondrial fusion/MAM-tethering protein MFN2 nor inhibition/ablation of the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 was able to do so, implying that \u03b1-syn operates downstream of the mitochondrial fusion/fission machinery. These novel results indicate that wild-type \u03b1-syn localizes to the MAM and modulates mitochondrial morphology, and that these behaviors are impaired by pathogenic mutations in \u03b1-syn.

Phenotypically, there is marked heterogeneity. Typical ALS has mixed upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement. Primary lateral sclerosis has predominant UMN involvement. Progressive muscular atrophy has predominant LMN involvement. Bulbar and limb ALS have predominant regional involvement. Frontotemporal dementia has significant cognitive and behavioral involvement. These phenotypes can be so distinctive that they would seem to have differing biology. However, they cannot be distinguished, at least neuropathologically or genetically. In sporadic ALS (SALS), they are mostly characterized by ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions of TDP-43. In familial ALS (FALS), where phenotypes are indistinguishable from SALS and similarly heterogeneous, each mutated gene has its own genetic and molecular signature. Overall, since the same phenotypes can have multiple causes including different gene mutations, there must be multiple molecular mechanisms causing ALS - and ALS is a syndrome. Since, however, multiple phenotypes can be caused by one single gene mutation, a single molecular mechanism can cause heterogeneity. What the mechanisms are remain unknown, but active propagation of the pathology neuroanatomically seems to be a principal component. Leading candidate mechanisms include RNA processing, cell-cell interactions between neurons and non-neuronal neighbors, focal seeding from a misfolded protein that has prion-like propagation, and fatal errors introduced during neurodevelopment of the motor system. If fundamental mechanisms could be identified and understood, ALS therapy could rationally target progression and stop the disease - a goal that seems increasingly achievable.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Disease Progression", "Extremities", "Humans", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Ravits", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA. jravits@ucsd.edu"}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Appel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Baloh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Barohn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benjamin Rix", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Elman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary Kay", "Last Name": "Floeter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Henderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Lomen-Hoerth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey D", "Last Name": "Macklis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leo", "Last Name": "McCluskey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Mitsumoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Przedborski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Rothstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John Q", "Last Name": "Trojanowski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leonard H", "Last Name": "van den Berg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Ringel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23473310", "Title": "When Schwann cells conspire with mitochondria, neighboring axons are under attack by glia-derived neurotoxic lipids.", "Abstract": "In this issue of Neuron, Viader et\u00a0al.

As for the proposed non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, they involve prion-like behavior of misfolded proteins and neuroinflammation.

Although most occurrences have an unknown cause, several gene mutations have been linked to familial forms of PD. The discovery of some of the proteins encoded by these genes, including Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1, at the mitochondria offered a new perspective on the involvement of mitochondria in PD. Specifically, these proteins are thought to be involved in the maintenance of a healthy pool of mitochondria by regulating their turnover by mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy. In this review, we discuss recent studies on the role of mitophagy in PD. We present three putative models whereby PINK1 and Parkin may affect mitophagy; 1) by shifting the balance between fusion and fission of the mitochondrial network, 2) by modulating mitochondrial motility and 3) by directly recruiting the autophagic machinery to damaged mitochondria.
