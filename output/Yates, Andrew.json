The quality and persistence of circulating CD4 + effector memory (T EM ) and central memory (T CM ) T cells in mice appear to shift with age, but it is unclear whether these changes are driven by the aging host environment, by cell age effects, or both. Here we address these issues by combining DNA labelling methods, established fate-mapping systems, a novel reporter mouse strain, and mathematical models. Together, these allow us to quantify the dynamics of both young and established circulating memory CD4 + T cell subsets, within both young and old mice. We show that that these cells and their descendents become more persistent the longer they reside within the T CM and T EM pools. This behaviour may limit memory CD4 T cell diversity by skewing TCR repertoires towards clones generated early in life, but may also compensate for functional defects in new memory cells generated in old age.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "M Elise", "Last Name": "Bullock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thea", "Last Name": "Hogan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cayman", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sinead", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Nowicka", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Minahil", "Last Name": "Sharjeel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christiaan", "Last Name": "van Dorp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benedict", "Last Name": "Seddon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun25"}, {"PMID": "38749003", "Title": "What is the optimum post treatment surveillance imaging protocol for low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritoneii?", "Abstract": "Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms are rare and can be associated with the development of disseminated peritoneal disease known as pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP).

Objectives: We sought to determine whether postarrest hypoxemia or postarrest hyperoxemia is associated with lower rates of survival to hospital discharge, compared with postarrest normoxemia, and whether postarrest hypocapnia or hypercapnia is associated with lower rates of survival, compared with postarrest normocapnia. Methods: An embedded prospective observational study during a multicenter interventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation trial was conducted from 2016 to 2021. Patients \u2a7d18\u2009years old and with a corrected gestational age of \u226537\u2009weeks who received chest compressions for cardiac arrest in one of the 18 intensive care units were included. Exposures during the first 24\u2009hours postarrest were hypoxemia, hyperoxemia, or normoxemia-defined as lowest arterial oxygen tension/pressure (PaO2) <60\u2009mm\u2009Hg, highest PaO2 \u2a7e200\u2009mm\u2009Hg, or every PaO2 60-199\u2009mm\u2009Hg, respectively-and hypocapnia, hypercapnia, or normocapnia, defined as lowest arterial carbon dioxide tension/pressure (PaCO2) <30\u2009mm\u2009Hg, highest PaCO2 \u2a7e50\u2009mm\u2009Hg, or every PaCO2 30-49\u2009mm\u2009Hg, respectively.

Here, we demonstrate that most B cells receive a basal Notch signal, which is intensified in pre-MZB and MZB cells. Ablation or constitutive activation of Notch2 upon T-cell-dependent immunization reveals an interplay between antigen-induced activation and Notch2 signaling, in which FoB cells that turn off Notch2 signaling enter germinal centers (GC), while high Notch2 signaling leads to generation of MZB cells or to initiation of plasmablast differentiation. Notch2 signaling is dispensable for GC dynamics but appears to be re-induced in some centrocytes to govern expansion of IgG1+ GCB cells. Mathematical modelling suggests that antigen-activated FoB cells make a Notch2 dependent binary fate-decision to differentiate into either GCB or MZB cells.

ART26.12 is a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) 5 inhibitor with antinociceptive properties, characterised here for the prevention and treatment of OIPN. ART26.12 binds selectively to FABP5 compared to FABP3, FABP4, and FABP7, with minimal off-target liabilities, high oral bioavailability, and a NOAEL of 1,000\u00a0mg/kg/day in rats and dogs. In an established preclinical OIPN model, acute oral dosing (25-100\u00a0mg/kg) showed a cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1)-dependent anti-allodynic effect lasting up to 8\u00a0hours (persisting longer than plasma exposure to ART26.12). Antagonists of cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) may have also been implicated. Twice daily oral dosing (25\u00a0mg/kg bis in die (BID) for 7 days) showed anti-allodynic effects in an established OIPN model without the development of tolerance. In a prevention paradigm, coadministration of ART26.12 (10 and 25\u00a0mg/kg BID for 15 days) with oxaliplatin prevented thermal hyperalgesia, mitigated mechanical allodynia, and attenuated OXA-induced weight loss. Multi-scale analyses revealed widespread lipid modulation, particularly among N-acyl amino acids in the spinal cord, including potential analgesic mediators. Additionally, ART26.12 administration led to upregulation of ion channels in the periaqueductal grey, and broad translational upregulation within the plasma proteome. These results show promise that ART26.12 is a safe and well-tolerated candidate for the treatment and prevention of OIPN through lipid modulation. PERSPECTIVE: Inhibition of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) is a novel target for reducing pain associated with chemotherapy. ART26.12 is a safe and well-tolerated small molecule FABP5 inhibitor effective at preventing and reducing pain induced with oxaliplatin through lipid modulation and activation of cannabinoid receptors.", "Keywords": ["Cannabinoid", "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy", "Fatty acid bind protein", "Lipid", "Pain"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Oxaliplatin", "Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins", "Rats", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "Male", "Hyperalgesia", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Dogs", "Analgesics", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Organoplatinum Compounds", "Humans", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Warren", "Affiliation": "Artelo Biosciences Limited, UK."}, {"First Name": "Myles", "Last Name": "Osborn", "Affiliation": "Artelo Biosciences Limited, UK."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Tsantoulas", "Affiliation": "Transpharmation Ltd., London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ana", "Last Name": "David-Pereira", "Affiliation": "Transpharmation Ltd., London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Cohn", "Affiliation": "Transpharmation Ltd., London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Duffy", "Affiliation": "Apconix Ltd., UK."}, {"First Name": "Linette", "Last Name": "Ruston", "Affiliation": "Seda Pharma Development Services Ltd., UK."}, {"First Name": "Clare", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Bloomington, Indiana."}, {"First Name": "Heather", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Bloomington, Indiana."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Kaczocha", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Stony Brook University, New York; Institute of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Stony Brook University, New York."}, {"First Name": "Iwao", "Last Name": "Ojima", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University, New York; Institute of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Stony Brook University, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Artelo Biosciences Limited, UK."}, {"First Name": "Saoirse E", "Last Name": "O'Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Artelo Biosciences Limited, UK."}], "Journal": "The journal of pain", "PubDate": "2024Jul"}, {"PMID": "38088765", "Title": "Early Cardiac Arrest Hemodynamics, End-Tidal C o2 , and Outcome in Pediatric Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation: Secondary Analysis of the ICU-RESUScitation Project Dataset (2016-2021).", "Abstract": "Cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during active extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a method to rescue patients refractory to standard resuscitation.

To date, there is no approved therapy for cachexia syndrome. The objective of this study was to establish an in vitro model of cancer cachexia in mature human skeletal muscle myotubes, with the intention of exploiting the cell model to assess potential cachexia therapeutics, specifically cannabinoid related drugs. Having cultured and differentiated primary human muscle myoblasts to mature myotubes, we successfully established two cancer cachexia models using conditioned media (CM) from human colon adenocarcinoma (SW480) and from non-small-cell lung carcinoma (H1299) cultured cells. The cancer-CM-induced extensive myotube degeneration, demonstrated by a significant reduction in mature myotube diameter, which progressed over the period studied. Myotube degeneration is a characteristic feature of cancer cachexia and was used in this study as an index of cachexia. Expression of cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors (CB1R and CB2R) was confirmed in the mature human skeletal muscle myotubes. Subsequently, the effect of cannabinoid compounds on this myotube degeneration were assessed. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a partial CB1R/CB2R agonist, and JWH133, a selective CB2R agonist, proved efficacious in protecting mature human myotubes from the deleterious effects of both (SW480 and H1299) cancer cachexia conditions. ART27.13, a full, peripherally selective CB1R/CB2R agonist, currently being trialled in cancer cachexia (IRAS ID 278450, REC 20/NE/0198), was also significantly protective against myotube degeneration in both (SW480 and H1299) cancer cachexia conditions. Furthermore, the addition of the CB2R antagonist AM630, but not the CB1R antagonist Rimonabant, abolished the protective effect of ART27.13. In short, we have established a convenient and robust in vitro model of cancer-induced human skeletal muscle cachexia. The data obtained using the model demonstrate the therapeutic potential of ART27.13 in cancer-induced cachexia prevention and provides evidence indicating that this effect is via CB2R, and not CB1R.", "Keywords": ["ART27.13", "CAReS", "CB1R", "CB2R", "cancer-induced cachexia", "cannabinoids", "myotube degeneration"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Noone", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry & Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, D02R590 Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Mary F", "Last Name": "Rooney", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry & Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, D02R590 Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Marilena", "Last Name": "Karavyraki", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry & Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, D02R590 Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Artelo Bioscience, Ltd., Alderly Edge, Cheshire SK10 4TG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Saoirse E", "Last Name": "O'Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Artelo Bioscience, Ltd., Alderly Edge, Cheshire SK10 4TG, UK."}, {"First Name": "Richard K", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry & Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, D02R590 Dublin, Ireland."}], "Journal": "Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2023Nov08"}, {"PMID": "37953337", "Title": "Ensembl 2024.", "Abstract": "Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org) is a freely available genomic resource that has produced high-quality annotations, tools, and services for vertebrates and model organisms for more than two decades. In recent years, there has been a dramatic shift in the genomic landscape, with a large increase in the number and phylogenetic breadth of high-quality reference genomes, alongside major advances in the pan-genome representations of higher species. In order to support these efforts and accelerate downstream research, Ensembl continues to focus on scaling for the rapid annotation of new genome assemblies, developing new methods for comparative analysis, and expanding the depth and quality of our genome annotations. This year we have continued our expansion to support global biodiversity research, doubling the number of annotated genomes we support on our Rapid Release site to over 1700, driven by our close collaboration with biodiversity projects such as Darwin Tree of Life. We have also strengthened support for key agricultural species, including the first regulatory builds for farmed animals, and have updated key tools and resources that support the global scientific community, notably the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor.

When combined with mathematical models, the kinetic of label uptake and loss within a population of interest then allows one to estimate rates of cell production and turnover through death or onward differentiation. Here we explore an alternative method of quantifying cellular dynamics, using a cell fate-mapping mouse model in which dividing cells can be induced to constitutively express a fluorescent protein, using a Ki67 reporter construct. We use a pulse-chase approach with this reporter mouse system to measure the lifespans and division rates of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells using a variety of modeling approaches, and show that they are all consistent with estimates derived from other published methods. However we propose that to obtain unbiased parameter estimates and full measures of their uncertainty one should simultaneously model the timecourses of the frequencies of labeled cells within both the population of interest and its precursor.

Our results revealed that memory T\u00a0cells preferentially localized in the intestines and lungs during infancy and accumulated more rapidly in mucosal sites compared with blood and lymphoid organs, consistent with site-specific antigen exposure. Early life mucosal memory T\u00a0cells exhibit distinct functional capacities and stem-like transcriptional profiles. In later childhood, they progressively adopt proinflammatory functions and tissue-resident signatures, coincident with increased T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion in mucosal and lymphoid sites.

Short-term clinical performance has been reported for a multitude of patch types, but comparisons are limited by inconsistent study design and scarce histologic data. Standard clinical criteria for assessment of patch efficacy and criteria for intervention need to be applied across patch types. The field is progressing with improvements in outcomes due to newer patch technologies focused on reducing antigenicity and promoting neotissue formation which may have the ability to grow, remodel, and repair.", "Keywords": ["Arterioplasty", "Patch", "Pulmonary artery", "Right ventricular outflow tract"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Pulmonary Artery", "Ventricular Outflow Obstruction", "Heart Ventricles", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Vascular Surgical Procedures", "Treatment Outcome", "Tetralogy of Fallot"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William E", "Last Name": "Schwartzman", "Affiliation": "The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Jimenez", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Medicine, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "The Heart Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aimee K", "Last Name": "Armstrong", "Affiliation": "The Heart Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arash", "Last Name": "Salavitabar", "Affiliation": "The Heart Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kan K", "Last Name": "Hor", "Affiliation": "The Heart Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Hoerstrup", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Maximilian Y", "Last Name": "Emmert", "Affiliation": "Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Toshiharu", "Last Name": "Shinoka", "Affiliation": "The Heart Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergio A", "Last Name": "Carrillo", "Affiliation": "The Heart Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher K", "Last Name": "Breuer", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Medicine, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "The Heart Center, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA.

We demonstrate the use of the Genotype model and the constituent Haplotype model for the precise and interoperable representation of pharmacogenomic diplotypes, HGVS variants, and VCF records using VRS and discuss how this can be leveraged to enable interoperable exchange and search operations between assayed variation and genomic knowledgebases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Computational Biology", "Genetic Variation", "Databases, Genetic", "Genomics", "Genotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wesley", "Last Name": "Goar", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Babb", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Srikar", "Last Name": "Chamala", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Cline", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert R", "Last Name": "Freimuth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Reece K", "Last Name": "Hart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kori", "Last Name": "Kuzma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tristan", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Prli\u0107", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Riehle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anastasia", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "Stahl", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Heidi L", "Last Name": "Rehm", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alex H", "Last Name": "Wagner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

"Patients with single ventricle heart defects requires a series of staged open-heart procedures, termed Fontan palliation. However, while lifesaving, these operations are associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. The attendant complications are thought to arise in response to the abnormal hemodynamics induced by Fontan palliation, although the pathophysiology underlying these physicochemical changes in cardiovascular and other organs remain unknown. Here, we investigated the microRNA (miRNA) content in serum and serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) by sequencing small RNAs from a physiologically relevant sheep model of the Fontan operation. The differential expression analysis identified the enriched miRNA clusters in (1) serum vs. serum-derived EVs and (2) pre-Fontan EVs vs. post-Fontan EVs. Metascape analysis showed that the overexpressed subset of EV miRNAs by Fontan procedure target liver-specific cells, underscoring a potentially important pathway involved in the liver dysfunction that occurs as a consequence of Fontan palliation. We also found that post-Fontan EV miRNAs were associated with senescence and cell death, whereas pre-Fontan EV miRNAs were associated with stem cell maintenance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This study shows great potential to identify novel circulating EV biomarkers from Fontan sheep serum that may be used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics for patients that have undergone Fontan palliation.", "Keywords": ["Extracellular vesicle", "Fontan model", "Hemodynamics", "MiRNA", "RNA sequencing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hyun-Ji", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Wallace H.

During that time, our resources, services and tools have continually evolved in line with both the publicly available genome data and the downstream research and applications that utilise the Ensembl platform. In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic shift in the genomic landscape. There has been a large increase in the number of high-quality reference genomes through global biodiversity initiatives. In parallel, there have been major advances towards pangenome representations of higher species, where many alternative genome assemblies representing different breeds, cultivars, strains and haplotypes are now available. In order to support these efforts and accelerate downstream research, it is our goal at Ensembl to create high-quality annotations, tools and services for species across the tree of life. Here, we report our resources for popular reference genomes, the dramatic growth of our annotations (including haplotypes from the first human pangenome graphs), updates to the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), interactive protein structure predictions from AlphaFold DB, and the beta release of our new website.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Software", "Databases,

biomedical cloud platforms to microservices: next steps in FAIR data and analysis.", "Abstract": "The biomedical research community is investing heavily in biomedical cloud platforms. Cloud computing holds great promise for addressing challenges with big data and ensuring reproducibility in biology. However, despite their advantages, cloud platforms in and of themselves do not automatically support FAIRness. The global push to develop biomedical cloud platforms has led to new challenges, including platform lock-in, difficulty integrating across platforms, and duplicated effort for both users and developers. Here, we argue that these difficulties are systemic and emerge from incentives that encourage development effort on self-sufficient platforms and data repositories instead of interoperable microservices. We argue that many of these issues would be alleviated by prioritizing microservices and access to modular data in smaller chunks or summarized form. We propose that emphasizing modularity and interoperability would lead to a more powerful Unix-like ecosystem of web services for biomedical analysis and data retrieval. We challenge funders, developers, and researchers to support a vision to improve interoperability through microservices as the next generation of cloud-based bioinformatics.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nathan C", "Last Name": "Sheffield", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health Genomics, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, 22908, Charlottesville, VA, USA. nsheffield@virginia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Vivien R", "Last Name": "Bonazzi", "Affiliation": "Deloitte, 20201, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip E", "Last Name": "Bourne", "Affiliation": "School of Data Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville VA 22904, Charlottesville, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tony", "Last Name": "Burdett", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "School of Data Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville VA 22904, Charlottesville, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert L", "Last Name": "Grossman", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational Data Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60615, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ola", "Last Name": "Spjuth", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, 75124, Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SD, UK."}], "Journal": "Scientific data", "PubDate": "2022Sep08"}, {"PMID": "36053072", "Title": "The Temporal Association of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality and Outcomes.", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in adaptations to pediatric resuscitation systems of care.

HIV. Understanding the dynamics of HIV suppression and rebound in this age group is crucial to optimizing treatment strategies and increasing the likelihood of infants achieving and sustaining viral suppression. Here we studied data from a cohort of 122 perinatally-infected infants who initiated antiretroviral treatment (ART) early after birth and were followed for up to four years. These data included longitudinal measurements of viral load (VL) and CD4 T cell numbers, together with information regarding treatment adherence. We previously showed that the dynamics of HIV decline in 53 of these infants who suppressed VL within one year were similar to those in adults. However, in extending our analysis to all 122 infants, we find that a deterministic model of HIV infection in adults cannot explain the full diversity in infant trajectories. We therefore adapt this model to include imperfect ART adherence and natural CD4 T cell decline and reconstitution processes in infants. We find that individual variation in both processes must be included to obtain the best fits. We also find that infants with faster rates of CD4 reconstitution on ART were more likely to experience resurgences in VL. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of combining mathematical modeling with clinical data to disentangle the role of natural immune processes and viral dynamics during HIV infection.",

and CD8 T cells are cornerstones of adaptive immunity, but the dynamics of their establishment early in life and how their kinetics change as they mature following release from the thymus are poorly understood. Further, due to the diverse signals implicated in naive T cell survival, it has been a long-held and conceptually attractive view that they are sustained by active homeostatic control as thymic activity wanes. Here we use multiple modelling and experimental approaches to identify a unified model of naive CD4 and CD8 T cell population dynamics in mice, across their lifespan. We infer that both subsets divide rarely, and progressively increase their survival capacity with cell age. Strikingly, this simple model is able to describe naive CD4 T cell dynamics throughout life. In contrast, we find that newly generated naive CD8 T cells are lost more rapidly during the first 3-4 weeks of life, likely due to increased recruitment into memory. We find no evidence for elevated division rates in neonates, or for feedback regulation of naive T cell numbers at any age. We show how confronting mathematical models with diverse datasets can reveal a quantitative and remarkably simple picture of naive T cell dynamics in mice from birth into old age.", "Keywords": ["computational biology", "immunology", "inflammation", "mathematical modeling", "mouse", "naive T cells", "population dynamics", "systems biology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Homeostasis", "Immunologic Memory", "Longevity", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sanket", "Last Name": "Rane", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Thea", "Last Name": "Hogan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, United States."}, {"First Name": "Benedict", "Last Name": "Seddon", "Affiliation": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2022Jun09"}, {"PMID": "35582795", "Title": "Past and future uses of text mining in ecology and evolution.", "Abstract": "Ecology and evolutionary biology, like other scientific fields, are experiencing an exponential growth of academic manuscripts.

The increasing availability of digital text, computational resources, and machine-learning based language models have led to a revolution in text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. NLP has been widely adopted across the biomedical sciences but is rarely used in ecology and evolutionary biology. Applying computational tools from text mining and NLP will increase the efficiency of data synthesis, improve the reproducibility of literature reviews, formalize analyses of research biases and knowledge gaps, and promote data-driven discovery of patterns across ecology and evolutionary biology.

A peri-operative management protocol was implemented at our institution in March 2010. It includes 6\u00a0weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation post-operatively to mitigate the thrombotic risks in this patient population. This is a retrospective study of hospitalized children who received post-operative anticoagulation following a comprehensive stage 2 procedure for single ventricle cardiac physiology at a free-standing children's hospital. The primary objectives are to describe our institution's anticoagulation strategy and report on the number of thromboses and major bleeding episodes in the 6\u00a0weeks post-operatively. Secondary objectives include the dose of enoxaparin required to obtain a therapeutic low-molecular weight anti-factor-Xa (AFXaLMWH) level, and the number of patients outside of the therapeutic range. A total of 71 infants were included in the final analysis. Four patients experienced a thrombosis episode and three patients experienced clinically significant bleeding. The mean dose of enoxaparin required to obtain a therapeutic AFXaLMWH level between 0.5-1 unit/mL was 1.23\u00a0mg/kg SQ every 12\u00a0h and 37% of patients achieved goal AFXaLMWH levels with the initial starting dose of enoxaparin 1\u00a0mg/kg SQ every 12\u00a0h. We describe a 9-year experience of anticoagulation after single ventricle palliation. Anticoagulation with therapeutic AFXaLMWH goals of 0.5-1 unit/mL may reduce the rates of clinically significant thrombosis post-operatively in this population and appears safe without increase in significant bleeding episodes when compared to a historical cohort.

This paper provides estimates of marginal CO2 emissions from US electricity generation using the most recently available and comprehensive data. The estimates vary by region, hour of the day, and year to year over the last decade. We identify an important and somewhat counterintuitive finding: While average emissions have decreased substantially over the last decade (28% nationally), marginal emissions have increased (7% nationally). We show that underlying these trends is primarily a shift toward greater reliance on coal to satisfy marginal electricity use. We apply our estimates to an analysis of the Biden administration's target of having electric vehicles (EVs) make up 50% of new vehicle purchases by 2030. We find that, without significant and concurrent changes to the electricity sector, the increase in electricity emissions is likely to offset more than half of the emission reductions from having fewer gasoline-powered vehicles on the road. Moreover, using average rather than marginal emissions to predict the impacts significantly overestimates the emission benefits. Overall, we find that the promise of EVs for reducing emissions depends, to a large degree, on complementary policies that decarbonize both average and marginal emissions in the electricity sector.", "Keywords": ["climate policy", "electricity", "emissions"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Holland", "Affiliation": "Department of Economics, Bryan School of Business and Economics, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27402-6170."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Kotchen", "Affiliation": "National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138-5398; matthew.kotchen@yale.edu."}, {"First Name": "Erin T", "Last Name": "Mansur", "Affiliation": "National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA 02138-5398."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Economics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2022Feb22"}, {"PMID": "35072136", "Title": "GA4GH: International policies and standards for data sharing across genomic research and healthcare.", "Abstract": "The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) aims to accelerate biomedical advances by enabling the responsible sharing of clinical and genomic data through both harmonized data aggregation and federated approaches.

pathophysiology and an update on modern day imaging.", "Abstract": "With increasing subspecialised experience in radical cytoreductive surgery and intra-abdominal chemotherapy for peritoneal malignancy, outcomes have improved significantly in selected patients. The surgery and the treatment regimens are radical and therefore correct patient selection is critical. The radiologist plays a central role in this process by estimating, as precisely as possible, the pre-treatment disease burden. Because of the nature of the disease process, accurate staging is not an easy task. Tumour deposits may be very small and in locations where they are very difficult to detect. It must be acknowledged that no form of modern day imaging has the capability of detecting the smallest peritoneal nodules, which may only be visible to direct inspection or histopathological evaluation. Nonetheless, it behoves the radiologist to be as exact and precise as possible in the reporting of this disease process. This is both to select patients who are likely to benefit from radical treatment, and just as importantly, to identify patients who are unlikely to achieve adequate cytoreductive outcomes. In this review, we outline the patterns of spread of disease and the anatomic basis for this, as well as the essential aspects of reporting abdominal studies in this patient group. We provide an evidence-based update on the relative strengths and limitations of our available multimodality imaging techniques namely CT, MRI and positron emission tomography/CT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Peritoneal Neoplasms", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jack W", "Last Name": "Power", "Affiliation": "University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Philip J", "Last Name": "Dempsey", "Affiliation": "University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Helen", "Last Name": "Fenlon", "Affiliation": "University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Jurgen", "Last Name": "Mulsow", "Affiliation": "University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Conor", "Last Name": "Shields", "Affiliation": "University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Carmel G", "Last Name": "Cronin", "Affiliation": "University College Dublin (UCD) School of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}], "Journal": "The British journal of radiology", "PubDate": "2022Apr01"}, {"PMID": "34816521", "Title": "Annotating and prioritizing genomic variants using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor-A tutorial.", "Abstract": "The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) is a freely available, open-source tool for the annotation and filtering of genomic variants.

"Ensembl 2022.", "Abstract": "Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org) is unique in its flexible infrastructure for access to genomic data and annotation. It has been designed to efficiently deliver annotation at scale for all eukaryotic life, and it also provides deep comprehensive annotation for key species. Genomes representing a greater diversity of species are increasingly being sequenced. In response, we have focussed our recent efforts on expediting the annotation of new assemblies. Here, we report the release of the greatest annual number of newly annotated genomes in the history of Ensembl via our dedicated Ensembl Rapid Release platform (http://rapid.ensembl.org). We have also developed a new method to generate comparative analyses at scale for these assemblies and, for the first time, we have annotated non-vertebrate eukaryotes. Meanwhile, we continually improve, extend and update the annotation for our high-value reference vertebrate genomes and report the details here. We have a range of specific software tools for specific tasks, such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and the newly developed interface for the Variant Recoder. All Ensembl data, software and tools are freely available for download and are accessible programmatically.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic",

Interactions Database (PHI-base) has manually curated experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence\u00a0and effector genes from fungal, bacterial and\u00a0protist pathogens,\u00a0which infect animal, plant, fish, insect and/or fungal hosts. PHI-base (www.phi-base.org) is devoted to the identification and presentation of phenotype information on pathogenicity and effector genes and their host interactions. Specific gene\u00a0alterations that did not alter the\u00a0in host\u00a0interaction phenotype\u00a0are also presented.\u00a0PHI-base is invaluable for comparative analyses and for the discovery of candidate targets in medically and agronomically important species for intervention. Version 4.12 (September 2021) contains 4387 references, and provides information on 8411 genes from 279 pathogens, tested on 228 hosts in\u00a018, 190 interactions. This provides a 24% increase in gene content since Version 4.8 (September 2019). Bacterial and fungal pathogens represent the majority of the interaction data, with a 54:46 split of entries, whilst protists, protozoa, nematodes\u00a0and insects represent 3.6% of entries.

At the peripheral level, CB1 receptor activation impacts the energy balance of mammals in a number of different ways: inhibiting satiety and emesis, increasing food intake, altering adipokine and satiety hormone levels, altering taste sensation, decreasing lipolysis (fat break down), and increasing lipogenesis (fat generation). The CB1 receptor also plays an important role in the gut-brain axis control of appetite and satiety. The combined effect of peripheral CB1 activation is to promote appetite, energy storage, and energy preservation (and the opposite is true for CB1 antagonists). Therefore, the next generation of CB1 receptor medicines (agonists and antagonists, and indirect modulators of the endocannabinoid system) have been peripherally restricted to mitigate these issues, and some of these are already in clinical stage development. These compounds also have demonstrated potential in other conditions such as alcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetic nephropathy (peripherally restricted CB1 antagonists) and pain conditions (peripherally restricted CB1 agonists and FAAH inhibitors).

The dominant mechanism responsible for this shift has not been elucidated. We took a multifaceted approach to evaluating the clinical and immunologic impact of low vitamin D levels in 53 HCT recipients. We used 28-plex flow cytometry for immunophenotyping, serum cytokine levels, T-cell cytokine production, and T-cell whole genome transcription. The median day-30 vitamin D level was 20 ng/mL, and deficiency was common in younger patients undergoing myeloablative transplantation. Low vitamin D levels were associated with a high CD8/Treg ratio, increased serum levels and T-cell production of proinflammatory cytokines, and a gene expression signature of unrestrained T-cell proliferation and epigenetic modulation through the PRC2/EZH2 complex. Immunophenotyping confirmed a strong association between high levels of vitamin D and an activated EZH2 signature, characterized by overexpression of ID3, which has a role in effector T-cell differentiation. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of vitamin D in modulating T-cell function in human GVHD and identify a previously undescribed interaction with EZH2 and ID3, which may impact effector differentiation and has implications to cell therapies and other forms of cancer immunotherapy. \u00a9 20XX American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Our group has pioneered the use of TEVGs as a conduit between the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary arteries in the Fontan operation. The natural history of graft remodeling and its effect on hemodynamic performance has not been well characterized. In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of the first U.S. clinical trial evaluating TEVGs in the treatment of congenital heart disease. We show two distinct phases of graft remodeling: an early phase distinguished by rapid changes in graft geometry and a second phase of sustained growth and decreased graft stiffness. Using clinically informed and patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we demonstrate how changes to TEVG geometry, thickness, and stiffness affect patient hemodynamics.

However, analysis of these predominantly unregulated products from other countries tells us that they are often mislabeled or contain unlabeled and potentially dangerous chemicals. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze CBD oils available in the United Kingdom. Materials and Methods: Phytocannabinoids, residual solvent, and heavy metals were measured blinded in 29 widely available CBD products by an independent testing facility using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection for cannabinoids, Headspace-gas chromatography-flame ionization detector and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for residual solvents, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry for heavy metals. Results: The mean advertised CBD content was 4.5%, and the actual mean measured CBD content of products was 3.2% (p=0.053, Mann-Whitney test). Only 11/29 (38%) products were within 10% of the advertised CBD content. Fifty five percent of products had measurable levels of the controlled substances \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (mean content 0.04%) or cannabinol (mean content 0.01%), as well as most other phytocannabinoid compounds including cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabidivarin (CBDV), and cannabidivarin acid (CBDVA). Detectable levels of N-pentane, ethanol, isopropanol, heptane, lead, and arsenic were found in many of the CBD products, but these were within acceptable levels. Conclusions: As demonstrated in other countries, the quality of over-the-counter CBD products in the United Kingdom can be substandard, particularly with regard to CBD content, and often contains levels of controlled substances. We recommend that these products be more strictly regulated for consumer welfare.", "Keywords": ["cannabidiol", "over the counter", "phytocannabinoid", "quality"], "MeSH terms": ["Cannabidiol", "Cannabis", "Controlled Substances", "Dronabinol", "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan Paul", "Last Name": "Liebling", "Affiliation": "Centre for Medicinal Cannabis, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas James", "Last Name": "Clarkson", "Affiliation": "PhytoVista Laboratories Ltd., Frome, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Blair William", "Last Name": "Gibbs", "Affiliation": "Centre for Medicinal Cannabis, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew Stephen", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Centre for Medicinal Cannabis, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Saoirse Elizabeth", "Last Name": "O'Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Centre for Medicinal Cannabis, London, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Cannabis and cannabinoid research", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "33765436", "Title": "Longitudinal profiling of respiratory and systemic immune responses reveals myeloid cell-driven lung inflammation in severe COVID-19.", "Abstract": "Immune response dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their severe manifestations have largely been studied in circulation.

In COVID-19 airways, T\u00a0cells exhibited activated, tissue-resident, and protective profiles; higher T\u00a0cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age. Myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures, and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age. In COVID-19 blood, aberrant CD163+ monocytes predominated over conventional monocytes, and were found in corresponding airway samples and in damaged alveoli.

However, the greatest barriers to the success of allo-HCT are relapse and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Many studies have examined the reconstitution of the immune system after allo-HCT and searched for factors associated with clinical outcome. Serum biomarkers have also been studied to predict the incidence and prognosis of GVHD. However, the use of multiparametric immunophenotyping has been less extensively explored: studies usually focus on preselected and predefined cell phenotypes and so do not fully exploit the richness of flow cytometry data. Here we aimed to identify cell phenotypes present 30 days after allo-HCT that are associated with clinical outcomes in 37 patients participating in a trial relating to the prevention of GVHD, derived from 82 flow cytometry markers and 13 clinical variables. To do this we applied variable selection methods in a competing risks modeling framework, and identified specific subsets of T, B, and NK cells associated with relapse.

We find that FM cells are kinetically homogeneous, recirculate freely, are continually replenished from transitional populations, and self-renew rarely. In contrast, GC B cell lineages persist for weeks with rapid turnover and site-specific dynamics. Those in the spleen derive from transitional cells and are kinetically homogeneous, while those in lymph nodes derive from FM B cells and comprise both transient and persistent clones.

Survival from severe disease was associated with increased CD4 + T cells and decreased monocyte/macrophage frequencies in the airway, but not in blood. Airway T cells and macrophages exhibited tissue-resident phenotypes and activation signatures, including high level expression and secretion of monocyte chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL3 by airway macrophages. By contrast, monocytes in blood expressed the CCL2-receptor CCR2 and aberrant CD163 + and immature phenotypes. Extensive accumulation of CD163 + monocyte/macrophages within alveolar spaces in COVID-19 lung autopsies suggested recruitment from circulation.

Here we reveal that most mutagenic DNA lesions are not resolved into a mutated DNA base pair within a single cell cycle. Instead, DNA lesions segregate, unrepaired, into daughter cells for multiple cell generations, resulting in the chromosome-scale phasing of subsequent mutations. We characterize this process in mutagen-induced mouse liver tumours and show that DNA replication across persisting lesions can produce multiple alternative alleles in successive cell divisions, thereby generating both multiallelic and combinatorial genetic diversity. The phasing of lesions enables accurate measurement of strand-biased repair processes, quantification of oncogenic selection and fine mapping of sister-chromatid-exchange events. Finally, we demonstrate that lesion segregation is a unifying property of exogenous mutagens, including UV light and chemotherapy agents in human cells and tumours, which has profound implications for

The TEVG was used as a Fontan conduit to connect the inferior vena cava and pulmonary artery, but a high incidence of graft narrowing manifested within the first 6 months, which was treated successfully with angioplasty. To elucidate mechanisms underlying this early stenosis, we used a data-informed, computational model to perform in silico parametric studies of TEVG development. The simulations predicted early stenosis as observed in our clinical trial but suggested further that such narrowing could reverse spontaneously through an inflammation-driven, mechano-mediated mechanism. We tested this unexpected, model-generated hypothesis by implanting TEVGs in an ovine inferior vena cava interposition graft model, which confirmed the prediction that TEVG stenosis resolved spontaneously and was typically well tolerated. These findings have important implications for our translational research because they suggest that angioplasty may be safely avoided in patients with asymptomatic early stenosis, although there will remain a need for appropriate medical monitoring. The simulations further predicted that the degree of reversible narrowing can be mitigated by altering the scaffold design to attenuate early inflammation and increase mechano-sensing by the synthetic cells, thus suggesting a new paradigm for optimizing next-generation TEVGs. We submit that there is considerable translational advantage to combined computational-experimental studies when designing cutting-edge technologies and their clinical management.", "Keywords": [],

However, important plant pathogens still have incomplete and inconsistent gene sets and lack dedicated funding or teams to improve this annotation. This paper describes a collaborative approach to gene curation to address this shortcoming. In the first instance, over 40 members of the Botrytis cinerea community from eight countries, with training and infrastructural support from Ensembl Fungi, used the gene editing tool Apollo to systematically review the entire gene set (11,707 protein coding genes) in 6-7 months. This has subsequently been checked and disseminated. Following this, a similar project for another pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, also led to a completely redefined gene set. Currently, we are working with the Zymoseptoria tritici community to enable them to achieve the same. While the tangible outcome of these projects is improved gene sets, it is apparent that the inherent agreement and ownership of a single gene set by research teams as they undergo this curation process are consequential to the acceleration of research in the field. With the generation of large data sets increasingly affordable, there is value in unifying both the divergent data sets and their associated research teams, pooling time, expertise, and resources. Community-driven annotation efforts can pave the way for a new kind of collaboration among pathogen research communities to generate well-annotated reference data sets, beneficial not just for the genome being examined but for related species and the refinement of automatic gene prediction tools.", "Keywords": ["Ensembl genomes", "apollo", "community gene annotation", "fungi", "plant pathogens"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Helder", "Last Name": "Pedro", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Kersey", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nishadi H", "Last Name": "De Silva", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31742553", "Title": "Differential impact of self and environmental antigens on the ontogeny and maintenance of CD4+ T cell memory.", "Abstract": "Laboratory mice develop populations of circulating memory CD4+ T cells in the absence of overt infection.

Here, we tracked the generation of memory CD4+ T cell subsets in mice housed in facilities differing in their 'dirtiness'. We found evidence for sequential naive to central memory to effector memory development, and confirmed that both memory subsets are heterogeneous in their rates of turnover. We also inferred that early exposure to self and environmental antigens establishes persistent memory populations at levels determined largely, although not exclusively, by the dirtiness of the environment.

"In recent years, tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) have emerged as essential components of immunological memory. Following antigenic challenge, TRM remain in nonlymphoid tissues and defend against re-exposure. Although accumulating evidence suggests important roles for TRM in mediating protective immunity, fundamental aspects of the population biology of TRM remain poorly understood. In this article, we discuss how results from different systems shed light on the ecological dynamics of TRM in mice and humans. We highlight the importance of dissecting processes contributing to TRM maintenance, and how these might vary across phenotypically and spatially heterogeneous subsets. We also discuss how the diversity of TRM communities within specific tissues may evolve under competition and in response to antigenic perturbation. Throughout, we illustrate how mathematical models can clarify inferences obtained from experimental data and help elucidate the homeostatic mechanisms underpinning the ecology of TRM populations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Kinetics", "Mice", "Models, Theoretical", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sinead E", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; andrew.yates@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2019Nov15"}, {"PMID": "31661488", "Title": "Cell generation dynamics underlying naive T-cell homeostasis in adult humans.", "Abstract": "Thymic involution and proliferation of naive T cells both contribute to shaping the naive T-cell repertoire as humans age, but a clear understanding of the roles of each throughout a human life span has been difficult to determine. By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20 to 65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T-cell generation decreases with age because of a combination of declining peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. Concomitant decline in T-cell loss compensates for decreased generation rates. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of CD4+ naive T-cell turnover, using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and proliferation relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity for the CD4+ naive T-cell population. We show that basal nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) phosphorylation positively correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones. Functionally, we found that NF-\u03baB signaling was essential for naive T-cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor interleukin (IL)-7, and reduced NF-\u03baB phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T-cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T-cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones that accumulate with age.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Proliferation", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Interleukin-7", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "NF-kappa B", "Phosphorylation", "Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1", "Signal Transduction", "Thymus Gland"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeff E", "Last Name": "Mold", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "R\u00e9u", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Axel", "Last Name": "Olin", "Affiliation": "Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Bernard", "Affiliation": "Institut Camille Jordan, CNRS UMR 5208, University of Lyon, Villeurbanne, France."}, {"First Name": "Jakob", "Last Name": "Micha\u00eblsson", "Affiliation": "Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Sanket", "Last Name": "Rane", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Azadeh", "Last Name": "Khosravi", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Mehran", "Last Name": "Salehpour", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ion Physics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "G\u00f6ran", "Last Name": "Possnert", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ion Physics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Petter", "Last Name": "Brodin", "Affiliation": "Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Jonas", "Last Name": "Fris\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2019Oct"}, {"PMID": "31598706", "Title": "Ensembl Genomes 2020-enabling non-vertebrate genomic research.", "Abstract": "Ensembl Genomes (http://www.ensemblgenomes.org) is an integrating resource for genome-scale data from non-vertebrate species, complementing the resources for vertebrate genomics developed in the context of the Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org).

When this network is perturbed by transient exposure to ultraviolet light, short-term LCs are temporarily reconstituted from an initial wave of monocytes but thought to be superseded by more permanent repopulation with undefined LC precursors. However, the extent to which this process is relevant to immunopathological processes that damage LC population integrity is not known. Using a model of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, where alloreactive T cells directly target eLCs, we have asked whether and how the original LC network is ultimately restored. We find that donor monocytes, but not dendritic cells, are the precursors of long-term LCs in this context. Destruction of eLCs leads to recruitment of a wave of monocytes that engraft in the epidermis and undergo a sequential pathway of differentiation via transcriptionally distinct EpCAM+ precursors. Monocyte-derived LCs acquire the capacity of self-renewal, and proliferation in the epidermis matched that of steady-state eLCs. However, we identified a bottleneck in the differentiation and survival of epidermal monocytes, which, together with the slow rate of renewal of mature LCs, limits repair of the network. Furthermore, replenishment of the LC network leads to constitutive entry of cells into the epidermal compartment. Thus, immune injury triggers functional adaptation of mechanisms used to maintain tissue-resident macrophages at other sites, but this process is highly inefficient in the skin.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Langerhans Cells", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Monocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ivana R", "Last Name": "Ferrer", "Affiliation": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK and Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London, London WC1E 6DD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Heather C", "Last Name": "West", "Affiliation": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK and Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London, London WC1E 6DD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Henderson", "Affiliation": "Bill Lyons Informatics Centre, Cancer Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6DD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dmitry S", "Last Name": "Ushakov", "Affiliation": "Peter Gorer Department of Immunobiology, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, New Hunt's House, Newcomen Street, London SE1 1UL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Pedro", "Last Name": "Santos E Sousa", "Affiliation": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK and Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London, London WC1E 6DD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Strid", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus, London W12 0NN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ronjon", "Last Name": "Chakraverty", "Affiliation": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK and Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London, London WC1E 6DD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clare L", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK and Cancer Institute Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer Studies, University College London, London WC1E 6DD, UK. c.bennett@ucl.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Science immunology", "PubDate": "2019Aug23"}, {"PMID": "31404636", "Title": "Functional outcomes among survivors of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest are associated with baseline neurologic and functional status, but not with diastolic blood pressure during CPR.", "Abstract": "Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with survival following pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.

The influence of acute VTE risk factors and the health care burden associated with VTE in CPHD is unknown.Methods: Children <18\u00a0years of age with a CPHD diagnostic code were identified from the 2003-2013 MarketScan Commercial Databases. VTE diagnoses were identified either concomitantly with initial CPHD diagnoses or during a 6-month follow-up. The associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and VTE among children with CPHD, stratified by recent cardiac surgery, were assessed by multivariable logistic regression models. Estimates of health care utilization were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.Results: VTE events occurred in 957 of 120\u00a0884 children with CPHD (0.8%). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in children with VTE. Single-ventricle physiology had the highest VTE rate (2.3%). All comorbid conditions were significantly associated with VTE, but the prevalence was highest in children with recent cardiac (11.1%) or noncardiac surgery (7.8%). The magnitude of association between noncardiac comorbidities and acquired acute cardiovascular conditions and VTE were larger for children without a recent cardiac surgery. Children with VTE had significantly higher health care utilization.Conclusions: VTE in CPHD is associated with significantly increased health care resource utilization and in-hospital mortality. All of the comorbid conditions examined were significantly associated with VTE, but a recent surgical procedure, especially cardiac surgery, conferred the highest VTE risk.

In evolutionary bioinformatics, open-source software comes in a broad range of programming languages, including C/C++, Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, and R. To avoid writing the same functionality multiple times for different languages, it is possible to share components by bridging computer languages and Bio* projects, such as BioPerl, Biopython, BioRuby, BioJava, and R/Bioconductor.In this chapter, we compare the three principal approaches for sharing software between different programming languages: by remote procedure call (RPC), by sharing a local \"call stack,\" and by calling program to programs. RPC provides a language-independent protocol over a network interface; examples are SOAP and Rserve. The local call stack provides a between-language mapping, not over the network interface but directly in computer memory; examples are R bindings, RPy, and languages sharing the Java virtual machine stack. This functionality provides strategies for sharing of software between Bio* projects, which can be exploited more often.Here, we present cross-language examples for sequence translation and measure throughput of the different options. We compare calling into R through native R, RSOAP, Rserve, and RPy interfaces, with the performance of native BioPerl, Biopython, BioJava, and BioRuby implementations and with call stack bindings to BioJava and the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS).In general, call stack approaches outperform native Bio* implementations, and these, in turn, outperform \"RPC\"-based approaches.

We show that following skin priming, the lymph node migratory population is principally composed of cells recruited to the site of priming, with a minor contribution from tissue resident cells. In combination with the YAe/E\u03b1 system, we also show that the majority of cells presenting antigen are CD103+CD11b+ dendritic cells that were recruited to the site of priming during the inflammatory response. This population has previously only been described in relation to mucosal tissues. Comprehensive phenotypic profiling of the cells migrating from the skin to the draining lymph node by mass cytometry revealed that in addition to dendritic cells, the migratory population also included CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. Taking our complex spatiotemporal data set, we then generated a model of cell migration that quantifies and describes the dynamics of arrival, departure, and residence times of cells at the site of priming and in the draining lymph node throughout the time-course of the initiation of adaptive immunity. In addition, we have identified the mean migration time of migratory dendritic cells as they travel from the site of priming to the draining lymph node. These findings represent an unprecedented, detailed and quantitative map of cell dynamics and phenotypes during immunization, identifying where, when and which cells to target for immunomodulation in autoimmunity and vaccination strategies.", "Keywords": ["adaptive immunity", "cell migration", "cell tracking", "dendritic cells", "innate immunity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptive Immunity", "Animals", "Antigen Presentation", "Cell Movement", "Dendritic Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocytes", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Models, Immunological", "Skin", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alan J", "Last Name": "Hayes", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Sanket", "Last Name": "Rane", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Hannah E", "Last Name": "Scales", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Gavin R", "Last Name": "Meehan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Benson", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Asher", "Last Name": "Maroof", "Affiliation": "UCB Celltech, Slough, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Juliane", "Last Name": "Schroeder", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Tomura", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Osaka Ohtani University, Osaka, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Gozzard", "Affiliation": "UCB Celltech, Slough, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Garside", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Brewer", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30804925", "Title": "Thymic Function as a Predictor of Immune Recovery in Chronically HIV-Infected Patients Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy.", "Abstract": "Poor immunological responders (PIR) are HIV-infected patients with virologic suppression upon antiretroviral therapy (ART) but persistently low CD4+ T cell counts.

All PIR had CD4+ T cell counts consistently below 500 cells/\u03bcL, while all AIR reached this threshold. AIR showed a higher percentage of recent thymic emigrants among CD4+ T cells; higher numbers of sj-TRECs and greater sj/\u03b2 TREC ratios; and significant increases in thymic volume from baseline to 12 months of ART. We identified mathematical models that correctly predicted PIR/AIR outcome after 36 months of therapy in 77-87% of the cases, based on observations made until 2-6 months after ART onset.

Although infection induces a strong MV-specific immune response that clears viral load and confers lifelong immunity, transient immunosuppression can also occur, leaving the host vulnerable to colonization from secondary pathogens. This apparent contradiction of viral clearance in the face of immunosuppression underlies what is often referred to as the 'measles paradox', and remains poorly understood. To explore the mechanistic basis underlying the measles paradox, and identify key factors driving viral clearance, we return to a previously published dataset of MV infection in rhesus macaques. These data include virological and immunological information that enable us to fit a mathematical model describing how the virus interacts with the host immune system. In particular, our model incorporates target cell depletion through infection of host immune cells-a hallmark of MV pathology that has been neglected from previous models. We find the model captures the data well, and that both target cell depletion and immune activation are required to explain the overall dynamics. Furthermore, by simulating conditions of increased target cell availability and suppressed cellular immunity, we show that the latter causes greater increases in viral load and delays to MV clearance. Overall, this signals a more dominant role for cellular immunity in resolving acute MV infection. Interestingly, we find contrasting dynamics dominated by target cell depletion when viral fitness is increased. This may have wider implications for animal morbilliviruses, such as canine distemper virus (CDV), that cause fatal target cell depletion in their natural hosts. To our knowledge this work represents the first fully calibrated within-host model of MV dynamics and, more broadly, provides a new platform from which to explore the complex mechanisms underlying Morbillivirus infection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunity, Cellular", "Macaca mulatta", "Measles", "Measles virus", "Mice", "Models, Theoretical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sinead E", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rik L", "Last Name": "de Swart", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Rory D", "Last Name": "de Vries", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Mina", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley N", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wen-Hsuan W", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger D", "Last Name": "Kouyos", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Diane E", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bryan T", "Last Name": "Grenfell", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2018Dec"}, {"PMID": "30543619", "Title": "Eleven quick tips to build a usable REST API for life sciences.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Science Disciplines", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Factual", "Databases, Genetic", "Genomics", "Humans", "Information Storage and Retrieval", "Software", "User-Computer Interface"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aleksandra", "Last Name": "Tarkowska", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Denise", "Last Name": "Carvalho-Silva", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Charles E", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Edd", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Finn", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2018Dec"}, {"PMID": "30534073", "Title": "A Systematic Review on the Pharmacokinetics of Cannabidiol in Humans.", "Abstract": "Background: Cannabidiol is being pursued as a therapeutic treatment for multiple conditions, usually by oral delivery. Animal studies suggest oral bioavailability is low, but literature in humans is not sufficient. The aim of this review was to collate published data in this area. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE (including MEDLINE) was conducted to retrieve all articles reporting pharmacokinetic data of CBD in humans. Results: Of 792 articles retireved, 24 included pharmacokinetic parameters in humans. The half-life of cannabidiol was reported between 1.4 and 10.9 h after oromucosal spray, 2-5 days after chronic oral administration, 24 h after i.v., and 31 h after smoking. Bioavailability following smoking was 31% however no other studies attempted to report the absolute bioavailability of CBD following other routes in humans, despite i.v formulations being available. The area-under-the-curve and Cmax increase in dose-dependent manners and are reached quicker following smoking/inhalation compared to oral/oromucosal routes. Cmax is increased during fed states and in lipid formulations. Tmax is reached between 0 and 4 h. Conclusions: This review highlights the paucity in data and some discrepancy in the pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol, despite its widespread use in humans.

Pattern recognition receptor agonists are a growing class of potential adjuvants that can shape the character of the immune response to subunit vaccines by directing the polarization of CD4 T cell differentiation to various functional subsets. In the current study, we applied a high-throughput in vitro screen to assess murine CD4 T cell polarization by a panel of pattern recognition receptor agonists. This identified lipopeptides with TLR2 agonist activity as exceptional Th1-polarizing adjuvants. In vivo, we demonstrated that i.v. administration of TLR2 agonists with Ag in mice replicated the findings from in vitro screening by promoting strong Th1 polarization. In contrast, TLR2 agonists inhibited priming of Th1 responses when administered cutaneously in mice. This route-specific suppression was associated with infiltrating CCR2+ cells in the skin-draining lymph nodes and was not uniquely dependent on any of the well characterized subsets of dendritic cells known to reside in the skin. We further demonstrated that priming of CD4 T cells to generate Th1 effectors following immunization with the Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) strain, a lipoprotein-rich bacterium recognized by TLR2, was dependent on the immunization route, with significantly greater Th1 responses with i.v. compared with intradermal administration of BCG.

high quality analysis of data informing both genome biology and clinical genomics. Over the last 15 years, the GENCODE consortium has been producing reference quality gene annotations to provide this foundational resource. The GENCODE consortium includes both experimental and computational biology groups who work together to improve and extend the GENCODE gene annotation. Specifically, we generate primary data, create bioinformatics tools and provide analysis to support the work of expert manual gene annotators and automated gene annotation pipelines. In addition, manual and computational annotation workflows use any and all publicly available data and analysis, along with the research literature to identify and characterise gene loci to the highest standard. GENCODE gene annotations are accessible via the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers, the Ensembl FTP site, Ensembl Biomart, Ensembl Perl and REST APIs as well as https://www.gencodegenes.org.",

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the EOS PMP\u2122 oxygenator for generation of plasma free hemoglobin (PfHg) over 24 hours at nominal operating range flow rates. The EOS ECMO\u2122 (LivaNova, Inc.; formerly Sorin, Arvada, CO) is equipped with a plasma tight polymethylpentene (PMP) hollow fiber oxygenator. We hypothesized that PfHg generation would be elevated in circuits with higher flow rates, because of the significant pressure drop across the oxygenator according to manufacturer provided flow charts. Generated PfHg concentrations were compared with PfHg concentrations from blood not exposed to an ECMO circuit. The secondary aim was to evaluate circuit flow-rate-induced changes in platelet count and platelet function over 24 hours. Circuits contained a CentriMag\u00ae (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) blood pump and an EOS ECMO PMP\u2122 oxygenator. Circuits in triplicate were run continuously for 24 hours at three flow rates [1, 3, and 5 liters per minute {LPM}]. PfHg was analyzed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. Platelet count and function were measured at baseline and 24 hours. Concentrations of PfHg at baseline for circuits operating at 1, 3, and 5 LPM were 24.4 \u00b1 4.0, 38.4 \u00b1 28.6, and 26.7 \u00b1 6.9 mg/dL, respectively. PfHg concentrations after 24 hours were statistically compared for the three flow rates using analysis of variance; PfHg concentrations at 1 LPM (181.4 \u00b1 29.1 mg/dL), 3 LPM (145.9 \u00b1 8.7 mg/dL), and 5 LPM (100.1 \u00b1 111.3 mg/dL) circuits. The F-test was not statistically significant (p = .632), indicating that PfHg generation at 24 hours was similar among the three flow rates.

Results of our clinical trial showed that the TEVG possesses growth capacity but that its widespread clinical use is not yet advisable due to the high incidence of TEVG stenosis. In animal models, TEVG stenosis is caused by increased monocytic cell recruitment and its classic (\"M1\") activation. Here, we report on the source and regulation of these monocytes. TEVGs were implanted in wild-type, CCR2 knockout ( Ccr2-/-), splenectomized, and spleen graft recipient mice. We found that bone marrow-derived Ly6C+hi monocytes released from sequestration by the spleen are the source of mononuclear cells infiltrating the TEVG during the acute phase of neovessel formation. Furthermore, short-term administration of losartan (0.6 g/L, 2 wk), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the macrophage populations (Ly6C+/-/F480+) in the scaffolds and improved long-term patency in TEVGs. Notably, the combined effect of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell seeding with short-term losartan treatment completely prevented the development of TEVG stenosis. Our results provide support for pharmacologic treatment with losartan as a strategy to modulate monocyte infiltration into the grafts and thus prevent TEVG stenosis.-Ruiz-Rosado, J. D.

Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth-death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via 'conditioning through experience' may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Aged", "Aging", "Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Communication", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Genetic Fitness", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Count", "Lymphopenia", "Mice", "Models, Immunological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sanket", "Last Name": "Rane", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Thea", "Last Name": "Hogan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Benedict", "Last Name": "Seddon", "Affiliation": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "29615134", "Title": "Improving outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest - the ICU-Resuscitation Project: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with survival, but recommended guidelines are often not met, and less than half the children with an in-hospital arrest will survive to discharge.

Other advances since 2015 include the release of the database in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, a large increase in community-derived curation, a new high-performance protein sequence search, additional cross-references, improved annotation of non-protein-coding genes, and the launch of pre-release and archival sites.

The Ensembl 'Core' database and Application Programming Interface (API) was our first major piece of software infrastructure and remains at the centre of all of our genome resources. Since its initial design more than fifteen years ago, the number of publicly available genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets has grown enormously, accelerated by continuous advances in DNA-sequencing technology. Initially intended to provide annotation for the reference human genome, we have extended our framework to support the genomes of all species as well as richer assembly models. Cross-referenced links to other informatics resources facilitate searching our database with a variety of popular identifiers such as UniProt and RefSeq. Our comprehensive and robust framework storing a large diversity of genome annotations in one location serves as a platform for other groups to generate and maintain their own tailored annotation.

However, we lack knowledge of the population structure and how self-renewal and de novo influx contribute to the maintenance of memory compartments. Here, we characterise the kinetics and structure of murine CD4 T cell memory subsets by measuring the rates of influx of new cells and using detailed timecourses of DNA labelling that also distinguish the behaviour of recently divided and quiescent cells. We find that both effector and central memory CD4 T cells comprise subpopulations with highly divergent rates of turnover, and show that inflows of new cells sourced from the naive pool strongly impact estimates of memory cell lifetimes and division rates. We also demonstrate that the maintenance of CD4 T cell memory subsets in healthy mice is unexpectedly and strikingly reliant on this replenishment.", "Keywords": ["BrdU labelling", "Ki67", "T cell homeostasis", "computational biology", "immunology", "mathematical modelling", "memory T cells", "mouse", "systems biology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Immunologic Memory", "Mice", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Graeme", "Last Name": "Gossel", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Thea", "Last Name": "Hogan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Cownden", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Benedict", "Last Name": "Seddon", "Affiliation": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2017Mar10"}, {"PMID": "28103239", "Title": "Identifying T Cell Receptors from High-Throughput Sequencing: Dealing with Promiscuity in TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 Pairing.", "Abstract": "Characterisation of the T cell receptors (TCR) involved in immune responses is important for the design of vaccines and immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune disease. The specificity of the interaction between the TCR heterodimer and its peptide-MHC ligand derives largely from the juxtaposed hypervariable CDR3 regions on the TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 chains, and obtaining the paired sequences of these regions is a standard for functionally defining the TCR. A brute force approach to identifying the TCRs in a population of T cells is to use high-throughput single-cell sequencing, but currently this process remains costly and risks missing small clones. Alternatively, CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 sequences can be associated using their frequency of co-occurrence in independent samples, but this approach can be confounded by the sharing of CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 across clones, commonly observed within epitope-specific T cell populations. The accurate, exhaustive, and economical recovery of TCR sequences from such populations therefore remains a challenging problem. Here we describe an algorithm for performing frequency-based pairing (alphabetr) that accommodates CDR3\u03b1- and CDR3\u03b2-sharing, cells expressing two TCR\u03b1 chains, and multiple forms of sequencing error. The algorithm also yields accurate estimates of clonal frequencies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Cells, Cultured", "Complementarity Determining Regions", "Computational Biology", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, Glasgow Biomedical Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paul G", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeff E", "Last Name": "Mold", "Affiliation": "Karolinska Institute, CMB, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, Glasgow Biomedical Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2017Jan"}, {"PMID": "27899575", "Title": "Ensembl 2017.", "Abstract": "Ensembl (www.ensembl.org) is a database and genome browser for enabling research on vertebrate genomes.

Unlike the other Burton brewing chemists, Griess paralleled his work at the brewery with significant contributions to the chemistry of synthetic dyes, managing to keep the two activities separate-to the extent that some of his inventions in dye chemistry were filed as patents on behalf of the German dye company BASF, without the involvement of Allsopp's. This seemingly unlikely situation can be explained partly by the very different attitudes to patent protection in Britain and in Germany combined with an apparent indifference to the significant business opportunity that the presence of a leading dye chemist presented to Allsopp's. Although his work for the brewery remained largely proprietary, Griess's discoveries in dye chemistry were exploited by the German dye industry, which quickly outpaced its British counterpart. One less well-known connection between brewing and synthetic dyes, and one that may further explain Allsopp's attitude, is the use of synthetic dyes in identifying microorganisms-the perennial preoccupation of brewers seeking to maintain yield and quality.

The coherent investigation of genic and genomic data often requires comparative genomics analyses based on whole-genome alignments, sets of homologous genes and other relevant datasets in order to evaluate and answer evolutionary-related questions. However, the complexity and computational requirements of producing such data are substantial: this has led to only a small number of reference resources that are used for most comparative analyses. The Ensembl comparative genomics resources are one such reference set that facilitates comprehensive and reproducible analysis of chordate genome data. Ensembl computes pairwise and multiple whole-genome alignments from which large-scale synteny, per-base conservation scores and constrained elements are obtained. Gene alignments are used to define Ensembl Protein Families, GeneTrees and homologies for both protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes. These resources are updated frequently and have a consistent informatics infrastructure and data presentation across all supported species. Specialized web-based visualizations are also available including synteny displays, collapsible gene tree plots, a gene family locator and different alignment views. The Ensembl comparative genomics infrastructure is extensively reused for the analysis of non-vertebrate species by other projects including Ensembl Genomes and Gramene and much of the information here is relevant to these projects. The consistency of the annotation across species and the focus on vertebrates makes Ensembl an ideal system to perform and support vertebrate comparative genomic analyses.

These studies present snapshots of homeostatic dynamics and have suggested that lymphocyte populations are heterogeneous with respect to rates of division and/or death, although resolving the details of such heterogeneity is problematic. Here we present a method of studying the population dynamics of T cells in mice over timescales of months to years that reveals heterogeneity in rates of division and death with respect to the age of the host at the time of thymic export. We use the transplant conditioning drug busulfan to ablate hematopoetic stem cells in young mice but leave the peripheral lymphocyte compartments intact. Following their reconstitution with congenically labeled (donor) bone marrow, we followed the dilution of peripheral host T cells by donor-derived lymphocytes for a year after treatment.

Rather than the effector : target ratio, we show that the relevant quantity is the ratio of a CTL's expected time to locate its next target (search time) to the average time it spends conjugated with a target that it is killing (handling time). For inefficient (slow) CTL, when the search time is always limiting, the critical density of CTL (that required to control 50% of infections, C(*)) is independent of the spatial distribution and derives from simple mass-action kinetics. For more efficient CTL such that handling time becomes limiting, mass-action underestimates C(*), and the more clustered an infection the greater is C(*). If CTL migrate chemotactically towards targets the converse holds-C(*) falls, and clustered infections are controlled most efficiently.

Estimates have been obtained using in vivo cytotoxicity assays in which peptide-pulsed splenocytes are killed by CTL in the spleens of immunised mice. However the spleen is a heterogeneous environment and splenocytes comprise multiple cell types. Are some cell types intrinsically more susceptible to lysis than others? Quantitatively, what impacts are made by the spatial distribution of targets and effectors, and the level of peptide-MHC on the target cell surface? To address these questions we revisited the splenocyte killing assay, using CTL specific for an epitope of influenza virus. We found that at the cell population level T cell targets were killed more rapidly than B cells. Using modeling, quantitative imaging and in vitro killing assays we conclude that this difference in vivo likely reflects different migratory patterns of targets within the spleen and a heterogeneous distribution of CTL, with no detectable difference in the intrinsic susceptibilities of the two populations to lysis. Modeling of the stages involved in the detection and killing of peptide-pulsed targets in vitro revealed that peptide dose influenced the ability of CTL to form conjugates with targets but had no detectable effect on the probability that conjugation resulted in lysis, and that T cell targets took longer to lyse than B cells. We also infer that incomplete killing in vivo of cells pulsed with low doses of peptide may be due to a combination of heterogeneity in peptide uptake and the dissociation, but not internalisation, of peptide-MHC complexes.

By combining the detailed experimental characterization with a theoretical kinetic model based on population balance equations, we extract relevant information on the contribution of the individual elementary steps on the global aggregation process. The analysis shows that the two molecules follow different aggregation pathways under the same operating conditions. In particular, while the monomer depletion of the IgG1 is found to be rate-limited by monomeric conformational changes, bimolecular collision is identified as the rate-limiting step in the IgG2 aggregation process. The measurement of the microscopic rate constants by kinetic analysis allows the quantification of the protein-protein interaction potentials expressed in terms of the Fuchs stability ratio (W). It is found that the antibody solutions exhibit large W values, which are several orders of magnitude larger than the values computed in the frame of the DLVO theory. This indicates that, besides net electrostatic repulsion, additional effects delay the aggregation kinetics of the antibody solutions with respect to diffusion-limited conditions.

Using U.S. aquatic ecosystem markets as an example, we develop a principal-agent model of the behavior of regulators and wetland/stream mitigation bankers to determine and explore the optimal degree of advance credit release.

In order to avoid stability issues which are commonly described when water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion is used, a solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w) method was developed and optimized.

The methylene chloride (MC) commonly used for an encapsulation process was replaced by ethyl acetate (EtAc), which was considered as a more suitable organic solvent in terms of both environmental and human safety.

Neither model requires that T(conv) and T(reg) are differentially susceptible to deletion or that the two lineages need qualitatively different signals for development, as have been proposed.

The clonal response to lymphopenia is extremely diverse, and it is unknown whether this heterogeneity represents distinct mechanisms of cell-cycle control or whether a common mechanism can account for the diversity. We addressed this question by combining in vivo and mathematical modeling of lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) of two distinct T cell clonotypes. OT-I T cells undergo rapid LIP accompanied by differentiation that superficially resembles Ag-induced proliferation, whereas F5 T cells divide slowly and remain naive. Both F5 and OT-I LIP responses were most accurately described by a single stochastic division model where the rate of cell division was exponentially decreased with increasing cell numbers. The model successfully identified key biological parameters of the response and accurately predicted the homeostatic set point of each clone. Significantly, the model was successful in predicting interclonal competition between OT-I and F5 T cells, consistent with competition for the same resource(s) required for homeostatic proliferation. Our results show that diverse and heterogeneous clonal T cell responses can be accounted for by a single common model of homeostasis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adoptive Transfer", "Animals", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Division", "Cell Line", "Clone Cells", "Homeostasis", "Immunophenotyping", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphopenia", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Models, Immunological", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thea", "Last Name": "Hogan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrey", "Last Name": "Shuvaev", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Commenges", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Callard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rodolphe", "Last Name": "Thiebaut", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benedict", "Last Name": "Seddon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2013Apr15"}, {"PMID": "23468830", "Title": "Heterogeneity in thymic emigrants: implications for thymectomy and immunosenescence.", "Abstract": "The development of mature, antigen-inexperienced (naive) T cells begins in the thymus and continues after export into the periphery. Post-thymic maturation of naive T cells, in humans, coincides with the progressive loss of markers such as protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). As a consequence, subpopulations of naive T cells can be recognised raising questions about the processes that give rise to the loss of these markers and their exact relationship to recent thymic emigrants (RTE). Here, we combine a mathematical survival analysis approach and data from healthy and thymectomised humans to understand the apparent persistence of populations of 'veteran' PTK7 (+) T cells in thymectomised individuals. We show that a model of heterogeneity in rates of maturation, possibly linked to natural variation in TCR signalling thresholds or affinity for self-antigens, can explain the data. This model of maturation predicts that the average post-thymic age of PTK7 (+) T cells will increase linearly with the age of the host suggesting that, despite the immature phenotype, PTK7 (+) cells do not necessarily represent a population of RTE. Further, the model predicts an accelerated increase in the average post-thymic age of residual PTK7 (+) T cells following thymectomy and may also explain in part the prematurely aged phenotype of the naive T cell pool in individuals thymectomised early in life.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aging", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Emigrants and Immigrants", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Thymectomy", "Thymus Gland", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Iren", "Last Name": "Bains", "Affiliation": "Immune Cell Biology, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom. bains@nimr.mrc.ac.uk"}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robin E", "Last Name": "Callard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23467678", "Title": "Plasticity in transmission strategies of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi: environmental and genetic effects.", "Abstract": "Parasites may alter their behaviour to cope with changes in the within-host environment. In particular, investment in transmission may alter in response to the availability of parasite resources or host immune responses. However, experimental and theoretical studies have drawn conflicting conclusions regarding parasites' optimal (adaptive) responses to deterioration in habitat quality. We analyse data from acute infections with six genotypes of the rodent malaria species Plasmodium chabaudi to quantify how investment in transmission (gametocytes) is influenced by the within-host environment. Using a minimum of modelling assumptions, we find that proportional investment in gametocytogenesis increases sharply with host anaemia and also increases at low parasite densities. Further, stronger dependence of investment on parasite density is associated with greater virulence of the parasite genotype. Our study provides a robust quantitative framework for studying parasites' responses to the host environment and whether these responses are adaptive, which is crucial for predicting the short-term and evolutionary impact of transmission-blocking treatments for parasitic diseases.", "Keywords": ["gametocyte", "gametocytogenesis", "life history trait", "parasite ecology", "phenotypic plasticity", "resource allocation trade-off", "transmission strategies"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angus", "Last Name": "Cameron", "Affiliation": "Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow Glasgow, UK ; Department of Systems and Computational Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine Bronx, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Reece", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Damien R", "Last Name": "Drew", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel T", "Last Name": "Haydon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Evolutionary applications", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}, {"PMID": "22854832", "Title": "Management strategies after cardiac surgery in an infant with human rhinovirus.", "Abstract": "This report presents management strategies after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for an infant with community-acquired rhinovirus bronchiolitis.
