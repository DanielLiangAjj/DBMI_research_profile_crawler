[{"PMID": "38908072", "Title": "Ferroptosis in health and disease.", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is a pervasive non-apoptotic form of cell death highly relevant in various degenerative diseases and malignancies. The hallmark of ferroptosis is uncontrolled and overwhelming peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in membrane phospholipids, which eventually leads to rupture of the plasma membrane. Ferroptosis is unique in that it is essentially a spontaneous, uncatalyzed chemical process based on perturbed iron and redox homeostasis contributing to the cell death process, but that it is nonetheless modulated by many metabolic nodes that impinge on the cells' susceptibility to ferroptosis. Among the various nodes affecting ferroptosis sensitivity, several have emerged as promising candidates for pharmacological intervention, rendering ferroptosis-related proteins attractive targets for the treatment of numerous currently incurable diseases. Herein, the current members of a Germany-wide research consortium focusing on ferroptosis research, as well as key external experts in ferroptosis who have made seminal contributions to this rapidly growing and exciting field of research, have gathered to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review on ferroptosis. Specific topics include: basic mechanisms, in vivo relevance, specialized methodologies, chemical and pharmacological tools, and the potential contribution of ferroptosis to disease etiopathology and progression. We hope that this article will not only provide established scientists and newcomers to the field with an overview of the multiple facets of ferroptosis, but also encourage additional efforts to characterize further molecular pathways modulating ferroptosis, with the ultimate goal to develop novel pharmacotherapies to tackle the various diseases associated with - or caused by - ferroptosis.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Cell death", "Iron", "Ischemia/reperfusion", "Lipid peroxidation", "Neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carsten", "Last Name": "Berndt", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hamed", "Last Name": "Alborzinia", "Affiliation": "Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM GGmbH), Heidelberg, Germany;

The innate immune system, which rapidly detects pathogens via pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pathogen-encoded effectors, serves as the first defensive line against EV-A71 infection. Concurrently, the virus has developed various sophisticated strategies to evade host antiviral responses and establish productive infection. Thus, the virus-host interactions and conflicts, as well as the ability to govern biological events at this first line of defense, contribute significantly to the pathogenesis and outcomes of EV-A71 infection. In this review, we update recent progress on host innate immune responses to EV-A71 infection.

Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis-mediated therapy could offer an appropriate alternative treatment option against cancer cells that are resistant to certain drugs. However, recurrent gliomas display robust ferroptosis resistance, although the precise mechanism of resistance remains elusive. In the present work, we report that proline rich protein 11 (PRR11) depletion significantly sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ by inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, PRR11 directly binds to and stabilizes dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which leads to glioma ferroptosis-resistant in a DHODH-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, PRR11 inhibits HERC4 and DHODH binding, by suppressing the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC4 and polyubiquitination degradation of DHODH at the K306 site, which maintains DHODH protein stability. Importantly, downregulated PRR11 increases lipid peroxidation and alters DHODH-mediated mitochondrial morphology, thereby promoting ferroptosis and increasing TMZ chemotherapy sensitivity.

Notably, the Keto diet-induced tumor metastasis is dependent on BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) and its up-regulation of pro-metastatic targets, including cell migration-inducing hyaluronidase 1, in response to the Keto diet. By contrast, upon genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition of endogenous BACH1, the Keto diet-mediated activation of those targets is largely diminished, and the effects on tumor metastasis are completely abolished. Mechanistically, upon administration of the Keto diet, the levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) are markedly induced. Through direct interaction with BACH1, ATF4 is recruited to those pro-metastatic target promoters and enhances BACH1-mediated transcriptional activation.

In current study, the effects of different acclimation temperatures on the growth, digestive physiology, antioxidant ability, liver transcriptional responses and intestinal microflora patterns of Ussruri whitefish were investigated. Ussruri whitefish (15.20\u00a0g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.23\u00a0g) were reared for 42 days under different acclimation temperatures, i.e., 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Result first determined 28\u00a0\u00b0C as the semi-lethal temperature in order to design the temperature gradient test. Highest main gain rate (MGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) were observed in fish group having acclimation temperature of 19\u00a0\u00b0C. Significantly decrease (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in triglyceride (TG) content appeared at 19\u00a0\u00b0C as compared to the 10\u00a0\u00b0C and 13\u00a0\u00b0C temperature groups. 19\u00a0\u00b0C notablely increased protease activities of stomach and intestine and intestinal lipase and amylase activities. 19\u00a0\u00b0C group obtained the highest activities of chloramphnicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The intestinal microflora composition was most conducive to maintaining overall intestinal health when the temperature was 19\u00a0\u00b0C, compared to 10\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Ussruri whitefish exposed to 10\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C possessed the lower Lactobacillus abundance compared to exposure to 19\u00a0\u00b0C. Temperature down to 10\u00a0\u00b0C or up to 25\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, triggered cold stress and heat stress, which leading to impairment in intestinal digestion, liver antioxidant capacity and intestinal microflora structure. Liver transcriptome response to 10\u00a0\u00b0C, 19\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C revealed that Ussruri whitefish might require the initiation of endoplasmic reticulum stress to correct protein damage from cold-temperature and high-temperature stress, and it was speculated that DNAJB11 could be regarded as a biomarker of cold stress response.Based on the quadratic regression analysis of MGR and SGR against temperature, the optimal acclamation temperature were, respectively, 18.0\u00a0\u00b0C and 18.1\u00a0\u00b0C.

However, the standard components(tannins and gallic acid) specified in the Chinese Pharmacopeia decrease in charcoal-fried Sanguisorbae Radix(CSR), which is contrast to the enhancement of the hemostatic effect. Therefore, this study aimed to optimize the charcoal-frying process of SR based on its hemostatic efficacy and comprehensively analyze the components of SR and its processed products, thus exploring the material basis for the hemostatic effect. The results indicated that SR processed at 250 \u2103 for 14 min(14-min CSR) not only complied with the description in the Chinese Pharmacopeia but also demonstrated improved blood-coagulating and blood-adsorbing effects compared with raw SR(P&lt;0.05). Moroever, 14-min CSR reduced the bleeding time in the rat models of tail snipping, liver bleeding, and muscle injury, surpassing both raw and excessively fried SR(16 min processed) as well as tranexamic acid(P&lt;0.05). Ellagitannin, ellagic acid, methyl gallate, pyrogallic acid, protocatechuic acid, Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn contributed to the hemostatic effect of CSR over SR. Among these substances, ellagitannin, ellagic acid, Mg, and Ca had high content in the 14 min CSR, reaching(106.73\u00b114.87),(34.86\u00b14.43),(2.81\u00b10.23), and(1.21\u00b10.23) mg\u00b7g~(-1), respectively. Additionally, the color difference value(\u0394E~*ab) of SR processed to different extents was correlated with the content of the aforementioned hemostatic substances. In summary, this study optimized the charcoal-frying process as 250 \u2103 for 14 min for SR based on its hemostatic effect.

Nevertheless, their effectiveness in eliminating solid tumors is generally limited by the instability and inadequate TAMs-specific targeting of photosensitizers. Here, a novel core-shell integrated nano platform is proposed to achieve a coordinated strategy of repolarizing TAMs for potentiating cancer immunotherapy. Colloidal mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CMSN) are fabricated to encapsulate photosensitizer-Indocyanine Green (ICG) to improve their stability. Then ginseng-derived exosome (GsE) was coated on the surface of ICG/CMSN for targeting TAMs, as well as repolarizing TAMs concurrently, named ICG/CMSN@GsE. As expected, with the synergism of ICG and GsE, ICG/CMSN@GsE exhibited better stability, mild generation of ROS, favorable specificity toward M2-like macrophages, enhancing drug retention in tumors and superior TAMs repolarization potency, then exerted a potent antitumor effect. In vivo, experiment results also confirm the synergistic suppression of tumor growth accompanied by the increased presence of anti-tumor M1-like macrophages and maximal tumor damage. Taken together, by integrating the superiorities of TAMs targeting specificity and synergistic TAMs repolarization effect into a single nanoplatform, ICG/CMSN@GsE can readily serve as a safe and high-performance nanoplatform for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.", "Keywords": ["Colloidal mesoporous silica nanoparticles", "Ginseng-derived exosome", "Repolarizing TAMs", "TAMs-specific targeting delivery", "Tumor-associated macrophages"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Wen", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhishuang", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Yimeng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Meiqi", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Biopharmaceuticals, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Qinfu", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Yikun", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences and Biopharmaceuticals, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuling", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}, {"First Name": "Siling", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China."}], "Journal": "Bioactive materials", "PubDate": "2024Aug"}, {"PMID": "38773477", "Title": "Association between dietary behavior and puberty in girls.", "Abstract": "Over the decades the trends of early onset of puberty have been observed in children, particularly in girls.

MTA2 loss in the adult mouse colon activated lipid absorptive genes and functional lipid uptake. Mechanistically, MTA2 co-occupies DNA with HNF4A, an activating pan-intestinal transcription factor (TF), on colonic chromatin.

Recent studies have suggested a potential link between AURKA and ferroptosis, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study presented evidence of AURKA upregulation in high grade meningioma and its ability to enhance malignant characteristics. We identified AURKA as a suppressor of erastin-induced ferroptosis in meningioma. Mechanistically, AURKA directly interacted with and phosphorylated kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), thereby activating nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2) and target genes transcription.

Suppression of AURKA, in conjunction with erastin, yields significant enhancements in the prognosis of a murine model of meningioma.

The copper chaperone Antioxidant 1 (Atox1) plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular copper ion balance and impacting the antioxidant capacity of mitochondria, as well as the oxidative stress state of cells. However, it remains unknown whether Atox1 is involved in modulating oxidative stress following TBI. Here, we investigated the regulatory role of Atox1 in oxidative stress on neurons both in vivo and in vitro, and elucidated the underlying mechanism through culturing hippocampal HT-22\u00a0cells with Atox1 mutation. The expression of Atox1 was significantly diminished following TBI, while mice with overexpressed Atox1 exhibited a more preserved hippocampal structure and reduced levels of oxidative stress post-TBI. Furthermore, the mice displayed notable impairments in learning and memory functions after TBI, which were ameliorated by the overexpression of Atox1. In the stretch injury model of HT-22\u00a0cells, overexpression of Atox1 mitigated oxidative stress by preserving the normal morphology and network connectivity of mitochondria, as well as facilitating the elimination of damaged mitochondria. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed the binding of Atox1 to DJ-1. Knockdown of DJ-1 in HT-22\u00a0cells significantly impaired the antioxidant capacity of Atox1. Mutations in the copper-binding motif or sequestration of free copper led to a substantial decrease in the interaction between Atox1 and DJ-1, with overexpression of DJ-1 failing to restore the antioxidant capacity of Atox1 mutants. The findings suggest that DJ-1 mediates the ability of Atox1 to withstand oxidative stress.

Multiple Rubus species are cultivated for their valuable fruits. However, the intrageneric classification and phylogenetic relationships are still poorly understood. In this study, we sequenced, assembled, and characterized 17 plastomes of Rubus, and conducted comparative genomics integrating with 47 previously issued plastomes of this genus. The 64 plastomes of Rubus exhibited typical quadripartite structure with sizes ranging from 155,144 to 156,700\u00a0bp, and contained 132 genes including 87 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes and eight rRNA genes. All plastomes are conservative in the gene order, the frequency of different types of long repeats and simple sequence repeats (SSRs), the codon usage, and the selection pressure of protein-coding genes. However, there are also some differences in the Rubus plastomes, including slight contraction and expansion of the IRs, a variation in the numbers of SSRs and long repeats, and some genes in certain clades undergoing intensified or relaxed purifying selection. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole plastomes showed that the monophyly of Rubus was strongly supported and resolved it into six clades corresponding to six subgenera. Moreover, we identified 12 highly variable regions that could be potential molecular markers for phylogenetic, population genetic, and barcoding studies.

Here, we report that unlike Parp2 -/- mice, which develop normally, mice expressing catalytically-inactive Parp2 (E534A, Parp2 EA/EA ) succumb to Tp53- and Chk2 -dependent erythropoietic failure in utero , mirroring Lig1 -/- mice. While DNA damage mainly activates PARP1, we demonstrate that DNA replication activates PARP2 robustly. PARP2 is selectively recruited and activated by 5'-phosphorylated nicks (5'p-nicks) between Okazaki fragments, typically resolved by Lig1. Inactive PARP2, but not its active form or absence, impedes Lig1- and Lig3-mediated ligation, causing dose-dependent replication fork collapse, particularly harmful to erythroblasts with ultra-fast forks.

Macrophage polarization and autophagy are major functions in inflammatory macrophages; however, the cellular functions of the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis in macrophages are not well understood. Here, we examined the role of CXCL10-CXCR3-axis-regulated autophagy in macrophage polarization. First, in non-inflammatory macrophages, whereas CXCL10 promotes M2 polarization and inhibits M1 polarization, CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 induces the opposite macrophage polarization. Next, CXCL10 promotes the expression of autophagy proteins (Atg5-Atg12 complex, p62, LC3-II, and LAMP1) and AMG487 inhibits their expression. Knockdown of LAMP1 by short interfering RNA switches the CXCL10-induced polarization from M2 to M1 in non-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, in inflammatory macrophages stimulated by poly(I:C), CXCL10 induces M1 polarization and AMG487 induces M2 polarization in association with a decrease in LAMP1. Finally, AMG487 alleviates lung injury after poly(I:C) treatment in mice.

GAS41 interacts with NRF2 and is critical for NRF2 to activate its targets such as SLC7A11 for modulating ferroptosis. By recognizing the H3K27-acetylation (H3K27-ac) marker, GAS41 is recruited to the SLC7A11 promoter, independent of NRF2 binding. By bridging the interaction between NRF2 and the H3K27-ac marker, GAS41 acts as an anchor for NRF2 on chromatin in a promoter-specific manner for transcriptional activation. Moreover, the GAS41-mediated effect on ferroptosis contributes to its oncogenic role in vivo. These data demonstrate that GAS41 is a target for modulating tumor growth through ferroptosis.

Herein, an Aptamer-Liposome mediated Telomerase activated poly-Molecular beacon Arborescent Nanoassembly(ALTMAN) approach was described for direct high-fidelity visualization of telomerase activity. Briefly, intracellular telomerase activates molecular beacons, causing their hairpin structures to unfold and produce fluorescent signals. Furthermore, multiple molecular beacons can self-assemble, forming arborescent nanostructures and leading to exponential amplification of fluorescent signals. Integrating the enzyme-free isothermal signal amplification successfully increased the sensitivity and reduced interference by leveraging the skillful design of the molecular beacon and the extension of the telomerase-activated TTAGGG repeat sequence. The proposed approach enabled ultrasensitive visualization of activated telomerase exclusively with a prominent detection limit of 2 cells\u00b7\u03bcL-1 and realized real-time imaging of telomerase activity in living cancer cells including blood samples from breast cancer patients and urine samples from bladder cancer patients.

However, relatively limited research has been conducted on the composition and quality of wild Rosa fruits. The present study aimed to compare the properties and chemical components of five wild edible Rosa fruits, Rosa roxburghii, Rosa sterilis, Rosa laevigata, Rosa davurica, and Rosa sericea. The UPLC-ESI-MS/MS approach identified the key metabolites among the five Rosa fruits as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and organic acids. The main differential metabolites among the five fruits are flavonoids (22.29-45.13%), phenolic acids (17-22.27%), and terpenoids (7.7-24%), respectively. In total, 125 compounds served as potential markers for the five Rosa species. Differential metabolic pathways of five Rosa fruits were analyzed using the KEGG approach.

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent oxidative form of cell death characterized by unrestricted lipid peroxidation in the context of heterogeneous and plastic mechanisms. Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of specific types of autophagy (e.g. ferritinophagy, lipophagy, and clockophagy) in initiating or executing ferroptotic cell death through the selective degradation of anti-injury proteins or organelles. Conversely, other forms of selective autophagy (e.g. reticulophagy and lysophagy) enhance the cellular defense against ferroptotic damage. Dysregulated autophagy-dependent ferroptosis has implications for a diverse range of pathological conditions. This review aims to present an updated definition of autophagy-dependent ferroptosis, discuss influential substrates and receptors, outline experimental methods, and propose guidelines for interpreting the results.Abbreviation: 3-MA:3-methyladenine; 4HNE: 4-hydroxynonenal; ACD: accidentalcell death; ADF: autophagy-dependentferroptosis; ARE: antioxidant response element; BH2:dihydrobiopterin; BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin; BMDMs: bonemarrow-derived macrophages; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CQ:chloroquine; DAMPs: danger/damage-associated molecular patterns; EMT,epithelial-mesenchymal transition; EPR: electronparamagnetic resonance; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRET: F\u00f6rsterresonance energy transfer; GFP: green fluorescent protein;GSH: glutathione;IF: immunofluorescence; IHC: immunohistochemistry; IOP, intraocularpressure; IRI: ischemia-reperfusion injury; LAA: linoleamide alkyne;MDA: malondialdehyde; PGSK: Phen Green\u2122 SK;RCD: regulatedcell death; PUFAs: polyunsaturated fatty acids; RFP: red fluorescentprotein;ROS: reactive oxygen species; TBA: thiobarbituricacid; TBARS: thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; TEM:transmission electron microscopy.", "Keywords": ["Cell death", "ferritinophagy", "iron", "lipid peroxidation", "lipophagy", "lysosome"], "MeSH terms": ["Ferroptosis", "Humans", "Autophagy", "Animals", "Consensus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Andrey S", "Last Name": "Tsvetkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The University of Texas McGovern Medical School at Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Han-Ming", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Ciro", "Last Name": "Isidoro", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas T", "Last Name": "Ktistakis", "Affiliation": "Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Linkermann", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine 3, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Werner J H", "Last Name": "Koopman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Radboud Center for Mitochondrial Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Uwe", "Last Name": "Simon", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Lorenzo", "Last Name": "Galluzzi", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shouqing", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Peninsula Medical School, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daqian", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Peulen", "Affiliation": "Metastasis Research Laboratory, GIGA Cancer-University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Rubinsztein", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jen-Tsan", "Last Name": "Chi", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna D", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Pharmacology and Toxicology, R.

"Mannose-binding lectin plays an essential role in bacteria or virus-triggered immune response in mammals. Previous proteomic data revealed that in Eriocheir sinensis, the mannose-binding protein was differentially expressed after Spiroplasma eriocheiris infection. However, the function of mannose-binding protein against pathogen infection in invertebrates is poorly understood. In this study, a crab mannose-binding protein (EsMBP) was characterized and enhanced the host resistance to S. eriocheiris infection. The application of recombinant C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CTLD) of EsMBP led to increased crab survival and decreased S. eriocheiris load in hemocytes. Meanwhile, the overexpression of CTLD of EsMBP in Raw264.7 cells inhibited S. eriocheiris intracellular replication. In contrast, depletion of EsMBP by RNA interference or antibody neutralization attenuated phenoloxidase activity and hemocyte phagocytosis, rendering host more susceptible to S. eriocheiris infection. Furthermore, miR-381-5p in hemocytes suppressed EsMBP expression and negatively regulated phenoloxidase activity to exacerbate S. eriocheiris invasion of hemocytes. Taken together, our findings revealed that crab mannose-binding protein was involved in host defense against S. eriocheiris infection and targeted by miR-381-5p, providing further insights into the control of S. eriocheiris spread in crabs.", "Keywords": ["Eriocheir sinensis", "Mannose-binding protein", "Phagocytosis", "Prophenoloxidase activation", "miR-381-5p"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mannose-Binding Lectin", "Brachyura", "Proteomics", "Monophenol Monooxygenase", "Phagocytosis", "MicroRNAs", "Hemocytes", "Mammals", "Catechol Oxidase", "Enzyme Precursors", "Spiroplasma"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yubo", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Aquatic Crustacean Diseases, College of Marine Science and Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, 2 Xuelin Road, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenbo", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Aquatic Crustacean Diseases, College of Marine Science and Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, 2 Xuelin Road, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Guanzheng", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Aquatic Crustacean Diseases, College of Marine Science and Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, 2 Xuelin Road, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Yangzhi", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Aquatic Crustacean Diseases, College of Marine Science and Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, 2 Xuelin Road, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Panpan", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Aquatic Crustacean Diseases, College of Marine Science and Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, 2 Xuelin Road, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongli", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Aquatic Crustacean Diseases, College of Marine Science and Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, 2 Xuelin Road, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuguang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210017, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Aquatic Crustacean Diseases, College of Marine Science and Engineering, Nanjing Normal University, 2 Xuelin Road, Nanjing 210023, China; Co-Innovation Center for Marine Bio-Industry Technology of Jiangsu Province, Lianyungang, Jiangsu 222005, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Freshwater Fisheries Research Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210017, China.

Patients suspected with AAS were recruited, and clinical information was collected. Genetic testing and functional analysis were carried out for the diagnosis. By literature review, we summarized the clinical and genetic characteristics of FGD1-related AAS and analyzed the genotype-phenotype correlation. Five patients were recruited, and four novel FGD1 variants were identified. The diagnosis of AAS was confirmed by genetic analysis and functional study. Three patients treated with growth hormone showed improved heights during the follow-up period. By literature review, clinical features of AAS patients with FGD1 variants were summarized. Regarding FGD1 variations, substitutions were the most common form, and among them, missense variants were the most frequent. Moreover, we found patients with drastic variants showed higher incidences of foot and genitourinary malformations. Missense variants in DH domain were related to a lower incidence of cryptorchidism. \u00a0 Conclusion: We reported four novel pathogenic FGD1 variations in AAS patients and confirmed the efficacy and safety of growth hormone treatment in FGD1-related AAS patients with growth hormone deficiency.

Our research revealed a significant accumulation of diacyl-PUFA phosphatidylcholines (PC-PUFA2s) following fatty acid or phospholipid treatments, correlating with cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis. Depletion of PC-PUFA2s occurred in aging and Huntington's disease brain tissue, linking it to ferroptosis.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an essential regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and exerts characteristic vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. SARS-COV-2 infects the lungs by binding to ACE2, which can lead to dysregulation of ACE2 expression, further leading to ALI with predominantly vascular inflammation and eventually to more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, restoration of ACE2 expression represents a valuable therapeutic approach for SARS-COV-2-related ALI/ARDS. In this study, we used polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), a double-stranded RNA analog, to construct a mouse ALI model that mimics virus infection. After Poly(I:C) exposure, ACE2 was downregulated in mouse lung tissues and in cultured ECs. Treatment with DIZE, an ACE2-activating compound, upregulated ACE2 expression and relieved ALI in mice. DIZE also improved barrier function and reduced the number of THP-1 monocytes adhering to cultured ECs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK) levels were increased in lung tissues of ALI mice as well as in Poly(I:C)-treated ECs in vitro. Both DIZE and the FAK inhibitor PF562271 decreased FAK/p-FAK expression in both ALI models, attenuating ALI severity in vivo and increasing barrier function and reducing monocyte adhesion in cultured ECs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments using ANG 1-7 and the MAS inhibitor A779 corroborated that DIZE-mediated ACE2 activation stimulated the activity of the ANG 1-7/MAS axis, which inhibited FAK/p-FAK expression in the mouse lung.

The peroxidation of PUFA-PLs, particularly sn2-arachidonoyl(AA)- and sn2-adrenoyl(AdA)-containing phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), has been associated with the execution of ferroptosis, a program of regulated cell death. There is a minor subpopulation (\u22481-2\u2005mol\u2009%) of doubly PUFA-acylated phospholipids (di-PUFA-PLs) whose role in ferroptosis remains enigmatic. Here we report that 15-lipoxygenase (15LOX) exhibits unexpectedly high pro-ferroptotic peroxidation activity towards di-PUFA-PEs. We revealed that peroxidation of several molecular species of di-PUFA-PEs occurred early in ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1, a typical ferroptosis inhibitor, effectively prevented peroxidation of di-PUFA-PEs. Furthermore, co-incubation of cells with di-AA-PE and 15LOX produced PUFA-PE peroxidation and induced ferroptotic death. The decreased contents of di-PUFA-PEs in ACSL4 KO A375 cells was associated with lower levels of di-PUFA-PE peroxidation and enhanced resistance to ferroptosis. Thus, di-PUFA-PE species are newly identified phospholipid peroxidation substrates and regulators of ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic target for many diseases related to ferroptotic

host-derived immune molecules during infection. As an intracellular pathogen, Spiroplasma eriocheiris is harmful to multiple crustaceans. However, the immune mechanism of exosomes during Spiroplasma infection has not been investigated. Here, we found exosomes derived from S. eriocheiris-infected crabs could facilitate phagocytosis and apoptosis of hemocytes, resulting in increased crab survival and suppression of Spiroplasma intracellular replication. Proteomic analysis revealed the altered abundance of EsTetraspanin may confer resistance to S. eriocheiris, possibly by mediating hemocyte phagocytosis in Eriocheir sinensis. Specifically, knockdown of EsTetraspanin in E. sinensis increased susceptibility to S. eriocheiris infection and displayed compromised phagocytic ability, whereas overexpression of EsTetraspanin in Drosophila S2 cells inhibited S. eriocheiris infection. Further, it was confirmed that intramuscular injection of recombinant LEL domain of EsTetraspanin reduced the mortality of S. eriocheiris-infected crabs. Blockade with anti-EsTetraspanin serum could exacerbate S. eriocheiris invasion of hemocytes and impair hemocyte phagocytic activity.

The association of the key protein expression with clinicopathological features of ICP was further analyzed. A total of 178 DEPs were identified between the ICP and control groups. Functional enrichment analysis showed these proteins were significantly enriched in the PPAR singling pathway by KEGG and PPAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1 activation by IPA. Apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2) was the only upregulated protein, which uniquely identified in ICP groups and related to both pathways. Validation of western blotting and immunohistochemical staining analysis showed significantly higher APOA2 expression in the ICP group than in the control group. Furthermore, the expression of APOA2 is associated with clinicopathological features in ICP groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that the AUC of APOA2 was 0.8984 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.772-1.000).

Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbes participate in the progression of tumorigenesis through the generation of carcinogenic metabolites.

In the present study we show that a tryptophan metabolite derived from Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, trans-3-indoleacrylic acid (IDA), facilitates colorectal carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, IDA acts as an endogenous ligand of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to transcriptionally upregulate the expression of ALDH1A3 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3), which utilizes retinal as a substrate to generate NADH, essential for ferroptosis-suppressor protein 1(FSP1)-mediated synthesis of reduced coenzyme Q10. Loss of AHR or ALDH1A3 largely abrogates IDA-promoted tumour development both in vitro and in vivo. It is interesting that P. anaerobius is significantly enriched in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).

patterns constitute a salient manifestation in major depressive disorder. GW117, an emergent antidepressant, functions as an agonist for melatonin 1 and melatonin 2 (MT1/MT2) receptors, in tandem with antagonism of the serotonin (5-HT) 2C receptor. The present investigation is dedicated to elucidating the role and underlying mechanisms by which GW117 ameliorates circadian sleep disruptions. Utilizing an adapted chronic unpredictable mild stress protocol, we induced a depressive-like phenotype and perturbed circadian rhythms in rodent models. Our methodological approach integrated quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in real-time, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunoblotting techniques to probe alterations in the expression of core circadian genes and homeostatic sleep markers. The impact of GW117 was assessed across various dosages (10, 20, and 40\u00a0mg/kg) on these molecular signatures. In a parallel examination, we evaluated the influence of GW117 (administered at 15, 40, and 60\u00a0mg/kg) on the sleep patterns of healthy mice. The results showed that GW117 significantly improved sleep-wake circadian rhythms, altered sleep architecture, and shortened sleep latency. Furthermore, GW117 increased the expression of several clock genes in the hypothalamus of chronic unpredictable mild stress model rats and normal mice. It also regulated circadian biomarkers, including melatonin and cortisol. Based on our findings, we propose that the beneficial effects of GW117 on sleep rhythms may be due to the melatonin system-mediated activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.", "Keywords": ["Antidepressants", "Chronic unpredictable mild stress", "Circadian rhythm", "GW117", "Melatonin receptors", "Sleep disorders"], "MeSH terms": ["Rats", "Animals", "Mice", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Melatonin", "Sleep", "Circadian Rhythm", "Receptor, Melatonin, MT1", "Receptor, Melatonin, MT2", "Antidepressive Agents", "Serotonin", "Organic Chemicals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ya-Qi", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100020, China; Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China."}, {"First Name": "Murezati", "Last Name": "Tiliwaerde", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China."}, {"First Name": "Na-Na", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery and Clinical Nutrition, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Captial Medical University, Beijing, 100038, China.

Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin E3 ligase Huwe1 is vital in NAFLD pathogenesis. Using mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we reveal that liver-specific deletion of Huwe1 (Huwe1LKO) in 1-year-old mice (approximately middle age in humans) elicits extensive lipid metabolic reprogramming that involves downregulation of de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake, upregulation of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, and increased oxidative phosphorylation. ChEA transcription factor prediction analysis inferred these changes result from attenuated PPAR\u0251, LXR, and RXR activity in Huwe1LKO livers.

Here, we report that conditional deletion of USP7 in excitatory neurons in the mouse forebrain triggers diverse phenotypes including sensorimotor deficits, learning and memory impairment, and aggressive behavior, resembling clinical features of HAFOUS. USP7 deletion induces neuronal apoptosis in a manner dependent of the tumor suppressor p53. However, most behavioral abnormalities in USP7 conditional mice persist despite p53 loss. Strikingly, USP7 deletion in the brain perturbs the synaptic proteome and dendritic spine morphogenesis independently of p53. Integrated proteomics analysis reveals that the neuronal USP7 interactome is enriched for proteins implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and specifically identifies the RNA splicing factor Ppil4 as a novel neuronal substrate of USP7. Knockdown of Ppil4 in cortical neurons impairs dendritic spine morphogenesis, phenocopying the effect of USP7 loss on dendritic spines.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential role of Melanophilin (MLPH) O-GlcNAcylation and the specific mechanism through which it regulates GBM radiotherapy resistance. We found that MLPH was significantly upregulated in recurrent GBM tumor tissues after ionizing radiation (IR). MLPH induced radiotherapy resistance in GBM cells and xenotransplanted human tumors through regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway. MLPH was O-GlcNAcylated at the conserved serine 510, and radiation-resistant GBM cells showed higher levels of O-GlcNAcylation of MLPH. O-GlcNAcylation of MLPH protected its protein stability and tripartite motif containing 21(TRIM21) was identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting MLPH degradation whose interaction with MLPH was affected by O-GlcNAcylation. Our data demonstrate that MLPH exerts regulatory functions in GBM radiation resistance by promoting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and that O-GlcNAcylation of MLPH both stabilizes and protects it from TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination. These results identify a potential mechanism of GBM radiation resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for GBM treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "NF-kappa B", "Cell

This study attempts to construct Multienzyme Isothermal Rapid Amplification (MIRA), a quick and simple nucleic acid amplification method that operates at room temperature. Based on the gene sequences of S. eriocheiris, appropriate amplification primers were constructed and screened in this investigation. Both the relevant specific probe and the chosen specific amplification primers were designed and labeled. The MIRA and MIRA-LFD reaction conditions were then optimized. The result showed MIRA and MIRA-FFD could identify S. eriocheiris at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 30\u00a0min and 15\u00a0min, respectively. To investigate the specificity of MIRA and MIRA-LFD, three Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Staphylococcus aureus), three Gram-positive bacteria (Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Salmonella typhimurium) and S. eriocheiris were selected. The result showed MIRA and MIRA-LFD were highly specific to S. eriocheiris and did not react with other six pathogens. The sensitivities of PCR, MIRA, and MIRA-LFD were then evaluated. The result showed the detection limit of PCR is 1\u00a0ng/L whereas the detection limit of MIRA and MIRA-LFD is 10\u00a0pg/L.

This retrospective study aimed to report the epidemiological findings in 95 cases of human fascioliasis in Dali, Yunnan Province, southwestern China, diagnosed between 2012 and 2021. MATERIAL AND METHODS The epidemiologic and clinical data of 95 patients diagnosed with human fascioliasis in Dali area from January 2012 to December 2021 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. The diagnosis of fascioliasis was based on the Chinese National Standard of Diagnosis of Fascioliasis (WS/T566-2017). RESULTS The mean age of patients was 38.54\u00b115.68 years, and there were more female patients than male (61.05% vs 38.95%). The high-incidence seasons were identified as summer and autumn. The patients with human fascioliasis lived in pastoral areas or were infected F. gigantica by consuming contaminated vegetables or water containing metacercaria. Meanwhile, human fascioliasis was diagnosed by positive serologic tests (1: 640), and Fasciola eggs (144-180\u00d773-96 \u03bcm) were detected in stool samples of 6 patients. The most common clinical features were abdominal pain (70.53%), accompanied by elevated eosinophils in 89.5% of these patients. Antiparasitic treatment with triclabendazole at 10 mg/kg/day for 2 days led to symptom relief in all patients.

Copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) are two of the most common heavy metal contaminants that impair the survival, development, and reproduction of aquatic organisms. With the growth of agriculture and industry, there is a possibility of heavy metal pollution in Coregonus ussuriensis Berg's water source. However, there are no published studies on the toxicity to C. ussuriensis. Acute toxicity experiments in C. ussuriensis revealed the 96-h median lethal concentrations of copper and cadmium to be 0.492\u2009mg\u00b7L-1 (95% confidence interval: 0.452-0.529) and 1.548\u2009mg\u00b7L-1 (95% confidence interval: 1.434-1.657), respectively, and safe concentrations of 4.92\u2009\u00b5g\u00b7L-1 and 15.48\u2009\u00b5g\u00b7L-1, respectively. C. ussuriensis was then treated for 96\u2009h with Cu (20% of 96\u2009h LC50), Cd (20% of 96\u2009h LC50), and a combination of Cu and Cd (20% of Cu 96\u2009h LC50\u2009+\u200920% of Cd 96\u2009h LC50). The histological damage caused by the three different exposure modes to the liver and gills of C. ussuriensis was verified using hematoxylin and eosin staining. All three exposure modes caused different degrees of vacuolization, nuclear consolidation, and necrosis in the liver tissue of C. ussuriensis and edema, hyperplasia, laminar fusion, and epithelial elevation in the gill tissue compared with the reference group. The severity of the damage increased with increasing exposure time. Anti-oxidant activity in the gill and liver tissues were measured using enzyme activity assay kits to reflect oxidative stress induced by copper and cadmium exposure alone and in combination. The enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH) were substantially higher than those in the reference groups. However, the activities of the enzymes decreased with increasing exposure time. Malondialdehyde (MDA) activity significantly increased during exposure in relation to that in the reference group. Analysis of immune gene expression in C. ussuriensis gill and liver tissues was executed using real-time inverse transcript polymerase chain response (RT-PCR). The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin one beta (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were positively correlated with exposure time and were significantly upregulated with increasing exposure time. Metallothionein (MT) gene expression levels were significantly upregulated in the short term after exposure compared to the reference group but decreased with increasing exposure time. Our results indicate that exposure to aqueous copper and cadmium solutions, either alone or in combination, causes histopathological damage, oxidative stress, and immunotoxicity in C. ussuriensis gill and liver tissue.

The clinical approach generally relies on anatomical changes in tumor size, which is unable to promptly reflect clinical outcomes and guide a timely adjustment of therapy regimens. To resolve it, we herein develop a self-assembled organic probe (dCyFFs) with caspase-3 (Casp-3)-activatable near-infrared (NIR) fluoro-photoacoustic signals for early evaluation and prediction of radiotherapy efficacy. The probe contains an NIR dye that is caged with a Casp-3-cleavable substrate and linked to a self-assembly initiating moiety. In the presence of Casp-3, the self-assembled probe can undergo secondary assembly into larger nanoparticles and simultaneously activate NIR fluoro-photoacoustic signals. Such a design endows a superior real-time longitudinal imaging capability of Casp-3 generated by radiotherapy as it facilitates the passive accumulation of the probe into tumors, activated signal output with enhanced optical stability, and retention capacity relative to a nonassembling small molecular control probe (dCy). As a result, the probe enables precise prediction of the radiotherapy effect as early as 3 h posttherapy, which is further evidenced by the changes in tumor size after radiotherapy. Overall, the probe with Casp-3-mediated secondary assembly along with activatable NIR fluoro-photoacoustic signals holds great potential for evaluating and predicting the response of radiotherapy in a timely manner, which can also be explored for utilization in other therapeutic modalities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Spectrum Analysis", "Molecular Probes", "Nanoparticles"], "Authors":

oncogene involved in multiple aspects of cancer metastasis in a broad variety of tumors. However, the molecular mechanism by which MACC1 transcription is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that in breast cancer cells, lncRNA MACC1-AS1 serves as a cis-factor to up-regulate MACC1 transcription and this regulation increases the cell proliferation potential. Mechanistically, MACC1-AS1 forms a complex with DEAD-Box helicase 5 (DDX5) and simultaneously interacts with the distal region of the MACC1 promoter. The interaction allows its associated DDX5 to spatially contact the MACC1 core promoter and shift from MACC1-AS1 to the core promoter. Moreover, binding of DDX5 to the core promoter results in local recruitment of the transcription factor SP-1, thus enhancing MACC1 transcription. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which MACC1-AS1 cis-regulates MACC1 transcription by interacting with the distal promoter region and delivering DDX5 to the core-promoter of the gene.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Molecular interaction", "Molecular mechanism of gene regulation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guiyu", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanmei", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Liqun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaoying", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaona", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Weibin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanchun", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology, Key Immunopathology Laboratory of Guangdong Province, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province 515041, China."}], "Journal": "iScience", "PubDate": "2023Sep15"}, {"PMID": "37653840", "Title": "Invasive Trends of Spartina alterniflora in the Southeastern Coast of China and Potential Distributional Impacts on Mangrove Forests.", "Abstract": "Mangrove forests are one of the most productive and seriously threatened ecosystems in the world.

We used the species occurrence records combined with bioclimate, sea-land topography, and marine environmental factors to predict the potentially suitable habitats of mangrove forests and the potentially suitable invasive habitats of S. alterniflora in the southeastern coast of China. We then applied the invasion risk index (IRI) to assess the risk that S. alterniflora would invade mangrove forests. The results show that the suitable habitats for mangrove forests are mainly distributed along the coastal provinces of Guangdong, Hainan, and the eastern coast of Guangxi. The suitable invasive habitats for S. alterniflora are mainly distributed along the coast of Zhejiang, Fujian, and relatively less in the southern provinces. The high-risk areas for S. alterniflora invasion of mangrove forests are concentrated in Zhejiang and Fujian. Bioclimate variables are the most important variables affecting the survival and distribution of mangrove forests and S. alterniflora. Among them, temperature is the most important environmental variable determining the large-scale distribution of mangrove forests.

Compounds 1 and 2 are discovered to be the first 13-norgermacrane type sesquiterpenoids in natural products. Compound 15 is a rare 5,6-seco-guaiane type sesquiterpene and its possible biogenic precursor is presumed to be compound 20. Subsequent structural modification for compound 28 led to 21 derivatives, among which 15 derivatives were new compounds.

Our previous studies suggested Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) as a potential target for cardiac fibrosis and heart failure. In the present study, we explored the role of SIRT3 in cardiac ferroptosis and its contribution to cardiac fibrosis. Our data showed that knockout of SIRT3 resulted in a significant increase in ferroptosis, with increased levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4) in the mouse hearts. Overexpression of SIRT3 significantly blunted ferroptosis in response to erastin, a known ferroptosis inducer, in H9c2 myofibroblasts. Knockout of SIRT3 resulted in a significant increase in p53 acetylation. Inhibition of p53 acetylation by C646 significantly alleviated ferroptosis in H9c2 myofibroblasts. To further explore the involvement of p53 acetylation in SIRT3-mediated ferroptosis, we crossed acetylated p53 mutant (p534KR) mice, which cannot activate ferroptosis, with SIRT3KO mice. SIRT3KO/p534KR mice exhibited a significant reduction in ferroptosis and less cardiac fibrosis compared to SIRT3KO mice. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of SIRT3 (SIRT3-cKO) in mice resulted in a significant increase in ferroptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Treatment of SIRT3-cKO mice with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) led to a significant reduction in ferroptosis and cardiac fibrosis. We concluded that SIRT3-mediated cardiac fibrosis was partly through a mechanism involving p53 acetylation-induced ferroptosis in myofibroblasts.", "Keywords": ["SIRT3", "cardiac fibrosis", "ferroptosis", "myofibroblasts", "p53 acetylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Acetylation", "Ferroptosis", "Fibrosis", "Heart Failure", "Mice, Knockout", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Sirtuin 3", "Stroke Volume", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Han", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aubrey C", "Last Name": "Cantrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian-Xiong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heng", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, USA."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2023May19"}, {"PMID": "37407175", "Title": "Bioassay-guided isolation of \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitory constituents from Hypericum sampsonii.", "Abstract": "This study employed the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity model as an anti-diabetic assay and implemented a bioactivity-guided isolation strategy to identify novel natural compounds with potential therapeutic properties.

heterobifunctional modalities such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been successfully advanced to clinics for treating cancer. However, pharmacologic activation of tumor-suppressor proteins for cancer treatment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a novel Acetylation Targeting Chimera (AceTAC) strategy to acetylate the p53 tumor suppressor protein. We discovered and characterized the first p53Y220C AceTAC, MS78, which recruits histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP to acetylate the p53Y220C mutant. MS78 effectively acetylated p53Y220C lysine 382 (K382) in a concentration-, time-, and p300-dependent manner and suppressed proliferation and clonogenicity of cancer cells harboring the p53Y220C mutation with little toxicity in cancer cells with wild-type p53. RNA-seq studies revealed novel p53Y220C-dependent upregulation of TRAIL apoptotic genes and downregulation of DNA damage response pathways upon acetylation induced by MS78. Altogether, the AceTAC strategy could provide a generalizable platform for targeting proteins, such as tumor suppressors, via acetylation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Humans",

inflammation, metabolism, cell death and aging in hosts.", "Abstract": "The FOX family of transcription factors was originally identified in 1989, comprising the FOXA to FOXS subfamilies. FOXO3, a well-known member of the FOXO subfamily, is widely expressed in various human organs and tissues, with higher expression levels in the ovary, skeletal muscle, heart, and spleen. The biological effects of FOXO3 are mostly determined by its phosphorylation, which occurs in the nucleus or cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of FOXO3 in the nucleus can promote its translocation into the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of FOXO3 in the cytoplasm leads to its translocation into the nucleus and exerts regulatory effects on biological processes, such as inflammation, aerobic glycolysis, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair. Additionally, FOXO3 isoform 2 acts as an important suppressor of osteoclast differentiation. FOXO3 can also interfere with the development of various diseases, including inhibiting the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells, blocking the production of inflammatory factors in autoimmune diseases, and inhibiting \u03b2-amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, FOXO3 slows down the aging process and exerts anti-aging effects by delaying telomere attrition, promoting cell self-renewal, and maintaining genomic stability. This review suggests that changes in the levels and post-translational modifications of FOXO3 protein can maintain organismal homeostasis and improve age-related diseases, thus counteracting aging. Moreover, this may indicate that alterations in FOXO3 protein levels are also crucial for longevity, offering new perspectives for therapeutic strategies targeting FOXO3.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Apoptosis", "FOXO3", "Inflammation", "Metabolism", "Oxidative stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Forkhead Box Protein O3", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Aging", "Apoptosis", "Inflammation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guoding", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Wu Lien-Teh Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Harbin 150081, China."}, {"First Name": "Monan", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Wu Lien-Teh Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Harbin 150081, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Wu Lien-Teh Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Harbin 150081, China."}, {"First Name": "Zaiyu", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Wu Lien-Teh Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Harbin 150081, China."}, {"First Name": "Yagan", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Wu Lien-Teh Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Harbin 150081, China."}, {"First Name": "Wuqi", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Wu Lien-Teh Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Harbin 150081, China."}, {"First Name": "Hailiang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Wu Lien-Teh Institute, Department of Microbiology, Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Immunity and Infection, Harbin 150081, China.

In order to understand its volatile oil compositions and flavor characteristics, and to explore the flavor difference between Z. motuoense and the common Chinese prickly ash sold in the market, we analyzed the essential oils of Z. motuoense pericarp (MEO) using HS-SPME/GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS coupled with multivariate data and flavoromics analyses. The common commercial Chinese prickly ash in Asia, Zanthoxylum bungeanum (BEO), was used as a reference. A total of 212 aroma compounds from the 2 species were identified, among which alcohols, terpenoids, esters, aldehydes, and ketones were the major compounds. The predominant components detected from MEO were citronellal, (+)-citronellal, and \u03b2-phellandrene. Six components-citronellal, (E,Z)-3,6-nonadien-1-ol, allyl methallyl ether, isopulegol, 3,7-dimethyl-6-octen-1-ol acetate, and 3,7-dimethyl-(R)-6-octen-1-ol-could be used as the potential biomarkers of MEO. The flavoromics analysis showed that MEO and BEO were significantly different in aroma note types. Furthermore, the content differences of several numb taste components in two kinds of prickly ash were quantitatively analyzed using RP-HPLC. The antimicrobial activities of MEO and BEO against four bacterial strains and nine plant pathogenic fungi were determined in vitro. The results indicated that MEO had significantly higher inhibitory activities against most microbial strains than BEO.

Here, we found that the oncoprotein Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) acts as a potential driver for tumor growth in TNBC and, surprisingly, through a proteomic screen, we identified USP7 as a major regulator of FOXM1 in TNBC cells. USP7 interacts with FOXM1 both in vitro and in vivo. USP7 stabilizes FOXM1 through deubiquitination. Conversely, RNAi-mediated USP7 knockdown in TNBC cells, dramatically reduced the levels of FOXM1. Moreover, based upon the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology, we generated PU7-1 (protein degrader for USP7-1), as a USP7 specific degrader. PU7-1 induces rapid USP7 degradation at low nanomolar concentrations in cells but shows no obvious effect on other USP family proteins. Strikingly, the treatment of TNBC cells with PU7-1 significantly abrogates FOXM1 functions and effectively suppresses cell growth in vitro. By using xenograft mouse models, we found that PU7-1 markedly represses tumor growth in vivo. Notably, ectopic overexpression of FOXM1 can reverse the tumor growth suppressive effects induced by PU7-1, underscored the specific effect on FOXM1 induced by USP7 inactivation. Together, our findings indicate that FOXM1 is a major target of USP7 in modulating tumor growth in a p53-independent manner and reveals the USP7 degrader as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Animals", "Mice", "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Proteomics", "Forkhead Box Protein M1", "Cell Proliferation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jingjie", "Last Name": "Yi", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences, Oncological Sciences and Neuroscience, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianping", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences, Oncological Sciences and Neuroscience, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences, Oncological Sciences and Neuroscience, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "H Umit", "Last Name": "Kaniskan", "Affiliation": "Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences, Oncological Sciences and Neuroscience, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences, Oncological Sciences and Neuroscience, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA. wg8@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Cell death and differentiation", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37288643", "Title": "[Research on Life Cycle Management of Medical Consumables Based on Hospital Resource Planning System].", "Abstract": "In order to improve the compatibility of the hospital resource planning (HRP) system for the whole life cycle of medical consumables, and to improve the management and control capabilities of hospital institutions on medical consumables.", "Keywords": ["artificial intelligence", "life cycle management", "machine learning", "the hospital resource planning"], "MeSH terms": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Hospitals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200030."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200030."}], "Journal": "Zhongguo yi liao qi xie za zhi = Chinese journal of medical instrumentation", "PubDate": "2023May30"}, {"PMID": "37283621", "Title": "Serum Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Level After an Oral Fat Tolerance Test is Related to Postprandial Free Fatty Acid Level.", "Abstract": "The relationship between blood lipids and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 in the postprandial period remains unclear.

There are two major surveillance mechanisms to suppress ferroptosis: one mediated by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) that catalyzes the reduction of phospholipid peroxides and the other mediated by enzymes, such as FSP1, that produce metabolites with free radical-trapping antioxidant activity. In this study, through a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen, followed by mechanistic investigation, we identified phospholipid-modifying enzymes MBOAT1 and MBOAT2 as ferroptosis suppressors.

Refractive status, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and macular thickness were measured. A total of 204 children were enrolled. In group 1, myopic shift was not noted, but poorer best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and shorter axial length were observed. Significantly lower peripapillary RNFL thickness in the average total and superior quadrant, higher central subfield thickness, lower parafoveal retinal thickness in average total, superior, and nasal and temporal quadrants were observed in group 1 than in the other groups. The poor BCVA in patients with ROP was correlated with the lower RNFL thickness in the superior quadrant.\u00a0 \u00a0Conclusion: Children with a history of type 1 ROP treated with ranibizumab did not show a myopic shift but did show abnormal retinal morphology and the poorest BCVA among all groups.

In this study, 46 USP genes were identified from Populus trichocarpa (PtrUSPs), and their biological characteristics were comprehensively analyzed based on phylogeny, physicochemical properties of proteins, and gene structures. The promoter regions of PtrUSPs contain a variety of cis-acting elements related to hormone and stress response. The results of a collinearity analysis showed that PtsrUSPs were highly conserved with homologous genes from four other representative species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Eucalyptus grandis, Glycine max, and Solanum lycopersicum).

In a proteomic screen, we identified BACH1 as a cellular factor that recognizes the p53 DNA-binding domain depending on its mutation status. BACH1 strongly interacts with p53R175H but fails to effectively bind wild-type p53 or other hotspot mutants in vivo for functional regulation. Notably, p53R175H acts as a repressor for ferroptosis by abrogating BACH1-mediated downregulation of SLC7A11 to enhance tumor growth; conversely, p53R175H promotes BACH1-dependent tumor metastasis by upregulating expression of pro-metastatic targets. Mechanistically, p53R175H-mediated bidirectional regulation of BACH1 function is dependent on its ability to recruit the histone demethylase LSD2 to target promoters and differentially modulate transcription.

Here, we showed that expression of the N-terminal fragment containing the expanded polyglutamine (HTTQ94) of mHTT is able to promote both the ACSL4-dependent and the ACSL4-independent ferroptosis. Surprisingly, inactivation of the ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis fails to show any effect on the life span of Huntington's disease mice. Moreover, by using RNAi-mediated screening, we identified ALOX5 as a major factor required for the ACSL4-independent ferroptosis induced by HTTQ94. Although ALOX5 is not required for the ferroptotic responses triggered by common ferroptosis inducers such as erastin, loss of ALOX5 expression abolishes HTTQ94-mediated ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Interestingly, ALOX5 is also required for HTTQ94-mediated ferroptosis in neuronal cells upon high levels of glutamate. Mechanistically, HTTQ94 activates ALOX5-mediated ferroptosis by stabilizing FLAP, an essential cofactor of ALOX5-mediated lipoxygenase activity. Notably, inactivation of the Alox5 gene abrogates the ferroptosis activity in the striatal neurons from the HD mice; more importantly, loss of ALOX5 significantly ameliorates the pathological phenotypes and extends the life spans of these HD mice.

Leak tracking is one of the key problems for anti-screenshot digital watermarking of archival images. Most of the existing algorithms suffer from low detection rate of watermark, because the archival images have a single texture. In this paper, we propose an anti-screenshot watermarking algorithm for archival images based on Deep Learning Model (DLM). At present, screenshot image watermarking algorithms based on DLM can resist screenshot attacks. However, if these algorithms are applied on archival images, the bit error rate (BER) of the image watermark will increase dramatically. Archival images are ubiquitous, so in order to improve the robustness of archival image anti-screenshot, we propose a screenshot DLM \"ScreenNet\". It aims to enhance the background and enrich the texture with style transfer. Firstly, a preprocessing process based on style transfer is added before the insertion of an archival image into the encoder to reduce the influence of the screenshot process of the cover image. Secondly, the ripped images are usually moir\u00e9d, so we generate a database of ripped archival images with moir\u00e9d by means of moir\u00e9d networks. Finally, the watermark information is encoded/decoded through the improved ScreenNet model using the ripped archive database as the noise layer. The experiments prove that the proposed algorithm is able to resist anti-screenshot attacks and achieves the ability to detect watermark information to leak the trace of ripped images.", "Keywords":

Heart Failure.", "Abstract": "Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) has been shown to contribute to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. At this point, there are no proven treatments for CMD. We have shown that histone acetylation may play a critical role in the regulation of CMD. By using a mouse model that replaces lysine with arginine at residues K98/117/161/162R of p53 (p534KR), preventing acetylation at these sites, we test the hypothesis that acetylation-deficient p534KR could improve coronary microvascular dysfunction and prevent the progression of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Wild-type (WT) and p534KR mice were subjected to pressure overload (PO) by transverse aortic constriction to induce cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). Echocardiography measurements revealed improved cardiac function together with reduction of apoptosis and fibrosis in p534KR mice. Importantly, myocardial capillary density and coronary flow reserve (CFR) were significantly improved in p534KR mice. Moreover, p534KR upregulated the expression of cardiac glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters, as well as the level of fructose-2,6-biphosphate; increased PFK-1 activity; and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy. These changes were accompanied by increased expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and proangiogenic growth factors. Additionally, the levels of SERCA-2 were significantly upregulated in sham p534KR mice as well as in p534KR mice after TAC. In vitro, p534KR significantly improved endothelial cell (EC) glycolytic function and mitochondrial respiration, and enhanced EC proliferation and angiogenesis. Similarly, acetylation-deficient p534KR significantly improved CFR and rescued cardiac dysfunction in SIRT3 KO mice. Our data reveal the importance of p53 acetylation in coronary microvascular function, cardiac function, and remodeling, and may provide a promising approach to improve hypertension-induced coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) and to prevent the transition of cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure.", "Keywords": ["CFR", "angiogenesis", "cardiac remodeling", "heart failure", "p53 acetylation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaochen", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, School of Medicine, Jackson, MS, 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aubrey C", "Last Name": "Cantrell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, School of Medicine, Jackson, MS, 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Quinesha A", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, School of Medicine, Jackson, MS, 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University, Institute for Cancer Genetics, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yingjie", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biophysics, University of Mississippi Medical Center, School of Medicine, Jackson, MS, 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian-Xiong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, School of Medicine, Jackson, MS, 39216, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heng", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, School of Medicine, Jackson, MS, 39216, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Feb09"}, {"PMID": "36775286", "Title": "Association of serum NOD-like receptor protein 3 levels with impaired fat tolerance and hypertriglyceridemia.", "Abstract": "The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a key role in lipid metabolism. We used an oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) to detect whether serum NLRP3 levels differed in people with different fat tolerances and evaluate whether NLRP3 was associated with impaired fat tolerance (IFT) and hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). We performed the OFTT using 176 volunteers. The groups were divided according to fasting and postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels: 1) normal fat tolerance (NFT) group (TG at 0 h <1.7 mmol/L and TG at any time point <2.5 mmol/L); 2) IFT group (TG at 0 h <1.7 mmol/L and TG at any time point >2.5 mmol/L); and 3) HTG group (TG at 0 h \u22651.7 mmol/L). With decreased lipid tolerance, the TG and NLRP3 levels increased gradually before a high-fat meal and at any time point after 0 h. NLRP3 levels reached a peak 2 h after meal consumption in all three groups. After adjustment for confounding indicators, logistic regression analysis revealed that fasting serum NLRP3 levels were positively associated with both IFT and HTG (for IFT, odds ratio [OR]: 1.079 [1.037-1.123], p < 0.001; for HTG, OR: 1.085 [1.049-1.123], p < 0.001).

This review aims to summarize epidemiological studies related to the effects of Tai Chi on symptom remission in older adults with MCI and reveal the potential mechanisms. Evidence suggested that Tai Chi can improve cognitive functions and alleviate the accompanying symptoms of MCI in the elderly potentially by activating the expression of signals in different brain regions, altering their connectivity, increasing the brain volume, and modulating brain-derived neurotropic and inflammation factors.

The conversion of methionine to cysteine is well known to protect tumour cells from ferroptosis upon cysteine starvation through transamination. However, whether amino acids-produced metabolites participate in ferroptosis independent of the cysteine pathway is largely unknown. Here, the authors show that the tryptophan metabolites serotonin (5-HT) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HA) remarkably facilitate tumour cells to escape from ferroptosis distinct from cysteine-mediated ferroptosis inhibition. Mechanistically, both 5-HT and 3-HA act as potent radical trapping antioxidants (RTA) to eliminate lipid peroxidation, thereby inhibiting ferroptotic cell death. Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) markedly abrogates the protective effect of 5-HT via degrading 5-HT. Deficiency of MAOA renders cancer cells resistant to ferroptosis upon 5-HT treatment.

In this study, Drosophila melanogaster (F0) was cultured in the medium containing cadmium (Cd, 4.5\u00a0mg/kg) from eggs to adults, and offspring (F1-F4) were continuously kept in standard medium (without cadmium). The phenotype analysis showed that cadmium induced developmental defects on wings and apoptosis in the wing disc cells of Drosophila (F0). The wing defects were transmitted for at least four generations even without Cd afterwards. And the effect on the mRNA expression of wing development related genes (shg, omb, F-actin, Mekk1) can be maintained for at least two or three generations. More importantly, under cadmium stress, the post-translational modification (PTM) on the histones H3K4me3 in the third instar larvae and ovaries or testes of adult flies increased significantly, while the levels of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 decreased significantly. The expression of histone methylation related genes (dSet-1, ash1, Lsd1) increased significantly and these changes can be transmitted to offspring from one or two generations in ovaries or testes. These results suggest that the phenotypic defects of wings caused by cadmium can be inherited to the offspring, and this transgenerational inheritance effect may be related to the epigenetic regulation of histone methylation.

Matrix viscoelasticity prompts symmetry breaking of the spheroid, leading to the formation of invading finger-like protrusions, YAP nuclear translocation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition both in vitro and in vivo in a Arp2/3-complex-dependent manner. Computational modelling of these observations allows us to establish a phase diagram relating morphological stability with matrix viscoelasticity, tissue viscosity, cell motility and cell division rate, which is experimentally validated by biochemical assays and in vitro experiments with an intestinal organoid.

Meanwhile, one batch of tablets and one batch of capsules (batch numbers ZKC1816 and 202101001) were selected to conduct the overall animal pharmacodynamic experiment to verify the feasibility of drug effect evaluation with cell index as an indicator. The best fitting model of dissolution curves of each batch of CDTs and CDCs is the Weibull model. There was a good correlation (r\u2009>\u20090.86) between the dissolution-absorption-pharmacodynamic curve. Based on RTCA technology, we have established the comprehensive evaluation method for cell biology of compound Danshen solid preparations in line with the overall concept of TCM and a synchronous evaluation system of dissolution and absorption in vitro of new TCM compound solid preparations.", "Keywords": ["DDASS", "RTCA", "compound Danshen tablets and capsules", "consistency evaluation", "dissolution and absorption"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Salvia miltiorrhiza", "Capsules", "Solubility", "Tablets", "Drugs, Chinese Herbal", "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lixia", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Yimeng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinhuo", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhaogang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tulin", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Guojun", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Development and Application of External Drugs in TCM, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China. yanguojun@njucm.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "AAPS PharmSciTech", "PubDate": "2022Oct31"}, {"PMID": "36305747", "Title": "Epigenome Programming by H3.3K27M Mutation Creates a Dependence of Pediatric Glioma on SMARCA4.", "Abstract": "Patients with diffuse midline gliomas that are H3K27 altered (DMG) display a dismal prognosis.

SMARCA4 colocalizes with SOX10 at gene regulatory elements to control the expression of genes involved in cell growth and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, SMARCA4 chromatin binding is reduced upon depletion of SOX10 or H3.3K27M, a mutation occurring in about 60% DMG tumors.

bacteria and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 for its success in gene editing. Molecular diagnostics is highly valued globally for its development as a new generation of diagnostic technology. An increasing number of studies have shown that CRISPR/Cas technology can be integrated with biosensors and bioassays for molecular diagnostics. CRISPR-based detection has attracted much attention as highly specific and sensitive sensors with easily programmable and device-independent capabilities. The nucleic acid-based detection approach is one of the most sensitive and specific diagnostic methods. With further research, it holds promise for detecting other biomarkers such as small molecules and proteins. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the prospects of CRISPR technology in biosensing and summarize its application strategies in molecular diagnostics.

Two processed products of Curcuma aromatica Salisb. [Zingiberaceae] (CAS) are traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that have long been used to treat gynecological blood stasis syndrome such as primary dysmenorrhea. The mechanisms and active substances of CAS are still largely unknown. The study aimed to establish a rat model of primary dysmenorrhea which investigates the differences between the pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of raw CAS (RCAS) and vinegar-processed CAS (VCAS). Histopathology, cytokinetics, and metabolomics were adopted to evaluate the anti-blood stasis effect of RCAS and VCAS. In metabolomics, endogenous differential metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces are the essential steps to evaluate the effect of RCAS and VCAS. In this study, the rat model of primary dysmenorrhea was successfully established. After RCAS and VCAS intervention, the uterine tissue morphology of dysmenorrhea model rats was improved, and gland hypertrophy and myometrial hyperplasia were reduced as well as neutrophil content. Compared with the RCAS group, the VCAS group had better uterine morphology, few inflammatory factors, and significantly improved amino acid and lipid metabolism. The aforementioned results support the conclusion that VCAS performed better than RCAS in primary dysmenorrhea and that vinegar processing increases the efficacy of CAS.", "Keywords": ["Curcuma aromatica Salisb.

Previous studies have indicated the antiapoptotic, antioxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory effects of naringin. It can improve many common diseases, including fibrosis or hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Acetaminophen (APAP) is a frequently used painkiller, and hepatotoxic side effects limit its use. The purpose of the current examination is to find the impact of naringin on APAP-induced hepatic injury. Firstly, we pretreated mice model groups with naringin. Then, the liver injury model was established by injecting intraperitoneally into mice with APAP. After the mice were euthanized, we obtained serum and liver tissue samples from the mice. Finally, these samples were analyzed using a metabolomics approach to find the underlying mechanism of the effects of naringin on APAP-induced liver injury and provide a new treatment strategy for APAP-induced liver injury. Our data indicate that naringin significantly improves APAP-induced liver injury in mice and reduces the expression levels of liver injury markers in a dose-dependent manner.

Traditionally, metabolic control analysis is applied to differential equation-based models to investigate the sensitivity of predictions to parameters. A corresponding theory for constraint-based models is lacking, due to their formulation as optimization problems. Here, we show that optimal solutions of optimization problems can be efficiently differentiated using constrained optimization duality and implicit differentiation. We use this to calculate the sensitivities of predicted reaction fluxes and enzyme concentrations to turnover numbers in an enzyme-constrained metabolic model of Escherichia coli. The sensitivities quantitatively identify rate limiting enzymes and are mathematically precise, unlike current finite difference based approaches used for sensitivity analysis. Further, efficient differentiation of constraint-based models unlocks the ability to use gradient information for parameter estimation. We demonstrate this by improving, genome-wide, the state-of-the-art turnover number estimates for E. coli. Finally, we show that this technique can be generalized to arbitrarily complex models. By differentiating the optimal solution of a model incorporating both thermodynamic and kinetic rate equations, the effect of metabolite concentrations on biomass growth can be elucidated. We benchmark these metabolite sensitivities against a large experimental gene knockdown study, and find good alignment between the predicted sensitivities and in vivo metabolome changes. In sum, we demonstrate several applications of differentiating optimal solutions of constraint-based metabolic models, and show how it connects to classic metabolic control analysis.", "Keywords": ["Constraint-based models", "Differentiation", "Enzyme constrained", "Flux balance analysis", "Metabolic control analysis", "Optimization"], "MeSH terms": ["Kinetics", "Escherichia coli", "Models, Biological", "Thermodynamics", "Metabolome", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "St Elmo", "Last Name": "Wilken", "Affiliation": "Institute of Quantitative and Theoretical Biology, Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 1, 40225, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany; Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences, Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 1, 40225, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble sterol derivative that not only participates in calcium and phosphorus metabolism but also acts as an immunomodulatory role by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors to regulate the expression of transcription factors. Increasing evidence has shown that vitamin D has immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory effects, and it may play a role in T cell regulatory responses due to downregulation in the expression of cathepsin G and inhibition of CD4+ T cell activation and protection of \u03b2 cells from immune attack and is beneficial in decreasing oxidative stress in T1DM patients. Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates involvement of vitamin D deficiency in T1DM pathogenesis, with the immune system improperly targeting and destroying its own islet \u03b2 cells.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of salt stress on the physiology, morphology, phenolic acid accumulation, and expression of genes involved in phenolic acid biosynthesis in T. officinale. We found that plants grew well at 1\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1 NaCl, and the state of photosystem \u2161 (PS\u2161) and the organization of the chloroplasts at 0.5\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1 NaCl showed no significant differences compared with the control.

At 4\u00a0g\u00a0kg-1 NaCl, the fresh and dry weights decreased to 28% and 42% of the control, while chlorosis and necrosis were observed on the leaves.

The results of qPCR showed that EsVAMP was expressed highly in hemocytes and nerves, followed by gills, intestines and hepatopancreas, and lowly expressed in heart and muscles. EsVAMP in hemocytes was up-regulated after S. eriocheiris infection. After EsVAMP over-expression and S. eriocheiris infection, the RAW264.7\u00a0cell morphology and cell viability of the experiment group were significantly better than the control group.

When water temperature exceeds its optimal range of 12-18\u00a0\u00b0C, the immune system of rainbow trout becomes weakened and unbalanced. High temperature in summer and global warming severely impact rainbow trout industry. The focus of this study was to explore the mechanisms regulating the immune response of rainbow trout under high temperature stress and identify molecular elements that account for resistance to high temperature. In this study, individual fish were screened in a high temperature stress experiment and divided into resistant (R) and sensitive (S) groups. The hepatic transcriptome sequencing and analysis of mRNAs and microRNAs of the R, S, and control groups showed that the number of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the S group (9259) was higher than that in the R group (5313). Furthermore, the 1233 genes differentially expressed between S and R groups were mainly enriched in immune-related pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signaling and IL-17 signaling. Among these DEGs were miR-301b-5p and its target gene that encodes nuclear factor of activated T cells two interacting protein (nfatc2ip). The dual-luciferase reporter system and immunofluorescence experiments verified the relationship between miR-301b-5p and nfatc2ip. We also showed that expression levels of miR-301b-5p and nfatc2ip significantly negatively correlated in the liver of rainbow trout under high temperature stress. By performing functional experiments, we showed that activation of miR-301b-5p expression or inhibition of nfatc2ip expression stimulated the phosphorylation of p65, p38, and JNK in the classical nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways under high temperature stress. These manipulations initially promoted the secretion of the pro-inflammatory factor IL-1\u03b2 and then increased the levels of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1. In addition, activation of miR-301b-5p expression or inhibition of nfatc2ip expression stimulated the repair of the hepatic ultrastructural damage caused by high temperature stress by activating the inflammatory response in rainbow trout liver.", "Keywords": ["High temperature stress", "Inflammatory response", "MAPK", "NF-\u03baB", "miR-301b-5p", "nfatc2ip"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Liver", "MicroRNAs", "Oncorhynchus mykiss", "Temperature", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tianqing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Enhui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Bingqian", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Gaochao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Fulin", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Fuyuan", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Yantai Jinghai Marine Fishery Co Ltd, Yantai, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Wenlong", "Last Name": "Jiao", "Affiliation": "Gansu Fisheries Research Institute, Lanzhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yanchun", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Xiance", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Hangzhou Qiandaohu Xun Long Sci-tech CO., LTD, Hangzhou, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Shanwei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Food Science and Technology, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Gefeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Cold Water Fish Industry Technology Innovation Strategic Alliance, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, PR China.

Therefore, it is particularly important to develop preventive means for antigen-unrelated types of influenza viruses. Recent studies have shown that probiotics can modulate the immune system and reduce the severity of viral infections. In this study, we investigated the potential of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 0111 against influenza virus H9N2. Challenge experiments showed that L. plantarum 0111 pretreatments could effectively improve mice's survival rate and weight loss and reduce the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) along with the degree of lung and intestinal injury. FMT experiment demonstrates that the protective effect produced by L. plantarum 0111 is associated with gut microorganisms. In addition, 16S high-throughput sequencing of the mouse intestinal microbiota showed that L. plantarum 0111 remodeled the intestinal microbiota after H9N2 infection and maintained the gut microbiota balance. In a mouse model, the oral administration of L. plantarum 0111 increased IFN-\u03b2 expression in the serum and BALF. At the same time, the transcript levels of IFN-\u03b2 and related ISGs in the intestine and lungs of mice were also increased. In addition, the activation and polarization of T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and the spleen were detected by flow cytometry, and the results showed that L. plantarum 0111 modulated cytokines in T cells and increased IgA expression in B cells in the MLNs and spleen. Thus, L. plantarum 0111 may improve gut microbiota-mediated immune responses and thus, resist infection by the influenza virus, and it could be used as an effective preventive measure against the

The simultaneous quantification of sEVs was realized by recording the increase in fluorescence upon nucleic acid cleavage, and a detection limit as low as 54 particles/\u03bcL was achieved. The whole analytical procedure could be completed in 1.5 h without the assistance of ultracentrifugation. Efficient enrichment and accurate quantification of sEVs are enabled through the proposed approach, broadening the potentials of sEVs in biological science, biomedical engineering, and personalized medicine.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Extracellular Vesicles", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Ultracentrifugation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xingle", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Center of Smart Laboratory and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, P.R.

Preeclampsia is a kind of pregnancy-induced hypertension caused by complex factors. The disease's pathophysiology, however, remains unknown. The focus of this research is to utilize WGCNA to identify susceptible modules and genes in the peripheral blood of preeclampsia patients. Obtain the whole gene expression data of GSE48424 preeclampsia patients and normal pregnant women from NCBI's GEO database. WGCNA is used to construct a gene co-expression network by calculating correlation coefficients between modules and phenotypic traits, screening important modules, and filtering central genes. To identify hub genes, we performed functional enrichment analysis, pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction on key genes in critical modules. Then, the genetic data file GSE149437 and clinical peripheral blood samples were used as a validation cohort to determine the diagnostic value of these key genes. Nine gene co-expression modules were constructed through WGCNA analysis. Among them, the blue module is significantly related to preeclampsia and is related to its clinical severity. Thirty genes have been discovered by using the intersection of the genes in the blue module and the DEGs genes as the hub genes. It was found that HDC, MS4A2, and SLC18A2 scored higher in the PPI network and were identified as hub genes. These three genes were also differentially expressed in peripheral blood validation samples. Based on the above three genes, we established the prediction model of peripheral blood markers of preeclampsia and drew the nomogram and calibration curve. The ROC curves were used in the training cohort GSE48424 and the validation cohort GSE149437 to verify the predictive value of the above model. Finally, it was confirmed in the collected clinical peripheral blood samples that MS4A2 was differentially expressed in the peripheral blood of early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia, which is of great significance.

This study aimed to explore the effect of wearing masks on exercise ability and ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT).

The subjects were randomized to perform 2 cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) on a cycle ergometer with gas exchange analysis, one with and another without wearing a face mask (cross-over design). The general data for all subjects and indicators from the 2 exercise tests performed with and without wearing a face mask were collected. RESULTS In cardiopulmonary exercise tests, wearing a mask significantly (P<0.05) decreased peak indexes (eg, work rate (WR), oxygen consumption per kg body weight (VO\u2082/kg), heart rate (HR), ventilation per minute (VE) and carbon dioxide ventilation equivalent (VE/VCO\u2082)) and anaerobic threshold indexes (eg, WR, HR, VE, breath frequency (BF), dead space ratio (VD/VT), and VE/VCO\u2082). However, the PETCO\u2082 at peak was significantly higher. There was a positive linear correlation between WR difference and VO\u2082 difference at VAT (abbreviated as deltaWR@VAT and deltaVO\u2082@VAT, respectively) (r=0.495, P=0.003). Subgroup analysis of the VAT indexes showed that WR, VO\u2082/kg, and VE were significantly decreased in the advanced VAT group with mask compared with the stable VAT group with mask (P<0.05). Logistic regression showed that deltaVE, deltaBF, and deltaVE/VCO\u2082 had independent influences on VAT. CONCLUSIONS Wearing masks advances VAT in healthy young subjects during CPET.

Further analysis showed that patients with ACAN truncating variants had shorter height standard deviation scores (p = 0.0001) and larger bone age-chronological age values (p = 0.0464). Moreover, patients in this Asian population had a smaller mean bone age-chronological age value than those that have been determined in European and American populations (p = 0.0033). Conclusion: Our data suggest that ACAN mutation is a common cause of short stature in China, especially among patients with a family history of short stature but also among those who were born short for their gestational age without a family history. Patients with truncating variants were shorter in height and had more obvious advanced bone age, and the proportion of patients with advanced bone age was lower in this Asian population than in Europe and America.", "Keywords": ["ACAN gene", "genetic analysis", "genotypes and phenotypes", "short stature", "variants"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Su", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Chunli", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Department of Child Health Care, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ziyang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Qianqi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Child Health Care, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyan", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "School of Pediatrics, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Bixia", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhanjun", "Last Name": "Jia", "Affiliation": "Nanjing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaonan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Child Health Care, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in genetics", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35604179", "Title": "Exploring the clinical efficacy of a self-made acne prescription based on high-throughput sequencing.", "Abstract": "We used high-throughput sequencing on skin microbial flora to assess the effectiveness of an acne prescription to formulate evidence for clinical decision-making.", "Keywords": ["acne", "high-throughput sequencing", "microorganism", "traditional Chinese medicine decoction"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Acne Vulgaris", "Bacteria", "Skin", "Treatment Outcome", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liangyi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingdong", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Cosmetology, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital 2nd Affiliated Hospital, Shenyang, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoqing", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoqing", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of cosmetic dermatology", "PubDate": "2022Nov"}, {"PMID": "35595012", "Title": "Selection of data sets for FAIRification in drug discovery and development: Which, why, and how?", "Abstract": "Despite the intuitive value of adopting the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles in both academic and industrial sectors, challenges exist in resourcing, balancing long- versus short-term priorities, and achieving technical implementation.

In this study, we established a mouse model of subarachnoid hemorrhage using the endovascular perforation method and exposed the mice to intermittent hypoxia for 8 hours daily for 2 consecutive days to simulate sleep apnea. We found that sleep apnea aggravated brain edema, increased hippocampal neuron apoptosis, and worsened neurological function in this mouse model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Then, we established an in vitro HT-22 cell model of hemin-induced subarachnoid hemorrhage/intermittent hypoxia and found that the cells died, and lactate dehydrogenase release increased, after 48 hours.

Among a number of regulatory modes, acetylation of p53 attracts great interests. p53 was one of the first non-histone proteins found to be functionally regulated by acetylation and deacetylation, and subsequent work has established that reversible acetylation is a general mechanism for regulation of non-histone proteins. Unlike other types of posttranslational modifications occurred during stress responses, the role of p53 acetylation has been recently validated in vivo by using the knock-in mice with both acetylation-defective and acetylation-mimicking p53 mutants. Here, we review the role of acetylation in p53-mediated activities, with a focus on which specific acetylation sites are critical for p53-dependent transcription regulation during tumor suppression and how acetylation of p53 recruits specific \"readers\" to execute its promoter-specific regulation of different targets. We also discuss the role of p53 acetylation in differentially regulating its classic activities in cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis as well as newly identified unconventional functions such as cell metabolism and ferroptosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Humans", "Mice", "Neoplasms", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhangchuan", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alyssa P", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Omid", "Last Name": "Tavana", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA. wg8@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Oncogene", "PubDate": "2022May"}, {"PMID": "35477177", "Title": "Inhibition of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Prolyl-Hydroxylase Modulates Platelet Function.", "Abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) involves in redox reactions. Considering the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in platelet function, whether it regulates platelet function remains unclear. Using an inhibitor of HIF prolyl-hydroxylase, IOX-2, we intend to investigate its effect on platelet function. Human platelets were treated with IOX-2 (0, 10, 25, and 50 \u03bcM) followed by analysis of platelet aggregation, granule secretion, receptor expression, platelet spreading, or clot retraction. Additionally, IOX-2 (10\u2009mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into mice to measure tail bleeding time and arterial thrombosis. IOX-2 significantly inhibited collagen-related peptide (CRP; 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL) or thrombin (0.03 U/mL)-induced platelet aggregation and ATP release dose dependently without affecting P-selectin expression and the surface levels of glycoprotein (GP)Ib\u03b1, GPVI, or \u03b1IIb\u03b23. In addition, IOX-2-treated platelets presented significantly decreased spreading on fibrinogen or collagen and clot retraction. Moreover, IOX-2 administration into mice significantly impaired the in vivo hemostatic function of platelets and arterial thrombus formation without affecting the number of circulating platelets and coagulation factors (FVIII and FIX). Further, IOX-2 significantly upregulated HIF-1\u03b1 in platelets, decreased ROS generation, and downregulated NOX1 expression. Finally, IOX-2 increased the phosphorylation level of VASP (Ser157/239), and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), AKT (Thr308/Ser473), and PKC\u03b4 (Thr505) in CRP- or thrombin-stimulated platelets. In conclusion, inhibition of HIF prolyl-hydroxylase modulates platelet function and arterial thrombus formation, possibly through upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 expression and subsequent inhibition of ROS generation, indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 might be a novel target for the treatment of thrombotic disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Blood Platelets", "Collagen", "Fibrinogen", "Hemostatics", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Mice", "P-Selectin", "Platelet Activation", "Platelet Aggregation", "Prolyl Hydroxylases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Thrombin", "Thrombosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaqian", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Sixuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yangyang", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlin", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China."}], "Journal": "Thrombosis and haemostasis", "PubDate": "2022Oct"}, {"PMID": "35464758", "Title": "Novel piRNA Regulates PIWIL1 to Modulate the Behavior of Placental Trophoblast Cells and Participates in Preeclampsia.", "Abstract": "This study is aimed at investigating the role of PIWIL1/piRNA in the development of preeclampsia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Apoptosis", "Argonaute Proteins", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Female", "Humans", "Placenta", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "RNA, Small Interfering", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Trophoblasts"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 910 Hengshan Road, Shanghai 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Ye", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 910 Hengshan Road, Shanghai 200030, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 910 Hengshan Road, Shanghai 200030, China."}], "Journal": "Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35463469", "Title": "Rapid establishment of human colonic organoid knockout lines.", "Abstract": "Human colonic organoids derived from biopsy or autopsy tissues are a vital tool to study mucosal homeostasis, model colonic diseases, and develop therapeutics.

High expressions of chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 are reported in infected porcine lungs. Since CXCR3 is a key player in host inflammatory response, it might be a therapeutic target to treat lung damage caused by PRRSV infection. The size of pigs has long hampered research into molecular mechanisms of PRRS and validating the potential pharmaceutical targets. In this study, a porcine lung xenograft model with PRRSV infection was generated in immunodeficient mice to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 on PRRSV infection-induced lung injury. The porcine lung tissues developed normally two weeks after xeno-transplantation in the mouse kidney capsule. Infection of PRRSV resulted in its efficient replication in the xenografts and histological damage to the porcine lung tissue structure, with no or little effects on mouse lungs. AMG487 administration dramatically reduced the number of PRRSV genome copies and significantly alleviated the porcine lung injury. Furthermore, treatment of AMG487 in cultured porcine macrophages consistently suppressed PRRSV replication with significant downregulation of Annexin A2 (ANXA2), a cellular protein facilitating viral replication.

Sanguisorbae Radix (SR), a well-known herbal medicine in China, has extensive therapeutic functions, while charred SR is known as an additional product obtained from SR after CSF. In this study, mass spectrometry was used to investigate the effect of charring on tannins transformation of SR. The findings showed that the content level of tannins in SR decreased significantly after carbonizing process, while their three categories, gallotannins, ellagitannins, and procyanidins, had downward trends in general. Moreover, CSF also induced the polyphenol in SR to release relevant monomers from its origins. Significant amount of hydrolyzable tannins were detected by mass spectrometry, including gallotannins and ellagitannins, suggesting that hydrolysis during CSF yielded gallic and ellagic acid and their derivatives, in addition to sugar moieties. Subsequently, gallic and ellagic acid can further polymerize to form sanguisorbic acid dilactone. The amount of proanthocyanidins, the oligomers of catechin, including procyanidin, procyanidin C2, procyanidin B3, and 3-O-galloylprocyanidin B3, decreased to form catechin and its derivatives, which may further degrade to protocatechualdehyde. Quantitative analysis illustrated that the amount of gallic, pyrogallic, and ellagic acid and methyl gallate, the essential effectors in SR, significantly increased after CSF, with increased ratios of 1.36, 4.28, 10.33, and 4.79, respectively. In contrast, the contents of cathechin and epigallocatechin dropped remarkably with increased ratios of 0.04 and 0.02. Tannins exhibit moderate absorption, while their relevant monomers have a higher bioavailability. Therefore, CSF is proved here to be an effective technique to the release of active monomers from the original polyphenol precursor.

Amongst various contaminants, mercury is of special attention owing to their environmental persistence and biogeochemical recycling and ecological risks. Herein, a simple and highly parallel electrochemical biosensor for Hg determination was designed and investigated. The proposed biosensor was prepared and compared between (1) DTT/MB-DNA/Au with configuration occupation approach and (2) MCH/MB-DNA/Au with passivation approach. According to the combined results of scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) and Randles-Sevcik equation, the DTT modified electrode exhibited high uniformity on DNA distribution and superb stability on electron transfer in Hg2+ detection. Evidentially, the response value of proposed DTT/MB-DNA/Au was increased from 57.518% to 97.607%, while RSD% between duplicate runs had dropped from 22.658% to 0.223% (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Moreover, the increased proportion of effective working area was 467.380% compared with general sensors. Besides, DTT concentration, DNA concentration as well as assembly time were optimized, utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Square Wave Anode Stripping Voltammetry (SWASV). This optimized biosensor exhibited an excellent selectivity toward Hg2+ over Cu2+, As2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cr3+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ etc., and the stability of DTT/MB-DNA/Au were at least two times better even after 3 days under room temperature.

The lenok comparative transcriptome was analyzed by combining single molecule, real-time, and next generation sequencing (NGS) technology.

Compared with the mature group, 719 genes with significantly increased expression and 1,727 genes with significantly decreased expression in all five tissues were found in the immature group. Furthermore, DEGs and pathways involved in the endocrine system and gonadal development were identified, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were identified as potentially regulating gonadal development in lenok. Inhibiting the activity of p38 MAPKs resulted in abnormal levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol, and affected follicular development.

It seems that the bacteria can spontaneously evolve resistance against any antibiotic within a short time without the horizontal transfer of heterologous genes and before accumulating drug-resistant mutations. We have shown that the tRNA-mediated translational regulation counteracts the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacteria. In this study, we demonstrated that isolated and subcultured Escherichia coli elevated its tRNAs under antibiotic stress to rapidly provide antibiotic resistance, especially at the early stage, before upregulating the efflux pump and evolving resistance mutations. The DNA recombination system repaired the antibiotic-induced DNA breakage in the genome, causing numerous structural variations. These structural variations are overrepresented near the tRNA genes, which indicated the cause of tRNA up-regulation. Knocking out the recombination system abolished the up-regulation of tRNAs, and coincidently, they could hardly evolve antibiotic resistance in multiple antibiotics, respectively. With these results, we proposed a multi-stage model of bacterial antibiotic resistance in an isolated scenario: the early stage (recombination-tRNA up-regulation-translational regulation); the medium stage (up-regulation of efflux pump); the late stage (resistant mutations). These results also indicated that the bacterial DNA recombination system and tRNA could be targeted to retard the bacterial spontaneous drug resistance.", "Keywords": ["antibiotic resistance", "oxidative stress", "recombination", "tRNA", "translation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huiying", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Guandi", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yubin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingkai", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Yutong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinning", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuesong", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Gong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "35122885", "Title": "Thermlanseedlines A-G, seven thermopsine-based alkaloids with antiviral and insecticidal activities from the seeds of Thermopsis lanceolata R.

Among these unconventional activities, an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death, termed ferroptosis, attracts great interest. Unlike apoptotic cell death, activation of p53 alone is not sufficient to induce ferroptosis directly; instead, through its metabolic targets, p53 is able to modulate the ferroptosis response in the presence of ferroptosis inducers such as GPX4 inhibitors or high levels of ROS. Here, we review the role of ferroptosis in p53-mediated tumor suppression, with a focus on what cellular factors are critical for p53-dependent ferroptosis during tumor suppression and how p53 modulates both the canonical (GPX4-dependent) and the non-canonical (GPX4-independent) ferroptosis pathways.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which controls the turnover of focal adhesion to regulate cell adhesion and migration, plays a role in the resolution of inflammation. However, the coordinated involvement of ICAM-1 and FAK during endothelial inflammation has yet to be elucidated. This study reports that, as part of an inflammatory response, ICAM-1 controls FAK expression in endothelial cells via the microRNA miR-15b-5p. Induction of lung injury by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in higher levels of FAK expression in inflammatory tissues, while in ICAM-1 knockout mice, FAK expression was reduced in the lungs. FAK expression was also reduced in endothelial cells following ICAM-1 siRNA downregulation. Furthermore, ICAM-1 inhibited miR-15b-5p expression while increasing FAK mRNA and protein expression via binding of miR-15b-5p to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of FAK.

In this study, we showed that LYAR, a nucleolar protein, is expressed at a higher level in CRC tissue than in adjacent normal tissue and that LYAR expression is closely associated with distant CRC metastasis. LYAR not only significantly promotes the migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro, but knockdown (KD) of LYAR in CRC cells also inhibits xenograft tumor metastasis in vivo. Microarray analysis of LYAR KD cells combined with a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, gene reporter assay, and rescue experiment indicated that FSCN1 (encoding fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (Fascin-1)) serves as a novel key regulator of LYAR-promoted migration and invasion of CRC cells. Knockdown of FSCN1 significantly inhibits subcutaneous tumorigenesis of CRC cells and leads to the downregulation of FASN and SCD, genes encoding key enzymes in fatty acid synthesis.

However, the effects of OSA on AAA initiation in a murine model of sleep apnea have not been completely studied. In this paper, Apoe-/- C57BL/6 mice infused with angiotensin II (Ang II) were placed in chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) condition for inducing OSA-related AAA. CIH significantly promoted the incidence of AAA and inhibited the survival of mice. By performing ultrasonography and elastic Van Gieson staining, CIH was found to be effective in promoting aortic dilation and elastin degradation. Immunohistochemical and zymography results show that CIH upregulated the expression and activity of MMP2 and MMP9 and upregulated MCP1 expression while downregulating \u03b1-SMA expression. Also, CIH exposure promoted ROS generation, apoptosis, and mitochondria damage in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which were measured by ROS assay, TUNEL staining, and transmission electron microscopy. The result of RNA sequencing of mouse aortas displayed that 232 mRNAs were differently expressed between Ang II and Ang II+CIH groups, and CaMKII-dependent p38/Jnk was confirmed as one downstream signaling of CIH.

However, the residual avermectin has a serious impact on the growth and quality of aquatic animals including Eriocheir sinensis. This study shows that the LC50 of avermectin to E. sinensis for 24, 48, 72 and 96\u00a0h was 21.88, 13.40, 9.11 and 7.10\u00a0mg/L, respectively. After avermectin stress, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and phenol oxidase (PO) in the hepatopancreas of E. sinensis increased and reached the peak on the 6th day. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulated with the increase of exposure time and concentration of avermectin. After 15 days of avermectin exposure, hepatopancreas was damaged seriously. These results indicated that avermectin had toxicity to E. sinensis. In order to solve the pollution problem caused by residual avermectin, a degrading bacterium AVM-2 was separated from the sediment of E. sinensis breeding pond. The strain was confirmed to be Ochrobactrum sp by morphology observation, physiological and biochemical identification and 16\u00a0S rDNA sequences analysis. When the pH value was 7, the temperature was 30\u00a0\u2103, the concentration of substrate was low, the quantity of inoculation was high, Ochrobactrum sp. AVM-2 had better degradation effect on avermectin. When the addition of Ochrobactrum sp. AVM-2 was 2.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 CFU/L, the residual avermectin in muscle and hepatopancreatine significantly decreased, and the degradation rate was about 66%. In summary, Ochrobactrum sp.

This research is managed to investigate the pharmacodynamics material basis on removing blood stasis of EZhu by exploring the spectrum-effect relationship between UPLC-Q/TOF-MS fingerprints and pharmacologic actions. Hemorheology and related functional parameters were detected to evaluate the pharmacologic actions of EZhu. Relative content Changes of components in rat plasma were detected by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS. A compound-target-pathway network was built to predict the pharmacological activity of components in plasma. Then, bivariate correlation analysis (BCA) was used to explore the correlation degree between components in plasma and pharmacologic actions of EZhu. In UPLC-Q/TOF-MS fingerprints of rat plasma, 10 prototype components were identified. BCA results show that 8 components were concerned with the pharmacological activity for treating blood stasis syndrome (BSS) in varying degrees (R\u00a0>\u00a00.5, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Among them, zedoarofuran and curzerenone have shown correlation with more pharmacological indicators. The network predicted that 80 targets were closely related to 10 components, in which 48 targets were connected with 159 metabolic pathways including arachidonic acid metabolism, sphingolipid signaling pathway, and linoleic acid metabolism.

Here, we demonstrate the crucial role of Cullin 2 RING E3 ligase (CRL2)-KLHDC3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in regulating p14ARF protein stability. KLHDC3 acts as a CRL2 adaptor that specifically recognizes a C-terminal degron in p14ARF and triggers p14ARF for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.

However, it is largely unknown whether SNHG7 is involved in docetaxel resistance of LUAD. In the current study, we identified the high expression of SNHG7 in docetaxel-resistant cells. Through functional assays, we determined that silencing of SNHG7 decreased IC50 value of LUAD cells to docetaxel and suppressed proliferation and autophagy in LUAD cells, and reversed M2 polarization in macrophages. Mechanistically, we uncovered that SNHG7 promoted autophagy via recruiting human antigen R (HuR) to stabilize autophagy-related genes autophagy related 5 (ATG5) and autophagy related 12 (ATG12). Moreover, exosomal SNHG7 was transmitted from docetaxel-resistant LUAD cells to parental LUAD cells and thus facilitated docetaxel resistance. Additionally, exosomal SNHG7 activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway to promote M2 polarization in macrophages via recruiting cullin 4A (CUL4A) to induce ubiquitination and degradation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).

Upon binding the unacetylated DBD, Dicer is recruited to the promoters of p53 target genes, where it represses p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Conversely, knockdown or knockout of endogenous Dicer leads to up-regulation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation without increasing its protein levels. Moreover, Dicer-mediated repression is independent of its intrinsic endoribonuclease activity; instead, Dicer directly represses transcription by recruiting the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase. However, upon DNA damage, Dicer-mediated repression is abrogated by stress-induced acetylation at the DBD of p53. Notably, the inability of acetylation-defective p53-3KR in transcription is partially but significantly restored upon loss of Dicer expression.

Satb2 loss in adult mice leads to stable conversion of colonic stem cells into small intestine ileal-like stem cells and replacement of the colonic mucosa with one that resembles the ileum. Conversely, SATB2 confers colonic properties on the mouse ileum. Human colonic organoids also adopt ileal characteristics upon SATB2 loss.

The results showed that cadmium changed the larval body length and weight, prolonged the pupation and eclosion time, and changed the relative expression levels of development-related genes (baz, \u03b2-Tub60D, tj). Furthermore, the parental Drosophila (F0) were treated with cadmium (4.5 mg/kg) from egg stage, and when grows to adults, they mated in standard medium to produce the de-stressed offspring (F1-F4) to assess the transgenerational effects of developmental delay. The results showed that the delayed effects of the pupation and eclosion time could be maintained for two generations, and the inhibiting effects of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E) could be maintained for two or three generations. More importantly, cadmium increased the expression of DNA methylation-related genes (dDnmt2, dMBD2/3) in the ovaries (F0-F2) and testicles (F0 and F1). In addition, cadmium accumulated in parental Drosophila (F0) was not transmitted to offspring through reproductive pathway.

Triploid fish could provide an ideal sterile model for searching of a underlying mechanism of abnormality in meiosis. The complete understanding of the coding and noncoding RNAs regulating sterility caused by meiosis abnormality is still not well understood. By high-throughput sequencing, we compared the expression profiles of gonadal mRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) at three different developmental stages between the diploid (XX) and triploid (XXX) female rainbow trout. These stages were gonads before differentiation (65\u00a0days post fertilisation, dpf), at the beginning of morphological differences (180 dpf) and showing clear difference between diploids and triploids (600 dpf), respectively. A majority of differentially expressed (DE) RNAs were identified, and 22 DE mRNAs related to oocyte meiosis and homologous recombination were characterized. The predicted miRNA-mRNA/lncRNA networks of 3 developmental stages were constructed based on the target pairs of DE lncRNA-miRNA and DE mRNA-miRNA. According to the networks, meiosis-related gene of ccne1 was targeted by dre-miR-15a-5p_R\u00a0+\u00a01, and 6 targeted DE lncRNAs were identified. Also, qRT-PCR was performed to validate the credibility of the network. Overall, this study explored the potential interplay between coding and noncoding RNAs during the gonadal development of polyploid fish. The mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA screened in this study may be helpful to identify the functional elements regulating fertility of rainbow trout, which may provide reference for character improvement in aquaculture.", "Keywords": ["Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA)", "Fertility", "Gonadal development", "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA)", "Rainbow trout", "Triploid", "microRNAs (miRNA)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Gonads", "MicroRNAs", "Oncorhynchus mykiss", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "RNA, Messenger", "Triploidy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tianqing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China."}, {"First Name": "Enhui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiulan", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China."}, {"First Name": "Bingqian", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China."}, {"First Name": "Wenhua", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China."}, {"First Name": "Fulin", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China."}, {"First Name": "Gefeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Freshwater Aquatic Biotechnology and Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.

Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 44 post-chemotherapy and 46 non-chemotherapy patients as well as 49 healthy controls (HCs). All groups were age- and gender-matched. Then, the topological features of brain functional network were assessed using graph theory analysis. Results: At the global level, compared with the HCs, both the non-chemotherapy group and the post-chemotherapy group showed significantly increased values in sigma (p < 0.05), gamma (p < 0.05), and local efficiency, E loc (p < 0.05). The post-chemotherapy group and the non-chemotherapy group did not differ significantly in the above-mentioned parameters. At the nodal level, when non-chemotherapy or post-chemotherapy patients were compared with the HCs, abnormal nodal centralities were mainly observed in widespread brain regions. However, when the post-chemotherapy group was compared with the non-chemotherapy group, significantly decreased nodal centralities were observed primarily in the prefrontal-subcortical regions. Conclusions: These results indicate that lung cancer and chemotherapy can disrupt the topological features of functional networks, and chemotherapy may cause a pattern of prefrontal-subcortical brain network abnormality.

We measured total iodine by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), analyzed perfluorinated compounds via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MRM-MS), and explored other environmental substances using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) analysis. Twenty-nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes related to GD were analyzed by SNaPshot. The serum total iodine was significantly higher in GD group, but its association with GD onset was weak, only with Exp(B) value near 1. The perfluorinated compound levels were not different between the two groups. More importantly, we found 16 environmental substances significantly different between GD and control groups, among which ponasterone A is a risk factor (p = 0.007 and Exp(B) = 14.14), while confertifoline is a protective factor against GD onset (p = 0.002 and Exp(B) = 0.001). We also identified 10 substances correlated significantly with thyroid indices in GD patients, among which seven associated with levels of the thyroid autoantibody TPOAb.

The calcium-independent phospholipase iPLA2\u03b2 is known to cleave acyl tails from the glycerol backbone of lipids and release oxidized fatty acids from phospholipids. We found that iPLA2\u03b2-mediated detoxification of peroxidized lipids is sufficient to suppress p53-driven ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress, even in GPX4-null cells. Moreover, iPLA2\u03b2 is overexpressed in human cancers; inhibition of endogenous iPLA2\u03b2 sensitizes tumor cells to p53-driven ferroptosis and promotes p53-dependent tumor suppression in xenograft mouse models. These results demonstrate that iPLA2\u03b2 acts as a major ferroptosis repressor in a GPX4-independent manner. Notably, unlike GPX4, loss of iPLA2\u03b2 has no obvious effect on normal development or cell viability in normal tissues but iPLA2\u03b2 plays an essential role in regulating ferroptosis upon ROS-induced stress. Thus, our study suggests that iPLA2\u03b2 is a promising therapeutic target for activating ferroptosis-mediated tumor suppression without serious toxicity concerns.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["A549 Cells", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Disease Models, Animal", "Fatty Acids", "Female", "Ferroptosis", "Group VI Phospholipases A2", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase", "Phospholipids", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Delin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center,Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center,Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center,Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhaoqi", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathematical Genomics, Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center,Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center,Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Program for Mathematical Genomics, Departments of Systems Biology and Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center,Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA. wg8@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2021Jun15"}, {"PMID": "34121134", "Title": "[99mTc]Tc-Galacto-RGD2 integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-targeted imaging as a surrogate for molecular phenotyping in lung cancer: real-world data.", "Abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are beneficial in patients with lung cancer.

This tool was applied to a medical device procurement decision in a large provincial general hospital with more than 5000 beds in China as a case study. Specifically, the AHP evaluation framework is first established to determine the evaluation dimensions and criteria. This goal is achieved by applying the AdHopHTA Mini-HTA template and gathering data from questionnaires completed by experts from 33 major public hospitals in Anhui Province, China. The professionals within the application hospital were invited to evaluate the alternative products in a pairwise comparison and obtain a ranking of their advantages and disadvantages. This goal is achieved using the intuitionistic linguistic fuzzy model to deal with the subjectivity and uncertainty that may be present in the professional evaluation by experts in different fields. At the same time, the Keeney-Raiffa MCDA (KRM) method was used to demonstrate the accuracy of the application results. The results show that our tool can achieve the same effect as the verification method while being more efficient, easier to use, and requiring fewer participants.

In the present study, thirty dietary agents were analyzed on nine drug targets through in silico studies. However, nine dietary scaffolds, such as silibinin, flavopiridol, oleandrin, ursolic acid, \u03b1-boswellic acid, \u03b2-boswellic acid, triterpenoid, guggulsterone, and oleanolic acid potentially bound to the cavity of PI3K-\u03b1, PKC-\u03b7, H-Ras, and Ras with the highest binding energy. Particularly, the compounds silibinin and flavopiridol have been shown to have broad spectrum anticancer activity. Interestingly, flavopiridol was embedded in the pockets of PI3K-\u03b1 and PKC-\u03b7 as bound crystal inhibitors in two different conformations and showed significant interactions with ATP binding pocket residues. However, complex-based pharmacophore modeling achieved two vital pharmacophoric features namely, two H-bond acceptors for PI3K-\u03b1, while three are hydrophobic, one cat-donor and one H-bond donor and acceptor for PKC-\u03b7, respectively. The database screening with the ChemBridge core library explored potential hits on a valid pharmacophore query. Therefore, to optimize perspective lead compounds from the hits, which were subjected to various constraints such as docking, MM/GBVI, Lipinski rule of five, ADMET and toxicity properties. Henceforth, the top ligands were sorted out and examined for vital interactions with key residues, arguably the top three promising lead compounds for PI3K-\u03b1, while seven for PKC-\u03b7, exhibiting binding energy from - 11.5 to - 8.5 kcal mol-1.

The in vitro anti-cell proliferation studies by MTT assay have revealed them as potential Panc-1, Miapaca-2, and BxPC-3 pancreatic cell growth inhibitors, and the same is supported by molecular docking, QSAR, and ADMET studies. The MTT assay of their SAHA derivatives against the same cell lines evidenced them as potential HDAC inhibitors and identified 4a, 4b, and 4k substituted with 1,3-thiazol, 1,3,4-thiadiazol, and 5-sulfanyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol moieties on phenyl and diethylamino phenyl rings as potential ones. Additionally, the flow cytometric analyses of 4a, 4b, and 4k against BxPC-3 cells revealed compound 4k as a lead compound that arrests the S phase cell cycle growth at low micromolar concentrations.

Juz.", "Abstract": "Protostane triterpenes in Alisma orientale (Sam.) Juz. have unique structural features with distinct pharmacological activities. Previously we have demonstrated that protostane triterpene biosynthesis could be regulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induction in A. orientale. Here, proteomic investigation reveals the MeJA mediated regulation of protostane triterpene biosynthesis. In our study, 281 differentially abundant proteins were identified from MeJA-treated compared to control groups, while they were mainly associated with triterpene biosynthesis, \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and response to stress/defense. Key enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), squalene epoxidase (SE), oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) and cytochrome P450s which potentially involved in protostane triterpene biosynthesis were significantly enriched in MeJA-treated group. Basic Helix-loop-helix (bHLH), MYB, and GRAS transcription factors were enhanced after MeJA treatment, and they also improved the expressions of key enzymes in Mevalonate pathway and protostane triterpene. Then, MeJA also could increase the expression of \u03b1-galactosidase (\u03b1-GAL), thereby promoting carbohydrate decomposition, and providing energy and carbon skeletons for protostane triterpene precursor biosynthesis. As well, exogenous MeJA treatment upregulated 13-lipoxygenase (13-LOX), allene oxide synthase (AOS) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC) involved in \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism, leading to the accumulation of endogenous MeJA and activation of the protostane triterpene biosynthesis transduction. Finally, MeJA upregulated stress/defence-related proteins, as to enhance the defence responses activity of plants. These results were further verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of 19 selected genes and content analysis of protostane triterpene. The results provide some new insights into the role of MeJA in protostane triterpene biosynthesis.", "Keywords": ["Alisma orientale", "Biosynthesis", "Methyl jasmonate", "Proteomics", "Protostane triterpenes"], "MeSH terms": ["Acetates", "Alisma", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Cyclopentanes", "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant", "Molecular Structure", "Oxylipins", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Proteomics", "Triterpenes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tian", "Last Name": "Rong", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhang", "Last Name": "Chunchun", "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 311402, China."}, {"First Name": "Gu", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.

Not only affecting the lungs but also provoking acute respiratory distress, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to infect multiple cell types including cardiac and vascular cells. Hence a significant proportion of infected patients develop cardiac events, such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at highest risk of cardiac death. To face the pandemic and limit its burden, health authorities have launched several fast-track calls for research projects aiming to develop rapid strategies to combat the disease, as well as longer-term projects to prepare for the future. Biomarkers have the possibility to aid in clinical decision-making and tailoring healthcare in order to improve patient quality of life. The biomarker potential of circulating RNAs has been recognized in several disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease. RNA biomarkers may be useful in the current COVID-19 situation. The discovery, validation, and marketing of novel biomarkers, including RNA biomarkers, require multi-centre studies by large and interdisciplinary collaborative networks, involving both the academia and the industry. Here, members of the EU-CardioRNA COST Action CA17129 summarize the current knowledge about the strain that COVID-19 places on the cardiovascular system and discuss how RNA biomarkers can aid to limit this burden.

Map-based cloning and molecular characterization indicated that Mn6 is an S26-family ER SPase I, with Gly102 (box E) in Mn6 critical for protein function during processing. Mass spectrometric and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that Mn6 is predominantly involved in processing carbohydrate synthesis-related proteins, including the cell wall invertase miniature seed1 (Mn1), which is specifically expressed in the basal endosperm transfer layer. RNA and protein expression levels of Mn1 were both significantly downregulated in the mn6 mutant. Due to the significant reduction in cell wall invertase activity in the transfer cell layer, mutation of Mn6 caused dramatic defects in endosperm development.

Here, we identified PD-1 as a direct target of tumor suppressor p53. Notably, p53 acetylation at K120/164 played a critical role in p53-mediated PD-1 transcription. Acetylated p53 preferentially recruited acetyltransferase cofactors onto PD-1 promoter, selectively facilitating PD-1 transcription by enhancing local chromatin acetylation. Reexpression of PD-1 in cancer cells inhibited tumor growth, whereas depletion of cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1 compromised p53-dependent tumor suppression. Moreover, histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activated PD-1 in an acetylated p53-dependent manner, supporting a synergistic effect by HDACi and p53 on tumor suppression via stimulating cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1.

activities of p53 including induction of cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis are well accepted as critical barriers to cancer development, accumulating evidence suggests that loss of these classic activities is not sufficient to abrogate the tumor suppression activity of p53. Numerous studies suggest that metabolic regulation contributes to tumor suppression, but the mechanisms by which it does so are not completely understood. Cancer cells rewire cellular metabolism to meet the energetic and substrate demands of tumor development. It is well established that p53 suppresses glycolysis and promotes mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation through a number of downstream targets against the Warburg effect. The role of p53-mediated metabolic regulation in tumor suppression is complexed by its function to promote both cell survival and cell death under different physiological settings. Indeed, p53 can regulate both pro-oxidant and antioxidant target genes for complete opposite effects. In this review, we will summarize the roles of p53 in the regulation of glucose, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, iron metabolism, and ROS production. We will highlight the mechanisms underlying p53-mediated ferroptosis, AKT/mTOR signaling as well as autophagy and discuss the complexity of p53-metabolic regulation in tumor development.", "Keywords": ["Ferroptosis", "Metabolism", "Transcriptional activation", "Tumor suppression", "p53"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Glycolysis", "Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanqing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY, 10032, USA.

P53R175H (homologous to Trp53R172H in mice) is a common hot spot mutation. How metastasis is regulated by p53R175H in ESCC remains to be investigated. To investigate p53R175H-mediated molecular mechanisms, we used a carcinogen-induced approach in Trp53R172H/- mice to model ESCC. In the primary Trp53R172H/- tumor cell lines, we depleted Trp53R172H (shTrp53) and observed a marked reduction in cell invasion in vitro and lung metastasis burden in a tail-vein injection model in comparing isogenic cells (shCtrl). Furthermore, we performed bulk RNA-seq to compare gene expression profiles of metastatic and primary shCtrl and shTrp53 cells. We identified the YAP-BIRC5 axis as a potential mediator of Trp53R172H -mediated metastasis. We demonstrate that expression of Survivin, an antiapoptotic protein encoded by BIRC5, increases in the presence of Trp53R172H Furthermore, depletion of Survivin specifically decreases Trp53R172H-driven lung metastasis. Mechanistically, Trp53R172H but not wild-type Trp53, binds with YAP in ESCC cells, suggesting their cooperation to induce Survivin expression.

We identified 141 plant species (belonging to 114 genera and 61 families). The plant family with the most species was Asteraceae (14 species). Informants reported that most medicinal plants are herbaceous, with 95.7% of plants used for decoction and 30.5% used for medicinal baths. Medicinal plants are most commonly used to treat rheumatism, injury, and abdominal diseases. The utilization frequency index and relative importance values indicated that Artemisia argyi and Acorus calamus are the most important plants sold at herbal markets during the Dragon Boat Festival. The price of medicinal materials sold in the market may serve as an indicator of the conservation status of species in the region.

Using endogenous metabolites and genome-wide CRISPR screening, we have identified FAR1 as a critical factor for SFA-mediated ferroptosis.

explore the mechanism. EOs were extracted from WIM of Bichengqie(Litseae Fructus), Dingxiang(Flos Syzygii Aromatici), Huajiao(Pericarpium Zanthoxyli Bungeani), and Xiaohuixiang(Fructus Foeniculi) with warm property, and Ganjiang(Rhizoma Zingiberis), Gaoliangjiang(Rhizoma Alpiniae Officinari), Hujiao(Fructus Piperis), and Wuzhuyu(Fructus Evodiae Rutaecarpae) with hot property, respectively. Then the in vitro toxicity was evaluated by human keratinocyte cytotoxicity. In vivo skin irritation potency was also evaluated through pathological observation after topical administration. The components, especially those located in stratum corneum, were analyzed by GC-MS. The main components, namely monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, of EOs extracted from CM with hot property,were detected for the interaction with keratino-lipid ceramide 3 by molecular simulation technology; and the interaction energy value was calculated based on the optimal conformation. It was found that the skin cell toxicity of EOs from CM with hot property was significantly higher than that of EOs from CM with warm property. However, there was no significant difference between them by in vivo skin irritation evaluation. Whether from CM with hot property or warm property, EOs showed a significant reduced toxicity compared with azone. Sesquiterpenes(33.56%\u00b119.38%) were found to be one of the main components in EOs from CM with hot property, while almost no sesquiterpenes was found in EOs from CM with warm property. After topical administration of EOs from CM with hot property, sesquiterpenes were demonstrated to be prone to locate in stratum corneum. The results of molecular simulation also revealed that the interaction between sesquiterpenes and ceramide 3 was significantly stronger than that of monoterpenes(P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, the location of sesquiterpenes in stratum corneum resulted in the significant difference between in vitro skin cell toxicity and in vivo skin irritation potency.

PHD finger protein 19 (PHF19) is a polycomb protein that controls H3K36me3 and H3K27me3. However, the roles of PHF19 in cardiac hypertrophy remain unknown. Here in this work, we observed that PHF19 promoted cardiac hypertrophy via epigenetically targeting SIRT2. In angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, adenovirus-mediated knockdown of Phf19 reduced the increase in cardiomyocyte size, repressed the expression of hypertrophic marker genes Anp and Bnp, as well as inhibited protein synthesis. By contrast, Phf19 overexpression promoted Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. We also knocked down Phf19 expression in mouse hearts in vivo. The results demonstrated that Phf19 knockdown reduced Ang II-induced decline in cardiac fraction shortening and ejection fraction. Phf19 knockdown also inhibited Ang II-mediated increase in heart weight, reduced cardiomyocyte size, and repressed the expression of hypertrophic marker genes in mouse hearts. Further mechanism studies showed that PHF19 suppressed the expression of SIRT2, which contributed to the function of PHF19 during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. PHF19 bound the promoter of SIRT2 and regulated the balance between H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 to repress the expression of SIRT2 in vitro and in vivo. In human hypertrophic hearts, the overexpression of PHF19 and downregulation of SIRT2 were observed. Of importance, PHF19 expression was positively correlated with hypertrophic marker genes ANP and BNP but negatively correlated with SIRT2 in human hypertrophic hearts.

Cilomilast is a second-generation, selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, but its role in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CKD remains unclear. Material and Methods: Cilomilast was applied to the mice with unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) and renal fibroblast cells (NRK-49F) stimulated by TGF-\u03b21. Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation after UUO or TGF-\u03b21 stimulation were examined by histology, Western blotting, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. KIM-1 and NGAL were detected to evaluate tubular injury in UUO mice. Results: In vivo, immunohistochemistry and western blot data demonstrated that cilomilast treatment inhibited extracellular matrix deposition, profibrotic gene expression, and the inflammatory response. Furthermore, cilomilast prevented tubular injury in UUO mice, as manifested by reduced expression of KIM-1 and NGAL in the kidney. In vitro, cilomilast attenuated the activation of fibroblast cells stimulated by TGF-\u03b21, as shown by the reduced expression of fibronectin, \u03b1-SMA, collagen I, and collagen III.

E3 ligases that mediate NRF2 ubiquitination have been widely reported, but the mechanism of NRF2 deubiquitination remains largely unclear. Here, we identified ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 11 (USP11) in NRF2 complexes and confirmed an interaction between these two proteins. We further found that USP11 deubiquitinates NRF2; this modification stabilizes NRF2. Functionally, USP11 depletion contributes to the suppression of cell proliferation and induction of ferroptotic cell death due to ROS-mediated stress, which can be largely abrogated by overexpression of NRF2. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of USP11 and NRF2 was performed using a lung tissue microarray, which revealed that USP11 is highly expressed in patients with NSCLC and positively correlated with NRF2 expression.

Recognizing the urgency of MSW management, Beijing's government launched the \"MSW Source Separation Regulation\" on May 1, 2020. This paper attempts to take into account the different levels of MSW source separation as well as the impact of different MSW compositions on energy recovery potential from incineration. We assume that the MSW management level in Beijing in 2025 will reach that of developed countries (e.g., Australia), which have abundant experience and mature MSW management systems. The amount of MSW generation is predicted by a first-order and one-variable grey differential equation model, GM (1,1), and a kernel-based nonlinear multivariate grey model, KGM (1,n). We establish six scenarios and distinguish them by the composition and lower\u00a0heating values (LHV) of MSW, considered with and without recycling and source separation to varying degrees. The predicted amount of MSW generation in 2025 is 11,505,400 tons with 2.255% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). With increasing source separation and removal of food waste, the volume of electricity generated per ton of waste ranges from 0.336 to 1.114 MWh/ton. At its lowest, the cost of electricity generation is 977.60 yuan/MWh.

However, TACE-induced hypoxia may promote the angiogenesis and section of some cytokines, such as IL-8, and, thereby, lead to tumor metastasis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Jiedu Recipe (JR), which has been demonstrated as an effective Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recipe on HCC, on TACE-induced cytokines upregulation and hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. A total of 88 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with TACE were enrolled and divided into a JR group or control group. TACE induced significant increases of neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), IL-1\u03b2, IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-8. JR treatment significantly inhibited the elevation of IL-8 compared with control. In vitro, JR significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced overexpression of IL-8, HIF-1\u03b1, and VEGF mRNA in Huh 7 cells. ELISA assay demonstrated the effect of JR on IL-8 expression. Both hypoxia and IL-8 may promote angiogenesis which was suppressed by JR. Western blot showed that IL-8 upregulated the expression of phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, NF-\u03baB, and VEGFR, which were inhibited by JR. On the other hand, effects of IL-8 on the increase of p-AKT and p-ERK were also blocked by LY294002 and U0126, respectively.

This study was to combine endobronchial ultrasound elastography (UE) with computed tomography (CT) to identify benign and malignant thoracic lymph nodes (LNs) more objectively and accurately. Methods. A total of 42 patients with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy required for endobronchial ultrasound with real-time guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) examination were enrolled. All patients were examined by enhanced chest CT, B-mode ultrasound, and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided elastography before EBUS-TBNA. Each lymph node was assessed by describing the characteristics of CT image (short diameter, texture, shape, boundary, and mean CT value), B-mode ultrasound (short diameter, echo characteristic, shape, and boundary), and elastography (image type, grading score, strain rate, and blue area ratio). The pathological results were used as the gold standard. The characteristics were compared alone and in combination between benign and malignant LNs. Results. The blue area ratio of elastography combined with CT had better diagnostic value in differentiating benign and malignant LNs than elastography alone, with the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) being 92%, 96%, 80%, 94%, and 86% vs 81%, 77%, 93%, 97%, and 56%, respectively. Elastography combined with B-mode ultrasound and CT characteristics showed the highest diagnostic value. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were all 100%. Conclusions.

However, upon DNA damage, levels of p53 dramatically increase for its activation. Although robust stabilization of p53 serves as a \"trademark\" for DNA damage responses, the requirement for such dramatic protein stabilization in tumor suppression has not been well addressed. Here we generated a mutant p53KQ mouse where all the C-terminal domain lysine residues were mutated to glutamines (K to Q mutations at K367, K369, K370, K378, K379, K383, and K384) to mimic constitutive acetylation of the p53 C-terminus. Because of p53 activation, p53KQ/KQ mice were perinatal lethal, yet this lethality was averted in p53KQ/- mice, which displayed normal postnatal development. Nevertheless, p53KQ/- mice died prematurely due to anemia and hematopoiesis failure. Further analyses indicated that expression of the acetylation-mimicking p53 mutant in vivo induces activation of p53 targets in various tissues without obviously increasing p53 levels. In the well-established pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse model, expression of the acetylation-mimicking p53-mutant protein effectively suppressed K-Ras-induced PDAC development in the absence of robust p53 stabilization. Together, our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that p53-mediated transcriptional function and tumor suppression can be achieved independently of its robust stabilization and reveal an alternative approach to activate p53 function for therapeutic purposes.

As signal molecules regulated by the neuroendocrine system, the role of polypeptides, such as neuropeptide Y, brain-gut peptide and glucagon-like peptide in obesity and its related complications has been revealed. Notably, with the rapid development of peptidomics, peptide drugs have been widely used in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases, due to their short half-life, small apparent distribution volume, low toxicity and low side effects. The present review summarizes the progress and the new trend of peptide research, which may provide novel targets for the prevention and treatment of obesity.", "Keywords": ["metabolic diseases", "obesity", "peptides", "peptidomics", "treatment"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yao", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, P.R.

A significant interaction between the unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) and saturated hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine (HPC) was found by molecular simulation and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which led to the reduction of PC peroxidation with the presence of HPC. Subsequently, the composite phospholipid ethosomes containing curcumin were prepared for the first time to evaluate their properties in comparison with the conventional ethosomes composed of PC (CE-P) or HPC (CE-H). CE with PC/HPC ratio of 1:1 (CE-P1H1) with the best vesicle stability and flexibility significantly decreased the uptake by HaCaT cells compared to CE-H and free curcumin, indicating reduced skin cell toxicity. Compared with free curcumin, CE-P1H1 had the highest transdermal efficiency (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), followed by CE-P (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), partly due to the fact that CE-P1H1 could disturb lipid domain of stratum corneum (SC).

In the current study, miR22 expression showed a tissues-specific difference in the poly(I:C) induced inflammatory mouse lung and brain tissues. The cell-specific different expression of miR22 was also observed in inflammatory glial cells and endothelial cells. The pattern of RPL29 expression was also similar to miR22 in these tissues and cells under the same treatment. Interestingly, the knockdown of RPL29 exerted an inhibitory effect on miR22 and its known transcription factors including Fos-B and c-Fos. Fos-B and c-Fos were also differentially expressed in the two cell lines transfected with poly(I:C). The knockdown of c-Fos also exerted its negative effects on miR22 expression in both cells.

The effects of melatonin and dabrafenib as monotherapy or in combination on the proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, migration and invasion of anaplastic thyroid cancer cells were examined. The molecular mechanism involved in drug combinations was also revealed. Melatonin enhanced dabrafenib-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted dabrafenib-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. Molecular mechanistic studies further uncovered that melatonin synergized with dabrafenib to inhibit AKT and EMT signalling pathways. Furthermore, melatonin and dabrafenib synergistically inhibited the expression of hTERT, and the inhibition of cell viability and the induction of cell cycle arrest mediated by the combination of these two drugs were reversed by hTERT overexpression.

Here, we investigated the role of HUWE1 in the female reproductive system.

Interestingly, oocytes from Huwe1 heterozygous females matured and fertilized normally, but the majority of embryos that lacked maternal Huwe1 were arrested at the morula stage after fertilization. Consequently, Huwe1 heterozygous females only produced wild-type pups. Concomitant knockout of p53 did not recover fertility of the Huwe1 knockout females.

It is characterized by virilization, hypertension, and significant final height impairment. In this study, we aim to investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics of four unrelated Chinese patients with 11\u03b2OHD disorder. Methods: The clinical information of four 11\u03b2OHD patients were carefully reviewed. Genetic analysis was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) based panel analysis. NGS coverage depth was analyzed to detect exonic copy-number variants (CNVs) on patient 1. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was subsequently performed to confirm the CNVs detected from the NGS coverage depth analysis. Results: The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 4.7 years (range, 2.0-9.3 years). Two genetically female patients (patients 1 and 2) with 11\u03b2OHD presented severe virilization of external genitalia and were raised as males. Two genetically male patients (patients 3 and 4) presented precocious puberty. Additionally, patients 1, 3, and 4 presented with hypertension. In patient 4, unilateral adrenal mass was detected and removed at the age of 9 years. Interestingly, the height of patient 4 (174.4 cm, +6.7 SD) wasn't impaired and reached his mid-parental height (173 cm). Three novel variants in the CYP11B1 gene (c.1150_1153del, c.217C>T, and c.400G>C) were identified by NGS. Various bioinformatics tools revealed potential pathogenic effects for the novel variants, and evolutionary-conservation revealed that the novel missense variant affected an amino acid that is highly conserved among species. Furthermore, NGS coverage depth analysis and qPCR identified a novel heterozygous deletion of exons 1-6 in patient 1.

Studying the mechanism underlying growth augmentation is expected to improve clinical therapies. The ovarian tumor (OTU) subfamily deubiquitinases have been implicated in the regulation of critical cell-signaling cascades, but most OTUs functions remain to be investigated. Through an unbiased RNAi screen, knockdown of OTUD5 is shown to significantly accelerate cell growth. Further investigation reveals that OTUD5 depletion leads to the enhanced transcriptional activity of TRIM25 and the inhibited expression of PML by altering the ubiquitination level of TRIM25. Importantly, OTUD5 knockdown accelerates tumor growth in a nude mouse model. OTUD5 expression is markedly downregulated in tumor tissues. The reduced OTUD5 level is associated with an aggressive phenotype and a poor clinical outcome for cancers patients. Our findings reveal a mechanism whereby OTUD5 regulates gene transcription and suppresses tumorigenesis by deubiquitinating TRIM25, providing a potential target for oncotherapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "HEK293 Cells", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Nude", "Middle Aged", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "RNA Interference", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome", "Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases", "Ubiquitination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fangzhou", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Qianqian", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational Medicine, The Affiliated Zhangjiagang Hospital of Soochow University, 68 Jiyang West Road, 215600, Suzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Kaiqiang", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical informatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Post-translational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Mingwei", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Tian", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Zebin", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tingting", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical informatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Post-translational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tanjun", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dawei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational Medicine, The Affiliated Zhangjiagang Hospital of Soochow University, 68 Jiyang West Road, 215600, Suzhou, China. daweili@suda.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, 100191, Beijing, China. zhao6025729@bjmu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2020Aug21"}]
