Neurons are increasingly appreciated as important reactive components of the glioma microenvironment, due to their role in causing hallmark glioma symptoms, such as cognitive deficits and seizures, as well as their potential ability to drive glioma progression. Separately, mTOR signaling has been shown to have pleiotropic effects in the brain tumor microenvironment, including regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability. However, the local cellular-level effects of mTOR inhibition on glioma-induced neuronal alterations are not well understood. Here we employed neuron-specific profiling of ribosome-bound mRNA via 'RiboTag,' morphometric analysis of dendritic spines, and in vivo calcium imaging, along with pharmacological mTOR inhibition to investigate the impact of glioma burden and mTOR inhibition on these neuronal alterations. The RiboTag analysis of tumor-associated excitatory neurons showed a downregulation of transcripts encoding excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins and dendritic spine development, and an upregulation of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal proteins involved in dendritic spine turnover. Light and electron microscopy of tumor-associated excitatory neurons demonstrated marked decreases in dendritic spine density. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in tumor-associated excitatory neurons revealed progressive alterations in neuronal activity, both at the population and single-neuron level, throughout tumor growth. This in vivo calcium imaging also revealed altered stimulus-evoked somatic calcium events, with changes in event rate, size, and temporal alignment to stimulus, which was most pronounced in neurons with high-tumor burden. A single acute dose of AZD8055, a combined mTORC1/2 inhibitor, reversed the glioma-induced alterations on the excitatory neurons, including the alterations in ribosome-bound transcripts, dendritic spine density, and stimulus evoked responses seen by calcium imaging. These results point to mTOR-driven pathological plasticity in neurons at the infiltrative margin of glioma - manifested by alterations in ribosome-bound mRNA, dendritic spine density, and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity. Collectively, our work identifies the pathological changes that tumor-associated excitatory neurons experience as both hyperlocal and reversible under the influence of mTOR inhibition, providing a foundation for developing therapies targeting neuronal signaling in glioma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander R", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation":

stimuli, animals engage in diverse forms of rapid escape behaviors. In Drosophila larvae, one type of escape response involves C-shaped bending and lateral rolling followed by rapid forward crawling. The sensory circuitry that promotes larval escape has been extensively characterized; however, the motor programs underlying rolling are unknown. Here, we characterize the neuromuscular basis of rolling escape behavior. We used high-speed, volumetric, Swept Confocally Aligned Planar Excitation (SCAPE) microscopy to image muscle activity during larval rolling. Unlike sequential peristaltic muscle contractions that progress from segment to segment during forward and backward crawling, muscle activity progresses circumferentially during bending and rolling escape behavior. We propose that progression of muscular contraction around the larva's circumference results in a transient misalignment between weight and the ground support forces, which generates a torque that induces stabilizing body rotation. Therefore, successive cycles of slight misalignment followed by reactive aligning rotation lead to continuous rolling motion. Supporting our biomechanical model, we found that disrupting the activity of muscle groups undergoing circumferential contraction progression leads to rolling defects. We use EM connectome data to identify premotor to motor connectivity patterns that could drive rolling behavior and perform neural silencing approaches to demonstrate the crucial role of a group of glutamatergic premotor neurons in rolling. Our data reveal body-wide muscle activity patterns and putative premotor circuit organization for execution of the rolling escape response.", "Keywords": ["Drosophila larvae", "motor circuits", "nociception", "premotor\u2013motor\u2013muscle connectome", "rolling escape behavior"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Drosophila", "Neurons", "Larva", "Escape Reaction", "Muscle Contraction", "Drosophila melanogaster"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patricia C", "Last Name": "Cooney", "Affiliation": "Grueber Laboratory, Mortimer B.

Significant residual activity not directly correlated with behavior was high dimensional and reflected the activity of small clusters of spatially organized neurons that may correspond to genetically defined cell types.

There is a growing interest in using perfusion to fix postmortem human brain tissue to achieve the highest fidelity preservation for downstream high-resolution morphomolecular brain mapping studies. Numerous practical barriers arise when applying perfusion fixation in brain banking settings, including the large mass of the organ, degradation of vascular integrity and patency prior to the start of the procedure, and differing investigator goals sometimes necessitating part of the brain to be frozen. As a result, there is a critical need to establish a perfusion fixation procedure in brain banking that is flexible and scalable. This technical report describes our approach to developing an ex situ perfusion fixation protocol. We discuss the challenges encountered and lessons learned while implementing this procedure. Routine morphological staining and RNA in situ hybridization data show that the perfused brains have well-preserved tissue cytoarchitecture and intact biomolecular signal.

This topography reflects developmental pressures. Oddly, vestibular (balance) nuclei are thought to be disorganized. By measuring activity in birthdated neurons, we revealed a functional map within the central vestibular projection nucleus that stabilizes gaze in the larval zebrafish. We first discovered that both somatic position and stimulus selectivity follow projection neuron birthdate. Next, with electron microscopy and loss-of-function assays, we found that patterns of peripheral innervation to projection neurons were similarly organized by birthdate. Finally, birthdate revealed spatial patterns of axonal arborization and synapse formation to projection neuron outputs. Collectively, we find that development reveals previously hidden organization to the input, processing, and output layers of a highly conserved vertebrate sensorimotor circuit. The spatial and temporal attributes we uncover constrain the developmental mechanisms that may specify the fate, function, and organization of vestibulo-ocular reflex neurons.

In Drosophila larvae, one type of escape response involves C-shaped bending and lateral rolling followed by rapid forward crawling. The sensory circuitry that promotes larval escape has been extensively characterized; however, the motor programs underlying rolling are unknown. Here, we characterize the neuromuscular basis of rolling escape behavior. We used high-speed, volumetric, Swept Confocally-Aligned Planar Excitation (SCAPE) microscopy to image muscle activity during larval rolling. Unlike sequential peristaltic muscle contractions that progress from segment to segment during forward and backward crawling, the muscle activity progresses circumferentially during bending and rolling escape behavior. We propose that progression of muscular contraction around the larval circumference results in a transient misalignment between weight and the ground support forces, which generates a torque that induces stabilizing body rotation. Therefore, successive cycles of slight misalignment followed by reactive aligning rotation lead to continuous rolling motion. Supporting our biomechanical model, we found that disrupting the activity of muscle groups undergoing circumferential contraction progression lead to rolling defects. We use EM connectome data to identify premotor to motor connectivity patterns that could drive rolling behavior, and perform neural silencing approaches to demonstrate the crucial role of a group of glutamatergic premotor neurons in rolling. Our data reveal body-wide muscle activity patterns and putative premotor circuit organization for execution of the rolling escape response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patricia C", "Last Name": "Cooney", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuhan", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wenze", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dulanjana M", "Last Name": "Perera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Hormigo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tanya", "Last Name": "Tabachnik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Isuru", "Last Name": "Godage", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M C", "Last Name": "Hillman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wesley B", "Last Name": "Grueber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aref A", "Last Name": "Zarin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Aug24"}, {"PMID": "36756677", "Title": "Renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia type 2: Perinatal lethal condition or a multisystemic disorder with variable expressivity.", "Abstract": "Renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia type 2 (RHPD2) is a rare condition that has been described in the literature disproportionately in perinatal losses.

Implemented in benchtop and miniaturized form factors, the microscopes also have high sensitivity, even for weak intrinsic fluorescence, allowing for the label-free imaging of diagnostically relevant histoarchitectural structures, as we show for pancreatic disease in living mice, for chronic kidney disease in fresh human kidney tissues, and for oral mucosa in a healthy volunteer. Miniaturized high-speed light-sheet microscopes for in-situ volumetric histological imaging may facilitate the point-of-care detection of diverse cellular-level biomarkers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Mice", "Microscopy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kripa B", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology and the Mortimer B.

SRGAP2C expression in mice increases the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses received by layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs)3-5. Here we show that the increased number of excitatory synapses received by layer 2/3 PNs induced by SRGAP2C expression originates from a specific increase in local and long-range cortico-cortical connections. Mice humanized for SRGAP2C expression in all cortical PNs displayed a shift in the fraction of layer 2/3 PNs activated by sensory stimulation and an enhanced ability to learn a cortex-dependent sensory-discrimination task. Computational modelling revealed that the increased layer 4 to layer 2/3 connectivity induced by SRGAP2C expression explains some of the key changes in sensory coding properties.

Initial CSDs are accompanied by profound vasoconstriction and leave residual oligemia and ischemia in their wake. Later, CSDs evoke variable responses, from constriction to biphasic to vasodilation. However, CSD-evoked vasoconstriction is found to be more likely during rapid, high-amplitude CSDs in regions with stronger oligemia and ischemia, which, in turn, worsens after each repeated CSD.

Here, we show that Glut1 functions in a cell-autonomous manner in the cerebral microvasculature to affect endothelial tip cells and, thus, brain angiogenesis. Moreover, brain endothelial cell-specific Glut1 depletion not only triggers a severe neuroinflammatory response in the Glut1 DS brain, but also reduces levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and causes overt disease. Reduced BDNF correlated with fewer neurons in the Glut1 DS brain. Controlled depletion of the protein demonstrated that brain pathology and disease severity was greatest when Glut1 scarcity was induced neonatally, during brain angiogenesis. Reducing Glut1 at later stages had mild or little effect.

Proprioceptive sensing of the position of rigid joints has been described in detail in several systems; however, it is not known how animals with a flexible skeleton encode their body positions.

Here we\u00a0used high-speed volumetric swept confocally aligned planar excitation (SCAPE) microscopy in crawling Drosophila larvae to simultaneously track the position, deformation, and intracellular calcium activity of their multidendritic proprioceptors. Most proprioceptive neurons were found to activate during segment contraction, although one subtype was activated by extension. During cycles of segment contraction and extension, different proprioceptor types exhibited sequential activity, providing a continuum of position encoding during all phases of crawling. This sequential activity was related to the dynamics of each neuron's terminal processes, and could endow each proprioceptor with a specific role in monitoring different aspects of body-wall deformation. We demonstrate this deformation encoding both during progression of contraction waves during locomotion as well as during less stereotyped, asymmetric exploration behavior. Our results provide powerful new insights into the body-wide neuronal dynamics of the proprioceptive system in crawling Drosophila, and demonstrate the utility of our SCAPE microscopy approach for characterization of neural encoding throughout the nervous system of a freely behaving animal.", "Keywords": ["Drosophila", "GCaMP", "SCAPE microscopy", "calcium imaging", "cell tracking", "high-speed microscopy", "larvae", "light-sheet microscopy", "locomotion", "proprioception"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Larva", "Locomotion", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Proprioception", "Sensory Receptor Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca D", "Last Name": "Vaadia", "Affiliation": "Grueber Laboratory, Mortimer B.

Studies to define the temporal requirements for Glut1 reveal that pre-symptomatic, AAV9-mediated repletion of the protein averts brain microvasculature defects and prevents disease, whereas augmenting the protein late, during adulthood, is devoid of benefit. Still, treatment following symptom onset can be effective; Glut1 repletion in early-symptomatic mutants that have experienced sustained periods of low brain glucose nevertheless restores the cerebral microvasculature and ameliorates disease. Timely Glut1 repletion may thus constitute an effective treatment for Glut1 DS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Brain", "Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Female", "Glucose", "Glucose Transporter Type 1", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Microvessels", "Monosaccharide Transport Proteins", "Neovascularization, Physiologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maoxue", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology &Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guangping", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Physiological Systems, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 010605, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carlos B", "Last Name": "Rueda", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology, Mortimer B.

In resting-state fMRI, hemodynamic fluctuations have been found to exhibit patterns of bilateral synchrony, with correlated regions inferred to have functional connectivity. However, the relationship between resting-state hemodynamics and underlying neural activity has not been well established, making the neural underpinnings of functional connectivity networks unclear. In this study, neural activity and hemodynamics were recorded simultaneously over the bilateral cortex of awake and anesthetized Thy1-GCaMP mice using wide-field optical mapping. Neural activity was visualized via selective expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorophore GCaMP in layer 2/3 and 5 excitatory neurons. Characteristic patterns of resting-state hemodynamics were accompanied by more rapidly changing bilateral patterns of resting-state neural activity. Spatiotemporal hemodynamics could be modeled by convolving this neural activity with hemodynamic response functions derived through both deconvolution and gamma-variate fitting. Simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology confirmed that Thy1-GCaMP signals are well-predicted by multiunit activity. Neurovascular coupling between resting-state neural activity and hemodynamics was robust and fast in awake animals, whereas coupling in urethane-anesthetized animals was slower, and in some cases included lower-frequency (<0.04 Hz) hemodynamic fluctuations that were not well-predicted by local Thy1-GCaMP recordings. These results support that resting-state hemodynamics in the awake and anesthetized brain are coupled to underlying patterns of excitatory neural activity.

This relationship between neural activity and hemodynamics is termed neurovascular coupling and provides the blood flow-dependent contrast detected in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neurovascular coupling is commonly assumed to be consistent and reliable from birth; however, numerous studies have demonstrated markedly different hemodynamics in the early postnatal brain. Our recent study in J. Neuroscience examined whether different hemodynamics in the immature brain are driven by differences in the underlying spatiotemporal properties of neural activity during this period of robust neural circuit expansion. Using a novel wide-field optical imaging technique to visualize both neural activity and hemodynamics in the mouse brain, we observed longer duration and increasingly complex patterns of neural responses to stimulus as cortical connectivity developed over time. However, imaging of brain blood flow, oxygenation, and metabolism in the same mice demonstrated an absence of coupled blood flow responses in the newborn brain. This lack of blood flow coupling was shown to lead to oxygen depletions following neural activations - depletions that may affect the duration of sustained neural responses and could be important to the vascular patterning of the rapidly developing brain.

Conversely, two-dimensional wide-field optical mapping (WFOM), a simpler technique that uses a camera to observe large areas of the exposed cortex under visible light, can detect changes in both neural activity and haemodynamics at very high speeds. Although WFOM may not provide single-neuron or capillary-level resolution, it is an attractive and accessible approach to imaging large areas of the brain in awake, behaving mammals at speeds fast enough to observe widespread neural firing events, as well as their dynamic coupling to haemodynamics. Although such wide-field optical imaging techniques have a long history, the advent of genetically encoded fluorophores that can report neural activity with high sensitivity, as well as modern technologies such as light emitting diodes and sensitive and high-speed digital cameras have driven renewed interest in WFOM. To facilitate the wider adoption and standardization of WFOM approaches for neuroscience and neurovascular coupling research, we provide here an overview of the basic principles of WFOM, considerations for implementation of wide-field fluorescence imaging of neural activity, spectroscopic analysis and interpretation of results.This article is part of the themed issue 'Interpreting BOLD: a dialogue between cognitive and cellular neuroscience'.", "Keywords": ["GCaMP", "fluorescence", "haemodynamics", "neurovascular coupling", "optical imaging", "spectroscopy"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Mice", "Neurons", "Optical Imaging", "Rats"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA Mortimer B.

Here, we demonstrate that localized neural activity in early postnatal mice does not evoke blood flow increases as in the adult brain, and elucidate the neural and metabolic correlates of these altered functional hemodynamics as a function of developmental age. Using wide-field GCaMP imaging, the development of neural responses to somatosensory stimulus is visualized over the entire bilaterally exposed cortex. Neural responses are observed to progress from tightly localized, unilateral maps to bilateral responses as interhemispheric connectivity becomes established. Simultaneous hemodynamic imaging confirms that spatiotemporally coupled functional hyperemia is not present during these early stages of postnatal brain development, and develops gradually as cortical connectivity is established. Exploring the consequences of this lack of functional hyperemia, measurements of oxidative metabolism via flavoprotein fluorescence suggest that neural activity depletes local oxygen to below baseline levels at early developmental stages. Analysis of hemoglobin oxygenation dynamics at the same age confirms oxygen depletion for both stimulus-evoked and resting-state neural activity. This state of unmet metabolic demand during neural network development poses new questions about the mechanisms of neurovascular development and its role in both normal and abnormal brain development.

Light-sheet microscopy techniques using two-objective, orthogonal illumination and detection require a highly constrained sample geometry, and either physical sample translation or complex synchronization of illumination and detection planes. In contrast, SCAPE microscopy acquires images using an angled, swept light-sheet in a single-objective, en-face geometry.

As a result, little investigation into the cause of SSHOs has been undertaken, and their potential to confound fMRI analysis, as well as their possible value as a functional biomarker has been largely overlooked. Here, we report direct observation of large-amplitude, sinusoidal ~0.1 Hz hemodynamic oscillations in the cortex of an awake human undergoing surgical resection of a brain tumor. Intraoperative multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) revealed that SSHOs were spatially localized to distinct regions of the cortex, exhibited wave-like propagation, and involved oscillations in the diameter of specific pial arterioles, indicating that the effect was not the result of systemic blood pressure oscillations. fMRI data collected from the same subject 4 days prior to surgery demonstrates that ~0.1 Hz oscillations in the BOLD signal can be detected around the same region. Intraoperative optical imaging data from a patient undergoing epilepsy surgery, in whom sinusoidal oscillations were not observed, is shown for comparison. This direct observation of the '0.1 Hz wave' in the awake human brain, using both intraoperative imaging and pre-operative fMRI, confirms that SSHOs occur in the human brain, and can be detected by fMRI.

However, broadly varying hemodynamic responses in the brains of newborn and young infants have been reported. Particular controversy exists over whether the \"true\" neonatal response to stimulation consists of a decrease or an increase in local deoxyhemoglobin, corresponding to a positive (adult-like) or negative blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), respectively. A major difficulty with previous studies has been the variability in human subjects and measurement paradigms. Here, we present a systematic study in neonatal rats that charts the evolution of the cortical blood flow response during postnatal development using exposed-cortex multispectral optical imaging. We demonstrate that postnatal-day-12-13 rats (equivalent to human newborns) exhibit an \"inverted\" hemodynamic response (increasing deoxyhemoglobin, negative BOLD) with early signs of oxygen consumption followed by delayed, active constriction of pial arteries. We observed that the hemodynamic response then matures via development of an initial hyperemic (positive BOLD) phase that eventually masks oxygen consumption and balances vasoconstriction toward adulthood. We also observed that neonatal responses are particularly susceptible to stimulus-evoked systemic blood pressure increases, leading to cortical hyperemia that resembles adult positive BOLD responses. We propose that this confound may account for much of the variability in prior studies of neonatal cortical hemodynamics.
