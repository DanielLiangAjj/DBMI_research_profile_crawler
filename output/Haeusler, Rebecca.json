We performed a case-control study to examine the association between ALS diagnosis and serum levels of bile acids. Sporadic and familial ALS patients, age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and presymptomatic gene carriers who donated blood samples were included. Non-fasted serum samples stored at -80\u00b0C were used for the analysis. Serum bile acid levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Concentrations of 15 bile acids were obtained, 5 non-conjugated and 10 conjugated, and compared between ALS versus control groups (presymptomatic gene carriers + healthy controls) using the Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum test. In total, 80 participants were included: 31 ALS (17 sporadic and 14 familial ALS); 49 controls (22 gene carriers, 27 healthy controls). The mean age was 50\u2009years old and 50% were male. In the ALS group, 45% had familial disease with a pathogenic variant in C9orf72 (29%), TARDBP (10%), FUS (3%), and CHCHD10 (3%) genes. In the control group, 43% carried pathogenic variants: C9orf72 (27%), SOD1 (10%), and FUS (6%). The serum levels of UDCA, TUDCA, and GUDCA trended higher in the ALS group compared to controls (median 27 vs. 7\u2009nM, 4 vs. 3\u2009nM, 110 vs. 47\u2009nM, p-values 0.04, 0.06, 0.04, respectively).

BAs act not only as signaling molecules involved in energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis, but also as regulators of food intake. The structure of BAs, particularly the position of the hydroxyl groups of BAs, impacts food intake partly by intestinal effects: (1) modulating the activity of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D, which produces the anorexigenic bioactive lipid oleoylethanolamide (OEA) or (2) regulating lipid absorption and the gastric emptying-satiation pathway. We hypothesized that 16\u03b1-hydroxylated BAs uniquely regulate food intake because of the long intermeal intervals in snake species in which these BAs are abundant. However, the effects of 16\u03b1-hydroxylated BAs in mammals are completely unknown because they are not naturally found in mammals. To test the effect of 16\u03b1-hydroxylated BAs on food intake, we isolated the 16\u03b1-hydroxylated BA pythocholic acid from ball pythons (Python regius). Pythocholic acid or deoxycholic acid (DCA) was given by oral gavage in mice. DCA is known to increase N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D activity better than other mammalian BAs. We evaluated food intake, OEA levels, and gastric emptying in mice. We successfully isolated pythocholic acid from ball pythons for experimental use. Pythocholic acid treatment significantly decreased food intake in comparison to DCA treatment, and this was associated with increased jejunal OEA, but resulted in no change in gastric emptying or lipid absorption. The exogenous BA pythocholic acid is a novel regulator of food intake and the satiety signal for OEA in the mouse intestine.", "Keywords": ["NAPE-PLD", "OEA", "bile acids", "gastric emptying", "pythocholic acid"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Male", "Animals", "Bile Acids and Salts", "Phospholipase D", "Phosphatidylethanolamines", "Eating", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sei", "Last Name": "Higuchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raidah H", "Last Name": "Nasiri", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leela J", "Last Name": "Giddla", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Molina", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rokia", "Last Name": "Diarra", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas V", "Last Name": "DiPatrizio", "Affiliation": "Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA."}, {"First Name": "Akira", "Last Name": "Kawamura", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Hunter College of CUNY, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Haeusler", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Endocrinology", "PubDate": "2023Aug01"}, {"PMID": "36163215", "Title": "Differential effects of bariatric surgery on plasma levels of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4.", "Abstract": "Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) and 4 (ANGPTL4) are regulators of triglyceride storage and utilization.

Considerable gaps remain in our knowledge of this physiology, but it appears that the enterocyte's structural polarization dictates its behavior in fat partitioning, treating fat differently based on its absorption across the apical versus the basolateral membrane. In this review, we synthesize existing data and thought on this dual-track model of enterocyte fat metabolism through the lens of human integrative physiology. The apical track includes the canonical pathway of dietary lipid absorption across the apical brush-border membrane, leading to packaging and secretion of those lipids as chylomicrons. However, this track also reserves a portion of dietary lipid within cytoplasmic lipid droplets for later uses, including the \"second-meal effect,\" which remains poorly understood. At the same time, the enterocyte takes up circulating fats across the basolateral membrane by mechanisms that may include receptor-mediated import of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or their remnants, local hydrolysis and internalization of free fatty acids, or enterocyte de novo lipogenesis using basolaterally absorbed substrates. The ultimate destinations of basolateral-track fat may include fatty acid oxidation, structural lipid synthesis, storage in cytoplasmic lipid droplets, or ultimate resecretion, although the regulation and purposes of this basolateral track remain mysterious.

Accordingly, in this study, middle-aged obese female and male mice were randomized to one of three groups: sleeve gastrectomy (SG), sham surgery ad libitum (SH-AL), or sham surgery with weight matching to SG through intermittent fasting with calorie restriction (SH-IF). Comprehensive measures of energy and glucose homeostasis, including energy intake, body weight, energy expenditure, glucose and insulin tolerance, and interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) sympathetic innervation density were obtained. At the end of 8 wk, SG and SH-IF females had better metabolic outcomes than their male counterparts. SG females had improved weight loss maintenance, preservation of fat-free mass (FFM), higher total energy expenditure (TEE), normal locomotor activity, and reduced plasma insulin and white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammatory markers. SH-IF females also had lower plasma insulin and WAT inflammatory markers, and higher TEE than SH-IF males, despite their lower FFM. In addition, SH-IF females had higher iBAT sympathetic nerve density than SG and SH-AL females, whereas there were no differences among males. Notably, SH-IF mice of both sexes had the most improved glucose tolerance, highlighting the benefits of fasting, irrespective of weight loss.

S1P associates with HDL by binding to apolipoprotein M (ApoM). Insulin resistance is a major driver of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk. However, the mechanisms linking alterations in insulin signaling with plasma lipoprotein metabolism are incompletely understood. The insulin-repressible FoxO transcription factors mediate key effects of hepatic insulin action on glucose and lipoprotein metabolism. This work tested whether hepatic insulin signaling regulates HDL-S1P and aimed to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. We report that insulin-resistant, nondiabetic individuals had decreased HDL-S1P levels, but no change in total plasma S1P. This also occurred in insulin-resistant db/db mice, which had low ApoM and a specific reduction of S1P in the HDL fraction, with no change in total plasma S1P levels. Using mice lacking hepatic FoxOs (L-FoxO1,3,4), we found that hepatic FoxOs were required for ApoM expression.

We found that BA pools, especially those low in 12HBAs, induce cellular manganese efflux and that Slc30a10 induction by BA pools is driven primarily by lithocholic acid signaling via the vitamin D receptor.

We then showed that serum APOC3 levels predict incident CVD events in subjects with T1DM in the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study. To explore underlying mechanisms, we investigated the impact of Apoc3 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) on lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis in a mouse model of T1DM. Apoc3 ASO treatment abolished the increased hepatic Apoc3 expression in diabetic mice - resulting in lower levels of TRLs - without improving glycemic control. APOC3 suppression also prevented arterial accumulation of APOC3-containing lipoprotein particles, macrophage foam cell formation, and the accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic mice. Our observations demonstrate that relative insulin deficiency increases APOC3 and that this results in elevated levels of TRLs and accelerated atherosclerosis in a mouse model of T1DM.

Bile acid metabolism, in turn, is controlled by several nutrient-sensitive transcription factors. Altered intrahepatic glucose signaling in type 2 diabetes associates with perturbed bile acid synthesis. We aimed to characterize the regulatory role of the primary intracellular metabolite of glucose, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), on bile acid metabolism. Hepatic gene expression patterns and bile acid composition were analyzed in mice that accumulate G6P in the liver, that is, liver-specific glucose-6-phosphatase knockout (L-G6pc-/- ) mice, and mice treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of the G6P transporter. Hepatic G6P accumulation induces sterol 12\u03b1-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1) expression, which is mediated by the major glucose-sensitive transcription factor, carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). Activation of the G6P-ChREBP-CYP8B1 axis increases the relative abundance of cholic-acid-derived bile acids and induces physiologically relevant shifts in bile composition. The G6P-ChREBP-dependent change in bile acid hydrophobicity associates with elevated plasma campesterol/cholesterol ratio and reduced fecal neutral sterol loss, compatible with enhanced intestinal cholesterol absorption.

We investigated the requirement for dietary fat in the phenotype using a fat-free diet. Cyp8b1-/- mice were resistant to Western diet-induced body weight gain, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. These changes were associated with increased fecal calories, due to malabsorption of hydrolyzed dietary triglycerides. This was reversed by treating the mice with taurocholic acid, the major 12\u03b1-hydroxylated BA species.

In type 2 diabetes, levels of the former are low and the latter are exaggerated, posing a pathophysiologic and therapeutic conundrum. A branching model of insulin signalling, with FoxO1 presiding over glucose production and Srebp-1c regulating lipogenesis, provides a potential explanation. Here we illustrate an alternative mechanism that integrates glucose production and lipogenesis under the unifying control of FoxO. Liver-specific ablation of three FoxOs (L-FoxO1,3,4) prevents the induction of glucose-6-phosphatase and the repression of glucokinase during fasting, thus increasing lipogenesis at the expense of glucose production. We document a similar pattern in the early phases of diet-induced insulin resistance, and propose that FoxOs are required to enable the liver to direct nutritionally derived carbons to glucose versus lipid metabolism. Our data underscore the heterogeneity of hepatic insulin resistance during progression from the metabolic syndrome to overt diabetes, and the conceptual challenge of designing therapies that curtail glucose production without promoting hepatic lipid accumulation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Fasting", "Forkhead Box Protein O1", "Forkhead Box Protein O3", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Glucokinase", "Glucose", "Glucose-6-Phosphatase", "Insulin", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lipogenesis", "Liver", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Haeusler", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kirsten", "Last Name": "Hartil", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein University, Bronx, New York 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bhavapriya", "Last Name": "Vaitheesvaran", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein University, Bronx, New York 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Isabel", "Last Name": "Arrieta-Cruz", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein University, Bronx, New York 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colette M", "Last Name": "Knight", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein University, Bronx, New York 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua R", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helene L", "Last Name": "Kammoun", "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Metabolism Laboratory, Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Febbraio", "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Metabolism Laboratory, Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Gutierrez-Juarez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein University, Bronx, New York 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irwin J", "Last Name": "Kurland", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein University, Bronx, New York 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2014Oct13"}, {"PMID": "23898186", "Title": "Mod5 protein binds to tRNA gene complexes and affects local transcriptional silencing.", "Abstract": "The tRNA gene-mediated (tgm) silencing of RNA polymerase II promoters is dependent on subnuclear clustering of the tRNA genes, but genetic analysis shows that the silencing requires additional mechanisms. We have identified proteins that bind tRNA gene transcription complexes and are required for tgm silencing but not required for gene clustering. One of the proteins, Mod5, is a tRNA modifying enzyme that adds an N6-isopentenyl adenosine modification at position 37 on a small number of tRNAs in the cytoplasm, although a subpopulation of Mod5 is also found in the nucleus. Recent publications have also shown that Mod5 has tumor suppressor characteristics in humans as well as confers drug resistance through prion-like misfolding in yeast. Here, we show that a subpopulation of Mod5 associates with tRNA gene complexes in the nucleolus. This association occurs and is required for tgm silencing regardless of whether the pre-tRNA transcripts are substrates for Mod5 modification. In addition, Mod5 is bound to nuclear pre-tRNA transcripts, although they are not substrates for the A37 modification. Lastly, we show that truncation of the tRNA transcript to remove the normal tRNA structure also alleviates silencing, suggesting that synthesis of intact pre-tRNAs is required for the silencing mechanism. These results are discussed in light of recent results showing that silencing near tRNA genes also requires chromatin modification.", "Keywords": ["Maf1", "RNA silencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Alkyl and Aryl Transferases", "Arabidopsis", "Atorvastatin", "Blotting, Northern", "Cell Nucleolus", "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation", "Cloning, Molecular", "DNA Primers", "Gene Silencing", "Heptanoic Acids", "Humans", "Immunoprecipitation", "In Situ Hybridization", "Oligonucleotides", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Pyrroles", "RNA Polymerase II", "RNA, Transfer", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Pratt-Hyatt", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0606, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dave A", "Last Name": "Pai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Haeusler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Glenn G", "Last Name": "Wozniak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul D", "Last Name": "Good", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erin L", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian X", "Last Name": "McLeod", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anita K", "Last Name": "Hopper", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Engelke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Aug13"}, {"PMID": "23884887", "Title": "Human insulin resistance is associated with increased plasma levels of 12\u03b1-hydroxylated bile acids.", "Abstract": "Bile acids (BAs) exert pleiotropic metabolic effects, and physicochemical properties of different BAs affect their function. In rodents, insulin regulates BA composition, in part by regulating the BA 12\u03b1-hydroxylase CYP8B1. However, it is unclear whether a similar effect occurs in humans. To address this question, we examined the relationship between clamp-measured insulin sensitivity and plasma BA composition in a cohort of 200 healthy subjects and 35 type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. In healthy subjects, insulin resistance (IR) was associated with increased 12\u03b1-hydroxylated BAs (cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and their conjugated forms). Furthermore, ratios of 12\u03b1-hydroxylated/non-12\u03b1-hydroxylated BAs were associated with key features of IR, including higher insulin, proinsulin, glucose, glucagon, and triglyceride (TG) levels and lower HDL cholesterol. In T2D patients, BAs were nearly twofold elevated, and more hydrophobic, compared with healthy subjects, although we did not observe disproportionate increases in 12\u03b1-hydroxylated BAs. In multivariate analysis of the whole dataset, controlling for sex, age, BMI, and glucose tolerance status, higher 12\u03b1-hydroxy/non-12\u03b1-hydroxy BA ratios were associated with lower insulin sensitivity and higher plasma TGs. These findings suggest a role for 12\u03b1-hydroxylated BAs in metabolic abnormalities in the natural history of T2D and raise the possibility of developing insulin-sensitizing therapeutics based on manipulations of BA composition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Bile Acids and Salts", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Haeusler", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Brenno", "Last Name": "Astiarraga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stefania", "Last Name": "Camastra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ele", "Last Name": "Ferrannini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}]
