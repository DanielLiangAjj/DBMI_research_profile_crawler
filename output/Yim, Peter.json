To evaluate potential biomarkers of coagulopathy and disease severity in COVID-19, we measured plasma levels of eight biomarkers potentially associated with coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function in 43 controls and 63 COVID-19 patients, including 47 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 16 non-ICU patients. COVID-19 patients showed significantly elevated levels of fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and its inhibitor plasminogen activation inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), as well as ST2 (the receptor for interleukin-33) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) compared to the control group. We found that higher levels of t-PA, ST2, and vWF at the time of admission were associated with lower survival rates, and that thrombotic events were more frequent in patients with initial higher levels of vWF. These results support a predictive role of specific biomarkers such as t-PA and vWF in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. The data provide support for the case that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is fibrin-mediated, but also highlights the important role that vWF may play in the genesis of thromboses in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Interventions designed to enhance fibrinolysis might prove to be useful adjuncts in the treatment of coagulopathy in a subset of COVID-19 patients.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Coagulopathy", "Fibrinolysis", "PAI-1", "ST2", "vWF"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "COVID-19", "von Willebrand Factor", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator", "Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein", "Thrombosis", "Fibrinolysis", "Blood Coagulation Disorders", "Biomarkers", "Thrombophilia", "Fibrin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Cabrera-Garcia", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Miltiades", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. anm2136@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Yim", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Parsons", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katerina", "Last Name": "Elisman", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad Taghi", "Last Name": "Mansouri", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gebhard", "Last Name": "Wagener", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. gw72@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Neil L", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. nh2298@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "International journal of hematology", "PubDate": "2022Dec"}, {"PMID": "34975518", "Title": "Light-Mediated Inhibition of Colonic Smooth Muscle Constriction and Colonic Motility via Opsin 3.", "Abstract": "Opsin photoreceptors outside of the central nervous system have been shown to mediate smooth muscle photorelaxation in several organs.

Androgens are steroid hormones present at much higher levels in males than females and could be involved in these differences. In adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a FGID that affects 5% to 10% of the population worldwide, we found that free testosterone levels were lower than those in healthy controls and inversely correlated with symptom severity. To determine how this diminished androgen signaling could contribute to bowel dysfunction, we depleted gonadal androgens in adult mice and found that this caused a profound deficit in gastrointestinal transit. Restoring a single androgen hormone was sufficient to rescue this deficit, suggesting that circulating androgens are essential for normal bowel motility in vivo. To determine the site of action, we probed androgen receptor expression in the intestine and discovered, unexpectedly, that a large subset of enteric neurons became androgen-responsive upon puberty. Androgen signaling to these neurons was required for normal colonic motility in adult mice.

In the present study, we characterized the cellular signaling mechanisms of photorelaxation.

We then demonstrated colocalization of OPN3 and G\u03b1s using co-IP and proximity ligation assays in primary human ASM cells, which was further supported by an increase in cAMP in mouse trachea treated with blue light compared with dark controls (23\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6 vs. 14\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6 pmol cAMP/ring, P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Preterm labor (PTL) is thought to be the largest reversible cause of sPTB, but current tocolytic therapies are ineffective and associated with systemic side effects from chronic use. Therefore, identifying novel mechanisms that promote human uterine smooth muscle (hUSM) relaxation is essential to improving clinical management of PTL. Here, we aimed to determine if an extraocular opsin receptor (OPN 3,4,5) system is expressed in pregnant hUSM and to characterize how photo-mediated relaxation of pre-contracting hUSM may be facilitated by external application of light. Translational studies were performed with hUSM from healthy late gestation patients (n\u2009=\u20098) and non-pregnant, similarly aged patients undergoing hysterectomy (n\u2009=\u20094). First, RT-PCR screened for mRNA coding for components of the classical extraocular light receptors (OPN 3,4,5). We found a restricted repertoire of opsin receptors (OPN3) expressed in pregnant hUSM tissue. Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm protein expression. Pre-contracting late gestation hUSM strips were studied in functional organ bath studies to determine if photo-mediated relaxation is intensity or wavelength dependent. Functional organ bath studies revealed acute photo-mediated relaxation occurring in an intensity- and wavelength-dependent manner. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation of OPN3 with Gs following light activation suggests that a component of photo-relaxation occurs via G protein-coupled receptor machinery. This is the first report of light-mediated relaxation of pre-contracted human myometrium.

Both relaxed an established ACh-induced contraction in human and guinea pig ex vivo ASM. In contrast, the prevention of an ACh-induced contraction required copretreatment with the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter blocker bumetanide. The combination of compound 13 and bumetanide also potentiated relaxation by the \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol in guinea pig tracheal rings.

Recently, a new family of proteins thought to represent the true CaCCs was identified as the TMEM16 family.

We identified the mRNA expression of eight members of the TMEM16 family in HASM cells and show immunohistochemical evidence of TMEM16A in both cultured and native HASM. Functionally, we demonstrate that the classic chloride channel inhibitor, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB), inhibited halide flux in cultured HASM cells. Moreover, HASM cells displayed classical electrophysiological properties of CaCCs during whole cell electrophysiological recordings, which were blocked by using an antibody selective for TMEM16A. Furthermore, two distinct TMEM16A antagonists (tannic acid and benzbromarone) impaired a substance P-induced contraction in isolated guinea pig tracheal rings. These findings demonstrate that multiple members of this recently described family of CaCCs are expressed in HASM cells, they display classic electrophysiological properties of CaCCs, and they modulate contractile tone in airway smooth muscle.
