We tested associations of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), the ratio of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D metabolite ratio, VDMR), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) concentrations measured in serum with risk of hip and vertebral fractures in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The study cohort of 6466 participants was without clinically apparent cardiovascular disease and was 39% White, 27% Black, 22% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese. The mean age was 62\u2009years, and 53% were female. There were 128 hip and vertebral fractures over a mean follow-up of 14.2\u2009years. 25(OH)D, the VDMR, PTH, and FGF-23 were not significantly associated with fracture risk after adjustment for demographics, diabetes, smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, medication use, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Principal component analysis did not suggest differences in linear combinations of 25(OH)D, the VDMR, PTH, and FGF-23 between participants who experienced fractures and those who did not. We did not observe significant interaction between race and ethnicity and any biomarker of vitamin D metabolism on fracture risk. In conclusion, none of the four serum biomarkers of vitamin D metabolism investigated showed a significant association with fracture risk in relatively healthy multiethnic populations. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

We investigated whether abnormal LA structure and function, greater supraventricular ectopy, and intermittent AF are associated with small vessel disease on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Methods and Results In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, 967 participants completed 14-day ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, speckle tracking echocardiography and, a median 17\u2009months later, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. We assessed associations of LA volume index and reservoir strain, supraventricular ectopy, and prevalent AF with brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of small vessel disease and atrophy. The mean age of participants was 72\u2009years; 53% were women. In multivariable models, LA enlargement was associated with lower white matter fractional anisotropy and greater prevalence of microbleeds; reduced LA strain, indicating worse LA function, was associated with more microbleeds. More premature atrial contractions were associated with lower total gray matter volume. Compared with no AF, intermittent AF (prevalent AF with <100% AF during electrocardiographic monitoring) was associated with lower white matter fractional anisotropy (-0.25 SDs [95% CI, -0.44 to -0.07]) and greater prevalence of microbleeds (prevalence ratio: 1.42 [95% CI, 1.12-1.79]). Conclusions In individuals without a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, alterations of LA structure and function, including enlargement, reduced strain, frequent premature atrial contractions, and intermittent AF, were associated with increased markers of small vessel disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging provides sensitive measurement of brain morphology and vascular brain injury. However, associations of risk factors with brain magnetic resonance imaging findings have largely been studied in White participants. We investigated associations of race, ethnicity, and cardiovascular risk factors with brain morphology and white matter (WM) injury in a diverse population. Methods and Results In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, measures were made in 2018 to 2019 of total brain volume, gray matter and WM volume, and WM injury, including WM hyperintensity volume and WM fractional anisotropy. We assessed cross-sectional associations of race and ethnicity and of cardiovascular risk factors with magnetic resonance imaging measures. Magnetic resonance imaging data were complete in 1036 participants; 25% Black, 15% Chinese-American, 19% Hispanic, and 41% White. Mean (SD) age was 72 (8) years and 53% were women. Although WM injury was greater in Black than in White participants in a minimally adjusted model, additional adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic status each attenuated this association, rendering it nonsignificant. Overall, greater average WM hyperintensity volume was associated with older age and current smoking (69% greater vs never smoking); lower fractional anisotropy was additionally associated with higher diastolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, and diabetes.

the response to vitamin D supplementation. To enhance internal and external validity and reduce cost, the INVITe trial was nested within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), an ongoing prospective observational cohort study. The INVITe trial enrolled a community-based population of 666 racially and ethnically diverse participants from January 2017 to April 2019. This represents 30% of 2210 MESA participants approached for screening, and 96% of those found to be eligible. Barriers to enrollment included delayed initiation of the trial relative to scheduled MESA study visits, a lower number of available MESA participants than expected, and a high prevalence (18%) of high-dose vitamin D supplementation (>1000\u00a0IU daily, an exclusion criterion). The final study visit was attended by 611 participants (92%), and median adherence was 98%. Our experience suggests that integration of a randomized trial into an existing observational cohort study may leverage strengths of the source population and enhance enrollment, retention, and adherence, although with limited enrollment capacity. The INVITe trial will use rigorously-collected data to advance understanding of individual determinants of vitamin D response.", "Keywords": ["Clinical trial", "Observational cohort study", "Pharmacogenomics", "Vitamin D"], "MeSH terms": ["Atherosclerosis", "Cholecalciferol", "Dietary Supplements", "Double-Blind Method", "Humans", "Prospective Studies", "Vitamin D", "Vitamins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ian H", "Last Name": "de Boer", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology and Kidney Research Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States of America.

However, previous studies have been limited to predominantly White populations despite differences in the distribution and metabolism of 25(OH)D by race/ethnicity. We determined associations of serum 25(OH)D, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH2)D3), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) with BMD among 1773 adult participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) in a staggered cross-sectional study design. Vitamin D metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and PTH using a 2-site immunoassay from serum collected in 2000-2002. Volumetric trabecular lumbar BMD was measured from computed tomography scans performed in 2002-2005 expressed as g/cm(3). We used linear regression and graphical methods to compare associations of vitamin D metabolite and PTH concentrations with BMD as the outcomes measure among White (n=714), Black (n=353), Chinese (n=249), and Hispanic (n=457) participants. Serum 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH2)D3 concentrations were highest among Whites and lowest among Blacks. BMD was greatest among Black participants. Higher serum 25(OH)D was only associated with higher BMD among Whites and Chinese participants (P-for-interaction=0.054). Comparing the lowest category of 25(OH)D (<20 ng/ml) to the highest (\u226530 ng/ml), the adjusted mean difference in BMD was -8.1g/cm3 (95% CI -14.8, -1.4) for Whites; -10.2g/cm3 (-20.4, 0.0) for Chinese vs. 8.8 g/cm3 (-2.8, 20.5) for Black and -1.1g/cm3 (-8.3, 6.2) for Hispanic. Similar results were observed for serum 24,25(OH2)D3. Serum PTH was not associated with BMD. In a multi-ethnic population, associations of 25(OH)D with BMD were strongest among White and Chinese participants and null among Black and Hispanic participants.
