Strategies bypassing smoothened and/or identifying additional downstream components of the Hedgehog pathway could provide novel antitumor targets with a better therapeutic index. Sry-related high mobility group box 9 (SOX9) is a Hedgehog/glioma-associated oncogene homolog-regulated transcription factor known to be overexpressed in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). A sequence motif search for SOX9-responsive elements identified three motifs in the promoter region of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In murine BCC cells, SOX9 occupies the mTOR promoter and induces its transcriptional activity. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of SOX9, as well as smoothened inhibition by itraconazole and vismodegib, reduces mTOR expression and the phosphorylation of known downstream mTOR targets. These effects culminate in diminishing the proliferative capacity of BCC cells, demonstrating a direct mechanistic link between the Hedgehog and mTOR pathways capable of driving BCC growth. Furthermore, rapamycin, a pharmacologic mTOR inhibitor, suppressed the growth of UV-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/-/SKH-1 mice, a model that closely mimics the accelerated BCC growth pattern of patients with basal cell nevus syndrome. Our data demonstrate that Hedgehog signaling converges on mTOR via SOX9, and highlight the SOX9-mTOR axis as a viable additional target downstream of smoothened that could enhance tumor elimination in patients with BCC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Carcinoma, Basal Cell", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "HEK293 Cells", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Hairless", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasms, Experimental", "Phosphorylation", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "RNA, Small Interfering", "SOX9 Transcription Factor", "Signal Transduction", "Skin", "Skin Neoplasms", "Smoothened Receptor", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Tissue Array Analysis", "Ultraviolet Rays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arianna L", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.

While the inhibition of p38 signaling is implicated in the impaired capacity to repair ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage-a primary risk factor for human skin cancers-its mechanism of action in skin carcinogenesis remains unclear, as both anti-proliferative and survival functions have been previously described. In this study, we utilized cultured keratinocytes, murine tumorigenesis models, and human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) specimens to assess the effect of p38 in this regard. UV irradiation of normal human keratinocytes increased the expression of all four p38 isoforms (\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3/\u03b4); whereas irradiation of p53-deficient A431 keratinocytes derived from a human SCC selectively decreased p38\u03b1, without affecting other isoforms. p38\u03b1 levels are decreased in the majority of human cutaneous SCCs assessed by tissue microarray, suggesting a tumor-suppressive effect of p38\u03b1 in SCC pathogenesis. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of p38\u03b1 and in A431 cells increased cell proliferation, which was in turn associated with increases in NAPDH oxidase (NOX2) activity as well as intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). These changes led to enhanced invasiveness of A431 cells as assessed by the matrigel invasion assay. Chronic treatment of p53-/-/SKH-1 mice with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 accelerated UV-induced SCC carcinogenesis and increased the expression of NOX2. NOX2 knockdown suppressed the augmented growth of A431 xenografts treated with SB203580. These findings indicate that in the absence of p53, p38\u03b1 deficiency drives SCC growth and progression that is associated with enhanced NOX2 expression and ROS formation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Humans", "Imidazoles", "Keratinocytes", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Microarray Analysis", "NADPH Oxidase 2", "NADPH Oxidases", "Pyridines", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Skin Neoplasms", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Ultraviolet Rays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hamid Reza", "Last Name": "Rezvani", "Affiliation": "Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Univ. de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; INSERM, Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Jung Ho", "Last Name": "Back", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mohsen", "Last Name": "Hosseini", "Affiliation": "Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Univ. de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; INSERM, Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Xiuwei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yucui", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Walid", "Last Name": "Mahfouf", "Affiliation": "Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Univ. de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; INSERM, Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Houssam", "Last Name": "Raad", "Affiliation": "Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Univ. de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; INSERM, Bioth\u00e9rapies des maladies g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques et cancers, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Grace", "Last Name": "Ragi", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad", "Last Name": "Athar", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Arianna L", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Bickers", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24718427", "Title": "Strange bedfellows.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Austria", "Germany", "History, 20th Century", "Keratoderma, Palmoplantar", "Syndrome", "Terminology as Topic", "World War II"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Walter H C", "Last Name": "Burgdorf", "Affiliation": "Retired."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Bickers", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Leonard J", "Last Name": "Hoenig", "Affiliation": "private practice, Pembroke Pines, Florida."}], "Journal": "JAMA dermatology", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}, {"PMID": "24631180", "Title": "Hair follicle disruption facilitates pathogenesis to UVB-induced cutaneous inflammation and basal cell carcinoma development in Ptch(+/-) mice.", "Abstract": "Hairless mice carrying homozygous mutations in hairless gene manifest rudimentary hair follicles (HFs), epidermal cysts, hairless phenotype, and enhanced susceptibility to squamous cell carcinomas. However, their susceptibility to basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), a neoplasm considered originated from HF-localized stem cells, is unknown. To demonstrate the role of HFs in BCC development, we bred Ptch(+/-)/C57BL6 with SKH-1 hairless mice, followed by brother-sister cross to get F2 homozygous mutant (hairless) or wild-type (haired) mice. UVB-induced inflammation was less pronounced in shaved haired than in hairless mice. In hairless mice, inflammatory infiltrate was found around the rudimentary HFs and epidermal cysts. Expression of epidermal IL1f6, S100a8, vitamin D receptor, repetin, and major histocompatibility complex II, biomarkers depicting susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation, was also higher. In these animals, HF disruption altered susceptibility to UVB-induced BCCs. Tumor onset in hairless mice was 10 weeks earlier than in haired littermates. The incidence of BCCs was significantly higher in hairless than in haired animals; however, the magnitude of sonic hedgehog signaling did not differ significantly. Overall, 100% of hairless mice developed >12 tumors per mouse after 32 weeks of UVB therapy, whereas haired mice developed fewer than three tumors per mouse after 44 weeks of long-term UVB irradiation. Tumors in hairless mice were more aggressive than in haired littermates and manifested decreased E-cadherin and enhanced mesenchymal proteins.

Our aim was to elucidate the role of the retinol-binding protein receptor STRA6, mediating cellular uptake of retinol, on skin structure and function. Our results indicate that STRA6 is constitutively expressed in human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts and is regulated via RAR/RXR-mediated pathways. HaCaT (Human adult low Calcium high Temperature) cells with stable STRA6 knockdown (STRA6KD) showed increased proliferation. Consistently, human organotypic 3D skin models using stable STRA6KD HaCaT cells showed a significantly thicker epidermis and enhanced expression of activation, differentiation, and proliferation markers. The effects were reversible after treatment with free retinol. Human skin reconstitution employing STRA6KD HaCaT cells leads to massive epithelial thickening under in vivo conditions in SCID mice. We propose that STRA6KD could lead to cellular vitamin A deficiency in keratinocytes. Consequently, STRA6 has a role for regulating retinoid homeostasis and in helping to program signaling that drives proliferation and differentiation of human skin cells. By its influence on hyperproliferation-associated differentiation, STRA6 could also have a role in skin regeneration and could be a target for pharmacological approaches to improve wound healing.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Cell Nucleus", "Cell Proliferation", "Epidermis", "Fibroblasts", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Keratinocytes", "Ligands", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, SCID", "Receptors, Retinoic Acid", "Regeneration", "Skin", "Tretinoin", "Vitamin A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Skazik", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Hospital, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philipp M", "Last Name": "Amann", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Hospital, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Heise", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Hospital, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Yvonne", "Last Name": "Marquardt", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Hospital, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Katharina", "Last Name": "Czaja", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Hospital, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Arianna", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ralph", "Last Name": "R\u00fchl", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary and."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Kurschat", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hans F", "Last Name": "Merk", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Hospital, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Bickers", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jens M", "Last Name": "Baron", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergology, University Hospital, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany."}], "Journal": "The Journal of investigative dermatology", "PubDate": "2014Jun"}]
