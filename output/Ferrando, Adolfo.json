The oncogenic activity of NUP98 fusion proteins is dependent on the interaction between Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 and menin. NUP98-rearranged (NUP98-r) leukemia cells also rely on specific kinases, including CDK6 and/or FLT3, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of these kinases and menin could overcome limited sensitivity to single agents. Here, we found that combinations of menin inhibitor, MI-3454, with kinase inhibitors targeting either CDK6 (Palbociclib) or FLT3 (Gilteritinib) strongly enhance the anti-leukemic effect of menin inhibition in NUP98-r leukemia models. We found strong synergistic effects of both combinations on cell growth, colony formation and differentiation in patient samples with NUP98 translocations. These combinations also markedly augmented anti-leukemic efficacy of menin inhibitor in Patient Derived Xenograft models of NUP98-r leukemia. Despite inhibiting two unrelated kinases, when Palbociclib or Gilteritinib were combined with the menin inhibitor, they affected similar pathways relevant to leukemogenesis, including cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and differentiation. This study provides strong rationale for clinical translation of the combination of menin and kinase inhibitors as novel treatments for NUP98-r leukemia, supporting the unexplored combinations of epigenetic drugs with kinase inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hongzhi", "Last Name": "Miao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Ropa", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University, School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trupta", "Last Name": "Purohit", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "EunGi", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria-Luisa", "Last Name": "Sulis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomasz", "Last Name": "Cierpicki", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. tomaszc@umich.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jolanta", "Last Name": "Grembecka", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA. jolantag@umich.edu."}], "Journal": "Leukemia", "PubDate": "2024Jun18"}, {"PMID": "38219917", "Title": "Romidepsin and Afatinib Abrogate Jak-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription Signaling and Elicit Synergistic Antitumor Effects in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma.", "Abstract": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are mature lymphoid neoplasias resulting from the malignant transformation of skin-resident T-cells.

The NOTCH is a transmembrane receptor protein activated by \u03b3\u2011secretase. \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are a NOTCH\u2011targeted therapy for T\u2011ALL. However, their clinical application has not been successful due to adverse events (primarily gastrointestinal toxicity), limited efficacy, and drug resistance caused by several mechanisms, including activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Nelfinavir is an human immunodeficiency virus 1 aspartic protease inhibitor and has been repurposed as an anticancer drug. It acts by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway. Thus, it was hypothesized that nelfinavir might inhibit the NOTCH pathway via \u03b3\u2011secretase inhibition and blockade of aspartic protease presenilin, which would make nelfinavir effective against NOTCH\u2011associated T\u2011ALL. The present study assessed the efficacy of nelfinavir against T\u2011ALL cells and investigated mechanisms of action in\u00a0vitro and in preclinical treatment studies using a SCL\u2011LMO1 transgenic mouse model. Nelfinavir blocks presenilin 1 processing and inhibits \u03b3\u2011secretase activity as well as the NOTCH1 pathway, thus suppressing T\u2011ALL cell viability. Additionally, microarray analysis of nelfinavir\u2011treated T\u2011ALL cells showed that nelfinavir upregulated mRNA levels of CHAC1 (glutathione\u2011specific \u03b3\u2011glutamylcyclotransferase 1, a negative regulator of NOTCH) and sestrin 2 (SESN2; a negative regulator of mTOR). As both factors are upregulated by ER stress, this confirmed that nelfinavir induced ER stress in T\u2011ALL cells. Moreover, nelfinavir suppressed NOTCH1 mRNA expression in microarray analyses. These findings suggest that nelfinavir inhibited the NOTCH1 pathway by downregulating NOTCH1 mRNA expression, upregulating CHAC1 and suppressing \u03b3\u2011secretase via presenilin 1 inhibition and the mTOR pathway by upregulating SESN2 via ER stress induction. Further, nelfinavir exhibited therapeutic efficacy against T\u2011ALL in an SCL\u2011LMO1 transgenic mouse model.

We have developed a bioengineered tissue platform for studying radiation damage in individualized settings. To demonstrate its utility, we determined the effects of radiation using engineered models of two human tissues known to be radiosensitive: engineered cardiac tissues (eCT, a target of chronic radiation damage) and engineered bone marrow (eBM, a target of acute radiation damage). We report the effects of high-dose neutrons, a proxy for simulated galactic cosmic rays, on the expression of key genes implicated in tissue responses to ionizing radiation, phenotypic and functional changes in both tissues, and proof-of-principle application of radioprotective agents. We further determined the extent of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and matrix remodeling gene expression changes, and found that these changes were associated with an early hypertrophic phenotype in eCT and myeloid skewing in eBM.

Here we use exome sequence data on 628,388 individuals to identify 40,208 carriers of clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Using genome-wide and exome-wide association analyses, we identify 24 loci (21 of which are novel) where germline genetic variation influences predisposition to CHIP, including missense variants in the lymphocytic antigen coding gene LY75, which are associated with reduced incidence of CHIP. We also identify novel rare variant associations with clonal haematopoiesis and telomere length. Analysis of 5,041 health traits from the UK Biobank (UKB) found relationships between CHIP and severe COVID-19 outcomes, cardiovascular disease, haematologic traits, malignancy, smoking, obesity, infection and all-cause mortality. Longitudinal and Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that CHIP is associated with solid cancers, including non-melanoma skin cancer and lung cancer, and that CHIP linked to DNMT3A is associated with the subsequent development of myeloid but not lymphoid leukaemias. Additionally, contrary to previous findings from the initial 50,000\u2009UKB exomes6, our results in the full sample do not support a role for IL-6 inhibition in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease among CHIP carriers. Our findings demonstrate that CHIP represents a complex set of heterogeneous phenotypes with shared and unique germline genetic causes and varied clinical implications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

Importantly, CRCD2 treatment also enhanced the cytotoxic activity of 6-MP in NT5C2 wild-type leukemias, leading to the identification of NT5C2 Ser502 phosphorylation as a novel NT5C2-mediated mechanism of 6-MP resistance in this disease. These results uncover an unanticipated role of nongenetic NT5C2 activation as a driver of 6-MP resistance in ALL and demonstrate the potential of NT5C2 inhibitor therapy for enhancing the efficacy of thiopurine maintenance therapy and overcoming resistance at relapse.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mercaptopurine", "5'-Nucleotidase", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Recurrence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Clara", "Last Name": "Reglero", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Chelsea L", "Last Name": "Dieck", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Arie", "Last Name": "Zask", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Farhad", "Last Name": "Forouhar", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anouchka P", "Last Name": "Laurent", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Wen-Hsuan W", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Albero", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hannah I", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cindy", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Julie M", "Last Name": "Gastier-Foster", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Mignon L", "Last Name": "Loh", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology, Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplant, and Cellular Therapies, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Teresa", "Last Name": "Palomero", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo A", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2022Nov02"}, {"PMID": "35589701", "Title": "Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I reverses NOTCH1-driven metabolic reprogramming in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.", "Abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is commonly driven by activating mutations in NOTCH1 that facilitate glutamine oxidation. Here we identify oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) as a critical pathway for leukemia cell survival and demonstrate a direct relationship between NOTCH1, elevated OxPhos gene expression, and acquired chemoresistance in pre-leukemic and leukemic models. Disrupting OxPhos with IACS-010759, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, causes potent growth inhibition through induction of metabolic shut-down and redox imbalance in NOTCH1-mutated and less so in NOTCH1-wt T-ALL cells. Mechanistically, inhibition of OxPhos induces a metabolic reprogramming into glutaminolysis. We show that pharmacological blockade of OxPhos combined with inducible knock-down of glutaminase, the key glutamine enzyme, confers synthetic lethality in mice harboring NOTCH1-mutated T-ALL. We leverage on this synthetic lethal interaction to demonstrate that IACS-010759 in combination with chemotherapy containing L-asparaginase, an enzyme that uncovers the glutamine dependency of leukemic cells, causes reduced glutaminolysis and profound tumor reduction in pre-clinical models of human T-ALL.

Nevertheless, kinases can be activated in the absence of genetic defects. Thus, phosphoproteomics can provide information on pathway activation and signaling networks that offer opportunities for targeted therapy. Here, we describe a mass spectrometry-based global phosphoproteomic profiling of 11\u2009T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines to identify targetable kinases. We report a comprehensive dataset consisting of 21,000 phosphosites on 4,896 phosphoproteins, including 217 kinases.

However, despite striking initial responses, osimertinib-treated patients eventually develop lethal metastatic relapse, often to the brain. Although osimertinib-refractory brain relapse is a major clinical challenge, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using metastatic models of EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we show that cancer cells expressing high intracellular S100A9 escape osimertinib and initiate brain relapses. Mechanistically, S100A9 upregulates ALDH1A1 expression and activates the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway in osimertinib-refractory cancer cells. We demonstrate that the genetic repression of S100A9, ALDH1A1, or RA receptors (RAR) in cancer cells, or treatment with a pan-RAR antagonist, dramatically reduces brain metastasis. Importantly, S100A9 expression in cancer cells correlates with poor PFS in osimertinib-treated patients.

The pathogenesis is largely unknown, and the treatment is challenging. We previously reported the specific association of the recurrent t(8;12)(q13;p13) chromosomal translocation that creates the ETV6-NCOA2 fusion with T/myeloid leukemias. Here we report that ETV6-NCOA2 initiates T/myeloid leukemia in preclinical models; ectopic expression of ETV6-NCOA2 in mouse bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors induced T/myeloid lymphoma accompanied by spontaneous Notch1-activating mutations. Similarly, cotransduction of human cord blood CD34+ progenitors with ETV6-NCOA2 and a nontransforming NOTCH1 mutant induced T/myeloid leukemia in immunodeficient mice; the immunophenotype and gene expression pattern were similar to those of patient-derived ETV6-NCOA2 leukemias. Mechanistically, we show that ETV6-NCOA2 forms a transcriptional complex with ETV6 and the histone acetyltransferase p300, leading to derepression of ETV6 target genes. The expression of ETV6-NCOA2 in human and mouse nonthymic hematopoietic progenitor cells induces transcriptional dysregulation, which activates a lymphoid program while failing to repress the expression of myeloid genes such as CSF1 and MEF2C. The ETV6-NCOA2 induced arrest at an early immature T-cell developmental stage.

"Mutations in epigenetic regulators are common in relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here, we uncovered the mechanism underlying the relapse of ALL driven by an activating mutation of the NSD2 histone methyltransferase (p.E1099K). Using high-throughput drug screening, we found that NSD2-mutant cells were specifically resistant to glucocorticoids. Correction of this mutation restored glucocorticoid sensitivity. The transcriptional response to glucocorticoids was blocked in NSD2-mutant cells due to depressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels and the failure of glucocorticoids to autoactivate GR expression. Although H3K27me3 was globally decreased by NSD2 p.E1099K, H3K27me3 accumulated at the NR3C1 (GR) promoter. Pretreatment of NSD2 p.E1099K cell lines and patient-derived xenograft samples with PRC2 inhibitors reversed glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo. PRC2 inhibitors restored NR3C1 autoactivation by glucocorticoids, increasing GR levels and allowing GR binding and activation of proapoptotic genes. These findings suggest a new therapeutic approach to relapsed ALL associated with NSD2 mutation. SIGNIFICANCE: NSD2 histone methyltransferase mutations observed in relapsed pediatric ALL drove glucocorticoid resistance by repression of the GR and abrogation of GR gene autoactivation due to accumulation of K3K27me3 at its promoter. Pretreatment with PRC2 inhibitors reversed resistance, suggesting a new therapeutic approach to these patients with ALL.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Child", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Female", "Glucocorticoids", "Histone Methyltransferases", "Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Repressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianping", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Hlavka-Zhang", "Affiliation": "Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan H", "Last Name": "Shrimp", "Affiliation": "National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Crissandra", "Last Name": "Piper", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Daphne", "Last Name": "Dup\u00e9r\u00e9-Rich\u00e9r", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Jacob S", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Duohui", "Last Name": "Jing", "Affiliation": "Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Heidi L", "Last Name": "Casellas Rom\u00e1n", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Catalina", "Last Name": "Troche", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Alok", "Last Name": "Swaroop", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Kulis", "Affiliation": "Fundaci\u00f3 Cl\u00ednic per a la Recerca Biom\u00e8dica, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Jon A", "Last Name": "Oyer", "Affiliation": "Pfizer Inc., Oncology Research and Development, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Christine M", "Last Name": "Will", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Riva", "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Richard L", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo A", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Richard B", "Last Name": "Lock", "Affiliation": "Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Licht", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida. jdlicht@ufl.edu."}], "Journal": "Cancer discovery", "PubDate": "2022Jan"}, {"PMID": "34103329", "Title": "Enhancer Hijacking Drives Oncogenic BCL11B Expression in Lineage-Ambiguous Stem Cell Leukemia.", "Abstract": "Lineage-ambiguous leukemias are high-risk malignancies of poorly understood genetic basis. Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of acute leukemia with expression of myeloid, T lymphoid, and stem cell markers driven by aberrant allele-specific deregulation of BCL11B, a master transcription factor responsible for thymic T-lineage commitment and specification. Mechanistically, this deregulation was driven by chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose BCL11B to superenhancers active in hematopoietic progenitors, or focal amplifications that generate a superenhancer from a noncoding element distal to BCL11B. Chromatin conformation analyses demonstrated long-range interactions of rearranged enhancers with the expressed BCL11B allele and association of BCL11B with activated hematopoietic progenitor cell cis-regulatory elements, suggesting BCL11B is aberrantly co-opted into a gene regulatory network that drives transformation by maintaining a progenitor state. These data support a role for ectopic BCL11B expression in primitive hematopoietic cells mediated by enhancer hijacking as an oncogenic driver of human lineage-ambiguous leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: Lineage-ambiguous leukemias pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to a poorly understood molecular and cellular basis. We identify oncogenic deregulation of BCL11B driven by diverse structural alterations, including de novo superenhancer generation, as the driving feature of a subset of lineage-ambiguous leukemias

deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin has shown remarkable activity as a single agent. However, clinical responses to romidepsin are typically transient, highlighting the need for more effective therapies. In this study, we show synergistic antilymphoma effects of romidepsin in combination with mechlorethamine, an alkylating agent, in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary samples with strong antitumor effects in an in\u00a0vivo model of S\u00e9zary syndrome. Mechanistically, gene expression profiling points to abrogation of Jak/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling as an important mediator of this interaction. Consistently, the combination of mechlorethamine plus romidepsin resulted in downregulation of STAT5 phosphorylation in romidepsin-sensitive cell lines and primary S\u00e9zary syndrome samples, but not in romidepsin-resistant tumors. Moreover, in further support of Jak/STAT signaling as a modulator of romidepsin activity in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, treatment with romidepsin in combination with Jak inhibitors resulted in markedly increased therapeutic responses. Overall, these results support a role for romidepsin plus mechlorethamine in combination in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and uncover a previously unrecognized role for Jak/STAT signaling in the response to romidepsin and romidepsin-based combination therapies in S\u00e9zary syndrome.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Depsipeptides", "Drug Synergism", "Humans", "Janus Kinase Inhibitors", "Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous", "Mechlorethamine", "Mice", "STAT Transcription Factors", "Signal Transduction", "Skin Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose R", "Last Name": "Cortes", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christina C", "Last Name": "Patrone", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stuart Aidan", "Last Name": "Quinn", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuhan", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Sanchez-Martin", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Mackey", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anisha J", "Last Name": "Cooke", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bobby B", "Last Name": "Shih", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anouchka P", "Last Name": "Laurent", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Megan H", "Last Name": "Trager", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo A", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Larisa J", "Last Name": "Geskin", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teresa", "Last Name": "Palomero", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.

Here, we show that activating IL7R pathway mutations and physiological IL7R signaling activate MAPK-ERK signaling, which provokes steroid resistance by phosphorylation of BIM. By mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that phosphorylated BIM is impaired in binding to BCL2, BCLXL and MCL1, shifting the apoptotic balance toward survival. Treatment with MEK inhibitors abolishes this inactivating phosphorylation of BIM and restores its interaction with anti-apoptotic BCL2-protein family members. Importantly, the MEK inhibitor selumetinib synergizes with steroids in both IL7-dependent and IL7-independent steroid resistant pediatric T-ALL PDX samples. Despite the anti-MAPK-ERK activity of ruxolitinib in IL7-induced signaling and JAK1 mutant cells, ruxolitinib only synergizes with steroid treatment in IL7-dependent steroid resistant PDX samples but not in IL7-independent steroid resistant PDX samples. Our study highlights the central role for MAPK-ERK signaling in steroid resistance in T-ALL patients, and demonstrates the broader application of MEK inhibitors over ruxolitinib to resensitize steroid-resistant T-ALL cells.

transformation of T-cell primed hematopoietic progenitors. Although T-ALL is a heterogenous and molecularly complex disease, more than 65% of T-ALL patients carry activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene. The majority of T-ALL-associated NOTCH1 mutations either disrupt the negative regulatory region, allowing signal activation in the absence of ligand binding, or result in truncation of the C-terminal PEST domain involved in the termination of NOTCH1 signaling by proteasomal degradation. To date, retroviral transduction models have relied heavily on the overexpression of aggressively truncated variants of NOTCH1 (such as ICN1 or \u0394E-NOTCH1), which result in supraphysiological levels of signaling activity and are rarely found in human T-ALL. The current protocol describes the method for mouse bone marrow isolation, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC) enrichment, followed by retroviral transduction with an oncogenic mutant form of the NOTCH1 receptor (NOTCH1-L1601P-\u0394P) that closely resembles the gain-of-function mutations most commonly found in patient samples. A hallmark of this forced expression of constitutively active NOTCH1 is a transient wave of extrathymic immature T-cell development, which precedes oncogenic transformation to T-ALL. Furthermore, this approach models leukemic transformation and progression in vivo by allowing for crosstalk between leukemia cells and the microenvironment, an aspect unaccounted for in cell-line based in vitro studies. Thus, the HSC transduction and transplantation model more faithfully recapitulates development of the human disease, providing a highly comprehensive and versatile tool for further in vivo and ex vivo functional studies.", "Keywords": ["Bone marrow", "Hematopoietic stem cell", "In vivo", "Leukemia development", "Mouse model", "NOTCH1 mutations", "NOTCH1 signaling", "Retrovirus", "T-ALL", "Transformation", "Transplantation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Agnieszka A", "Last Name": "Wendorff", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adolfo A", "Last Name": "Ferrando", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Bio-protocol", "PubDate": "2020May20"}, {"PMID": "32924017", "Title": "Combinatorial ETS1-dependent control of oncogenic NOTCH1 enhancers in T-cell leukemia.", "Abstract": "Notch activation is highly prevalent among cancers, in particular T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

To circumvent this barrier in T-ALL, we aimed to inhibit ETS1, a developmentally important T-cell transcription factor previously shown to co-bind Notch response elements. Using complementary genetic approaches in mouse models, we show that ablation of Ets1 leads to strong Notch-mediated suppressive effects on T-cell development and leukemogenesis, but milder intestinal effects than pan-Notch inhibitors. Mechanistically, genome-wide chromatin profiling studies demonstrate that Ets1 inactivation impairs recruitment of multiple Notch-associated factors and Notch-dependent activation of transcriptional elements controlling major Notch-driven oncogenic effector pathways.

To reduce the toxicity of ABT263, we converted it into DT2216, a BCL-XL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), that targets BCL-XL to the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase for degradation. We found that DT2216 was more potent against various BCL-XL-dependent leukemia and cancer cells but considerably less toxic to platelets than ABT263 in vitro because VHL is poorly expressed in platelets.

Here, we demonstrate a role for aberrant chromatin accessibility in the regulation of MYC expression in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Central to this process, the NOTCH1-MYC enhancer (N-Me), a long-range T cell-specific MYC enhancer, shows dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility during T-cell specification and maturation and an aberrant high degree of chromatin accessibility in mouse and human T-ALL cells.

Mechanistically, genetic inactivation of Phf6 in the hematopoietic system enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) long-term self-renewal and hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy by rendering Phf6 knockout HSCs more quiescent and less prone to stress-induced activation. Consistent with a leukemia-initiating tumor suppressor role, inactivation of Phf6 in hematopoietic progenitors lowers the threshold for the development of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL.

Here, we show that the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and the downstream mediators of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-ALL and eradicates leukemia in mouse models of T-ALL, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. HSF1 drives a compact transcriptional program and among the direct HSF1 targets, specific chaperones and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-ALL.

The NOTCH1 signaling status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the response of T-ALL patient samples to HSP90 inhibition.

Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2+/R367Q mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts.

Here we show that mice expressing a constitutive T-cell-specific ThPOK transgene (ThPOK(const) mice) develop thymic lymphomas. These tumors resemble human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in that they predominantly exhibit activating Notch1 mutations. Lymphomagenesis is prevented if thymocyte development is arrested at the DN3 stage by recombination-activating gene (RAG) deficiency, but restored by introduction of a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgene or by a single injection of anti-\u03b1\u03b2TCR antibody into ThPOK(const) RAG-deficient mice, which promotes development to the CD4(+)8(+) (DP) stage. Hence, TCR signals and/or traversal of the DN (double negative) > DP (double positive) checkpoint are required for ThPOK-mediated lymphomagenesis. These results demonstrate a novel link between ThPOK, TCR signaling, and lymphomagenesis. Finally, we present evidence that ectopic ThPOK expression gives rise to a preleukemic and self-perpetuating DN4 lymphoma precursor population.

WT1 mutant AML patients have reduced 5hmC levels similar to TET2/IDH1/IDH2 mutant AML. These mutations are characterized by convergent, site-specific alterations in DNA hydroxymethylation, which drive differential gene expression more than alterations in\u00a0DNA promoter methylation. WT1 overexpression increases global levels of 5hmC, and WT1 silencing reduced 5hmC levels. WT1 physically interacts with TET2 and TET3, and WT1 loss of function results in a similar hematopoietic differentiation phenotype as observed with TET2 deficiency.

This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL.

Drugs that target the function of key epigenetic factors have been approved in the context of haematopoietic disorders, and mutations that affect chromatin modulators in a variety of leukaemias have recently been identified; however, 'epigenetic' drugs are not currently used for T-ALL treatment. Recently, we described that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has a tumour-suppressor role in T-ALL. Here we delineated the role of the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in T-ALL. We show that JMJD3 is essential for the initiation and maintenance of T-ALL, as it controls important oncogenic gene targets by modulating H3K27 methylation. By contrast, we found that UTX functions as a tumour suppressor and is frequently genetically inactivated in T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrated that the small molecule inhibitor GSKJ4 (ref. 5) affects T-ALL growth, by targeting JMJD3 activity. These findings show that two proteins with a similar enzymatic function can have opposing roles in the context of the same disease, paving the way for treating haematopoietic malignancies with a new category of epigenetic inhibitors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Benzazepines", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Histone Demethylases", "Histones", "Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases", "Lysine", "Methylation", "Mice", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Pyrimidines", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Panagiotis", "Last Name": "Ntziachristos", "Affiliation": "1] Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016, USA [2] NYU Cancer Institute and Helen L. and Martin S.
