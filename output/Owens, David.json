Near-continuous monitoring using autosamplers occurred just before, during, and after 5-7 sampling events triggered by rainfall and/or snowmelt. Microbial genetic material was noted at all four locations during all but one sampling event, but was exceedingly variable in time, where one sample would have no detections and the next sample could be a relatively high concentration. The highest microbial sums (microbial concentrations summed over an event) were observed during months in which precipitation exceeded historical averages. Extended wet conditions through the spring thaw resulted in the highest percentage of microbial positive samples, though at relatively low concentrations. Sampling events that followed drier than normal periods showed longer lag times between the onset of precipitation and microbial occurrence, as well as lower microbial detection rates. Although a general lag time pattern was observed at each site, the largest offset in time was observed at the site with the greatest depth to water.

Therefore, using repetitive controller to adjust the level and timing of FES applied to the corresponding muscles, so as to generate the muscle torque opposite to the tremor motion, is a feasible means of tremor suppression. At present, most repetitive control systems based on FES assume that tremor is a fixed single frequency signal, but in fact, tremor may be a multi-frequency signal and the tremor frequency also varies with time. In this paper, the tremor data of intention tremor patients are analyzed from the perspective of frequency, and an adaptive repetitive controller with internal model switching is proposed to suppress tremor signals with different frequencies. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed adaptive repetitive controller based on parallel multiple internal models and series high-order internal model switching can suppress tremor by up to 84.98% on average, which is a significant improvement compared to the traditional single internal model repetitive controller and filter based feedback controller.

The sustainability of these Bt crops is threatened because the corn earworm/bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), is evolving a resistance to these toxins. Using Bt sweet corn as a sentinel plant to monitor the evolution of resistance, collaborators established 146 trials in twenty-five states and five Canadian provinces during 2020-2022. The study evaluated overall changes in the phenotypic frequency of resistance (the ratio of larval densities in Bt ears relative to densities in non-Bt ears) in H. zea populations and the range of resistance allele frequencies for Cry1Ab and Vip3Aa. The results revealed a widespread resistance to Cry1Ab, Cry2Ab2, and Cry1A.105 Cry toxins, with higher numbers of larvae surviving in Bt ears than in non-Bt ears at many trial locations. Depending on assumptions about the inheritance of resistance, allele frequencies for Cry1Ab ranged from 0.465 (dominant resistance) to 0.995 (recessive resistance). Although Vip3Aa provided high control efficacy against H. zea, the results show a notable increase in ear damage and a number of surviving older larvae, particularly at southern locations. Assuming recessive resistance, the estimated resistance allele frequencies for Vip3Aa ranged from 0.115 in the Gulf states to 0.032 at more northern locations. These findings indicate that better resistance management practices are urgently needed to sustain efficacy the of corn and cotton that produce Vip3Aa.", "Keywords": ["Bacillus thuringiensis toxins",

Hamiltonian realization and contraction analysis method.", "Abstract": "The conventional tracking control of mechanical systems is generally based on the stabilization of error dynamics and most of the results can only guarantee asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectories. Since error dynamics are generally time-varying, it is very difficult to find appropriate Lyapunov functions or control Lyapunov functions to complete stability analysis and controller design. To address this limitation, the novel constructive exponential tracking control method is proposed to mechanical systems by utilizing the Hamiltonian realization and contraction analysis in this paper. Firstly, based on the Hamiltonian realization and use the structural characteristics of port-Hamiltonian systems, the exponential tracking controllers are constructed for fully actuated and under-actuated mechanical systems by combining the pre-feedback with feedback control.

Plasma VTG in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) helped us understand their reproductive maturation and investigate it as a biomarker of contaminant exposure. The presence of VTG was screened in plasma from 404 loggerheads from the northwestern Atlantic Ocean using a freshwater turtle antibody in western blots. The concentrations of VTG were semiquantified using band intensities calibrated to results from a loggerhead antibody enzyme-linked immunoassay. The detection and concentrations of VTG were in (from highest to lowest): nesting females, in-water adult females, subadult females, smaller females, unknown sex, and males. Loggerheads from this region begin vitellogenesis at \u224577\u2009cm straight carapace length. We classified VTG expression as abnormal in nine male or juvenile turtles. Organochlorine contaminant (OC) concentrations were measured in blood and/or fat biopsies of some turtles. One abnormal VTG female had the second highest fat polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene concentrations compared among 43 VTG-negative juveniles. The nine VTG-abnormal turtles had average blood PCB concentrations 8.5% higher, but not significantly different, than 46 VTG-negative juveniles (p\u2009=\u20090.453). In turtles less than 77\u2009cm, blood PCB concentrations were significantly, but weakly, correlated with semiquantified VTG concentrations (tau\u2009=\u20090.1, p\u2009=\u20090.004). Greater blood OC concentrations were found in adult females than in males, which motivated the creation of a conceptual model of OC, VTG, and hormone concentrations across a reproductive cycle. A decision tree is also provided incorporating VTG as a sexing tool. Abnormal VTG expression cannot conclusively be linked to endocrine disruption caused by these OC concentrations. Studies should further investigate causes of abnormal VTG expression in wild sea turtles. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;42:1309-1325. \u00a9 2023 SETAC.

Here we report the identification of TINCR as a tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). TINCR is upregulated by UV-induced DNA damage in a TP53-dependent manner in human keratinocytes. Decreased TINCR protein expression is prevalently found in skin and head and neck squamous cell tumors and TINCR expression suppresses the growth of SCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, Tincr knockout mice show accelerated tumor development following UVB skin carcinogenesis and increased penetrance of invasive SCCs.

The goal of our study was to identify intrinsic modulators of basic T lymphocyte activation pathways that could discriminately bolster CD8 anti-tumor effector responses. Using a Tbc1d10c null mouse, we observed marked resistance to a range of tumor types conferred by Tbc1d10c deficiency. Moreover, tumor-bearing Tbc1d10c null mice receiving PD-1 or CTLA-4 monotherapy exhibited a 33% or 90% cure rate, respectively. While Tbc1d10c was not expressed in solid tumor cells, Tbc1d10c disruption selectively augmented CD8 T-cell activation and cytotoxic effector responses and adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells alone was sufficient to recapitulate Tbc1d10c null tumor resistance. Mechanistically, Tbc1d10c suppressed CD8 T-cell activation and anti-tumor function by intersecting canonical NF-\u03baB pathway activation via regulation of Map3k3-mediated IKK\u03b2 phosphorylation. Strikingly, none of these cellular or molecular perturbations in the NF-\u03baB pathway were featured in Tbc1d10c null CD4 T cells. Our findings identify a Tbc1d10c-Map3k3-NF-\u03baB signaling axis as a viable therapeutic target to promote CD8 T-cell anti-tumor immunity while circumventing CD4 T cell-associated cytotoxicity and NF-\u03baB activation in tumor cells.", "Keywords": ["Immuno-oncology", "Map3k3", "NF-\u03baB", "carabin", "melanoma", "squamous cell carcinoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "NF-kappa B", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Neoplasms", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "GTPase-Activating Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adrienne O", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seung-Hyun", "Last Name": "Woo", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Junya", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiyoon", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marlon E", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianli", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rong", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olga", "Last Name": "Yarygina", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danya Z", "Last Name": "Jafri", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Bachelor", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael O", "Last Name": "Finlayson", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh K", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics & Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Hayden", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Oncoimmunology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36096340", "Title": "The Associations of Aortic Valve Sclerosis, Aortic Annular Increased Reflectivity, and Mitral Annular Calcification with Subsequent Aortic Stenosis in Older Individuals: Findings from the Cardiovascular Health Study.", "Abstract": "Although aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) is well described as preceding aortic stenosis (AS), the associations of AS with antecedent mitral annular calcification (MAC) and aortic annular increased reflectivity (AAIR) have not been characterized.

Using a long-term monitoring database and biologically relevant overwintering zones, we modeled the annual and seasonal population dynamics of a common pest, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), based on three overwintering suitability zones throughout North America using four decades of soil temperatures: the southern range (able to persist through winter), transitional zone (uncertain overwintering survivorship), and northern limits (unable to survive winter). Our model indicates H. zea population dynamics are hierarchically structured with continental-level effects that are partitioned into three geographic zones. Seasonal populations were initially detected in the southern range, where they experienced multiple large population peaks. All three zones experienced a final peak between late July (southern range) and mid-August to mid-September (transitional zone and northern limits). The southern range expanded by 3% since 1981 and is projected to increase by twofold by 2099 but the areas of other zones are expected to decrease in the future. These changes suggest larger populations may persist at higher latitudes in the future due to reduced low-temperature lethal events during winter. Because H. zea is a highly migratory pest, predicting when populations accumulate in one region can inform synchronous or lagged population development in other regions. We show the value of combining long-term datasets, remotely sensed data, and laboratory findings to inform forecasting of insect pests.", "Keywords": ["bollworm", "corn earworm", "dispersal",

However, since then, insulin production and purification improved with enhanced technologies, along with a full understanding of the insulin molecule structure. The availability of radio-immunoassays contributed to the unravelling of the physiology of glucose homeostasis, ultimately leading to the adoption of rational models of insulin replacement. The introduction of recombinant DNA technologies has since resulted in the era of both rapid- and long-acting human insulin analogues administered via the subcutaneous route which better mimic the physiology of insulin secretion, leading to the modern basal-bolus regimen. These advances, in combination with improved education and technologies for glucose monitoring, enable people with diabetes to better meet individual glycaemic goals with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia.

Addressing this knowledge gap could support the design of antiviral agents as well as further our understanding of viral-host protein interactions, infectivity, pathogenicity, and innate immune system clearance. Lipidomics revealed that the virus envelope comprised mainly phospholipids (PLs), with some cholesterol and sphingolipids, and with cholesterol/phospholipid ratio similar to lysosomes. Unlike cellular membranes, procoagulant amino-PLs were present on the external side of the viral envelope at levels exceeding those on activated platelets. Accordingly, virions directly promoted blood coagulation. To investigate whether these differences could enable selective targeting of the viral envelope in vivo, we tested whether oral rinses containing lipid-disrupting chemicals could reduce infectivity. Products containing PL-disrupting surfactants (such as cetylpyridinium chloride) met European virucidal standards in vitro; however, components that altered the critical micelle concentration reduced efficacy, and products containing essential oils, povidone-iodine, or chlorhexidine were ineffective. This result was recapitulated in vivo, where a 30-s oral rinse with cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash eliminated live virus in the oral cavity of patients with coronavirus disease 19 for at least 1 h, whereas povidone-iodine and saline mouthwashes were ineffective.

Ever since the insulin extracted from animal pancreas has been continuously purified, until an unlimited synthesis of regular human insulin (RHI) became possible in the '80s using the recombinant-DNA (rDNA) technique. The rDNA technique then led to the designer insulins (analogs) in the early '90s. Rapid-acting insulin analogs were developed to accelerate the slow subcutaneous (sc) absorption of RHI, thus lowering the 2-h post-prandial plasma glucose (PP-PG) and risk for late hypoglycemia as comparing with RHI. The first rapid-acting analog was lispro (in 1996), soon followed by aspart and glulisine. Rapid-acting analogs are more convenient than RHI: they improve early PP-PG, and 24-h PG and A1C as long as basal insulin is also optimized; they lower the risk of late PP hypoglycemia and they allow a shorter time-interval between injection and meal. Today rapid-acting analogs are the gold standard prandial insulins. Recently, even faster analogs have become available (faster aspart, ultra-rapid lispro) or are being studied (Biochaperone lispro), making additional gains in lowering PP-PG.

For the latter, we remain in the search of an accurate definition and related targets. Recent work leads us to consider that the within-subject variability of HbA1c calculated from consecutive determinations of HbA1c at regular time-intervals could be the most relevant index for assessing the long-term variability with a threshold value of 5% (%CV\u202f=\u202fSD of HbA1c/mean HbA1c) to separate stability from lability of HbA1c. Presently, no one can deny that short- and long-term glucose variability should be maintained within their lower ranges to limit the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Usually, therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing post-meal glucose excursions, i.e. the major contributor to daily glucose fluctuations, exert a beneficial effect on the short-term glucose variability. This explains the effectiveness of adjunct therapies with either GLP- receptor agonists or SGLT inhibitors in type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the application of a CGM device alone reduces the short-term glycaemic variability. In contrast, sophisticated insulin delivery does not necessarily lead to such reductions despite marked downward shifts of 24-hour glycaemic profiles. Such contrasting observations raise the question as to whether the prolonged wear of CGM devices is or not the major causative factor for improvement in glucose variability among intensively insulin-treated persons with type 1 diabetes.", "Keywords": ["Glucose variabilities", "New questions", "Pending answers"], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Glycated Hemoglobin", "Humans", "Hypoglycemia", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Insulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "L Ouis", "Last Name": "Monnier", "Affiliation": "Medical School of Montpellier, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.

Methods \u2003Two groups of medical students observed a single educational event on the larynx and management of the airway. The learning opportunity was delivered in a lecture format with the lecturer demonstrating on an anatomical model of the larynx. Group one (tactile group) had an identical model to interact with during the lecture and were present within the lecture theater; group two (nontactile group) did not and observed the lecture via video link. Students were asked to rank their opinion to several statements about the session based on an 11-point Likert's scale and give qualitative feedback. Results \u2003All ranked feedback was mainly positive. Tactile learning was statistically equivalent to nontactile learning based on the ranked feedback from the students, except for \"improvement in anatomical knowledge,\" for which the students believed tactile learning was superior ( p \u2009=\u20090.017).

Consequently, these marine reptiles may be vulnerable to global climate change, and under the assumption of continued climate warming, numerous studies pose dire predictions for future populations based primarily on hatchling sex ratio data. Alternatively, as long-lived species that take decades to reach maturity, without inherent coping mechanisms for such change, sea turtles could not have persisted across geological epochs. Globally, loggerhead Caretta caretta [Linnaeus, 1758] sea turtles occupy temperate zones, with ontogenetic development that spans the entirety of gyres associated with respective ocean basins. The largest rookery for this species occurs in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA) population, where a 30-year cycle in annual nest counts is reported through 2018. Complementary studies document a lagged association between these annual nest counts and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO); however, the underlying mechanism for this association remains elusive.

The observational study cohort used for model development consisted of data from a primary care dataset of 20,510 multi-ethnic individuals with T2DM from London, UK (2007-2018). Discrimination and calibration of the resulting prediction models developed using cox regression were assessed using the c-statistic and calibration slope, respectively. Models were internally validated using tenfold cross-validation and externally validated on 13,346 primary care individuals from Wales, UK. The simplest model was simplified into a risk score to enable implementation in community-based medicine. The derived full model included demographic, laboratory parameters, medication-use, cardiovascular disease history (CVD) and sight threatening retinopathy status (STDR). Two less resource-intense models were developed by excluding CVD and STDR in the second model and HbA1c and HDL in the third model. All three 5-year risk models had good internal discrimination and calibration (optimism adjusted C-statistics were each 0.85 and calibration slopes 0.999-1.002). In Wales, models achieved excellent discrimination(c-statistics ranged 0.82-0.83). Calibration slopes at 5-years suggested models over-predicted risks, however were successfully updated to accommodate reduced incidence of stage 3 CKD in Wales, which improved their alignment with the observed rates in Wales (E/O ratios near to 1). The risk score demonstrated similar model performance compared to direct evaluation of the cox model. These resource-driven risk\u00a0prediction\u00a0models may enable universal screening for Stage 3 CKD to enable targeted early optimisation of risk factors for CKD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarega", "Last Name": "Gurudas", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Manjula", "Last Name": "Nugawela", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "A Toby", "Last Name": "Prevost", "Affiliation": "Nightingale-Saunders Clinical Trials and Epidemiology Unit, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Thirunavukkarasu", "Last Name": "Sathish", "Affiliation": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Rohini", "Last Name": "Mathur", "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Data Science, Queen Mary's University London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "J M", "Last Name": "Rafferty", "Affiliation": "Swansea University, Wales, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Blighe", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ramachandran", "Last Name": "Rajalakshmi", "Affiliation": "Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Anjana R", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Jebarani", "Last Name": "Saravanan", "Affiliation": "Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "Azeem", "Last Name": "Majeed", "Affiliation": "School of Public, Health Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Viswanthan", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai, India."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Swansea University, Wales, UK."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Robson", "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Data Science, Queen Mary's University London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sobha", "Last Name": "Sivaprasad", "Affiliation": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, University College London, City Road, London, 162EC1V 2PD, UK. s.sivaprasad@ucl.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "ORNATE India Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2021Jul01"}, {"PMID": "34183355", "Title": "The CD200-CD200R Axis Promotes Squamous Cell Carcinoma Metastasis via Regulation of Cathepsin K.", "Abstract": "The CD200-CD200R immunoregulatory signaling axis plays an etiologic role in the survival and spread of numerous cancers, primarily through suppression of antitumor immune surveillance. Our previous work outlined a prometastatic role for the CD200-CD200R axis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) that is independent of direct T-cell suppression but modulates the function of infiltrating myeloid cells. To identify effectors of the CD200-CD200R axis important for cSCC metastasis, we conducted RNA sequencing profiling of infiltrating CD11B+Cd200R+ cells isolated from CD200+ versus CD200-null cSCCs and identified the cysteine protease cathepsin K (Ctsk) to be highly upregulated in CD200+ cSCCs. CD11B+Cd200R+ cells expressed phenotypic markers associated with myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like cells and tumor-associated macrophages and were the primary source of Ctsk expression in cSCC. A Cd200R+ myeloid cell-cSCC coculture system showed that induction of Ctsk was dependent on engagement of the CD200-CD200R axis, indicating that Ctsk is a target gene of this pathway in the cSCC tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of Ctsk, but not matrix metalloproteinases, significantly blocked cSCC cell migration in vitro. Finally, targeted CD200 disruption in tumor cells and Ctsk pharmacologic inhibition significantly reduced cSCC metastasis in vivo. Collectively, these findings support the conclusion that CD200 stimulates cSCC invasion and metastasis via induction of Ctsk in CD200R+ infiltrating myeloid cells.

Consensus cardiology recommendations previously supported the 'blanket' disqualification of athletes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from competitive sport. More recently, epidemiological studies examining the relative contribution of HCM as a cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes and reports from small cohorts of older athletes with HCM that continue to exercise have fueled debate whether it is safe to play with HCM. Shared decision-making is endorsed within the sports cardiology community in which athletes can make an informed decision about treatment options and potentially elect to continue competitive sports participation. This review critically examines the available evidence relevant to sports eligibility decisions in young athletes diagnosed with HCM. Histopathologically, HCM presents an unstable myocardial substrate that is vulnerable to ventricular tachyarrhythmias during exercise. Studies support that young age and intense competitive sports are risk factors for SCD in patients with HCM. We provide an estimate of annual mortality based on our understanding of disease prevalence and the incidence of HCM-related SCD in different athlete populations. Adolescent and young adult male athletes and athletes participating in a higher risk sport such as basketball, soccer and American football exhibit a greater risk.

Presently, the relationship between the \"variability in glucose homoeostasis\" and diabetes complications has never been fully clarified because studies are either observational or limited to retrospective analysis of trials not primarily designed to address this issue. Despite the absence of definitive evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is most likely that acute and long-term glucose homoeostasis \"cycling\", akin to weight and blood pressure \"cycling\" in obese and hypertensive individuals, are additional risk factors for diabetes complications in the presence of sustained ambient hyperglycaemia. As hypoglycaemic events are strongly associated with short- and long-term glucose variability, two relevant messages can be formulated. Firstly, due consideration should be given to avoid within-day glucose fluctuations in excess of 36% (coefficient of variation) at least for minimizing the inconvenience and dangers associated with hypoglycaemia. Secondly, it seems appropriate to consider that variability in glucose homoeostasis is not only associated with cardiovascular events but is also a causative risk factor via hypoglycaemic episodes as intermediary step.

Currently Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) monitoring involves investigating unexpected injury in Bt crop fields and collecting larvae from non-Bt host plants for laboratory diet bioassays to determine mortality responses to diagnostic concentrations of Bt toxins. To date, this monitoring approach has not detected any significant change from the known range of baseline susceptibility to Bt toxins, yet practical field-evolved resistance in H. zea populations and numerous occurrences of unexpected injury occur in Bt crops. In this study, we implemented a network of 73 sentinel sweet corn trials, spanning 16 U.S. states and 4 Canadian provinces, for monitoring changes in H. zea susceptibility to Cry and Vip3A toxins by measuring differences in ear damage and larval infestations between isogenic pairs of non-Bt and Bt hybrids over three years. This approach can monitor susceptibility changes and regional differences in other ear-feeding lepidopteran pests. Temporal changes in the field efficacy of each toxin were evidenced by comparing our current results with earlier published studies, including baseline data for each Bt trait when first commercialized. Changes in amount of ear damage showed significant increases in H. zea resistance to Cry toxins and possibly lower susceptibility to Vip3a. Our findings demonstrate that the sentinel plot approach as an in-field screen can effectively monitor phenotypic resistance and document field-evolved resistance in target pest populations, improving resistance monitoring for Bt crops.", "Keywords": ["Bt toxin", "insect resistance monitoring", "sentinel sweet corn"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bacillus thuringiensis", "Bacillus thuringiensis

The authors hypothesized that clinical, mechanical, and local tissue measures would be correlated, that clinical tests would not alter mechanical stiffness, and that males would demonstrate greater lumbar stiffness than females. Clinical, lumped mechanical, and tissue stiffness were not correlated; however, gradings from the posteroanterior spring and passive intervertebral motion tests were positively correlated with each other. Clinical assessments had no effect on lumped mechanical stiffness. The males had greater lumped mechanical and lumbar erector spinae stiffness compared with the females. The lack of correlation between clinical, tissue, and lumped mechanical measures of spinal stiffness indicates that the use of the term \"stiffness\" by clinicians may require reevaluation; clinicians should be confident that they are not altering mechanical stiffness of the spine through segmental mobility assessments; and greater resting lumbar erector stiffness in males suggests that sex should be considered in the assessment and treatment of the low back.", "Keywords": ["PA-spring", "PIVM", "low back", "myotonometry", "range of motion"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liana M", "Last Name": "Tennant", "Affiliation": "University of Waterloo."}, {"First Name": "Erika", "Last Name": "Nelson-Wong", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Kuest", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Lawrence", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Levesque", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Prisby", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Spivey", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie R", "Last Name": "Albin", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Jagger", "Affiliation": "Regis University."}, {"First Name": "Jeff M", "Last Name": "Barrett", "Affiliation": "University of Waterloo."}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Colorado School of Mines."}, {"First Name": "Jack P", "Last Name": "Callaghan", "Affiliation": "University of Waterloo."}], "Journal": "Journal of applied biomechanics", "PubDate": "2020Dec01"}, {"PMID": "32945506", "Title": "Sensitivity of human papillomavirus\u2011positive and \u2011negative oropharyngeal cancer cell lines to ionizing irradiation.", "Abstract": "Human papillomavirus\u2011positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has increased in incidence and has a much better prognosis than HPV\u2011negative (HPV\u2011) OPSCC with radiotherapy alone, but exactly why is unknown. The present study therefore aimed to further examine the sensitivity and possible changes in gene expression of several HPV+ and HPV\u2011 OPSCC, including various novel cell lines, upon ionizing irradiation (IR).

Surviving fractions of each cell line were tested by clonogenic assays, and irregularities in cell cycle responses were examined by flow cytometry, while changes in gene expression were followed by mRNA sequencing. HPV+ OPSCC cell lines showed greater variation in sensitivity to ionizing irradiation (IR) and tended to be more sensitive than HPV\u2011 OPSCC cell lines. However, their IR sensitivity was not correlated to the proportion of cells in G2 arrest, and HPV\u2011 cell lines generally showed lower increases in G2 after IR. Upon IR with 2\u00a0Gy, mRNA sequencing revealed an increase in minor HPV integration sites in HPV+ cell lines, and some changes in gene expression in OPSCC cell lines, but not primarily those associated with DNA repair. To conclude, HPV+ OPSCC cell lines showed greater variation in their sensitivity to IR, with some that were radioresistant, but overall the HPV+ OPSCC group still tended to be more sensitive to IR than the HPV\u2011 OPSCC group. In addition, HPV+ OPSCC lines were more frequently in G2 as compared to HPV\u2011 cell lines, but the increase in G2 arrest upon IR in HPV+ OPSCC was not correlated to sensitivity to IR.

Individuals with isolated IGT or combined IFG and IGT have increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Diagnosing prediabetes early and accurately is critical in order to refer high-risk individuals for intensive lifestyle modification. However, there is currently no international consensus for diagnosing prediabetes with HbA1c or glucose measurements based upon American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria that identify different populations at risk for progressing to diabetes. Various caveats affecting the accuracy of interpreting the HbA1c including genetics complicate this further. This review describes established methods for detecting glucose disorders based upon glucose and HbA1c parameters as well as novel approaches including the 1-hour plasma glucose (1-h PG), glucose challenge test (GCT), shape of the glucose curve, genetics, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity, metabolomics, and ancillary tools such as fructosamine, glycated albumin (GA), 1,5- anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG). Of the approaches considered, the 1-h PG has considerable potential as a biomarker for detecting glucose disorders if confirmed by additional data including health economic analysis. Whether the 1-h OGTT is superior to genetics and omics in providing greater precision for individualized treatment requires further investigation. These methods will need to demonstrate substantially superiority to simpler tools for detecting glucose disorders to justify their cost and complexity.", "Keywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cardiovascular disease", "Continuous glucose monitoring", "Glycemic variability", "HbA1c", "Metabolomics", "Oral glucose tolerance test", "Prediabetes", "Type 2 diabetes"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Child", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Fructosamine", "Glucose Intolerance", "Glucose Metabolism Disorders", "Glucose Tolerance Test", "Glycated Hemoglobin", "Glycation End Products, Advanced", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prediabetic State", "Serum Albumin", "Young Adult", "Glycated Serum Albumin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Bergman", "Affiliation": "NYU School of Medicine, NYU Diabetes Prevention Program, Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, VA New York Harbor Healthcare System, Manhattan Campus, 423 East 23rd Street, Room 16049C, NY, NY 10010, USA.

These modifications have the potential to mimic physiological prandial insulin secretion better with an even earlier onset of action with improved PPG control, shorter duration of effect and reduced risk of hypoglycaemia. Recent phase 3 trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes show that faster aspart and ultra-rapid lispro compared with conventional aspart and lispro, achieved fewer PPG excursions with a small increase in post-meal hypoglycaemia but similar or marginally superior glycated haemoglobin levels, and suggest the need for parallel optimization of basal insulin replacement. Phase 1 trials for BioChaperone Lispro are equally encouraging with phase 3 trials yet to be initiated. Comparative analysis of the clinical and pharmacological evidence for these new prandial insulin candidates in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the main focus of this review.", "Keywords": ["clinical trials", "hypoglycaemia", "insulin therapy", "pharmacodynamics", "pharmacokinetics", "postprandial glucose", "type 1 diabetes", "type 2 diabetes"], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Humans", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Insulin", "Insulin Aspart", "Insulin Lispro"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Diabetes Research Group, Swansea University Medical School, Wales, UK."}, {"First Name": "Geremia B", "Last Name": "Bolli", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Perugia Medical School, Perugia, Italy."}], "Journal": "Diabetes, obesity & metabolism", "PubDate": "2020May"}, {"PMID": "31829775", "Title": "Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.", "Abstract": "These updated guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology replace the original version published in 2011.

We prospectively compared the performance of the American Heart Association ( AHA ) 14-point screening evaluation and a resting ECG for cardiovascular screening of high school athletes. Methods and Results Competitive athletes participating in organized high school or premier/select level sports underwent cardiovascular screening using the AHA 14-point history and physical examination, and an ECG interpreted with the Seattle Criteria. A limited echocardiogram was performed for all screening abnormalities. The primary outcome measure was identification of a cardiovascular disorder associated with sudden cardiac death. From October 2014 to June 2017, 3620 high school athletes (median age, 16\u00a0years; range 13-19; 46.2% female; 78.6% white, 8.0% black) were screened. One or more positive responses to the AHA 14-point questionnaire were present in 814 (22.5%) athletes. The most common history responses included chest pain (8.1%), family history of inheritable conditions (7.3%), and shortness of breath (6.4%). Abnormal physical examination was present in 356 (9.8%) athletes, and 103 (2.8%) athletes had an abnormal ECG . Sixteen (0.4%) athletes had conditions associated with sudden cardiac death. The sensitivity (18.8%), specificity (68.0%), and positive predictive value (0.3%) of the AHA 14-point evaluation was substantially lower than the sensitivity (87.5%), specificity (97.5%), and positive predictive value (13.6%) of ECG .

Despite the common use of a decellularized matrix, little is known as to the pivotal signals that must be restored for tissue or organ regeneration. We report that Alx3, a developmentally important gene, orchestrated adult parenchymal and stromal regeneration by directly transactivating Wnt3a and vascular endothelial growth factor. In contrast to the modest parenchyma formed by native adult progenitors, Alx3-restored cells in decellularized scaffolds not only produced vascularized stroma that involved vascular endothelial growth factor signalling, but also parenchymal dentin via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. In an orthotopic large-animal model following parenchyma and stroma ablation, Wnt3a-recruited endogenous cells regenerated neurovascular stroma and differentiated into parenchymal odontoblast-like cells that extended the processes into newly formed dentin with a structure-mechanical equivalency to native dentin. Thus, the Alx3-Wnt3a axis enables postnatal progenitors with a modest innate regenerative capacity to regenerate adult tissues.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) allows for more accurate wall thickness measurement across the entire ventricle than echocardiography. The prevalence of unexplained LV hypertrophy by cardiac MRI is unknown. MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) recruited individuals without overt cardiovascular disease 45 to 84\u00a0years of age. Methods and Results We studied 4972 individuals who underwent measurement of regional LV wall thickness by cardiac MRI as part of the MESA baseline exam. American Heart Association criteria were used to define LV segments. We excluded participants with hypertension, LV dilation (\u226595% predicted end-diastolic volume) or dysfunction (ejection fraction \u226450%), moderate-to-severe left-sided valve lesions by cardiac MRI , severe aortic valve calcification by cardiac computed tomography (aortic valve Agatston calcium score >1200 in women or >2000 in men), obesity (body mass index >35\u00a0kg/m2), diabetes mellitus, and current smoking. Sixty-seven participants (aged 64\u00b110\u00a0years, 9% female) had unexplained LV hypertrophy (wall thickness \u226515\u00a0mm in at least 2 adjacent LV segments), representing 1.4% (1 in 74) participants, 2.6% of men and 0.2% of women.

The study aimed to determine whether defective DNA repair could be associated with sensitivity to inhibition of DNA repair using the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Sensitivity to Olaparib, and induction and repair of DNA damage, were assessed in a panel of 8 OPSCC cell-lines, including 2 novel HPV-positive lines. Effects on cell cycle distribution and levels of PARP1 and p53 were quantified. RNA-sequencing was used to assess differences in activity of DNA repair pathways. Two HPV-positive OPSCC lines were sensitive to Olaparib at potentially therapeutic doses (0.1-0.5 \u03bcM). Two HPV-negative lines were sensitive at an intermediate dose. Four other lines, derived from HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumours, were resistant to PARP inhibition. Only one cell-line, UPCISCC90, showed results consistent with the original hypothesis i.e. that in HPV-positive cells, treatment with Olaparib would cause accumulation of DSB, resulting in cell cycle arrest.

We deployed a sampler to characterize water quality from a household well tapping a shallow fractured dolomite aquifer in northeast Wisconsin.

Results from the automated sampler demonstrate the dynamic nature of the household water quality, especially with regard to microbial targets, which were shown to vary 1 to 2 orders of magnitude during a single sampling event.

"Water penetration of grommets: an in vitro study.", "Abstract": "The insertion of grommets has been one of the most common procedures carried out by ENT surgeons for patients with persistent middle ear fluid. There has always been apprehension at the use of grommets by patients undertaking swimming or other water sports due to concerns of grommet penetration by water into the middle ear. Despite this, no common consensus exists amongst otolaryngologists regarding post-operative advice following grommet insertion. Most studies focus on surface swimming and do not consider other activities such as diving that patients may undertake. This study aimed to determine the hydrostatic head required for water to pass through a grommet using different water-based solutions. These were selected to simulate conditions such as swimming and showering or bathing. An improved model of a grommeted middle ear (based on previous work by Ricks et al.) was constructed using two 5-ml plastic syringes, latex (from a surgical glove), two rubber neoprene membranes and a Shah Ventilation Tube (1.14\u00a0mm). Different water solutions were added to the system and the hydrostatic head measured using digital calipers. The results revealed that the hydrostatic head required to penetrate a grommet is lowest using soapy water and highest with distilled water. The differences between chlorinated water and 3% saline were not significant. We hope that this study can be used in conjunction with previous work to better prepare the ENT surgeon in giving suitable post-operative advice following grommet insertion.", "Keywords": ["Grommet", "Hydrostatic head", "Middle ear ventilation"], "MeSH terms": ["Baths", "Diving", "Ear, Middle", "Humans", "Middle Ear Ventilation", "Otitis Media with Effusion", "Postoperative Complications", "Research Design", "Soaps", "Water Sports"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yousef", "Last Name": "Ibrahim", "Affiliation": "Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory (SMTL), Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, CF31 1RQ, UK. yos_ms@hotmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Fram", "Affiliation": "Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory (SMTL), Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, CF31 1RQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Gavin", "Last Name": "Hughes", "Affiliation": "Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory (SMTL), Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, CF31 1RQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Pete", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory (SMTL), Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, CF31 1RQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory (SMTL), Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, CF31 1RQ, UK."}], "Journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "28732240", "Title": "Constitutive transgene expression of Stem Cell Antigen-1 in the hair follicle alters the sensitivity to tumor formation and progression.", "Abstract": "The cell surface protein Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1) marks stem or progenitor cells in several murine tissues and is normally upregulated during cancer development. Although the specific function of Sca-1 remains unknown, Sca-1 seems to play a role in proliferation, differentiation and cell migration in a number of tissues. In the skin epithelium, Sca-1 is highly expressed in the interfollicular epidermis but is absent in most compartments of the hair follicle; however, the function of Sca-1 in the skin has not been investigated. To explore the role of Sca-1 in normal and malignant skin development we generated transgenic mice that express Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells that are normally Sca-1 negative. Development of hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis appeared normal in Sca-1 mutant mice; however, follicular induction of Sca-1 expression in bulge region and isthmus stem cells reduced the overall yield of papillomas in a chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Despite that fewer papillomas developed in transgenic mice a higher proportion of the papillomas underwent malignant conversion. These findings suggest that overexpression of Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells contributes at different stages of tumour development. In early stages, overexpression of Sca-1 decreases tumour formation while at later stages overexpression of Sca-1 seems to drive tumours towards malignant progression.", "Keywords": ["Stem Cell Antigen-1", "Stem cell markers"], "MeSH terms": ["9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene", "Animals", "Antigens, Ly", "Carcinogenesis", "Clone Cells", "Colony-Forming Units Assay", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Hair Follicle", "Integrases", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Morphogenesis", "Skin", "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate", "Transgenes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rikke", "Last Name": "Christensen", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Aarhus University Hospital, Brendstrupgaardsvej 21C, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark; Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Bartholins All\u00e9 6, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

Kuntze. Recently, a complex of species morphologically similar to E. fornicatus has been recognized, which includes new pests established in Israel and the USA, both in California and Florida. Collectively termed E. nr. fornicatus, these cryptic species carry symbiotic Fusarium spp. fungi, some of which cause dieback disease in susceptible hosts, which include avocado, Persea americana Miller. Due to the threat to this economically important crop, research was initiated to evaluate efficacy of kairomone-based lures for detection of the beetle in Florida (termed the Florida tea shot hole borer, FL-TSHB). A series of field tests were conducted in 2016 in commercial avocado groves known to have FL-TSHB at various population levels. All tests evaluated lures containing quercivorol (p-menth-2-en-1-ol) and \u03b1-copaene, presented separately and in combination; and one test evaluated effect of trap type on beetle captures. In addition, electroantennography (EAG) was used to quantify female olfactory responses to lure emissions. This study identified (-)-\u03b1-copaene as a new attractant for FL-TSHB, equivalent in efficacy to quercivorol (the standard lure for Euwallacea detection in the USA); however, the combination of lures captured significantly more FL-TSHB than either lure alone. This combination resulted in synergistic attraction at two field sites and additive attraction at a third site. Sticky panel traps captured more FL-TSHB than comparably-baited Lindgren funnel traps. Females engaged in host-seeking flight from 11:00 to 16:00 hr (EST), with peak numbers observed between 12:00 and 13:00 hr.

Although glucocentric therapies may improve glycaemic control (as determined by glycated haemoglobin levels), evidence suggests that this approach alone has limited beneficial effects on CV outcomes relative to improvements in lipid and blood pressure control. This may be explained in part by the fact that current antidiabetic treatment regimens primarily address overall glycaemia and/or fasting plasma glucose, but not the postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) excursions that have a fundamental causative role in increasing CV risk. This literature review evaluates the relationship between PPG and the risk of CV disease, discusses the treatment of T2DM with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and examines the associated CV outcomes. The literature analysis suggests that exaggerated PPG excursions are a risk factor for CV disease because of their adverse pathophysiologic effects on the vasculature, resulting in increased all-cause and CV-related mortality. Although GLP-1 RAs are well established in the current T2DM treatment paradigm, a subgroup of these compounds has a particularly pronounced, persistent and short-lived effect on gastric emptying and, hence, lower PPG substantially. However, current long-term data on CV outcomes with GLP-1 RAs are contradictory, with both beneficial and adverse effects having been reported.

Clinical inertia and/or poor adherence to therapy contribute to patients not reaching glycaemic targets when managed according to this paradigm. Clinical inertia exists across the entire spectrum of anti-diabetes therapies, although it is most pronounced when initiating and optimizing insulin therapy. Possible reasons include needle aversion, fear of hypoglycaemia, excessive weight gain and/or the need for increased self-monitoring of blood glucose. Studies have suggested, however, that early intensive insulin therapy in newly diagnosed, symptomatic patients with T2DM with HbA1c >9% (75\u2009mmol/mol) can preserve beta-cell function, thereby modulating the disease process. Furthermore, postprandial plasma glucose is a key component of residual dysglycaemia, evident especially when HbA1c remains above target despite fasting normoglycaemia. Therefore, to achieve near normoglycaemia, additional treatment with prandial insulin or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) is often required. Long- or short-acting GLP-1 RAs offer effective alternatives to basal or prandial insulin in patients inadequately controlled with other therapies or basal insulin alone, respectively. This review highlights the limitations of current algorithms, and proposes an alternative based on the early introduction of insulin therapy and the rationale for the sequential or fixed combination of GLP-1 RAs with insulin (\"treat-to-success\" paradigm).", "Keywords": ["GLP-1", "insulin therapy", "treatment algorithm", "type 2 diabetes mellitus"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Drugs, Investigational", "Glycated Hemoglobin", "Humans", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Insulin", "Therapies, Investigational"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Diabetes Research Unit, Institute of Life Sciences, College of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, UK."}, {"First Name": "Louis", "Last Name": "Monnier", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Nutrition and Atherosclerosis, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Anthony H", "Last Name": "Barnett", "Affiliation": "Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK."}], "Journal": "Diabetes, obesity & metabolism", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "28329355", "Title": "International recommendations for electrocardiographic interpretation in athletes.", "Abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of mortality in athletes during sport.

The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200-222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200-222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "DNA", "DNA Damage", "Disinfection", "Epidermis", "Humans", "Keratinocytes", "Male", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Mice", "Mice, Hairless", "Radiodermatitis", "Skin", "Ultraviolet Rays", "Ultraviolet Therapy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Manuela", "Last Name": "Buonanno", "Affiliation": "a \u2009 Center for Radiological Research, Departments of."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Ponnaiya", "Affiliation": "a \u2009 Center for Radiological Research, Departments of."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "a \u2009 Center for Radiological Research, Departments of."}, {"First Name": "Milda", "Last Name": "Stanislauskas", "Affiliation": "b \u2009 Dermatology."}, {"First Name": "Gerhard", "Last Name": "Randers-Pehrson", "Affiliation": "a \u2009 Center for Radiological Research, Departments of."}, {"First Name": "Lubomir", "Last Name": "Smilenov", "Affiliation": "a \u2009 Center for Radiological Research, Departments of."}, {"First Name": "Franklin D", "Last Name": "Lowy", "Affiliation": "c \u2009 Medicine and Infectious Diseases."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "b \u2009 Dermatology."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "a \u2009 Center for Radiological Research, Departments of."}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2017Apr"}, {"PMID": "28210712", "Title": "Identification of an epidermal keratinocyte AMPA glutamate receptor involved in dermatopathies associated with sensory abnormalities.", "Abstract": "Epidermal keratinocytes are increasingly recognized as active participants in the sensory transduction of itch and pain, processes known to involve primary afferent glutamatergic neurons.

Few prospective studies have directly compared the ability of TTE and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to predict clinical outcomes in AR and MR. We hypothesized that, given its higher reproducibility, CMR would predict the need for valve surgery or heart failure (HF) hospitalization better than TTE. Quantitative TTE and CMR were performed on the same day for 51 subjects: 29 with chronic AR and 22 with chronic, primary MR for quantification of valve regurgitation. Baseline measurements of valve regurgitation were compared to the combined primary end point of new HF and valve surgery using receiver operating characteristics, simple logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. The primary end point occurred in 5 AR subjects (all surgery) and 8\u00a0MR subjects (7 surgery, 1 HF) after a mean follow-up of 4.4 \u00b1 1.5\u00a0years. For AR, CMR-derived regurgitant volume >50\u00a0ml identified those at high risk with 50% undergoing valve surgery versus 0% for those with regurgitant volume \u226450\u00a0ml and was more strongly associated with outcomes than regurgitant volume by TTE (p <0.05). For MR, 6.8% of those with regurgitant volume by TTE \u226430\u00a0ml developed the primary end point versus 70% in those with regurgitant volume >30\u00a0ml.

Here we review published data from 24-h time-averaged HR monitoring in healthy individuals and subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with either short-acting GLP-1 RAs, lixisenatide or exenatide, or long-acting GLP-1 RAs, exenatide LAR, liraglutide, albiglutide, or dulaglutide (N\u00a0=\u00a01112; active-treatment arms). HR effects observed in two independent head-to-head trials of lixisenatide and liraglutide (N\u00a0=\u00a0202; active-treatment arms) are also reviewed. Short-acting GLP-1 RAs, exenatide and lixisenatide, are associated with a transient (1-12\u00a0h) mean placebo- and baseline-adjusted 24-h HR increase of 1-3\u00a0beats per minute (bpm). Conversely, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are associated with more pronounced increases in mean 24-h HR; the highest seen with liraglutide and albiglutide at 6-10\u00a0bpm compared with dulaglutide and exenatide LAR at 3-4\u00a0bpm. For both liraglutide and dulaglutide, HR increases were recorded during both the day and at night. In two head-to-head comparisons, a small, transient mean increase in HR from baseline was observed with lixisenatide; liraglutide induced a substantially greater increase that remained significantly elevated over 24\u00a0h. The underlying mechanism for increased HR remains to be elucidated; however, it could be related to a direct effect at the sinus node and/or stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, with this effect related to the duration of action of the respective GLP-1 RAs. In conclusion, this review indicates that the effects on HR differ within the class of GLP-1 RAs: short-acting GLP-1 RAs are associated with a modest and transient HR increase before returning to baseline levels, while some long-acting GLP-1 RAs are associated with a more pronounced and sustained increase during the day and night. Findings from recently completed trials indicate that a GLP-1 RA-induced increase in HR, regardless of magnitude, does not present an increased cardiovascular risk for subjects with T2DM, although a pronounced increase in HR may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in those with advanced heart failure.", "Keywords": ["Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist", "Heart rate", "Type 2 diabetes mellitus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor", "Glucagon-Like Peptides", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments", "Liraglutide", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Lorenz", "Affiliation": "R&D Diabetes Division, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Industrial Park H\u00f6chst, Bldg.

Substantial promise is, however, shown by a variety of pattern classification approaches to neuroimaging data. Here, we examined the predictive accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) in later diagnosing schizophrenia, at a single-subject level, using a cohort of HR individuals drawn from multiply affected families and a combination of neuroanatomical, schizotypal and neurocognitive variables. Baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), schizotypal and neurocognitive data from 17 HR subjects, who subsequently developed schizophrenia and a matched group of 17 HR subjects who did not make the transition, yet had psychotic symptoms, were included in the analysis. We employed recursive feature elimination (RFE), in a nested cross-validation scheme to identify the most significant predictors of disease transition and enhance diagnostic performance. Classification accuracy was 94% when a self-completed measure of schizotypy, a declarative memory test and structural MRI data were combined into a single learning algorithm; higher than when either quantitative measure was used alone. The discriminative neuroanatomical pattern involved gray matter volume differences in frontal, orbito-frontal and occipital lobe regions bilaterally as well as parts of the superior, medial temporal lobe and cerebellar regions. Our findings suggest that an early SVM-based prediction of schizophrenia is possible and can be improved by combining schizotypal and neurocognitive features with neuroanatomical variables.

Animals exhibiting temperature dependent sex determination (TSD), including sea turtles, are perhaps most vulnerable to a warming of the Earth as highly skewed sex ratios can result, potentially leading to population extinction resulting from decreased male recruitment. Recent studies have begun to quantify climate change impacts to sea turtle populations, especially in terms of predicting effects on hatchling sex ratios. However, given the inherent difficulty in studying sex ratios at this life stage, a more accurate assessment of changes in population sex ratios might be derived by evaluating the juvenile portion of foraging aggregations. We investigated the long-term trend in sex ratio of a juvenile loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle population inhabiting Pamlico and Core Sounds, North Carolina, USA. We used plasma testosterone reference ranges measured using radioimmunoassay (RIA) to assign sex for 959 turtles and confirmed sex assignment of a subset (N = 58) of the sampled turtles through laparoscopic examination of their gonads. Our results demonstrate that for this particular population of loggerheads, sex ratios (3Females:1Male) had not significantly changed over a 10 year period (1998-2007), nor showed any significant difference among 5-cm straight carapace length (SCL) size classes. Ultimately, these findings provide a basis for comparison with future sex ratios, and highlight the importance of establishing similar long-term studies monitoring secondary, rather than primary, sex ratios, so that needed mitigation measures to climate change impacts can be implemented.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Global Warming", "Male", "North Carolina", "Sex Determination Processes", "Sex Ratio", "Turtles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joanne", "Last Name": "Braun McNeill", "Affiliation": "Southeast Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Beaufort, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Larisa", "Last Name": "Avens", "Affiliation": "Southeast Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Beaufort, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "April", "Last Name": "Goodman Hall", "Affiliation": "Southeast Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Beaufort, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lisa R", "Last Name": "Goshe", "Affiliation": "Southeast Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Beaufort, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Harms", "Affiliation": "Center for Marine Sciences and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Morehead City, North Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "University of Charleston, South Carolina at the College of Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27499458", "Title": "Efficacy and safety of linagliptin in type 2 diabetes patients with self-reported hepatic disorders: A retrospective pooled analysis of 17 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.", "Abstract": "Liver disease is highly prevalent among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

This study was a prospective, multicenter trial of cardiovascular screening at 35 National Collegiate Athletic Association institutions. Screening included a standardized history and physical examination (PE) as recommended by the American Heart Association and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest. Centralized electrocardiographic interpretation was provided using the Seattle criteria. Athletes with screening abnormalities underwent additional evaluation directed by the host institution medical team. Primary outcomes included the proportion of total and false-positive screens; the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of history, PE, and ECG; and the prevalence of serious cardiovascular disorders associated with severe morbidity or sudden cardiac death. From August 2012 to June 2014, 5,258 athletes from 17 intercollegiate sports were screened: 55% men (mean age 20.1\u00a0years), 73% Caucasian, 16% African-American, and 11% other/mixed race. At least 1 positive cardiac symptom or family history response was reported by 1,750 athletes (33.3%). PE was abnormal in 108 athletes (2.1%), and electrocardiographic abnormalities were present in 192 athletes (3.7%). Thirteen athletes (0.25%) were identified with serious cardiac conditions including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1), large atrial septal defect with right ventricular dilation (1), and ventricular pre-excitation (11). The false-positive rate for history was 33.3%, PE 2.0%, and\u00a0ECG 3.4%. The sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value for history was 15.4%/66.9%/0.1%, PE 7.7%/98.2%/0.9%, and ECG 100%/96.6%/6.8%. In conclusion, electrocardiographic screening in National Collegiate Athletic Association athletes has a low false-positive rate and provides superior accuracy compared with a standardized history and PE to detect athletes with potentially dangerous cardiovascular conditions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Athletes", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Electrocardiography", "Ethnicity", "Female", "Heart Diseases", "Heart Septal Defects, Atrial", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Medical History Taking", "Physical Examination", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sports", "Students", "United States", "Universities"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Drezner", "Affiliation": "Sports Medicine Section, Department of Family Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.

A Prospective Observational Study of 19,195 Tonsillectomies over a 10-Year Period.", "Abstract": "There are a multitude of techniques to undertake tonsillectomy, with hot techniques such as diathermy and coblation being associated with a higher risk of secondary haemorrhage. The UK National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit (2004) advocated cold steel dissection and ties to be the gold standard. This prospective observational study investigates the trends in tonsillectomy techniques across Wales in the last decade to establish if surgeons have adhered to this national guidance. Data relating to tonsillectomy were extracted over a 10-year period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2012 from the Wales Surgical Instrument Surveillance Programme database. A total of 19,195 patients were included. Time-series analysis using linear regression showed there was an increase in the number of bipolar diathermy tonsillectomies by 84% (Pearson's r = 0.762, p = 0.010) and coblation tonsillectomies by 120% (r = 0.825, p = 0.003). In contrast, there was a fall in the number of cold steel dissection tonsillectomies with ties by 60% (r = -0.939, p < 0.001). This observational study suggests that the use of bipolar and coblation techniques for tonsillectomy has increased. This deviation from national guidance may be due to these techniques being faster with less intraoperative bleeding.

Sea turtle sex is determined by incubation temperature and individuals lack external sex-based traits until sexual maturity. Previous research utilized serum/plasma testosterone radioimmunoassays (RIA) to determine sex in immature/juvenile sea turtles. However, there has been a growing application of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for wildlife endocrinology studies, but no study on sea turtles has compared the results of ELISA and RIA. This study provides the first sex ratio for a threatened East Pacific green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) foraging aggregation, a critical step for future management of this species. Here, we validate a testosterone ELISA and compare results between RIA and ELISA of duplicate samples. The ELISA demonstrated excellent correspondence with the RIA for providing testosterone concentrations for sex determination. Neither assay proved reliable for predicting the sex of reproductively active females with increased testosterone production. We then applied ELISA to examine the sex ratio of 69 green turtles foraging in San Diego Bay, California. Of 45 immature turtles sampled, sex could not be determined for three turtles because testosterone concentrations fell between the ranges for either sex (females: 4.1-113.1 pg/mL, males: 198.4-2,613.0 pg/mL) and these turtles were not subsequently recaptured to enable sex determination; using a Bayesian model to predict probabilities of turtle sex we predicted all three 'unknowns' were female (> 0.86). Additionally, the model assigned all turtles with their correct sex (if determined at recapture) with 100% accuracy. Results indicated a female bias (2.83F:1M) among all turtles in the aggregation; when focusing only on putative immature turtles the sex ratio was 3.5F:1M. With appropriate validation, ELISA sexing could be applied to other sea turtle species, and serve as a crucial conservation tool.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animal Distribution", "Animals", "Bayes Theorem", "California", "Endangered Species", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Male", "Radioimmunoassay", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sex Determination Processes", "Sex Ratio", "Testosterone", "Turtles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Camryn D", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Michelle N", "Last Name": "Robbins", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tomoharu", "Last Name": "Eguchi", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "Grice Marine Lab, University of Charleston South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Anne B", "Last Name": "Meylan", "Affiliation": "Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Meylan", "Affiliation": "Natural Sciences, Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas M", "Last Name": "Kellar", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Schwenter", "Affiliation": "Grice Marine Lab, University of Charleston South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hendrik H", "Last Name": "Nollens", "Affiliation": "Veterinary Services, SeaWorld San Diego, San Diego, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robin A", "Last Name": "LeRoux", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter H", "Last Name": "Dutton", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Seminoff", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal and Turtle Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Jolla, California, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "26330380", "Title": "Grey matter networks in people at increased familial risk for schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Grey matter brain networks are disrupted in schizophrenia, but it is still unclear at which point during the development of the illness these disruptions arise and whether these can be associated with behavioural predictors of schizophrenia.

Within the high risk sample, the path length of the posterior cingulate cortex and the betweenness centrality of the left inferior frontal operculum explained 81% of the variance in schizotypal cognitions, which was previously shown to be the strongest behavioural predictor of schizophrenia in the study. In contrast, local grey matter volume measurements explained 48% of variance in schizotypy. The present results suggest that single-subject grey matter networks can quantify behaviourally relevant biological alterations in people at increased risk for schizophrenia before disease onset.", "Keywords": ["Graph theory", "High risk", "Neuroimaging", "Psychiatry", "Schizophrenia", "Structural MRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Risk", "Schizophrenia", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Betty M", "Last Name": "Tijms", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychiatry, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Morningside, EH10 5HF Edinburgh, UK; School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, UK; Alzheimer Centre and Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre, 1081 HZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Here we developed a mouse model in which PDK1 is conditionally ablated in activated CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, and mature keratinocytes through OX40-Cre recombinase expression.

Through a series of T-cell transfers, bone marrow reconstitutions, and crossing to lymphocyte-deficient backgrounds, we demonstrate that ablation of PDK1 in keratinocytes is the major driver of disease pathogenesis. PDK1-deficient keratinocytes exhibit intrinsic defects in the expression of key structural proteins including cytokeratin-10 and loricrin, resulting in increased keratinocyte turnover, which in turn triggers inflammation, T-cell recruitment, and immune-mediated destruction.

We found no significant differences in any examined regions between controls and those at high risk, or between those at high risk who later developed schizophrenia and those who remained well.

During homeostasis, turnover of epidermal lineages is achieved by input from regionalized keratinocytes stem or progenitor populations with little overlap from neighboring niches. Over the last decade, molecular markers selectively expressed by a number of these stem or progenitor pools have been identified, allowing for the isolation and functional assessment of stem cells and genetic lineage tracing analysis within intact skin. These advancements have led to many fundamental observations about epidermal stem cell function such as the identification of their progeny, their role in maintenance of skin homeostasis, or their contribution to wound healing. In this chapter, we provide a methodology to identify and isolate epidermal stem cells and to assess their functional role in their respective niche. Furthermore, recent evidence has shown that the microenvironment also plays a crucial role in stem cell function. Indeed, epidermal cells are under the influence of surrounding fibroblasts, adipocytes, and sensory neurons that provide extrinsic signals and mechanical cues to the niche and contribute to skin morphogenesis and homeostasis. A better understanding of these microenvironmental cues will help engineer in vitro experimental models with more relevance to in vivo skin biology.

limited primarily due to curriculum time constraints with traditional face-to-face (FtF) teaching being restrained by the limitations of time and location. Advances in network technology have opened up new doors for the delivery of teaching in the form of online learning. This study compares a traditional instructor-led lecture with synchronous e-learning (SeL) using otolaryngological emergencies teaching as an educational intervention. A randomised controlled trial was designed involving two groups of medical students attending an otolaryngology emergencies management lecture: one present FtF and the other viewing the streamed lecture online. The primary outcome measure was improvement between pre-and post-lecture test scores. Secondary outcomes comprised the students' ratings of the lecture on a Likert-type scale. Students in both groups had improved test scores following the lecture (p < 0.001 for both groups) and there was no difference in magnitude of improvement in test scores between the two groups (p = 0.168). There was no difference in student ratings between the two groups for the usefulness of the lecture (p = 0.484), interactivity (p = 0.834) and meeting educational needs (p = 0.968). The FtF group, however, was more satisfied overall (p = 0.034). This study demonstrates that SeL may be as effective as FtF teaching in improving students' knowledge on the management of otolaryngological emergencies, and that it is generally positively perceived by medical undergraduates. This highlights the potential utility of e-learning technology in undergraduate otolaryngology training.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Computer-Assisted Instruction", "Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Undergraduate", "Educational Measurement", "Emergencies", "Female", "Humans", "Internet", "Male", "Otolaryngology", "Students, Medical", "Teaching"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Talal", "Last Name": "Alnabelsi", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Al-Hussaini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "PubDate": "2015Mar"}, {"PMID": "25283485", "Title": "Triple combination of insulin glargine, sitagliptin and metformin in type 2 diabetes: the EASIE post-hoc analysis and extension trial.", "Abstract": "We examined the effects of adding glargine to metformin-sitagliptin (MS+G) or sitagliptin to metformin-glargine (MG+S) therapy in type 2 diabetic persons uncontrolled after 24-week MS or MG dual therapy.", "Keywords": ["A1c", "EASIE", "Insulin glargine", "Metformin", "Sitagliptin", "Type 2 diabetes"], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Adult", "Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Confidence Intervals", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glycated Hemoglobin", "Humans", "Hypoglycemia", "Insulin Glargine", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Metformin", "Middle Aged", "Odds Ratio", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sitagliptin Phosphate", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Juliana C N", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity, Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China.

Hh-induced tumors arise from various tissues and they may be indolent or aggressive, as is the case with skin basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cerebellar medulloblastoma, respectively. Little is known about common cell-intrinsic factors that control the development of such diverse Hh-dependent tumors. Transcription factor Zfx is required for the self-renewal of hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells, as well as for the propagation of acute myeloid and T-lymphoblastic leukemias. We report here that Zfx facilitates the development of experimental BCC and medulloblastoma in mice initiated by deletion of the Hh inhibitory receptor Ptch1. Simultaneous deletion of Zfx along with Ptch1 prevented BCC formation and delayed medulloblastoma development. In contrast, Zfx was dispensable for tumorigenesis in a mouse model of glioblastoma. We used genome-wide expression and chromatin-binding analysis in a human medulloblastoma cell line to characterize direct, evolutionarily conserved targets of Zfx, identifying Dis3L and Ube2j1 as two targets required for the growth of the human medulloblastoma cells.

The subsequent elucidation of the chemical and three-dimensional structure of insulin and its chemical synthesis and biosynthesis allowed modification of the insulin molecule itself, resulting in insulin analogs that are designed to mimic normal endogenous insulin secretion during both fasting and prandial conditions. Insulin glargine was the first once-daily, long-acting insulin analog to be introduced into clinical practice more than 10\u00a0years ago and is specifically designed to provide basal insulin requirements. It has a prolonged duration of action and no distinct insulin peak, making it suitable for once-daily administration and reducing the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia that is seen with intermediate-acting insulins.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of utilising an anterior septal suture to a bridle system for NGT fixation. A sheep's head model was used to represent the nasal cavity of post-operative patients and a fine-bore NGT was passed. The NGT was secured with either an anterior septal suture or bridle system. A pulley system of weights was applied until the NGT slipped or snapped. Each weight and condition was investigated five times. The anterior and posterior septum were examined for evidence of damage for each condition. At 5\u00a0kg the anterior septal suture allowed the NGT to slip and the tube began to become distorted. At 5.5\u00a0kg the anterior septal suture snapped the NGT. In comparison, the bridle system was able to sustain a weight up to 15.5\u00a0kg (Fisher's exact test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0079). There was no evidence of damage to the anterior or posterior septum for each condition.

Since 1946, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) has been the predominant basal insulin in clinical use. However, absorption is variable due to the need for resuspension and the time-action profile (peak activity 4-6\u2009h after subcutaneous administration) confers an increased propensity for between-meal and nocturnal hypoglycaemia. In the 1980s, recombinant DNA technology enabled modifications to the insulin molecule resulting in the soluble long-acting insulin analogues, glargine and detemir. Both exhibit a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn due to improved time-action profiles and reduced day-to-day glucose variability. Glargine is indicated for administration once daily and detemir once or twice daily. Degludec is the latest prolonged-acting insulin which forms long subcutaneous multi-hexamers that delay absorption. Recent phase III trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes show that degludec was non-inferior to comparators (predominantly glargine) with a minimal although inconsistent reduction in overall hypoglycaemia and a small absolute difference in nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Newer developmental agents include LY2605541 and glargine U300. LY2605541 comprises insulin lispro combined with polyethylene glycol, thereby increasing its hydrodynamic size and retarding absorption from the subcutaneous tissue. Glargine U300 is a new formulation of glargine resulting in a flatter and more prolonged time-action profile than its predecessor.

Insulin remains the only glucose-lowering therapy that is efficacious throughout this continuum. However, the timing of introduction and the choice of insulin therapy remain contentious because of the heterogeneity of T2DM and the well-recognized behavioral and therapeutic challenges associated with this mode of therapy. Nevertheless, the early initiation of basal insulin has been shown to improve glycemic control and affect long-term outcomes in people with T2DM and is a treatment strategy supported by international guidelines as part of an individualized approach to chronic disease management. The rationale for early initiation of insulin is based on evidence demonstrating multifaceted benefits, including overcoming the glucotoxic effects of hyperglycemia, thereby facilitating \"\u03b2-cell rest,\" and preserving \u03b2-cell mass and function, while also improving insulin sensitivity. Independent of its effects on glycemic control, insulin possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may help protect against endothelial dysfunction and damage resulting in vascular disease. Insulin therapy and the achievement of good glycemic control earlier in T2DM provide long-term protection to end organs via \"metabolic memory\" regardless of subsequent treatments and degree of glycemic control.

This study examines the effect of temperature on the capability of the tympanometer to accurately evaluate external auditory canal volume in both simple and partially obstructed Ear Canal Models. An Ear Canal Model was designed using simple laboratory equipment including a 5 ml calibrated clinical syringe. This was attached to the sensing probe of a Kamplex tympanometer. Two basic trials were undertaken: (a) evaluation of the effect of temperature on the tympanometer in simple canal volume measurement and (b) assessing canal volume with partial canal occlusion. These studies were conducted at 0, 10, 20 and 30 \u00b0C in a Thermotron climatic chamber. 1,400 individual test scenarios were completed over the two arms of the study. At volumes of 1.4 cm(3) or below, tympanometry had a very high level of correlation (Spearman's \u03c1 = 1) with the actual volume present at all tested temperatures except 0 \u00b0C. There was no significant relationship between temperature and degree of error in ear canal volume measurement in both simple and partially occluded models. The ability of the Kamplex tympanometer to accurately and precisely assess ear canal volume in this scientific model in both simple and partially occluded scenarios up to a volume of 1.4 cm(3) is not effected by ambient temperature.

risk of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Nonlinear Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) for fMRI provides computational modelling of gating mechanisms at the neuronal population level. It allows for estimations of connection strengths with nonlinear modulation within task-dependent networks. This paper presents an application of nonlinear DCM in subjects at high familial risk of schizophrenia performing the Hayling Sentence Completion Task (HSCT). We analysed scans of 19 healthy controls and 46 subjects at high familial risk of schizophrenia, which included 26 high risk subjects without psychotic symptoms and 20 subjects with psychotic symptoms. The activity-dependent network consists of the intra parietal cortex (IPS), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus. The connections between the MD thalamus and the IFG were gated by the MD thalamus. We used DCM to investigate altered connection strength of these connections. Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) at the group and family level was used to compare the optimal bilinear and nonlinear models. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was used to assess the connection strengths with the gating from the MD thalamus and the IFG. The nonlinear models provided the better explanation of the data. Furthermore, the BMA analysis showed significantly lower connection strength of the thalamocortical connection with nonlinear modulation from the MD thalamus in high risk subjects with psychotic symptoms and those who subsequently developed schizophrenia. These findings demonstrate that nonlinear DCM provides a method to investigate altered connectivity at the level of neural circuits. The reduced connection strength with thalamic gating may be a neurobiomarker implicated in the development of psychotic symptoms. This study suggests that nonlinear DCM could lead to new insights into functional and effective dysconnection at the network level in subjects at high familial risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Algorithms", "Bayes Theorem", "Brain", "Delusions", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Hallucinations", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Linear Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Neural Pathways", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Psychomotor Performance", "Risk", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Thalamus", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria R", "Last Name": "Dauvermann", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychiatry, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, University of Edinburgh, UK.

In 1999, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) introduced SIGN 34 outlining appropriate indications for tonsillectomy. Following concerns of increasing hospital admissions for tonsillitis, in 2009 ENT UK suggested that too few tonsillectomies were being undertaken. This study analyses the effect the SIGN guidelines have had on trends in population rates of tonsillectomy and hospital admissions for tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess in England, Scotland and Wales. A retrospective study was undertaken using the health databases of England, Scotland and Wales between 1999 and 2010. Tonsillectomy, acute tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess were identified using national classification codes. Changes in rate of tonsillectomy and hospital admissions for tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess were assessed using a linear regression model. 699,898 tonsillectomies were undertaken in the three national cohorts over the study period. Linear regression analysis suggested that implementation of SIGN 34 significantly reduced the population rate of tonsillectomy in England (p = 0.005) and Wales (p = 0.003) but not in Scotland (p = 0.24), and indicated there had been an increase in hospital admissions for acute tonsillitis in all cohorts (England p = 0.000008, Scotland p = 0.03, Wales p = 0.000005) and peritonsillar abscess in England (p < 0.05) and Wales (p = 0.03).

In this mini-review we will discuss recent studies that provide some of the first genetic evidence to support a stem cell origin for a number of skin cancer types.", "Keywords": ["Cancer stem cell", "Epidermis", "Hair follicle", "Keratinocyte", "Stem cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Clonal Evolution", "Epidermis", "Humans", "Mutation", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Skin Neoplasms", "Stem Cell Niche", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Khanh", "Last Name": "Thieu", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marlon E", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cancer letters", "PubDate": "2013Sep10"}, {"PMID": "22562400", "Title": "The European positional paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps: has the introduction of guidance on the management of sinus disease affected uptake of surgery and acute admissions for sinusitis?", "Abstract": "Rhinosinusitis is a common condition with adults experiencing 2-5 episodes per year. The European Positional Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EP3OS) published in 2005 and updated in 2007 provided evidence-based guidelines on the management of sinus disease promoting a conservative approach to treatment. This study examines the effect of EP3OS on sinus surgery uptake and acute admissions for sinusitis in England and Wales. A retrospective study using the national electronic health databases of England (Hospital Episodes Statistics, HES online) and Wales (Patient Episodes Database of Wales, PEDW) was undertaken from 2000 to 2010 using the OPCS-4 codes E12-E17 (sinus surgery) and ICD10 code J01 (acute admission for sinusitis). Data were analysed for effect following the introduction of the EP3OS in 2005 using linear regression and Chi squared analysis. 116,370 sinus procedures and 10,916 acute admissions for sinusitis were made during the study period. No significant decrease in sinus surgery procedures occurred following the introduction of the EP3OS as may have been expected (p > 0.05), although subgroup analysis suggested a significant increase in Wales (p < 0.05). In addition, significant increases in acute admissions for sinusitis were observed following the introduction of EP3OS (p < 0.05). However, subgroup analysis suggested this was not the case in Wales (p > 0.05). The EP3OS appears to have had little impact on the rates of sinus surgery but more conservative approaches to managing of sinus disease may have led to an increase in acute admissions. Further research is required to investigate whether changes in practice were adopted.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["England", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Nasal Polyps", "Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures", "Paranasal Sinuses", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Retrospective Studies", "Rhinitis", "Sinusitis", "Wales"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ben", "Last Name": "Cosway", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, UK. bencosway@doctors.org.uk"}, {"First Name": "Alun", "Last Name": "Tomkinson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Owens", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}]
