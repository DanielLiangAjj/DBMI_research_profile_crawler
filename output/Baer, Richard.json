[{"PMID": "38554279", "Title": "BRCA1 and 53BP1 regulate reprogramming efficiency by mediating DNA repair pathway choice at replication-associated double-strand breaks.", "Abstract": "Reprogramming to pluripotency is associated with DNA damage and requires the functions of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor. Here, we leverage separation-of-function mutations in BRCA1/2 as well as the physical and/or genetic interactions between BRCA1 and its associated repair proteins to ascertain the relevance of homology-directed repair (HDR), stalled fork protection (SFP), and replication gap suppression (RGS) in somatic cell reprogramming. Surprisingly, loss of SFP and RGS is inconsequential for the transition to pluripotency. In contrast, cells deficient in HDR, but proficient in SFP and RGS, reprogram with reduced efficiency. Conversely, the restoration of HDR function through inactivation of 53bp1 rescues reprogramming in Brca1-deficient cells, and 53bp1 loss leads to elevated HDR and enhanced reprogramming in mouse and human cells. These results demonstrate that somatic cell reprogramming is especially dependent on repair of replication-associated double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the HDR activity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and can be improved in the absence of 53BP1.", "Keywords": ["BRCA1", "BRCA2", "CP: Molecular biology", "double-strand break", "pluripotency", "replication gap suppression", "replication stress", "somatic cell reprogramming", "stalled replication fork"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "BRCA1 Protein", "Cellular Reprogramming", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Repair", "DNA Replication", "Recombinational DNA Repair", "Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Georgieva", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Columbia University Stem Cell Initiative, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Columbia University Stem Cell Initiative, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "Taglialatela", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Stem Cell Initiative, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Genetics and Development, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stepan", "Last Name": "Jerabek", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Columbia University Stem Cell Initiative, New York, NY 10032, USA; Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo namesti 542/2, 160 00 Praha 6, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Colleen R", "Last Name": "Reczek", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pei Xin", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Developmental Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Sung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michiko", "Last Name": "Horiguchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Jasin", "Affiliation": "Developmental Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Ciccia", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Stem Cell Initiative, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Genetics and Development, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Columbia University Stem Cell Initiative, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

DNA resection is triggered by the CtIP/Sae2 protein, which allosterically promotes Mre11-mediated endonuclease DNA cleavage at a position internal to the DSB. Although the mechanics of resection, including the initial endonucleolytic step, are largely conserved in eucaryotes, CtIP and its functional counterpart in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sae2) share only a modest stretch of amino acid homology. Nonetheless, this stretch contains two highly conserved phosphorylation sites for cyclin-dependent kinases (T843 in mouse) and the damage-induced ATM/ATR kinases (T855 in mouse), both of which are required for DNA resection. To explore the function of ATM/ATR phosphorylation at Ctip-T855, we generated and analyzed mice expressing the Ctip-T855A mutant. Surprisingly, unlike Ctip-null mice and Ctip-T843A-expressing mice, both of which undergo embryonic lethality, homozygous CtipT855A/T855A mice develop normally. Nonetheless, they are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, and CtipT855A/T855A mouse embryo fibroblasts from these mice display marked defects in DNA resection, chromosomal stability, and HDR-mediated repair of DSBs. Thus, although ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP-T855 is not required for normal animal development, it enhances CtIP-mediated DNA resection in response to acute stress, such as genotoxin exposure.",

PAR relaxes chromatin and recruits other DNA repair factors, including XRCC1 and DNA Ligase 3, to maintain genomic stability. Here we show that, in contrast to the normal development of Parp1-null mice, heterozygous expression of catalytically inactive Parp1 (E988A, Parp1+/A) acts in a dominant-negative manner to disrupt murine embryogenesis. As such, all the surviving F1 Parp1+/A mice are chimeras with mixed Parp1+/AN (neoR retention) cells that act similarly to Parp1+/-. Pure F2 Parp1+/A embryos were found at Mendelian ratios at the E3.5 blastocyst stage but died before E9.5. Compared to Parp1-/- cells, genotype and expression-validated pure Parp1+/A cells retain significant ADP-ribosylation and PARylation activities but accumulate markedly higher levels of sister chromatid exchange and mitotic bridges. Despite proficiency for homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining measured by reporter assays and supported by normal lymphocyte and germ cell development, Parp1+/A cells are hypersensitive to base damages, radiation, and Topoisomerase I and II inhibition. The sensitivity of Parp1+/A cells to base damages and Topo inhibitors exceed Parp1-/- controls. The findings show that the enzymatically inactive PARP1 dominant negatively blocks DNA repair in selective pathways beyond wild-type PARP1 and establishes a crucial physiological difference between PARP1 inactivation vs. deletion.

alternative end-joining (A-EJ)-mediated translocations in cell-based reporter systems. To address the physiological role of CtIP, an essential gene, in translocation-mediated lymphomagenesis, we introduced the T855A mutation at murine CtIP to nonhomologous end-joining and Tp53 double-deficient mice that routinely succumbed to lymphomas carrying A-EJ-mediated IgH-Myc translocations. T855 of CtIP is phosphorylated by ATM or ATR kinases upon DNA damage to promote end resection. Here, we reported that the T855A mutation of CtIP compromised the neonatal development of Xrcc4-/-Tp53-/- mice and the IgH-Myc translocation-driven lymphomagenesis in DNA-PKcs-/-Tp53-/- mice. Mechanistically, the T855A mutation limits DNA end resection length without affecting hairpin opening, translocation frequency, or fork stability. Meanwhile, after radiation, CtIP-T855A mutant cells showed a consistent decreased Chk1 phosphorylation and defects in the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Consistent with the role of T855A mutation in lymphomagenesis beyond translocation, the CtIP-T855A mutation also delays splenomegaly in \u03bb-Myc mice.

The ligation step of CSR is usually mediated by the classical nonhomologous end-joining (cNHEJ) pathway. In cNHEJ-deficient cells, a remarkable \u223c25% of CSR can be achieved by the alternative end-joining (Alt-EJ) pathway that preferentially uses microhomology (MH) at the junctions. While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells.

Cachectic cancer patients have a reduced tolerance to antineoplastic therapies and often succumb to premature death from the wasting of respiratory and cardiac muscles. Since there are no available treatments for cachexia, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms that drive cachexia in order to devise effective strategies to treat it. Although 25% of metastatic breast cancer patients develop symptoms of muscle wasting, mechanistic studies of breast cancer cachexia have been hampered by a lack of experimental models. Using tumor cells deficient for BARD1, a subunit of the BRCA1/BARD1 tumor suppressor complex, we have developed a new orthotopic model of triple-negative breast cancer that spontaneously metastasizes to the lung and leads to systemic muscle deterioration. We show that expression of the metal-ion transporter, Zip14, is markedly upregulated in cachectic muscles from these mice and is associated with elevated intramuscular zinc and iron levels. Aberrant Zip14 expression and altered metal-ion homeostasis could therefore represent an underlying mechanism of cachexia development in human patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Our study provides a unique model for studying breast cancer cachexia and identifies a potential therapeutic target for its treatment.", "Keywords": ["BRCA mutations", "breast cancer", "cachexia", "metastasis", "mouse models"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "BRCA1 Protein", "Cachexia", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Norisoprenoids", "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases", "Up-Regulation", "Zinc"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ahmad Rushdi", "Last Name": "Shakri", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "James Zhong", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wanchao", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Coker", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rohaan", "Last Name": "Hegde", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanna", "Last Name": "Scholze", "Affiliation": "Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa", "Last Name": "Chin", "Affiliation": "Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Szabolcs", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanina", "Last Name": "Hibshoosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kurenai", "Last Name": "Tanji", "Affiliation": "Division of Neuropathology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anup", "Last Name": "Kumar Biswas", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Swarnali", "Last Name": "Acharyya", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Cancer medicine", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "32161084", "Title": "Silent renal infarcts prompt further investigation.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["arrhythmias", "neurological injury", "renal medicine"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Cerebral Infarction", "Delirium", "Factor Xa Inhibitors", "Female", "Humans", "Infarction", "Kidney Diseases", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Pyrazoles", "Pyridones"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aine", "Last Name": "Peoples", "Affiliation": "General Medicine, Mater Hospital Brisbane, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia peoplea@tcd.ie."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "Renal, Mater Hospital Brisbane, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Schweitzer", "Affiliation": "Centre for Neurosciences, Mater Misericordiae Brisbane Ltd, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Amos", "Affiliation": "Queensland X-Ray Pty Ltd, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}], "Journal": "BMJ case reports", "PubDate": "2020Mar10"}, {"PMID": "32160537", "Title": "Detection of Marker-Free Precision Genome Editing and Genetic Variation through the Capture of Genomic Signatures.", "Abstract": "Genome editing technologies have transformed our ability to engineer desired genomic changes within living systems.

To compare the effectiveness of real acupressure versus sham acupressure therapy in improving sleep quality in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) or hemodiafiltration (HDF). Methods. A multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in two Australian dialysis units located in Princess Alexandra Hospital and Logan Hospital, respectively. Forty-two subjects with self-reported poor sleep quality were randomly assigned to real (n = 21) or sham (n = 21) acupressure therapy delivered thrice weekly for four consecutive weeks during routine dialysis sessions. The primary outcome was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score measured at week four adjusted for baseline PSQI measurements. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (QOL) (SF-8), adverse events, and patient acceptability (treatment acceptability questionnaire, TAQ). Results. The two groups were comparable on global PSQI scores (difference 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.32 to 1.70) and on the subscale scores.

formation by preserving genomic stability. Similarly, the CtIP protein, which interacts with the BRCA1 tumor suppressor, is also thought to have tumor suppression activity. Through its role in DNA end resection, CtIP facilitates DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (DSBR-HR) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). In addition, however, CtIP has also been implicated in the formation of aberrant chromosomal rearrangements in an MMEJ-dependent manner, an activity that could potentially promote tumor development by increasing genome instability. To clarify whether CtIP acts in vivo to suppress or promote tumorigenesis, we have examined its oncogenic potential in mouse models of human breast cancer. Surprisingly, mice heterozygous for a null Ctip allele did not display an increased susceptibility to tumor formation. Moreover, mammary-specific biallelic CtIP ablation did not elicit breast tumors in a manner reminiscent of BRCA1 loss. Instead, CtIP inactivation dramatically reduced the kinetics of mammary tumorigenesis in mice bearing mammary-specific lesions of the p53 gene. Thus, unlike other repair factors, CtIP is not a tumor suppressor, but has oncogenic properties that can promote tumorigenesis, consistent with its ability to facilitate MMEJ-dependent chromosomal instability. Consequently, inhibition of CtIP-mediated MMEJ may prove effective against tumor types, such as human breast cancer, that display MMEJ-dependent chromosomal rearrangements.", "Keywords": ["CtIP", "DNA break repair", "DNA resection", "chromosomal instability", "tumor suppression"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Carrier Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "DNA Damage", "DNA End-Joining Repair", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genomic Instability", "Heterozygote", "Mammary Glands, Animal", "Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Milk Proteins", "Oncogenes", "Phenotype", "Recombinational DNA Repair", "Time Factors", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Colleen R", "Last Name": "Reczek", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Reena", "Last Name": "Shakya", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yana", "Last Name": "Miteva", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Szabolcs", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Ludwig", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Oncotarget", "PubDate": "2016May31"}, {"PMID": "26880199", "Title": "MRN, CtIP, and BRCA1 mediate repair of topoisomerase II-DNA adducts.", "Abstract": "Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with complex ends poses a special challenge, as additional processing is required before DNA ligation.

Factors implicated in resection include nucleases MRE11, EXO1, and DNA2, which process DNA ends into 3' ssDNA overhangs; helicases such as BLM, which unwind DNA; and other proteins such as BRCA1 and CtIP whose functions remain unclear. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of CtIP on T847 is required to promote resection, whereas CDK-dependent phosphorylation of CtIP-S327 is required for interaction with BRCA1. Here, we provide evidence that CtIP functions independently of BRCA1 in promoting DSB end resection. First, using mouse models expressing S327A or T847A mutant CtIP as a sole species, and B cells deficient in CtIP, we show that loss of the CtIP-BRCA1 interaction does not detectably affect resection, maintenance of genomic stability or viability, whereas T847 is essential for these functions. Second, although loss of 53BP1 rescues the embryonic lethality and HR defects in BRCA1-deficient mice, it does not restore viability or genome integrity in CtIP(-/-) mice. Third, the increased resection afforded by loss of 53BP1 and the rescue of BRCA1-deficiency depend on CtIP but not EXO1. Finally, the sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient cells to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition is partially rescued by the phospho-mimicking mutant CtIP (CtIP-T847E).

Patients with HIV are at higher risk of acute and chronic renal dysfunction, so baseline assessment and ongoing monitoring of renal function is an important part of routine management of patients with HIV. Given the paucity of evidence in this area, we sought to establish a consensus view on how routine monitoring could be performed in Australian patients on ART regimens, especially those involving TDF. A group of nephrologists and prescribers (an HIV physician and a hepatologist) were assembled by Gilead to discuss practical and reasonable renal management strategies for patients particularly those on TDF-based combination regimens (in the case of those with HIV-infection) or on TDF-monotherapy (in the case of HBV-mono infection). The group considered which investigations should be performed as part of routine practice, their frequency, and when specialist renal referral is warranted. The algorithm presented suggests testing for serum creatinine along with plasma phosphate and an assessment of urinary protein (rather than albumin) and glucose. Here we advocate baseline tests of renal function at initiation of therapy. If creatinine excretion inhibitors (e.g. cobicistat or rilpivirine) are used as part of the ART regimen, we suggest creatinine is rechecked at 4\u00a0weeks and this value used as the new baseline.

Chromatin binding by modified CtIP precedes extensive resection and full checkpoint activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Extracts", "Chromatin", "Conserved Sequence", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Cleavage", "DNA Repair", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Rabbits", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Xenopus Proteins", "Xenopus laevis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shaun E", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yinyin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Foon", "Last Name": "Wu-Baer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian T", "Last Name": "Chait", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Max E", "Last Name": "Gottesman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Gautier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular cell", "PubDate": "2013Feb21"}, {"PMID": "23254285", "Title": "Mechanism of DNA resection during intrachromosomal recombination and immunoglobulin class switching.", "Abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are byproducts of normal cellular metabolism and obligate intermediates in antigen receptor diversification reactions. These lesions are potentially dangerous because they can lead to deletion of genetic material or chromosome translocation. The chromatin-binding protein 53BP1 and the histone variant H2AX are required for efficient class switch (CSR) and V(D)J recombination in part because they protect DNA ends from resection and thereby favor nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Here, we examine the mechanism of DNA end resection in primary B cells. We find that resection depends on both CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP, Rbbp8) and exonuclease 1 (Exo1). Inhibition of CtIP partially rescues the CSR defect in 53BP1- and H2AX-deficient lymphocytes, as does interference with the RecQ helicases Bloom (Blm) and Werner (Wrn). We conclude that CtIP, Exo1, and RecQ helicases contribute to the metabolism of DNA ends during DSB repair in B lymphocytes and that minimizing resection favors efficient CSR.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Base Sequence", "Carrier Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Repair", "DNA Repair Enzymes", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Endodeoxyribonucleases", "Endonucleases", "Exodeoxyribonucleases", "Histones", "Immunoglobulin Isotypes", "MRE11 Homologue Protein", "Mice", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nuclear Proteins", "RecQ Helicases", "Recombination, Genetic", "Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1", "V(D)J Recombination", "Werner Syndrome Helicase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Bothmer", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philipp C", "Last Name": "Rommel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Gazumyan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Federica", "Last Name": "Polato", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Colleen R", "Last Name": "Reczek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthias F", "Last Name": "Muellenbeck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sonja", "Last Name": "Schaetzlein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Winfried", "Last Name": "Edelmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Phang-Lang", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert M", "Last Name": "Brosh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Casellas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Ludwig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andr\u00e9", "Last Name": "Nussenzweig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel C", "Last Name": "Nussenzweig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davide F", "Last Name": "Robbiani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "PubDate": "2013Jan14"}]
