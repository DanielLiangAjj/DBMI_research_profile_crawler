To secure a reliable and cost-effective supply chain, it\u00a0is critical to unlock alternative lithium extraction resources beyond conventional brine. In this study, we develop an electrochemical method to directly leach lithium from \u03b1-phase spodumene. We find the H2O2 promoter can significantly reduce the leaching potential by facilitating the electron transfer and changing the reaction path. Upon leaching, \u03b2-phase spodumene shows a typical phase transformation to HAlSi2O6, while leached \u03b1-phase remains its original crystal phase with a lattice shrinkage. To demonstrate the scale-up potential of electrochemical leaching, we design a catalyst-modified high-throughput current collector for high loading of suspended spodumene, achieving a leaching current of 18\u2009mA and a leaching efficiency of 92.2%. Electrochemical leaching will revolutionize traditional leaching and recycling processes by minimizing the environmental footprint and energy consumption.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "John and Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianwei", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "John and Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "John and Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhen", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "John and Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Feifei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "John and Willie Leone Family Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. feifeishi@psu.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2024Jun13"}, {"PMID": "38847794", "Title": "Solvent-Mediated, Reversible Ternary Graphite Intercalation Compounds for Extreme-Condition Li-Ion Batteries.", "Abstract": "Traditional Li-ion intercalation chemistry into graphite anodes exclusively utilizes the cointercalation-free or cointercalation mechanism. The latter mechanism is based on ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs), where glyme solvents were explored and proved to deliver unsatisfactory cyclability in LIBs. Herein, we report a novel intercalation mechanism, that is, in situ synthesis of t-GIC in the tetrahydrofuran (THF) electrolyte via a spontaneous, controllable reaction between binary-GIC (b-GIC) and free THF molecules during initial graphite lithiation. The spontaneous transformation from b-GIC to t-GIC, which is different from conventional cointercalation chemistry, is characterized and quantified via operando synchrotron X-ray and electrochemical analyses. The resulting t-GIC chemistry obviates the necessity for complete Li-ion desolvation, facilitating rapid kinetics and synchronous charge/discharge of graphite particles, even under high current densities. Consequently, the graphite anode demonstrates unprecedented fast charging (1 min), dendrite-free low-temperature performance, and ultralong lifetimes exceeding 10\u2009000 cycles. Full cells coupled with a layered cathode display remarkable cycling stability upon a 15 min charging and excellent rate capability even at -40 \u00b0C. Furthermore, our chemical strategies are shown to extend beyond Li-ion batteries to encompass Na-ion and K-ion batteries, underscoring their broad applicability.

In this study, we analyze the nucleation mechanism of Li pits and their morphology evolution with a large population and electrode area (>0.45 cm2). We elucidate the dependence of the pit size and density on the current density and overpotential, which are aligned with classical nucleation theory. With a confocal laser scanning microscope, we reveal the preferential stripping on certain crystal grains and a new stripping mode between pure pitting and stripping without pitting. Descriptors like circularity and the aspect ratio (R) of the pit radius to depth are used to quantify the evolution of Li pits in three dimensions. As the pits grow, growth predominates along the through-planedirection, surpassing the expanding rate in the in-plane direction. After analyzing more than 1000 pits at each condition, we validate that the overpotential is inversely related to the pit radius and exponentially related to the rate of nucleation. With this established nucleation-overpotential relationship, we can better understand and predict the evolution of the surface area and roughness of Li electrodes under different stripping conditions.

UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was employed to chara-cterize the chemical components of non-polysaccharide fraction of Bletillae Rhizoma, and the common targets of Bletillae Rhizoma and gastric ulcer were screened out by network pharmacology. The &quot;drug-component-target-disease&quot; network was constructed. Protein-protein interaction(PPI) network was established by STRING. Gene Ontology(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed based on Matescape database to predict the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Bletillae Rhizoma. Finally, the gastric ulcer model was induced in mice by alcohol to verify the therapeutic effect and mechanism of non-polysaccharide fraction of Bletillae Rhizoma on gastric ulcer. Forty-seven chemical components were identified from non-polysaccharide fraction of Bletillae Rhizoma, among which gymnoside \u2160, gymnoside \u2161, militarine, bletilloside A, and shancigusin I might be the main active components of non-polysaccharide fraction of Bletillae Rhizoma against gastric ulcer. PPI network analysis revealed core targets such as albumin(ALB), serine/threonine kinase 1(AKT1), tumor necrosis factor(TNF), and epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that non-polysaccharide fraction of Bletillae Rhizoma mainly exerted the therapeutic effect by regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase B(AKT) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) signaling pathway, and Ras signaling pathway. The results of animal experiments showed that non-polysaccharide fraction of Bletillae Rhizoma could significantly improve alcohol-induced ulceration in mice to increase ulcer inhibition rate, decrease the levels of TNF-\u03b1, interleukin(IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP), and thromboxane B2(TXB2), elevated the le-vels of IL-10, prostaglandin E2(PGE2), epidermal growth factor(EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF), down-re-gulate the protein levels of PI3K and AKT, and up-regulate the protein levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT.

We show here that the accumulation of necHCs in human and mouse NASH liver is associated with an up-regulation of the \"don't-eat-me\" ligand CD47 on necHCs, but not on apoptotic hepatocytes, and an increase in the CD47 receptor SIRP\u03b1 on liver macrophages, consistent with impaired macrophage-mediated clearance of necHCs. In vitro, necHC clearance by primary liver macrophages was enhanced by treatment with either anti-CD47 or anti-SIRP\u03b1. In a proof-of-concept mouse model of inducible hepatocyte necroptosis, anti-CD47 antibody treatment increased necHC uptake by liver macrophages and inhibited markers of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, which is responsible for liver fibrogenesis. Treatment of two mouse models of diet-induced NASH with anti-CD47, anti-SIRP\u03b1, or AAV8-H1-shCD47 to silence CD47 in hepatocytes increased the uptake of necHC by liver macrophages and decreased markers of HSC activation and liver fibrosis.

The water-soluble polysaccharide is the main component of P. cocos decoction. The effects and mechanisms of the water-soluble polysaccharide from P. cocos (PCWP) were investigated in chronic sleep deprivation (CSD)-induced anxiety in rats. CSD induced anxiety, gut dysbiosis, and inflammatory responses, and reduced neurotransmitter levels, whereas PCWP intervention ameliorated anxiety-like behaviors, increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid in the hypothalamus, regulated gastrointestinal peptide levels, reduced inflammatory factors, and inhibited the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1/nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling pathway in rats with CSD.

Microbial nitrogen cycling begins with aerobic nitrification, which is also the key rate-limiting step. For over a century, it has been accepted that nitrification occurs sequentially involving ammonia oxidation, which produces nitrite followed by nitrite oxidation, generating nitrate. This perception was changed by the discovery of comammox Nitrospira bacteria and their metabolic pathway. In addition, this also provided us with new knowledge concerning the complex nitrogen cycle network. In the comammox process, ammonia can be completely oxidized to nitrate in one cell via the subsequent activity of the enzyme complexes, ammonia monooxygenase, hydroxylamine dehydrogenase, and nitrite oxidodreductase. Over the past five years, research on comammox made great progress. However, there still exist a lot of questions, including how much does comammox contribute to nitrification? How large is the diversity and are there new strains to be discovered? Do comammox bacteria produce the greenhouse gas N2O, and how or to which extent may they contribute to global climate change? The above four aspects are of great significance on the farmland nitrogen management, aquatic environment restoration, and mitigation of global climate change. As large number of comammox bacteria and pathways have been detected in various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, indicating that the comammox process may exert an important role in the global nitrogen cycle.", "Keywords": ["AOA", "AOB", "Comammox bacteria", "Ecosystems", "Microbial N-cycle", "Nitrification"], "MeSH terms": ["Ammonia", "Ammonium Compounds", "Archaea", "Bacteria", "Ecosystem", "Nitrates", "Nitrification", "Nitrites", "Nitrogen", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Phylogeny", "Soil Microbiology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guibing", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100085, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.

However, antidepressant-like effects of the main active ingredients of Wolfiporia cocos, total triterpenes of Wolfiporia cocos (TTWC), are not well studied. This study aimed to investigate those effects and explore their specific mechanisms of action in depth. Methods: Chemical components of TTWC were analyzed using LC-MS. Depression-like behavior in rats were induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The suppressive effects of TTWC (60, 120, 240\u00a0mg/kg) against CUMS-induced depression-like behavior were evaluated using the forced swimming test (FST), open field test (OFT) and sucrose preference test (SPT). Levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), glutamate (GLU), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-18 (IL-18), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in different groups were determined by ELISA. Western blotting (WB) was used to detect the expression of NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1, caspase-1, pro-IL-1beta, IL-1beta, pro-IL-18, and IL-18 in the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the mRNA levels of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 were detected by RT-PCR. Results: A total of 69 lanostane-type triterpene acids of TTWC were identified. The results showed that TTWC exhibited an antidepressant-like effect in CUMS rats, reversed the decreased sugar preference in the SPT, reduction of immobility time in the FST, reduced the rest time, increased the total moving distance in the OFT. TTWC increased 5-HT levels and decreased GLU levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, TTWC decreased CRH levels in serum, indicating the regulation of over-activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition, reduced serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The WB results implied that TTWC inhibited the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18 in the prefrontal cortex and enhanced the expression of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1beta, and pro-IL-18. Although most of the results were not significant, PCR results showed that TTWC inhibited the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18 in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: TTWC treatment exerted an antidepressant-like effect and regulates neurotransmitters, HPA axis and NLRP3 signaling pathway.

Impaired efferocytosis drives the formation of clinically dangerous necrotic atherosclerotic plaques, the underlying etiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). An intron of the gene encoding PHACTR1 contains rs9349379 (A>G), a common variant associated with CAD. As PHACTR1 is an actin-binding protein, we reasoned that if the rs9349379 risk allele G causes lower PHACTR1 expression in macrophages, it might link the risk allele to CAD via impaired efferocytosis. We show here that rs9349379-G/G was associated with lower levels of PHACTR1 and impaired efferocytosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages and human atherosclerotic lesional macrophages compared with rs9349379-A/A. Silencing PHACTR1 in human and mouse macrophages compromised AC engulfment, and Western diet-fed Ldlr-/- mice in which hematopoietic Phactr1 was genetically targeted showed impaired lesional efferocytosis, increased plaque necrosis, and thinner fibrous caps - all signs of vulnerable plaques in humans. Mechanistically, PHACTR1 prevented dephosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which was necessary for AC engulfment. In summary, rs9349379-G lowered PHACTR1, which, by lowering phospho-MLC, compromised efferocytosis.

Besides, LIBs own the characteristics of no memory effect, high charging and discharging rate, long cycle life\u00a0and high energy conversion rate. Therefore, LIBs have been widely considered as the most promising power source for mobile devices. Commonly used LIBs contain carbonate based liquid electrolytes. Such electrolytes own high ionic conductivity and excellent wetting ability. However, the use of highly flammable and volatile organic solvents in them may lead to problems like leakage, thermo runaway and parasitic interface reactions, which limit their application. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) can solve these problems, while they also bring new challenges such as poor interfacial contact with electrodes and low ionic conductivity at room temperature. Many approaches have been tried to solve these problems. This article is divided into three parts to introduce polyethylene oxide (PEO) based polymer-ceramic hybrid solid electrolyte, which is one of the most efficient way to improve the performance of SPEs. The first part focuses on polymer-lithium salt (LiX) matrices, including their ionic conduction mechanism and impact factors for their ionic conductivity. In the second part, the influence of both active and passive ceramic fillers on SPEs are reviewed.

Herein, we improve the charge transport in fluoride electrodes at both nano- and mesoscales to enable high-mass-loading fluoride electrodes.

At the mesoscale, we design a percolating three-dimensional porous carbon nanotube (CNT) network to enable fast pathways for both electrons and ions. The resulting spongelike material, FeOF/TiO2@CNT, substantially enhances the kinetics of the conversion reaction in FeOF, boosts extra lithium storage capacity, and reduces the voltage hysteresis. Steady cycling over 300 cycles is achieved at a high mass loading of 8.7 mg cm-2 (FeOF/TiO2) (1.74 mAh cm-2).

Existing methods for gene-level ASE detection analyze one individual at a time, therefore failing to account for shared information across individuals. Failure to accommodate such shared information not only reduces power, but also makes it difficult to interpret results across individuals. However, when only RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data are available, ASE detection across individuals is challenging because the data often include individuals that are either heterozygous or homozygous for the unobserved cis-regulatory SNP, leading to sample heterogeneity as only those heterozygous individuals are informative for ASE, whereas those homozygous individuals have balanced expression. To simultaneously model multi-individual information and account for such heterogeneity, we developed ASEP, a mixture model with subject-specific random effect to account for multi-SNP correlations within the same gene. ASEP only requires RNA-seq data, and is able to detect gene-level ASE under one condition and differential ASE between two conditions (e.g., pre- versus post-treatment). Extensive simulations demonstrated the convincing performance of ASEP under a wide range of scenarios. We applied ASEP to a human kidney RNA-seq dataset, identified ASE genes and validated our results with two published eQTL studies. We further applied ASEP to a human macrophage RNA-seq dataset, identified genes showing evidence of differential ASE between M0 and M1 macrophages, and confirmed our findings by results from cardiometabolic trait-relevant genome-wide association studies. To the best of our knowledge, ASEP is the first method for gene-level ASE detection at the population level that only requires the use of RNA-seq data.

In the pathogenesis of intellectual disability, the insufficiency of essential qi and the malnutrition of the prenatal essence and the postnatal essence result in the insufficiency of qi of five zang organs. Persistent sickness consumes qi and injures blood. The insufficiency of qi and blood causes the dysfunction of transportation and transformation. Hence, phlegm is produced and mixed with stasis. This disease is localized in the brain and closely related to heart, kidney, spleen and stomach. The \"yizhi touxue line\" was created on the base of the theory of qi street and the international standard of scalp acupuncture.

However, it remains challenging to develop solid electrolytes that are both mechanically robust and strong against external mechanical load, due to the brittleness of ceramic electrolytes and the softness of polymer electrolytes. Herein, a nacre-inspired design of ceramic/polymer solid composite electrolytes with a \"brick-and-mortar\" microstructure is proposed. The nacre-like ceramic/polymer electrolyte (NCPE) simultaneously possesses a much higher fracture strain (1.1%) than pure ceramic electrolytes (0.13%) and a much larger ultimate flexural modulus (7.8 GPa) than pure polymer electrolytes (20 MPa). The electrochemical performance of NCPE is also much better than pure ceramic or polymer electrolytes, especially under mechanical load. A 5 \u00d7 5 cm2 pouch cell with LAGP/poly(ether-acrylate) NCPE exhibits stable cycling with a capacity retention of 95.6% over 100 cycles at room temperature, even undergoes a large point load of 10 N.

We hypothesized that many human monocyte and adipose lincRNAs would be absent in current public annotations due to lincRNA tissue specificity, modest sequencing depth in public data, limitations of transcriptome assembly algorithms, and lack of dynamic physiological contexts. Deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed in peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes (monocytes; average ~247 million reads per sample) and adipose tissue (average ~378 million reads per sample) collected before and after human experimental endotoxemia, an in vivo inflammatory stress, to identify tissue-specific and clinically relevant lincRNAs. Using a stringent filtering pipeline, we identified 109 unannotated lincRNAs in monocytes and 270 unannotated lincRNAs in adipose. Most unannotated lincRNAs are not conserved in rodents and are tissue specific, while many have features of regulated expression and are enriched in transposable elements. Specific subsets have enhancer RNA characteristics or are expressed only during inflammatory stress. A subset of unannotated lincRNAs was validated and replicated for their presence and inflammatory induction in independent human samples and for their monocyte and adipocyte origins. Through interrogation of public genome-wide association data, we also found evidence of specific disease association for selective unannotated lincRNAs. Our findings highlight the critical need to perform deep RNA-Seq in a cell-, tissue-, and context-specific manner to annotate the full repertoire of human lincRNAs for a complete understanding of lincRNA roles in dynamic cell functions and in human disease.", "Keywords": ["RNA-Seq", "de novo assembly", "human", "inflammation", "lincRNA"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adolescent", "Adult", "DNA Transposable Elements", "Endotoxemia", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monocytes", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jane F", "Last Name": "Ferguson", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Translational and Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christine C", "Last Name": "Hinkle", "Affiliation": "Gene Therapy Program, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Mingyao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; mpr2144@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Physiological genomics", "PubDate": "2017Jun01"}, {"PMID": "28337394", "Title": "Chloroplast microsatellite markers for Pseudotaxus chienii developed from the whole chloroplast genome of Taxus chinensis var. mairei (Taxaceae).", "Abstract": "Pseudotaxus chienii (Taxaceae) is an old rare species endemic to China that has adapted well to ecological heterogeneity with high genetic diversity in its nuclear genome.

Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) may have systemic and adipose tissue-specific anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective action. Interactions between calgranulins and the unsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) have been reported, yet little is known about the relationship between calgranulins and the LC n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We explored tissue-specific action of calgranulins in the setting of evoked endotoxemia and n-3 PUFA supplementation. Expression of calgranulins in adipose tissue in vivo was assessed by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) before and after n-3 PUFA supplementation and evoked endotoxemia in the fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty acid modulation of endotoxemia (FFAME) Study. Subjects received n-3 PUFA (n = 8; 3600mg/day EPA/DHA) or matched placebo (n = 6) for 6-8 weeks, before completing an endotoxin challenge (LPS 0.6 ng/kg).

In an independent evoked endotoxemia study, calgranulin gene expression correlated with the systemic inflammatory response. Through in vivo and in vitro interrogation we highlight differential responses in adipocytes and mononuclear cells during inflammation, with n-3 PUFA leading to increased calgranulin expression in adipose, but decreased expression in circulating cells.

For three lncRNAs (MIR210HG, linc-ATP13A4-8, and linc-KIAA1737-2) that fulfilled our criteria, we validated their expression patterns, examined their loci for conservation and synteny, and defined their associated epigenetic marks. The lncRNA landscape characterized here provides insights into novel transcriptomic variations in the renal epithelial cell response to hypoxic and inflammatory stress.", "Keywords": ["RNA sequencing", "epithelial injury", "hypoxia", "inflammation", "noncoding RNA"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Line", "Cytokines", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Epithelial Cells", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Markers", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Inflammation", "Inflammation Mediators", "Kidney Tubules, Proximal", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sepsis", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennie", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Renal Electrolyte and Hypertension Division, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; linjenn@mail.med.upenn.edu."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Chenyi", "Last Name": "Xue", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Michael G S", "Last Name": "Shashaty", "Affiliation": "Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Division, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Sager J", "Last Name": "Gosai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Nuala", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Division, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Grazioli", "Affiliation": "Renal Electrolyte and Hypertension Division, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Hinkle", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Caughey", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Wenjun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Katalin", "Last Name": "Susztak", "Affiliation": "Renal Electrolyte and Hypertension Division, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Brian D", "Last Name": "Gregory", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Mingyao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Although ABO blood group is associated with variations in concentrations of circulating von Willebrand Factor and other endothelial cell adhesion molecules, ABO antigens are also present on several platelet surface glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids.

In myeloid cells, there is a temporal regulation to induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the proinflammatory microRNA miR-155 that correlates inversely with levels of BMAL1. BMAL1 in the myeloid lineage inhibits activation of NF-\u03baB and miR-155 induction and protects mice from LPS-induced sepsis. Bmal1 has two miR-155-binding sites in its 3'-UTR, and, in response to LPS, miR-155 binds to these two target sites, leading to suppression of Bmal1 mRNA and protein in mice and humans. miR-155 deletion perturbs circadian function, gives rise to a shorter circadian day, and ablates the circadian effect on cytokine responses to LPS. Thus, the molecular clock controls miR-155 induction that can repress BMAL1 directly.

We examined transcriptional profiles in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), perivascular fat adjacent to the LAD, and descending thoracic aorta between obese (n = 5) and lean (n = 6) juvenile Ossabaw pigs (age = 22 wk). Obesity was experimentally induced by feeding the animals a high-fat/high-fructose corn syrup/high-cholesterol diet for 16 wk. We found that expression of 189 vascular cell genes in the LAD and expression of 165 genes in the thoracic aorta were altered with juvenile obesity (false discovery rate \u2264 10%) with an overlap of only 28 genes between both arteries. Notably, a number of genes found to be markedly upregulated in the LAD of obese pigs are implicated in atherosclerosis, including ACP5, LYZ, CXCL14, APOE, PLA2G7, LGALS3, SPP1, ITGB2, CYBB, and P2RY12. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed the induction of proinflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways with obesity primarily in the LAD. Gene expression in the LAD perivascular fat was minimally altered with juvenile obesity. Together, we provide new evidence that obesity produces artery-specific changes in pretranslational regulation with a clear upregulation of proatherogenic genes in the LAD. Our data may offer potential viable drug targets and mechanistic insights regarding the molecular precursors involved in the origins of overnutrition and obesity-associated vascular disease. In particular, our results suggest that the oxidized LDL/LOX-1/NF-\u03baB signaling axis may be involved in the early initiation of a juvenile obesity-induced proatherogenic coronary artery phenotype.", "Keywords": ["childhood obesity", "endothelial function", "gene expression", "overnutrition"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Aorta, Thoracic", "Computational Biology", "Coronary Vessels", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Lipoproteins, LDL", "NF-kappa B", "Obesity", "Scavenger Receptors, Class E", "Swine", "Vasodilation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jaume", "Last Name": "Padilla", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211, USA. padillaja@missouri.edu"}, {"First Name": "Nathan T", "Last Name": "Jenkins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sewon", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mozow Y", "Last Name": "Zuidema", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cuihua", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James W", "Last Name": "Perfield", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jamal A", "Last Name": "Ibdah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frank W", "Last Name": "Booth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Wade", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M Harold", "Last Name": "Laughlin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "R Scott", "Last Name": "Rector", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Physiological genomics", "PubDate": "2013Jun03"}]
