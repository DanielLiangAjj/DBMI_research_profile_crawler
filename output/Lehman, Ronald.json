[{"PMID": "38758005", "Title": "Timing-dependent synergies between motor cortex and posterior spinal stimulation in humans.", "Abstract": "Volitional movement requires descending input from the motor cortex and sensory feedback through the spinal cord. We previously developed a paired brain and spinal electrical stimulation approach in rats that relies on convergence of the descending motor and spinal sensory stimuli in the cervical cord. This approach strengthened sensorimotor circuits and improved volitional movement through associative plasticity. In humans, it is not known whether posterior epidural spinal cord stimulation targeted at the sensorimotor interface or anterior epidural spinal cord stimulation targeted within the motor system is effective at facilitating brain evoked responses. In 59 individuals undergoing elective cervical spine decompression surgery, the motor cortex was stimulated with scalp electrodes and the spinal cord was stimulated with epidural electrodes, with muscle responses being recorded in arm and leg muscles. Spinal electrodes were placed either posteriorly or anteriorly, and the interval between cortex and spinal cord stimulation was varied. Pairing stimulation between the motor cortex and spinal sensory (posterior) but not spinal motor (anterior) stimulation produced motor evoked potentials that were over five times larger than brain stimulation alone. This strong augmentation occurred only when descending motor and spinal afferent stimuli were timed to converge in the spinal cord. Paired stimulation also increased the selectivity of muscle responses relative to unpaired brain or spinal cord stimulation. Finally, clinical signs suggest that facilitation was observed in both injured and uninjured segments of the spinal cord. The large effect size of this paired stimulation makes it a promising candidate for therapeutic neuromodulation. KEY POINTS: Pairs of stimuli designed to alter nervous system function typically target the motor system, or one targets the sensory system and the other targets the motor system for convergence in cortex. In humans undergoing clinically indicated surgery, we tested paired brain and spinal cord stimulation that we developed in rats aiming to target sensorimotor convergence in the cervical cord. Arm and hand muscle responses to paired sensorimotor stimulation were more than five times larger than brain or spinal cord stimulation alone when applied to the posterior but not anterior spinal cord. Arm and hand muscle responses to paired stimulation were more selective for targeted muscles than the brain- or spinal-only conditions, especially at latencies that produced the strongest effects of paired stimulation. Measures of clinical evidence of compression were only weakly related to the paired stimulation effect, suggesting that it could be applied as therapy in people affected by disorders of the central nervous system.", "Keywords": ["cervical", "electrical stimulation", "epidural", "motor cortex", "motor evoked potentials", "myelopathy", "spinal cord"], "MeSH terms": ["Motor Cortex", "Humans",

Here, we review several technical considerations with the goal of increasing efficiency and improving outcomes with the 3-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Diskectomy", "Postoperative Complications", "Spondylosis", "Radiculopathy", "Deglutition Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center, New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Och Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Clinical spine surgery", "PubDate": "2022Dec01"}, {"PMID": "36417309", "Title": "Intraoperative electrical stimulation of the human dorsal spinal cord reveals a map of arm and hand muscle responses.", "Abstract": "Although epidural stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord has emerged as a powerful modality for recovery of movement, how it should be targeted to the cervical spinal cord to activate arm and hand muscles is not well understood, particularly in humans. We sought to map muscle responses to posterior epidural cervical spinal cord stimulation in humans. We hypothesized that lateral stimulation over the dorsal root entry zone would be most effective and responses would be strongest in the muscles innervated by the stimulated segment. Twenty-six people undergoing clinically indicated cervical spine surgery consented to mapping of motor responses. During surgery, stimulation was performed in midline and lateral positions at multiple exposed segments; six arm and three leg muscles were recorded on each side of the body. Across all segments and muscles tested, lateral stimulation produced stronger muscle responses than midline despite similar latency and shape of responses. Muscles innervated at a cervical segment had the largest responses from stimulation at that segment, but responses were also observed in muscles innervated at other cervical segments and in leg muscles. The cervical responses were clustered in rostral (C4-C6) and caudal (C7-T1) cervical segments. Strong responses to lateral stimulation are likely due to the proximity of stimulation to afferent axons. Small changes in response sizes to stimulation of adjacent cervical segments argue for local circuit integration, and distant muscle responses suggest activation of long propriospinal connections. This map can help guide cervical stimulation to improve arm and hand function.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A map of muscle responses to cervical epidural stimulation during clinically indicated surgery revealed strongest activation when stimulating laterally compared to midline and revealed differences to be weaker than expected across different segments. In contrast, waveform shapes and latencies were most similar when stimulating midline and laterally, indicating activation of overlapping circuitry. Thus, a map of the cervical spinal cord reveals organization and may help guide stimulation to activate arm and hand muscles strongly and selectively.", "Keywords": ["cervical spinal cord injury",

In this way, the oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) is more closely related to a supine anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) except that the former is performed in a lateral position down a smaller minimally invasive retroperitoneal corridor. This lateral positioning at L5-S1, however, provides an opportunity for single-position surgery simultaneously with posterior fixation, which is not afforded by other approaches. \u2003We present here a case of a 57-yr-old male with a prior right-sided L5-S1 microdiscectomy who presents with worsening lumbar radiculopathy and foot drop. He subsequently underwent a minimally invasive L5-S1 OLIF with posterior instrumentation placed bilaterally while remaining in a single lateral position (Mazor X Stealth Edition, Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). Both the anterior OLIF surgeon and posterior instrumentation surgeon were able to work simultaneously. There is currently a need for further high-quality operative videos showing the L5-S1 OLIF technique, and to our knowledge, this is the first video demonstrating a 2-surgeon near-simultaneous workflow approach using a spinal robotics platform at this level. \u2003There is no identifying information in this video.

We expand the role of robotics with a simultaneous workflow where 2 surgeons can work in single position surgery and discuss the technical feasibility of placement of S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screws in the lateral position. A 70-year-old male presented with chronic back pain and bilateral leg pain with the left side worse than the right. He subsequently underwent an L3-S1 oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) with a minimally invasive L3-ilium robotic posterior spinal fixation simultaneously in single lateral position with S2AI screws. The software planning requisite of robotics allowed for a preoperative plan where lumbar cortical screws were used to line up with bilateral S2AI screws. Intraoperatively, the OLIF was performed anterior to the patient which allowed for a second surgeon to perform the posterior stage of screw placement simultaneously in overlapping fashion during OLIF exposure. Once all screws were placed, the OLIF discectomy and cage placement were completed. As the OLIF incision is closed, rodding proceeds posteriorly with subsequent closure simultaneously as well. Operative time from skin incision to skin closure was 3 hours and 47 minutes. We present here a novel technical report on the recommended workflow of simultaneous robotic single position surgery OLIF and demonstrate the feasibility of placement of sacroiliac fixation in the lateral decubitus position.

Patients are often introduced to opioids following surgical procedures-this is particularly relevant following spinal surgery. Surgeons can help reduce this opioid burden by finding alternatives to narcotic analgesia in the postoperative period. One such medication that has shown potential in this role is ketamine, which has been studied in various surgical specialties. A review was performed of current literature regarding ketamine use in the perioperative period specific to spinal surgery. This review focused on prospective randomized control trials; the primary endpoint was opioid consumption in the postoperative period, monitored through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use. Both pediatric and adult spinal surgery patients were included; cervical, thoracic, and lumbar procedures were also all included. 10 studies were selected for this reviewed based on inclusion criteria, published between 2004 and 2017. 7 of these studies demonstrated a significant decrease in postoperative opioid use with the integration of ketamine in the perioperative period, while 3 trials showed no significant difference in opioid consumption. There is inherent difficulty in standardizing studies of this nature-dosing protocols, medication timing, and supplemental analgesia were variable throughout the included studies. However, this review of the most up-to-date prospective studies indicate ketamine has potential to play a significant role in reducing opioid requirements following spinal surgery, and further study is warranted in this field.", "Keywords": ["Ketamine", "opioid", "pain control", "spinal surgery"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melvin C", "Last Name": "Makhni", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meghan", "Last Name": "Cerpa", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of spine surgery (Hong Kong)", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "33065691", "Title": "Cervical Spinal Fusion in Adult Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: A National Analysis of Complications and 90-day Readmissions.", "Abstract": "Retrospective cohort study.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Humans", "Inpatients", "Male", "Medicare", "Middle Aged", "Patient Readmission", "Pneumonia", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Spinal Diseases", "Spinal Fusion", "United States", "Urinary Tract Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael W", "Last Name": "Fields", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nathan J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Daniel Y", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ashok", "Last Name": "Para", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ."}, {"First Name": "Venkat", "Last Name": "Boddapati", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Mathew", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jun S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Lombardi", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "K Daniel", "Last Name": "Riew", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Och Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Spine", "PubDate": "2021Jan01"}, {"PMID": "33049410", "Title": "Are outpatient three- and four-level anterior cervical discectomies and fusion safe?", "Abstract": "The safety of outpatient one- and two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been validated in a number of recent studies.

Biomechanical studies suggest that plates with locking screws can enhance the fixation rigidity and pull-out strength. Although longer screws are known to be correlated with increased pull-out strength, deeper screw depths can increase the risk for intraoperative complications. An important factor that has yet to be studied is the minimum screw length relative to the diameter of the vertebral body (VB) necessary to achieve successful fusion.

The S2AI screws are often used for lumbosacral fixation at the base of long spinal deformity constructs. In severe spinal deformities, additional pelvic fixation beyond the standard 2 screws may help achieve and maintain correction, and also increase the rigidity of the construct. With a thorough understanding of pelvic anatomy, multiple pelvic screws, such as bilateral dual S2AI screws, may be placed safely to achieve stability and accommodate additional rods to perform powerful correction techniques. We illustrate the safe use of multiple rods across the lumbosacral junction in this case, by using both a hook rod construct and domino connectors - ultimately though these additional rods rely on the integrity of the pelvic fixation to provide their support. We recommend at least 3 rods across the lumbosacral junction in any adult spinal deformity case requiring pelvic fixation, and would recommend considering more than 3 rods, especially across 3-column osteotomy sites. For long spinal constructs in patients with significant adult spinal deformity, we believe the use of multiple pelvic screws to a multirod construct is a safe and effective way to provide long-term correction and clinical success.", "Keywords": ["Pelvic fixation", "Spine deformity", "Spine surgery"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James D", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melvin C", "Last Name": "Makhni", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meghan", "Last Name": "Cerpa", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Neurospine", "PubDate": "2020Jun"}, {"PMID": "31687312", "Title": "Job Selection After Orthopedic Surgery Training: Why Are Our Trainees Failing to Select the Right Job?", "Abstract": "A survey was administered to a random sampling of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) members to determine the rate at which recently trained orthopedic surgeons switch their first job and to identify factors affecting the job selection process.

The margin for error will be quantified by the maximal insertional arc (MIA).METHODSThe study population included 10 consecutive operative patients with adult idiopathic scoliosis who underwent primary surgery. All measurements were performed using 3D visualization software by an attending spine surgeon. The screw starting points were 2 mm lateral to the midline of the SAF in the mediolateral direction and in the center of the pedicle in the cephalocaudal direction. The DSP was on the dorsal cortex. The ventral starting point (VSP) was at the depth of the SAF. Measurements included distance to the pedicle isthmus, MIA, and screw trajectories.RESULTSTen patients and 110 vertebral levels (T1-11) were measured. The patients' average age was 41.4 years (range 18-64 years). The pedicle isthmus was largest at T1 (4.04 \u00b1 1.09 mm), and smallest at T5 (1.05 \u00b1 0.93 mm). The distance to the pedicle isthmus was 7.47 mm for the VSP and 11.92 mm for the DSP (p < 0.001). The MIA was 15.3\u00b0 for the VSP and 10.1\u00b0 for the DSP (p < 0.001). Screw angulation was 21.7\u00b0 for the VSP and 16.8\u00b0 for the DSP (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONSA more ventral starting point for thoracic pedicle screws results in increased MIA and more medial screw angulation.

The S2 alar-iliac (S2AI) trajectory has been introduced as a method of pelvic fixation to decrease strain on S1 screws. The S2AI screws differ in several ways from traditional iliac screws. The trajectory of these screws helps avoid the use of offset connectors due to the screws alignment with the proximal pedicle screw instrumentation. Current literature shows that S2AI screws are effective with low complication rates, but the path of these screws is intimately associated with major neural and vascular structures.

This paper reviews studies on biomarkers of low back pain (LBP) in human subjects. LBP is the leading cause of disability, caused by various spine-related disorders, including intervertebral disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and facet arthritis. The focus of these studies is inflammatory mediators, because inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of disc degeneration and associated pain mechanisms. Increasingly, studies suggest that the presence of inflammatory mediators can be measured systemically in the blood. These biomarkers may serve as novel tools for directing patient care. Currently, patient response to treatment is unpredictable with a significant rate of recurrence, and, while surgical treatments may provide anatomical correction and pain relief, they are invasive and costly. The review covers studies performed on populations with specific diagnoses and undefined origins of LBP. Since the natural history of LBP is progressive, the temporal nature of studies is categorized by duration of symptomology/disease. Related studies on changes in biomarkers with treatment are also reviewed. Ultimately, diagnostic biomarkers of LBP and spinal degeneration have the potential to shepherd an era of individualized spine medicine for personalized therapeutics in the treatment of LBP.", "Keywords": ["back pain", "biomarkers", "inflammation", "intervertebral disc degeneration", "spine"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Inflammation Mediators", "Intervertebral Disc Degeneration", "Low Back Pain", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aysha N", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hayley E", "Last Name": "Jacobsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jansher", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher G", "Last Name": "Filippi", "Affiliation": "Lenox Hill Hospital, Northwell Health, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Lenox Hill Hospital, Northwell Health, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "K Daniel", "Last Name": "Riew", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nadeen O", "Last Name": "Chahine", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "29227322", "Title": "No Clear Benefit of Chlorhexidine Use at Home Before Surgical Preparation.", "Abstract": "Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of home use of chlorhexidine before surgery to reduce bacterial colonization.

Since ATTR preferentially deposits in ligaments, tendons, and articular cartilage, we hypothesized that ATTR-CA patients have a greater prevalence of total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasties compared with the general population, and that arthroplasty occurs significantly before ATTR-CA diagnosis. Three-hundred and thirteen patients with cardiac amyloidosis (172 with ATTR-CA, 141 with light-chain) from our institutional database were analyzed and compared to published data in over 300 million patients. Overall, 23.3% of patients with ATTR-CA and 9.2% of patients with light-chain cardiac amyloidosis (AL-CA) underwent lower extremity arthroplasty. Compared to the general population, both THA and TKA were significantly more common among patients with ATTR-CA (THA: RR 5.61, 95% CI 2.25-4.64; TKA: RR 3.32, 95% CI 2.25-4.64) but not those with AL-CA (THA: RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.85-4.08; TKA: RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.73-2.84). On an average, arthroplasty occurred 7.2\u2009years before ATTR-CA diagnosis.", "Keywords": ["Cardiac amyloidosis", "arthroplasty", "light-chain", "transthyretin"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80

Omitting a PLF significantly reduces overall surface area available for achieving a solid arthrodesis, however it decreases the soft tissue dissection and costs of additional bone graft. The authors sought to perform a meta-analysis to establish the fusion rate of MIS TLIF performed without attempting a PLF. We performed an extensive Medline and Ovid database search through December 2010 revealing 39 articles. Inclusion criteria necessitated that a one or two level TLIF procedure was performed through a paramedian MIS approach with bilateral posterior pedicle screw instrumentation and without posterolateral bone grafting. CT scan verified fusion rates were mandatory for inclusion. Seven studies (case series and case-controls) met inclusion criteria with a total of 408 patients who underwent MIS TLIF as described above. The mean age was 50.7 years and 56.6% of patients were female. A total of 78.9% of patients underwent single level TLIF. Average radiographic follow-up was 15.6 months. All patients had local autologous interbody bone grafting harvested from the pars interarticularis and facet joint of the approach side. Either polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or allograft interbody cages were used in all patients. Overall fusion rate, confirmed by bridging trabecular interbody bone on CT scan, was 94.7%.

Based on their increasing experience with cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) in this unique patient population, the authors set out to further evaluate the outcomes and complications of CDA in active duty military patients. A retrospective review of a single military tertiary medical center was performed between August 2008 and August 2012 and the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent cervical disc arthroplasty were evaluated. There were 37 active duty military patients, with a total of 41 CDA. The study found good relief of preoperative symptoms (92%) and the ability to maintain operational readiness with a high rate of return to full unrestricted duty (95%) with an average follow-up of 6 months. There was a low rate of complications related to the anterior cervical approach (5%-8%), with no device- or implant-related complications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Arthroplasty", "Cervical Vertebrae", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Military Personnel", "Radiculopathy", "Retrospective Studies", "Return to Work", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel G", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA. daniel.g.kang@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert W", "Last Name": "Tracey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Cody", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael K", "Last Name": "Rosner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam J", "Last Name": "Bevevino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of surgical orthopaedic advances", "PubDate": "2013Spring"}]
