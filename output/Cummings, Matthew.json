[{"PMID": "38368384", "Title": "COVID-19 immune signatures in Uganda persist in HIV co-infection and diverge by pandemic phase.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in sub-Saharan Africa, where severe COVID-19 fatality rates are among the highest in the world and the immunological landscape is unique. In a prospective cohort study of 306 adults encompassing the entire clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda, we profile the peripheral blood proteome and transcriptome to characterize the immunopathology of COVID-19 across multiple phases of the pandemic. Beyond the prognostic importance of myeloid cell-driven immune activation and lymphopenia, we show that multifaceted impairment of host protein synthesis and redox imbalance define core biological signatures of severe COVID-19, with central roles for IL-7, IL-15, and lymphotoxin-\u03b1 in COVID-19 respiratory failure. While prognostic signatures are generally consistent in SARS-CoV-2/HIV-coinfection, type I interferon responses uniquely scale with COVID-19 severity in persons living with HIV. Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 severity peaked during phases dominated by A.23/A.23.1 and Delta B.1.617.2/AY variants. Independent of clinical severity, Delta phase COVID-19 is distinguished by exaggerated pro-inflammatory myeloid cell and inflammasome activation, NK and CD8+ T cell depletion, and impaired host protein synthesis. Combining these analyses with a contemporary Ugandan cohort of adults hospitalized with influenza and other severe acute respiratory infections, we show that activation of epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor pathways are distinct features of COVID-19, deepening translational understanding of mechanisms potentially underlying SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, our findings provide biological rationale for use of broad and targeted immunotherapies for severe COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa, illustrate the relevance of local viral and host factors to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology, and highlight underemphasized yet therapeutically exploitable immune pathways driving COVID-19 severity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans",

In this context, patient stratification based on biomarkers of a dysregulated host response may identify subgroups more likely to respond to targeted immunomodulatory therapeutics. In a prospective cohort of adults hospitalized with suspected sepsis in Uganda, we applied machine learning methods to develop a prediction model for 30-day mortality that integrates physiology-based risk scores with soluble biomarkers reflective of key domains of sepsis immunopathology. After model evaluation and internal validation, whole-blood RNA sequencing data were analyzed to compare biological pathway enrichment and inferred immune cell profiles between patients assigned differential model-based risks of mortality. Of 260 eligible adults (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 26-43 years; 59.2% female, 53.9% living with HIV), 62 (23.8%) died by 30 days after hospital discharge. Among 14 biomarkers, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) demonstrated the greatest importance for mortality prediction in machine learning models. A clinicomolecular model integrating sTNFR1 and Ang-2 with the Universal Vital Assessment (UVA) risk score optimized 30-day mortality prediction across multiple performance metrics. Patients assigned to the high-risk, UVA-based clinicomolecular subgroup exhibited a transcriptional profile defined by proinflammatory innate immune and necroptotic pathway activation, T-cell exhaustion, and expansion of key immune cell subsets including regulatory and gamma-delta T cells. Clinicomolecular stratification of adults with suspected sepsis in Uganda enhanced 30-day mortality prediction and identified a high-risk subgroup with a therapeutically targetable immunological profile.

Objectives: To identify clinically relevant, novel subgroups in COVID-19-related ARDS and compare them with previously described ARDS subphenotypes. Methods: Eligible participants were adults with COVID-19 and ARDS at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups with baseline clinical, respiratory, and laboratory data serving as partitioning variables. A previously developed machine learning model was used to classify patients as the hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between subgroups. Heterogeneity of treatment effect for corticosteroid use in subgroups was tested. Measurements and Main Results: From March 2, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 483 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS met study criteria. A two-class latent class analysis model best fit the population (P\u2009=\u20090.0075). Class 2 (23%) had higher proinflammatory markers, troponin, creatinine, and lactate, lower bicarbonate, and lower blood pressure than class 1 (77%). Ninety-day mortality was higher in class 2 versus class 1 (75% vs. 48%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Considerable overlap was observed between these subgroups and ARDS subphenotypes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR cycle threshold was associated with mortality in the hypoinflammatory but not the hyperinflammatory phenotype. Heterogeneity of treatment effect to corticosteroids was observed (P\u2009=\u20090.0295), with improved mortality in the hyperinflammatory phenotype and worse mortality in the hypoinflammatory phenotype, with the caveat that corticosteroid treatment was not randomized. Conclusions: We identified two COVID-19-related ARDS subgroups with differential outcomes, similar to previously described ARDS subphenotypes. SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold had differential value for predicting mortality in the subphenotypes. The subphenotypes had differential treatment responses to corticosteroids.", "Keywords": ["ARDS", "COVID-19", "latent class analysis", "phenotyping"], "MeSH terms": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Aged", "COVID-19", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Latent Class Analysis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Retrospective Studies", "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pratik", "Last Name": "Sinha", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Washington University Medical School, Saint Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Furfaro", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Cummings", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Darryl", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Delucchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences."}, {"First Name": "Manoj V", "Last Name": "Maddali", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "June", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Washington University Medical School, Saint Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Murn", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Fountain", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Shelief Y", "Last Name": "Robbins-Juarez", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew A", "Last Name": "Adan", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Tejus", "Last Name": "Satish", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mahesh", "Last Name": "Madhavan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Aakriti", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Alexander K", "Last Name": "Lyashchenko", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cara", "Last Name": "Agerstrand", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Natalie H", "Last Name": "Yip", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kristin M", "Last Name": "Burkart", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy R", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Baldwin", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn S", "Last Name": "Calfee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Brodie", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Max R", "Last Name": "O'Donnell", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2021Dec01"}, {"PMID": "34370701", "Title": "Severe COVID-19 in Uganda across Two Epidemic Phases: A Prospective Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Among a prospective cohort of children and adults admitted to a national COVID-19 treatment unit in Uganda from March to December 2020, we characterized the epidemiology of and risk factors for severe illness.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or normal control plasma. The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to receive normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in the clinical scale was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, P = 0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected.CONCLUSIONIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in day 28 clinical status. However, convalescent plasma was associated with significantly improved survival.

Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections and ARDS, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. Thus, we sought to determine whether antecedent statin use is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from February 1 st through May 12 th , 2020 with study period ending on June 11 th , 2020. Antecedent statin use was assessed using medication information available in the electronic medical record. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the propensity of receiving statins, adjusting for baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and outpatient medications. The primary endpoint included in-hospital mortality within 30 days. A total of 2626 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 951 (36.2%) were antecedent statin users. Among 1296 patients (648 statin users, 648 non-statin users) identified with 1:1 propensity-score matching, demographic, baseline, and outpatient medication information were well balanced. Statin use was significantly associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in the propensity-matched cohort (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 \u00e2\u20ac\" 0.64, p<0.001). We conclude that antecedent statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with lower inpatient mortality.
