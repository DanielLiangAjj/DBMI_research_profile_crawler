This open-label, non-comparative, phase I dose-escalation trial aimed to assess its\u00a0safety and optimal dosage in 20 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Good tolerance was shown with a maximum tolerated dose of 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012 viral particles. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were influenza-like illness, pyrexia, fatigue, decreased platelet count, abdominal distension, and anemia. Cohorts 4 and 5 had approximately 50% higher levels of CD8+ T\u00a0cells in the peripheral blood after injection. The best target response occurred in 14 patients, 4 of whom had progressive disease. Multiple intratumoral injections of OBP-301 were well tolerated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The stable disease rate for the injected tumors was greater than the overall response rate, even with no obvious tumor response. OBP-301 might have a greater impact on local response as histological examination revealed that the presence of OBP-301 was consistent with the necrotic area at the injection site. Increased infiltration of CD8+ T\u00a0cells and <1% PD-L1 expression were observed in tumors after injection.

These lesions present as either corrugated thickenings of interdigitation zone and ellipsoid zone bands or in later stages as rectangular or pyramidal shaped foci that extend radially through photoreceptor cell-attributable bands. In ABCA4-related and peripherin-2/RDS-disease (PRPH2/RDS), monogenic forms of retinopathy caused by mutations in proteins expressed in photoreceptor cells, these punctate lesions colocalize with fundus flecks in en face images. In fundus albipunctatus and retinitis punctata albescens, diseases caused by mutations in genes (retinol dehydrogenase 5, RDH5; and retinaldehyde-binding protein 1, RLBP1) encoding proteins of the visual cycle, these lesions manifest as white dot-like puncta. Similar aberrations in photoreceptor cell-attributable SD-OCT reflectivity layers manifest as reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) in short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence and near-infrared fundus autofluorescence fundus images and are linked to age-related macular degeneration a complex disease. Despite differences in the etiologies of retinal diseases presenting as fundus flecks, dots and RPD, underlying degenerative processes in photoreceptor cells are signified in SD-OCT scans by the loss of structural features that would otherwise define healthy photoreceptor cells at these foci.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Adolescent", "Alcohol Oxidoreductases", "Carrier Proteins", "Correlation of Data", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Optical Imaging", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinal Drusen", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rait", "Last Name": "Parmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ruben", "Last Name": "Jauregui", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "PubDate": "2021Jun01"}, {"PMID": "34039559", "Title": "Optic nerve tortuosity and displacements during horizontal eye movements in healthy and highly myopic subjects.", "Abstract": "(1) To assess the morphology and 3-dimensional (3D) displacements of the eye globe and optic nerve (ON) in adduction/abduction using MRI.

This is a powerful and often non-intuitive approach for complex molecule synthesis.

Due to reduced absorption of 532\u2009nm and 787\u2009nm light by macular pigment, foveal sparing was more readily demonstrable by green/UWF-AF and NIR-AF imaging. Prominent in green/UWF-AF images is a central zone of relatively elevated AF that is continuous inferonasal with a demarcation line bordering lower AF nasally and higher AF temporally. This zone and border are more visible in STGD1 than in healthy eyes and more visible with green/UWF-AF. With the development of AF flecks, inferonasal retina is initially spared. Central atrophic areas were larger in NIR-AF images than in blue/SW-AF and green/UWF-AF images and the presence of a contiguous hyperAF ring varied with imaging modality. Flecks visible as hyperAF foci in blue/SW-AF images were also visible in green/UWF-AF but were often hypoAF in NIR-AF.

Hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target in the therapeutic treatment and diagnostic detection of the influenza virus. Influenza A virus encompasses several different HA subtypes with different strains, which are constantly changing. In this study, we identified a fully human H1N1 neutralizing antibody (32D6) via an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell-based technology. 32D6 specifically neutralizes the clinically isolated H1N1 strains after the 2009 pandemic but not the earlier strains. The epitope was identified through X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 complex structure, which revealed a unique loop conformation located on the top surface of HA. The major region is composed of two peptide segments (residues 172-177 and 206-213), which form an abreast loop conformation. The residue T262 between the two loops forms a conformational epitope for recognition by 32D6. Three water molecules were observed at the interface of HA and the heavy chain, and they may constitute a stabilizing element for the 32D6-HA association. In addition, each 32D6-Fab is likely capable of blocking one HA trimer.

Localized at the rims of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs), it is required for the maintenance of OS structure. Here, we describe a case with a phenotypic manifestation of a homozygous single-base pair deletion, c.712delC (p.Leu238Cysfs*78) in the ROM1 gene, resulting in early termination at exon 2. The variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a 63-yr-old Caucasian woman with late-onset pattern macular dystrophy. Notably, although the phenotype resembles those caused by pathogenic variants in ABCA4 or RDS/PRPH2, no pathogenic variants in these, or any other plausible candidate genes, were identified by WES. Clinical features include the presence of hyperautofluorescent flecks, relative sparing of the central macula, and preserved visual acuity. Reduced visual sensitivity was detected among flecked regions in the retina; however, full-field electroretinogram testing revealed no generalized cone dysfunction. The described first case of the complete loss of ROM1 protein function in the retina suggests its sufficiency for late-onset macular dystrophy.

One of these injuries is macular hole formation. We report the case of a 21-year-old woman who presented with acute floaters in her left eye after exposure to a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Her initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the left eye was 20/80. Examination demonstrated an acute vitreous hemorrhage, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) confirmed a full-thickness macular hole (FTMH). Four months after her injury, her BCVA deteriorated to 20/400, and she underwent vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, and gas injection. Three weeks following the procedure, her FTMH was closed, however, her BCVA remained 20/150. At her last office visit, 19 months after the surgery, the examination was unchanged. There are few reports of vitrectomy to close an FTMH after Nd:YAG laser exposure, and the factors that contribute to visual recovery remain unclear. The aim of this case report is to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and surgical repair, and to review the literature and surgical outcomes of cases of Nd:YAG laser-induced macular holes. Imaging with SD-OCT was essential in evaluating the visual outcome, as it was dependent on the degree of photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium injury.", "Keywords": ["Nd:YAG injury", "laser-induced macular hole", "macular hole", "vitrectomy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gregory E", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

The PDMS check valves, each having a compliant flap in contact with a stiff stopper to allow for unidirectional fluid flow with minimized leakage, are located at the inlet and outlet of the pump chamber, respectively.

The disease is triggered by endogenous and exogenous corticosteroid imbalance and psychosocial stress and is much more prevalent in men. We studied the association of genetic variation in 44 genes from stress response and corticosteroid metabolism pathways with the CSC phenotype in two independent cohorts of 400 CSC cases and 1,400 matched controls. The expression of cadherin 5 (CDH5), the major cell-cell adhesion molecule in vascular endothelium, was downregulated by corticosteroids which may increase permeability of choroidal vasculature, leading to fluid leakage under the retina. We found a significant association of four common CDH5 SNPs with CSC in male patients in both cohorts. Two common intronic variants, rs7499886:A>G and rs1073584:C>T, exhibit strongly significant associations with CSC; P = 0.00012; odds ratio (OR) = 1.5; 95%CI [1.2;1.8], and P = 0.0014; OR = 0.70; 95%CI [0.57;0.87], respectively.

Cone packing density was measured at three different retinal eccentricities (0.5\u00a0mm, 1.0\u00a0mm, and 1.5\u00a0mm from the foveal center) along four meridians. Cone density decreased from 32,200 to 11,600\u00a0cells/mm(2) with retinal eccentricity (0.5\u00a0mm to 1.5\u00a0mm from the fovea, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Its selectivity is derived from a human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter-driven active viral replication, which occurs in cancer cells with high telomerase activity but not in normal cells lacking such activity. Because the TERT activity is elevated in most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the current study aims to investigate whether Telomelysin can be used for treatment of HCC. The oncolytic effect of Telomelysin has been investigated both in vitro using cell culture and in vivo using an immunocompetent in situ orthotopic HCC model. In this model, HCC developed spontaneously in the liver of HBx transgenic mice, which is pathologically and genetically similar to human HCC. In cell culture assay, Telomelysin lyses HCC cell lines at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), ranging 0.77-6.35 (MOI [PFU/cell]). In the orthotopic HCC model, Telomelysin showed a potent oncolytic effect on HCC but spared normal liver tissue. Dose escalation analysis identified a safety dose of 1.25 \u00d7 10(8) PFU for this model. The effect of multiple injections of Telomelysin was also evaluated in this immunocompetent HCC model. We found that the virus replicates in HCC after a second intratumoral injection despite an immune response induced by the previous injection. This preclinical study shows that Telomelysin can be used for treatment of human HCC at an appropriate dosage and that its tumor-killing activity persists after multiple injections.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenoviridae", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Humans", "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Oncolytic Virotherapy", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Telomerase", "Trans-Activators", "Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei-Hsiang", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Shiou-Hwei", "Last Name": "Yeh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wan-Jen", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kun-Huei", "Last Name": "Yeh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Toshiyoshi", "Last Name": "Fujiwara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aisuke", "Last Name": "Nii", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stanley Shi-Chung", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pei-Jer", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "International journal of cancer", "PubDate": "2013Mar15"}, {"PMID": "22810148", "Title": "DFPE, partially fluorinated ether: a novel approach for experimental intravitreal tamponade.", "Abstract": "To evaluate decafluoro-di-n-pentyl ether (DFPE) as a vitreous tamponade by examining ocular tolerance in rabbits' eyes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cataract", "Drug Combinations", "Electroretinography", "Endotamponade", "Ethers", "Intravitreal Injections", "Lens, Crystalline", "Male", "Rabbits", "Retina", "Retinal Diseases", "Silicone Oils", "Vitrectomy", "Vitreous Body"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rodrigo A V", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University/Harkness Eye Institute, New York, New York, USA. oculare@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Keegan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian S", "Last Name": "Fuchs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marcos P", "Last Name": "Avila", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nigel", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
