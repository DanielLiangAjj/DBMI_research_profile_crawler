A recent multisite screening study (S1204) from the SWOG Cancer Research Network found that a substantial number of patients with newly diagnosed cancer had previously unknown viral infections. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-efficiency of universal screening of patients with newly diagnosed cancer. We estimated the cost-efficiency of universal screening of new cancer cases for HBV, HCV, or HIV, expressed as cost per virus detected, from the health care payer perspective. The prevalence of each virus among this cohort was derived from S1204. Direct medical expenditures included costs associated with laboratory screening tests. Costs per case detected were estimated for each screening strategy. Secondary analysis examined the cost-efficiency of screening patients whose viral status at cancer diagnosis was unknown. Among the possible options for universal screening, screening for HBV alone ($581), HCV alone ($782), HBV and HCV ($631) and HBV, HCV, and HIV ($841) were most efficient in terms of cost per case detected. When screening was restricted to patients with unknown viral status, screening for HBV alone ($684), HBV and HCV ($872), HBV and HIV ($1,157), and all three viruses ($1,291) were most efficient in terms of cost per newly detected case. Efficient viral testing strategies represent a relatively modest addition to the overall cost of managing a patient with cancer.

Between 2010 and 2013, 3,649 patients with breast cancer younger than 75 years without diabetes with high-risk T1-3, N0-3 M0 breast cancer (any estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) were randomly assigned to metformin 850 mg orally twice a day or placebo twice a day for 5 years. New primary invasive cancers (outside the ipsilateral breast) developing as a first event were identified. Time to events was described by the competing risks method; two-sided likelihood ratio tests adjusting for age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol intake were used to compare metformin versus placebo arms.

We enrolled patients with histologically distinct, poor-prognosis malignancies who had progressed on multiple therapies, and developed low-passage, patient-derived xenograft models that were used to validate 35 patient-specific drug predictions. Both OncoTarget, which identifies high-affinity inhibitors of individual master regulator (MR) proteins, and OncoTreat, which identifies drugs that invert the transcriptional activity of hyperconnected MR modules, produced highly significant 30-day disease control rates (68% and 91%, respectively). Moreover, of 18 OncoTreat-predicted drugs, 15 induced the predicted MR-module activity inversion in vivo. Predicted drugs significantly outperformed antineoplastic drugs selected as unpredicted controls, suggesting these methods may substantively complement existing precision cancer medicine approaches,

Here, Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D) scores are analyzed among men in a prostate cancer prevention trial to explore such differences. Selenium and vitamin E cancer prevention trial participants who completed the SF-6D at baseline, and in at least 1 of follow-up years 1, 3, and 5 were included. This study compared mean SF-6D scores across race/ethnicity at each point using a linear mixed model controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. At baseline, 9691 men were eligible for analysis, of whom 7556 (78%) were non-Hispanic White, 1592 (16.4%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 543 (5.6%) were Hispanic. Hispanic and White participants had higher unadjusted mean SF-6D scores than Black participants at every time point (P\u2009<\u20090.05), while white participants had lower mean scores than Hispanic participants at every time point after baseline (P\u2009<\u20090.05). After adjusting for covariates, statistically significant differences in HRQOL among the 3 groups persisted. Hispanic participants had higher preference scores than White participants by 0.073 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.075 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and 0.040 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in follow-up years 1, 3, and 5, respectively.

The results suggest there is a preference-weighted HRQOL difference by race/ethnicity that cannot be explained by social and clinical variables alone.

Through preclinical studies, we demonstrated that the sensitivity to the leading HDAC6 inhibitor (HDAC6i) ricolinstat can be predicted by a computational network-based algorithm (HDAC6 score). Analysis of ~3,000 human breast cancers (BCs) showed that ~30% of them could benefice from HDAC6i therapy. Thus, we designed a phase 1b dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the activity of ricolinostat plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic BC (MBC) (NCT02632071). Study results showed that the two agents can be safely combined, that clinical activity is identified in patients with HR+/HER2- disease and that the HDAC6 score has potential as predictive biomarker. Analysis of other tumor types also identified multiple cohorts with predicted sensitivity to HDAC6i's.

This report provides a detailed description of the goals and methods of the lifestyle intervention and the evidence supporting the intervention used in the BWEL trial. The intervention's primary goal for participants is to achieve and maintain a weight loss \u2265 10% of baseline weight through increased physical activity and caloric restriction. The evidence supporting the diet, physical activity, and behavioral components of this telephone-based weight-loss intervention, as well as strategies to promote participant engagement and retention, is described. The intervention is provided through 42 sessions delivered by trained health coaches over a 2-year period.

The goal was to examine metformin impact on metabolic factors in non-diabetic subjects and determine whether this impact varies by baseline BMI, insulin, and rs11212617 SNP in CCTG MA.32, a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized adjuvant breast cancer (BC) trial. 3649 subjects with T1-3, N0-3, M0 BC were randomized; pretreatment and 6-month on-treatment fasting plasma was centrally assayed for insulin, leptin, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Glucose was measured locally and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) calculated. Genomic DNA was analyzed for the rs11212617 SNP. Absolute and relative change of metabolic factors (metformin versus placebo) were compared using Wilcoxon rank and t-tests. Regression models were adjusted for baseline differences and assessed interactions with baseline BMI, insulin, and the SNP. Mean age was 52 years. The majority had T2/3, node positive, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative BC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Median baseline body mass index (BMI) was 27.4\u2009kg/m2 (metformin) and 27.3\u2009kg/m2 (placebo). Median weight change was -1.4\u2009kg (metformin) vs +0.5\u2009kg (placebo). Significant improvements were seen in all metabolic factors, with 6 month standardized ratios (metformin/placebo) of 0.85 (insulin), 0.83 (HOMA), 0.80 (leptin), and 0.84 (hsCRP), with no qualitative interactions with baseline BMI or insulin.

adults (AYAs) are at increased risk for negative opioid-related outcomes, including misuse and overdose. High-quality cancer care requires adequate pain management and often includes opioids for tumor- and/or treatment-related pain. Little is known about opioid use and misuse in children and AYAs with cancer, and we therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature using PRISMA guidelines to identify all relevant studies that evaluated opioid use and/or misuse among this population. Eleven studies were identified that met our inclusion criteria. The range of opioid use among the studies was 12-97%, and among the five studies that reported opioid misuse or aberrant behaviors, 7-90% of patients met criteria. Few studies reported factors associated with opioid misuse but included prior mental health and/or substance use disorders, and prior opioid use. In summary, opioid use is highly variable among children and AYAs with cancer; however, the range of use varies widely depending on the study population, such as survivors or end-of-life cancer patients. Few studies have examined opioid misuse and/or aberrant behaviors, and future research is needed to better understand opioid use and misuse among children and AYAs with cancer, specifically those who will be cured of their cancer and may subsequently experience adverse opioid-related outcomes.", "Keywords": ["AYAs", "Adolescent and young adults", "Opioid misuse", "Opioid prescribing"], "MeSH

To assess the effects of Akt inhibition on the tumor micro-environment (TME), we analyzed tumor tissue from patients with operable hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer (BC) treated on a presurgical trial with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206. Methods: Quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence (qmIF) was performed using CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3, CD68, and pancytokeratin on biopsy and surgical specimens of MK-2206 and untreated, control patients. nanoString was performed on surgical specimens to assess mRNA expression from MK-2206-treated vs. control patients. Results: Increased CD3+CD8+ density was observed in post vs. pre-treatment tissue in the MK-2206-treated vs. control patients (87 vs. 0.2%, p < 0.05). MK-2206 was associated with greater expression of interferon signaling genes (e.g., IFI6, p < 0.05) and lower expression of myeloid genes (CD163, p < 0.05) on differential expression and gene set enrichment analyses. Greater expression of pro-apoptotic genes (e.g., BAD) were associated with MK-2206 treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Akt inhibition in operable BC was associated with a favorable immune profile in the TME, including increased CD3+CD8+ density and greater expression of interferon genes.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of BWL versus dim red light therapy (DRL) on depressive symptoms within individual cancer survivors using personalized (N-of-1) trials. Methods: Cancer survivors with at least mild depressive symptoms were randomized to one of two treatment sequences consisting of counterbalanced crossover comparisons of three-weeks of lightbox-delivered BWL (intervention) or DRL (sham) for 30 min each morning across 12 weeks. A smartphone application guided cancer survivors through the treatment sequence and facilitated data collection. Cancer survivors tracked end-of-day depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and fatigue using visual analog scales. Within-patient effects of BWL were assessed using an autoregressive model with adjustment for linear time trends. Results: Eight of nine cancer survivors completed the 12-week protocol. Two survivors reported significantly (i.e., p < 0.05) lower depressive symptoms (-1.3 \u00b1 0.5 and -1.30 \u00b1 0.9 points on a 10-point scale), five reported no difference in depressive symptoms, and one reported higher depressive symptoms (+1.7 \u00b1 0.6 points) with BWL versus DRL. Eight of nine cancer survivors recommended personalized trials of BWL to others. Conclusions: There were heterogeneous effects of three-week BWL on self-reported depressive symptoms among cancer survivors, with some finding a benefit but others finding no benefit or even harm.

Accordingly, we queried clinicaltrials.gov to determine the extent to which patients with chronic conditions were excluded from phase III cancer trials, using National Cancer Institute-sponsored breast cancer RCTs as a test case. Two physicians independently coded for the presence of 19 prevalent chronic conditions within eligibility criteria. They also coded for exclusions based on performance status and vague criteria that could have broadly excluded patients with chronic conditions. The search identified 58 RCTs, initiated from 1993 to 2012. Overall, 88% of trials had at least one exclusion for a chronic condition, performance status, or vague criterion.

We sought to determine the frequency and predictors of MDC and assess the association between MDC and nationally-recognized quality metrics in patients with breast cancer. Methods: We used the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results-medicare dataset to evaluate patients diagnosed with stages I-III breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery between 2002 and 2011 with follow-up to 2012. We defined MDC as a visit claim from a surgeon, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist within 12\u00a0months of diagnosis. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine the association between demographic and clinical variables and MDC, and to assess the association between MDC and three nationally-recognized quality indicators (adjuvant hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive tumors, chemotherapy for hormone receptor-negative cancer, and radiation after lumpectomy). Results: Of the 61,039 patients in our initial cohort, 53,849 (88.2%) saw a medical oncologist, 46,521 (76.2%) saw a radiation oncologist, and 43,280 (70.9%) were evaluated by all three providers the first year after diagnosis. MDC use was higher in patients with the highest socioeconomic status compared with the lowest [odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% CI 1.63-1.86], in patients diagnosed in later\u00a0years, and those with stage III disease compared to stage I [OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.41]. Patients older in age (\u226580 vs. 65-69\u00a0years, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.31-0.34), patients with more comorbidities, those who lived in a rural setting compared to urban (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.57-0.64), and unmarried patients (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.76-0.82) were less likely to see all three providers. In a multivariable analysis, MDC use was associated with increased likelihood of meeting each quality metric. Conclusion: Early stage breast cancer patients were evaluated by a surgeon, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist less than 75% of the time.

We examined whether vitamin D supplementation in high-risk premenopausal women reduces mammographic density (MD), an established breast cancer risk factor. We conducted a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in premenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer [5-year risk \u2265 1.67%, lifetime risk \u2265 20%, lobular carcinoma in situ, prior stage 0-II breast cancer, hereditary breast cancer syndrome, or high MD (heterogeneously/extremely dense)], with a baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] \u2264 32 ng/mL. Participants were randomized to 12 months of vitamin D3 20,000 IU/week or matching placebo. The primary endpoint was change in MD from baseline to 12 months using the Cumulus technique. Secondary endpoints included serial blood biomarkers [25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding protein-3] and MD change at 24 months. Among 208 women randomized, median age was 44.6 years, 84% were white, 33% had baseline 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL, and 78% had high baseline MD. Comparing the active and placebo groups at 12 months, MD changes were small and did not significantly differ. Mean MD changes at 12 and 24 months were -0.3% and -1.2%, respectively, in the active arm and +1.5% and +1.6% with placebo (P > 0.05). We observed a mean change in serum 25(OH)D of +18.9 versus +2.8 ng/mL (P < 0.01) and IGF-1 of -9.8 versus -1.8 ng/mL (P = 0.28), respectively.

Although some biological targets from preclinical studies show promise in nonhuman animal models, few targets have been translated to successful clinical trials. To address this problem, the National Cancer Institute's Symptom Management and Health-Related Quality of Life Steering Committee convened a meeting of experts in the CIPN and oncology symptom management fields to participate in a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM). Investigators presented data from preclinical and translational studies for possible CIPN interventions; these were evaluated for readiness of randomized clinical trial testing by experts, and recommendations were provided. Breakout sessions were convened to discuss and develop future studies. The CTPM experts concluded that there is compelling evidence to move forward with selected pharmacological and nonpharmacological clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of CIPN. Several key feasibility issues need to be addressed, however. These include identification of optimal outcome measures to define the CIPN phenotype, establishment of parameters that guide the evaluation of clinically meaningful effects, and adoption of approaches for inclusion of translational and biomarker and/or genetic measures. The results of the CTPM provide support for conducting clinical trials that include both pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches, alone or in combination, with biomarkers, genetics, or other measures designed to inform underlying CIPN mechanisms.

Since 2011, bisphosphonate use has been recommended by NCCN for all patients with newly diagnosed MM receiving antineoplastic therapy independent of the presence of bone disease. This study investigated their use after these guidelines were established. Methods: We identified patients aged \u226565 years in the SEER-Medicare database with newly diagnosed MM between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, who received antineoplastic therapy, had \u22656 months of follow-up, and did not receive prior bisphosphonates. Presence of SREs at diagnosis was identified, including pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation to bone, or surgery to bone. Use of bisphosphonates was defined as having \u22651 claim for an intravenous or oral bisphosphonate within 6 months after the start of antineoplastic therapy. We used multivariable modeling to compare users with nonusers, controlling for demographic and clinical covariates. We compared overall survival between users and nonusers using proportional hazards analysis. Results: Of 1,309 patients identified, 720 (55%) used a bisphosphonate. Factors associated with use included SRE at diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.60; 95% CI, 1.98-3.40), hypercalcemia (AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26-2.41), and use of proteasome inhibitor + immunomodulatory imide therapy (AOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.39). Chronic kidney disease (AOR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.66) was associated with decreased use. Bisphosphonate use was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88).

Obesity is prevalent in Hispanic/Latina patients with breast cancer, and the occurrence of BWATi in this population is not well-characterized. The association between BWATi and body mass index (BMI) was evaluated in Hispanic/Latina patients with breast cancer who underwent mastectomy. BWATi was defined as the presence of crown-like structures of the breast (CLS-B), detected by CD68 IHC in nontumor breast tissue. BWATi severity was quantified as number of CLS-B/cm2 Adipocyte diameter was measured using hematoxylin and eosin-stained breast tissue sections. Preoperative BMI (within 1 week prior to mastectomy) was categorized as normal (18.5-<25.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-<30.0 kg/m2), class I obesity (30.0-<35.0 kg/m2), and class II-III obesity (35.0 kg/m2 or above). Patient charts were abstracted to record clinicopathologic features and liver function tests <90 days before mastectomy. The study included 91 women (mean age 69 years; range 36-96 years). Prevalence of BWATi increased with BMI (24% in normal weight, 34% in overweight, 57% in class I obesity, and 65% in class II-III obesity; P trend <0.01). Severe BWATi (>0.27 CLS-B/cm2) was associated with higher BMI (P trend = 0.046) and greater adipocyte diameter (P = 0.04). Adjusting for BMI, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and elevated alanine aminotransferase were associated with severe BWATi, and current smoking was associated with mild BWATi (all P < 0.05).

ASCO considered the guideline for endorsement. Methods The SIO guideline addressed the use of integrative therapies for the management of symptoms and adverse effects, such as anxiety and stress, mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Interventions of interest included mind and body practices, natural products, and lifestyle modifications. SIO systematic reviews focused on randomized controlled trials that were published from 1990 through 2015. The SIO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations in the SIO guideline-published in 2017-are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the guideline with a few added discussion points. Recommendations Key recommendations include the following: Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-l-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy because of a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related adverse effects.

Implementation of the inclusion of patient advocates has varied considerably, with inconsistent involvement of patient advocates in key phases of research such as concept development. Despite this, there is agreement that patient advocates have improved the patient focus of many cancer research studies. This commentary describes our experience designing and pilot testing a new framework for patient engagement at SWOG, one of the largest cancer clinical trial network groups in the United States and one of the four adult groups in the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Our goal is to provide a roadmap for other clinical trial groups that are interested in bringing the patient voice more directly into clinical trial conception and development. We developed a structured process to engage patient advocates more effectively in the development of cancer clinical trials and piloted the process in four SWOG research committees, including implementation of a new Patient Advocate Executive Review Form that systematically captures patient advocates' input at the concept stage. Based on the positive feedback to our approach, we are now developing training and evaluation metrics to support meaningful and consistent patient engagement across the SWOG clinical trial life cycle. Ultimately, the benefits of more patient-centered cancer trials will be measured in the usefulness, relevance, and speed of study results to patients, caregivers, and clinicians.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Community Networks", "Cooperative Behavior", "Decision Making", "Humans", "Multicenter Studies as Topic", "National Cancer Institute (U.S.)", "Neoplasms", "Patient Advocacy", "Patient Participation", "Research Design", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patricia A", "Last Name": "Deverka", "Affiliation": "American Institutes for Research, Health Group, Chapel Hill, NC."}, {"First Name": "Rick", "Last Name": "Bangs", "Affiliation": "SWOG Patient Advocate Committee, Portland, OR."}, {"First Name": "Karma", "Last Name": "Kreizenbeck", "Affiliation": "Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah M", "Last Name": "Delaney", "Affiliation": "Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Dawn L", "Last Name": "Hershman", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, NY."}, {"First Name": "Charles D", "Last Name": "Blanke", "Affiliation": "SWOG, OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR."}, {"First Name": "Scott D", "Last Name": "Ramsey", "Affiliation": "Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the National Cancer Institute", "PubDate": "2018Jun01"}, {"PMID": "29671113", "Title": "Personal and clinical social support and adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy among hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients in an integrated health care system.", "Abstract": "We evaluated associations between personal and clinical social support and non-adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) in a large, Northern California breast cancer (BC) cohort from an integrated healthcare network.", "Keywords": ["Adjuvant endocrine therapy", "Breast cancer", "Non-adherence", "Social support", "Women"], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Comorbidity", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "Disease Management", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Medication Adherence", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Public Health Surveillance", "Receptors, Estrogen", "Receptors, Progesterone", "Severity of Illness Index", "Social Support", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Candyce H", "Last Name": "Kroenke", "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 2000 Broadway, 5th floor, Oakland, CA, USA.

However, the association of cardiovascular-disease risk factors (CVD-RFs) with long-term survival and cardiac events is not well studied. Methods We examined SWOG (formerly the Southwest Oncology Group) breast cancer trials from 1999 to 2011. We identified baseline diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease by linking trial records to Medicare claims. The primary outcome was overall survival. Patients with both baseline and follow-up claims were examined for cardiac events. Cox regression was used to assess the association between CVD-RFs and outcomes. Results We identified 1,460 participants older than 66 years of age from five trials; 842 were eligible for survival outcomes analysis. At baseline, median age was 70 years, and median follow-up was 6 years. Hypertension (73%) and hypercholesterolemia (57%) were the most prevalent conditions; 87% of patients had one or more CVD-RF. There was no association between any of the individual CVD-RFs and overall survival except for hypercholesterolemia, which was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P = .01). With each additional CVD-RF, there was an increased risk of death (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.40; P = .002), worse progression-free survival (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.25; P = .05), and marginally worse cancer-free survival (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.34; P = .07). The relationship between baseline CVD-RFs and cardiac events was analyzed in 736 patients. A strong linear association between the number of CVD-RFs and cardiac event was observed (HR per CVD-RF, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.69; P < .001). Conclusion Among participants in clinical trials, each additional baseline CVD-RF was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events and death. Efforts to improve control of modifiable CVD-RFs are needed, especially among those with multiple risk factors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dawn L", "Last Name": "Hershman", "Affiliation": "Dawn L.

Materials and Methods Of 40 patients with breast cancer who participated in a longitudinal study between June 2011 and March 2016, 34 completed the study. There were 13 patients who obtained a pathologic complete response (pCR) and 21 patients who did not obtain a pCR. Imaging data from six subjects were excluded from the study because either the patients dropped out of the study before it was finished or there was an instrumentation malfunction. Two weeks into the treatment regimen, three-dimensional images of both breasts during a breath hold were acquired by using dynamic diffuse optical tomography. Features from the breath-hold traces were used to distinguish between response groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and sensitivity analysis were used to determine the degree of association with 5-month treatment outcome. Results An ROC curve analysis showed that this method could identify patients with a pCR with a positive predictive value of 70.6% (12 of 17), a negative predictive value of 94.1% (16 of 17), a sensitivity of 92.3% (12 of 13), a specificity of 76.2% (16 of 21), and an area under the ROC curve of 0.85. Conclusion Several dynamic optical imaging features obtained within 2 weeks of NAC initiation were identified that showed statistically significant differences between patients with pCR and patients without pCR as determined 5 months after treatment initiation. If confirmed in a larger cohort prospective study, these dynamic imaging features may be used to predict treatment outcome as early as 2 weeks after treatment initiation. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Breast", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tomography, Optical", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jacqueline E", "Last Name": "Gunther", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Biomedical Engineering (J.E.G., M.F., M.A., A.H.H.) and Electrical Engineering (A.H.H.), Columbia University, 500 W 120th St, Mudd Bldg, ET351, MC 8904, New York, NY 10027;

Data are limited on how knowledge about one's breast cancer and understanding treatment rationales may impact treatment completion. In this qualitative analysis, we explored barriers to care with a focus on knowledge. We conducted 18 in-depth interviews with women from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds who were treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (n\u2009=\u200912; Boston, MA) and Columbia University Medical Center (n\u2009=\u20096; New York, NY) and had undergone neo/adjuvant breast cancer treatment within the prior 3 years. Interviews focused on treatments received, adherence, barriers experienced, and questions related to breast cancer knowledge and treatment rationales. We analyzed transcribed interview recordings in N'Vivo using a two-stage coding process that allowed for both preconfigured and emergent themes. Answers for breast cancer knowledge were confirmed using medical records. In our analysis, over one-third of women reported incomplete therapy, including never initiating treatment, stopping treatment prematurely, or missing/delaying treatments due to logistical reasons (childcare, transportation) or patient preferences. Others reported treatment modifications because of provider recommendations. Nearly all women were able to accurately describe the rationale for recommended treatments. Among 17 women for whom medical records were available, women correctly reported 18-71% of their tumor characteristics; incorrect reporting was not consistently associated with treatment incompletion. In conclusion, logistical issues and patient preferences were the main reasons for incomplete therapy in our study. Understanding of treatment rationale was high, but breast cancer knowledge was variable.

We identified patients in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program who underwent oncologic neurosurgery procedures between 2008 and 2012. The mFI, ranging from 0 to 1, was calculated as the proportion of 11 possible risk factors present. We assessed the associations between mFI and 30-day mortality, neurologic and medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge in univariate and multivariable analyses and compare the index to established risk stratification techniques. A total of 9149 patients were identified. Mortality, severe medical complications, prolonged length of stay, and unfavorable discharge increased incrementally with increasing levels of frailty. Severe neurologic complications were highest in those with low frailty. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased frailty increased the odds of all adverse outcomes, including neurologic complications. The mFI increased the ability to predict all outcomes beyond available indices and was the most reliable predictor of neurologic complications. The mFI can be calculated from routinely collected medical record data and is predictive of 30-day adverse outcomes in a wide variety of neurosurgical oncology patients.

Duloxetine is US Food and Drug Administration approved for treatment of multiple chronic pain disorders. We hypothesized that treatment of AIMSS with duloxetine would improve average joint pain compared with placebo. Methods This randomized, double-blind, phase III trial included AI-treated postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer and who had average joint pain score of \u2265 4 out of 10 that developed or worsened since AI therapy initiation. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to duloxetine or placebo for 13 weeks. The primary end point was average joint pain through 12 weeks, examined using multivariable linear mixed models, adjusted for stratification factors (baseline pain score of 4 to 6 v 7 to 10 and prior taxane use). Clinically significant change in average pain was defined as a \u2265 2-point decrease from baseline. Results Of 299 enrolled patients, 127 patients treated with duloxetine and 128 who received placebo were evaluable for the primary analysis. By 12 weeks, the average joint pain score was 0.82 points lower for patients who received duloxetine compared with those who received placebo (95% CI, -1.24 to -0.40; P = .0002). Similar patterns were observed for worst joint pain, joint stiffness, pain interference, and functioning. Rates of adverse events of any grade were higher in the duloxetine-treated group (78% v 50%); rates of grade 3 adverse events were similar. Conclusion Results of treatment with duloxetine for AIMSS were superior to those of placebo among women with early-stage breast cancer, although it resulted in more frequent low-grade toxicities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Analgesics", "Aromatase Inhibitors", "Arthralgia", "Breast Neoplasms", "Double-Blind Method", "Duloxetine Hydrochloride", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Pain Measurement", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N Lynn", "Last Name": "Henry", "Affiliation": "N.

Secondary outcomes of the trial include the impact of the weight loss intervention on overall survival, body weight, physical activity, dietary intakes, incidence of comorbidities, serum biomarkers and patient reported outcomes. Participants are randomized 1:1 to a 2-year, telephone-based weight loss intervention or to an education control group. The intervention is delivered through 42 telephone calls, delivered by health coaches based at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Calls are supplemented by an intervention workbook, as well as a number of tools to help facilitate weight loss. Intervention goals include loss of 10% of baseline body weight, achieved through caloric restriction and increased physical activity.

The purpose of this trial was to determine whether bortezomib enhanced the effectiveness of fulvestrant. One hundred eighteen postmenopausal women with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) were randomized to fulvestrant alone (Arm A-500\u2009mg intramuscular (i.m.) day -14, 1, 15 in cycle 1, and day 1 of additional cycles) or in combination with bortezomib (Arm B-1.6\u2009mg/m2 intravenous (i.v.) on days 1, 8, 15 of each cycle). The study was powered to show an improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) from 5.4 to 9.0 months and compare PFS rates at 6 and 12 months (\u03b1=0.10, \u03b2=0.10). Patients with progression on fulvestrant could cross over to the combination (arm C).

proliferative effect of adjuvant tamoxifen on the endometrium can potentially result in endometrial abnormalities, including cancer in postmenopausal women. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to assess endometrial pathological diagnoses in postmenopausal women with early stage, ER-positive breast cancer without endometrial pathology at baseline. They were assigned to tamoxifen alone versus tamoxifen plus cyclical medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 10\u2009mg for 14 days every 3 months) for 5 years. Endovaginal sonograms (EVS) +/- endometrial biopsies (EMB) were required at baseline, 2 and 5 years. Of 313 patients registered, 296 were eligible and 169 (57%; 89, tamoxifen; 80, tamoxifen+MPA) were evaluable (completed year-2 EVS, with an EMB if stripe width was \u2a7e5\u2009mm). Sixty (67%) of these in the tamoxifen arm had an endometrial stripe width \u2a7e5\u2009mm (and underwent subsequent EMB) compared with 48 (60%) in the tamoxifen+MPA arm (P=0.40). There were four cases of proliferative endometrium and one simple hyperplasia on the tamoxifen arm (6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2-13%) among evaluable patients and one proliferative endometrium on the tamoxifen+MPA arm (P=0.11). The overall fraction with benign endometrial abnormalities at year 2 was 3.6% (6/169; 95% CI: 1.3-7.6%), with only 1 (of 102) new benign proliferative event at year 5. The event rate in both arms was much lower than projected, making treatment arm comparisons less informative. A normal endometrium prior to tamoxifen may provide reassurance regarding future endometrial events.

Explanations for this low uptake includelack of awareness of breast cancer risk status, insufficient knowledge about breast cancer preventive therapies among patients and physicians, and toxicity concerns. Increasing acceptance of pharmacologic breast cancer prevention will require effective communication of breast cancer risk, accurate representation about the potential benefits and side effects of anti-estrogens, targeting-specific high-risk populations most likely to benefit from preventive therapy, and minimizing the side effects of current anti-estrogens with novel administration and dosing options. One strategy to improve the uptake of chemoprevention strategies is to consider lessons learned from the use of drugs to prevent other chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease.

We evaluated the US Food and Drug Administration's boxed warning of ESAs used to treat chemotherapy-induced anemia because evidence on the effectiveness of boxed warnings remains inconclusive. Patients and Methods Using 2004 to 2009 SEER-Medicare data, we exploited a natural experiment to examine the effects of ESA boxed warnings on utilization and risk of VTE. The intervention group included Medicare fee-for-services patients diagnosed with colorectal, breast, or lung cancers targeted by this warning and undergoing chemotherapy; the control group included patients with myelodysplastic syndromes not targeted by this warning. The period from January 2004 to September 2006 was used as the prewarning period; the period from April 2007 to September 2009 was used as the postwarning period. The two binary dependent variables included ESA use and hospitalized VTE. Linear probability models with a difference-in-differences specification were used for estimation. Results Our sample consisted of 45,319 unique patients between 2004 and 2009. The trends in ESA use remained similar between the intervention and control groups before the warning, but started declining sharply in the intervention group only after the warning. The trends in hospitalized VTE were relatively stable. Regressions showed that the ESA boxed warning was associated with a 20.2-percentage-point reduction ( P < .001) in the likelihood of ESAs being used to treat cancers targeted by the warning, but not significantly associated with the likelihood of hospitalized VTE. Conclusion Our study showed that the warning was effective in reducing ESA utilization. Future studies should examine other regulatory drug safety actions, such as the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy initiative, whose effectiveness remains unknown.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Drug Labeling", "Drug Utilization", "Erythropoietin", "Female", "Hematinics", "Humans", "Male", "Medicare", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "SEER Program", "United States", "United States Food and Drug Administration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Bian", "Affiliation": "John Bian, LeAnn Norris, Richard Schulz, and Charles L.

Our objective was to examine the morbidity and mortality associated with axillary evaluation in DCIS. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 10,504 women aged 65-90 years with DCIS who underwent breast conserving surgery between 2002 and 2012 using SEER-Medicare database. Patients were categorized by receipt of axillary evaluation with either sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary node dissection (ALND). We determined the incidence of lymphedema treatment as defined by diagnostic and procedural codes, as well as 10-year breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. 18.3\u00a0% of those treated with BCS and 69.4\u00a0% of those treated with mastectomy had an axillary evaluation. One year after treatment, 8.2\u00a0% of women who had an axillary evaluation developed lymphedema, compared to 5.9\u00a0% of those who did not. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, the incidence of lymphedema was higher among those who underwent axillary evaluation (HR 1.22, 95\u00a0% CI 1.04-1.45). Overall 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was similar between both groups (HR 0.83, 95\u00a0% CI 0.40-1.74). Only 44 (0.40\u00a0%) women died of breast cancer; receipt of axillary evaluation did not alter overall survival. Axillary evaluation is commonly performed in women with DCIS, especially those undergoing mastectomy. However, women who receive an axillary evaluation have higher rates of lymphedema, without breast cancer-specific or overall survival benefit.

Women who discontinue chemotherapy early may reduce those benefits, but little is known about what predicts early discontinuation. We sought to determine prospectively the rate and reasons for early discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with breast cancer. We conducted a prospective cohort study among three U.S. health care organizations. Of 1158 women with newly diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer, 2006-2010, we analyzed 445 (38.4\u00a0%) patients who initiated standard adjuvant chemotherapy as defined by accepted guidelines. We interviewed patients at baseline and twice during treatment regarding sociodemographic/psychosocial factors and treatment decision-making and collected clinical data. They were categorized according to the number of cycles required by the chemotherapy regimen they had initiated. The outcome was early discontinuation (<80\u00a0% of planned cycles). Of patients analyzed, 392 (88.1\u00a0%) completed the prescribed therapy. The strongest predictor was receipt of a regimen entailing >4 cycles of therapy (18.1\u00a0% for longer regimens, 7.4\u00a0% for 4 cycles) (odds ratio [OR] 2.59, 95\u00a0% CI 1.32-5.08), controlling for race, age, stage, hormone receptor status, social support, optimism, spirituality, stress, and physical symptoms. Higher levels of psychological symptoms on the Memorial symptom assessment scale also increased the odds of early discontinuation (OR 1.92, 95\u00a0% CI 0.998-3.68). The large majority of patients who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer completed their prescribed regimens, but early discontinuation was associated with lengthier regimens and, with borderline statistical significance, for those with psychological side effects.", "Keywords": ["Adherence", "Adjuvant chemotherapy", "Breast cancer", "Early discontinuation", "Non-persistence",

Our goal was to determine the associations between psychosocial factors and ET non-persistence. We recruited women with BC receiving care in an integrated healthcare system between 2006 and 2010. Using a subset of patients treated with ET, we investigated factors related to ET non-persistence (discontinuation) based on pharmacy records (\u226590\u00a0days gap). Serial interviews were conducted at baseline and every 6\u00a0months. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), Medical Outcomes Survey, Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQM), Impact of Events Scale (IES), Interpersonal Processes of Care measure, and Decision-making beliefs and concerns were measured. Multivariate models assessed factors associated with non-persistence. Of the 523 women in our final cohort who initiated ET and had a subsequent evaluation, 94 (18\u00a0%) were non-persistent over a 2-year follow-up. The cohort was primarily white (74.4\u00a0%), stage 1 (60.6\u00a0%), and on an aromatase inhibitor (68.1\u00a0%).

However, a randomized trial published in 2010 demonstrated that, compared with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), vaginal brachytherapy was less toxic and as effective in reducing locoregional relapses.", "Keywords": ["endometrial cancer", "external beam radiation therapy", "observation", "radiotherapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brachytherapy", "Carcinoma, Endometrioid", "Endometrial Neoplasms", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Vagina"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY; Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY; New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.

However, effectively implementing these pharmacogenetic markers in the clinic remains a major challenge. On the other hand, recent advances in proteomic technologies incorporating mass spectrometry (MS) for biomarker discovery show great promise to provide clinically relevant protein biomarkers. In this study, we evaluated the association between protein content in serum exosomes and severity of CIPN. Women with early stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant taxane chemotherapy were assessed with the FACT-Ntx score and serum was collected before and after the taxane treatment. Based on the change in FACT-Ntx score from baseline to 12 month follow-up, we separated patients into two groups: those who had no change (Group 1, N = 9) and those who had a \u226520% worsening (Group 1, N = 8). MS-based proteomics technology was used to identify proteins present in serum exosomes to determine potential biomarkers. Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon analysis was applied and maximum FDR was controlled at 20%. From the serum exosomes derived from this cohort, we identified over 700 proteins known to be in different subcellular locations and have different functions. Statistical analysis revealed a 12-protein signature that resulted in a distinct separation between baseline serum samples of both groups (q<0.2) suggesting that the baseline samples can predict subsequent neurotoxicity. These toxicity-associated biomarkers can be further validated in larger retrospective cohorts for their utility in identifying patients at high risk for CIPN.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Breast Neoplasms", "Bridged-Ring Compounds", "Case-Control Studies", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Cohort Studies", "Exosomes", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "Prospective Studies", "Proteomics", "Risk Factors", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry", "Taxoids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily I", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Katherine D", "Last Name": "Crew", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Meghna", "Last Name": "Trivedi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Awad", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Proteomics Shared Resource, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mathew", "Last Name": "Maurer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Kalinsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Antonius", "Last Name": "Koller", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Proteomics Shared Resource, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Purvi", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Proteomics Shared Resource, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jenny", "Last Name": "Kim Kim", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Proteomics Shared Resource, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Dawn L", "Last Name": "Hershman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "26686859", "Title": "National Cancer Institute-supported chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy trials: outcomes and lessons.", "Abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most common and debilitating complications of cancer treatment. Due to a lack of effective management options for patients with CIPN, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored a series of trials aimed at both prevention and treatment. A total of 15 such studies were approved, evaluating use of various neuro-modulatory agents which have shown benefit in other neuropathic pain states. Aside from duloxetine, none of the pharmacologic methods demonstrated therapeutic benefit for patients with CIPN. Despite these disappointing results, the series of trials revealed important lessons that have informed subsequent work. Some examples of this include the use of patient-reported symptom metrics, the elimination of traditional--yet unsubstantiated--practice approaches, and the discovery of molecular genetic predictors of neuropathy. Current inquiry is being guided by the results from these large-scale trials, and as such, stands better chance of identifying durable solutions for this treatment-limiting toxicity.", "Keywords":

Recommendations highlight the need for large-scale trials evaluating the impact of energy balance interventions on cancer outcomes, as well as the concurrent conduct of studies focused on dissemination and implementation of interventions in diverse populations of cancer survivors, including answering critical questions about the degree of benefit in key subgroups of survivors. Other considerations include the importance of incorporating economic metrics into energy balance intervention trials, the need to establish intermediate biomarkers, and the importance of integrating traditional and nontraditional funding sources. Establishing lifestyle change after cancer diagnosis as a routine part of cancer care will require a multipronged effort to overcome barriers related to study development, funding, and stakeholder engagement. Given the prevalence of obesity and inactivity in cancer survivors in the United States and elsewhere, energy balance interventions hold the potential to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality in millions of patients, and it is essential that we move forward in determining their role in cancer care with the same care and precision used to test pharmacologic and other interventions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Medical Oncology", "Neoplasms", "Obesity", "Patient Education as Topic", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Prognosis", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Risk Assessment", "Severity of Illness Index", "Societies, Medical", "Survivors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jennifer A", "Last Name": "Ligibel", "Affiliation": "Jennifer A.

The study was conducted at 11 institutions across the United States. The true acupuncture protocol was developed using a consensus-based process. The true acupuncture and the sham acupuncture protocols each consisted of 12 sessions administered for 6 weeks, followed by one weekly session for 6 weeks. The true acupuncture protocol used standardized protocol points, and the standardized acupoints were tailored to a patient's joint symptoms. The similarly standardized sham acupuncture protocol utilized superficial needling of nonacupoints.

Unfortunately, such care is not uniformly delivered. Patient, provider, and system barriers contribute to delays in cancer care, lower quality of care, and poorer outcomes in vulnerable populations, including low income, underinsured, and racial/ethnic minority populations. Covering the costs of cancer care is a major concern for many cancer survivors, and as a result, a major challenge will be to provide cost-effective follow-up care by reducing overuse of unnecessary tests and procedures so that access to effective medications can be preserved. One of the recently promoted means of improving the coordination of care for breast cancer survivors has been the use of survivorship care planning, as coordination of care will be absolutely essential to deliver high-quality care. Patient navigation is another approach to help overcome healthcare system barriers and facilitate timely access to quality medical care. Understanding the challenges and opportunities in delivering high-quality cancer care is one of the most critical issues of the day.

Musculoskeletal pain and stiffness can lead to noncompliance and increased utilization of health care resources. There is a suggestion that the syndrome is the result of estrogen deprivation and may share components with autoimmune diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Several factors may increase the likelihood of developing AI arthralgia, such as prior chemotherapy, prior hormone replacement therapy, and increased weight; there are inconsistencies with regard to the data on genetic predispositions to this syndrome. While several studies have been done to evaluate interventions to treat or prevent AI arthralgia, no clear treatment has emerged as being particularly beneficial. Much of the research has been limited by small sample size, difficulty blinding patients to placebo, inconsistent definitions of the syndrome, multiple patient reported outcomes, lack of objective outcome measures and heterogeneous patient populations.

This therapy-induced side effect is one of the most troublesome in oncology clinical practices, considering the morbidity, the frequency, and the potential irreversibility of this problem. Patients with breast cancer are particularly impacted by this side effect as multiple agents commonly used for this disease can cause neuropathy. In this chapter, we provide an overview of CIPN, including: clinical predictors, frequency, and its impact on quality of life. Further, we highlight the pathophysiology and review the literature to date for agents designed to prevent or treat CIPN. We also highlight the most important ongoing clinical and translational research questions that hope to help better predict and prevent this toxicity.

We assessed use of anti-estrogens for breast cancer prevention, among high-risk women seen at an academic breast center, to observe how uptake rates compare in this setting. We collected data on demographics, breast cancer risk factors, and health behaviors via self-administered questionnaires and medical chart abstraction. Women eligible for chemoprevention with anti-estrogens had a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk according to the Gail model of \u22651.67%, history of lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ (LCIS/DCIS), and/or BRCA mutation. We dichotomized anti-estrogen use as ever or never. Predictors of use were evaluated using multivariable log-binomial regression. Of 412 high-risk women enrolled, 316 (77%) were eligible for chemoprevention. Among eligible women, 55% were non-Hispanic white, 29% Hispanic, 8% non-Hispanic black, and 7% Asian. Women were grouped based upon their highest category of breast cancer risk (in descending order): BRCA mutation carriers (3%), DCIS (40%), LCIS (22%), and 5-year Gail risk \u22651.67% (36%). Among those eligible for chemoprevention, 162 (51%) had ever initiated anti-estrogen therapy (71% tamoxifen, 23% raloxifene, 5% aromatase inhibitor). Anti-estrogen use was highest among women with DCIS (73%). In multivariable analysis, women with a 5-year Gail risk \u22651.67% had approximately a 20% lower likelihood of anti-estrogen use compared to women with DCIS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). In the primary prevention setting, excluding women diagnosed with DCIS, anti-estrogen use was 37%. Multivariable analysis showed differences in uptake by education and potentially by race/ethnicity. Among high-risk women seen at a breast center, anti-estrogen use for chemoprevention was relatively high as compared to the published literature.
