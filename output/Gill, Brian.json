[{"PMID": "38293120", "Title": "Glioma-Induced Alterations in Excitatory Neurons are Reversed by mTOR Inhibition.", "Abstract": "Gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumors characterized by poor prognosis and composed of diffusely infiltrating tumor cells that intermingle with non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, including neurons. Neurons are increasingly appreciated as important reactive components of the glioma microenvironment, due to their role in causing hallmark glioma symptoms, such as cognitive deficits and seizures, as well as their potential ability to drive glioma progression. Separately, mTOR signaling has been shown to have pleiotropic effects in the brain tumor microenvironment, including regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability. However, the local cellular-level effects of mTOR inhibition on glioma-induced neuronal alterations are not well understood. Here we employed neuron-specific profiling of ribosome-bound mRNA via 'RiboTag,' morphometric analysis of dendritic spines, and in vivo calcium imaging, along with pharmacological mTOR inhibition to investigate the impact of glioma burden and mTOR inhibition on these neuronal alterations. The RiboTag analysis of tumor-associated excitatory neurons showed a downregulation of transcripts encoding excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins and dendritic spine development, and an upregulation of transcripts encoding cytoskeletal proteins involved in dendritic spine turnover. Light and electron microscopy of tumor-associated excitatory neurons demonstrated marked decreases in dendritic spine density. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging in tumor-associated excitatory neurons revealed progressive alterations in neuronal activity, both at the population and single-neuron level, throughout tumor growth. This in vivo calcium imaging also revealed altered stimulus-evoked somatic calcium events, with changes in event rate, size, and temporal alignment to stimulus, which was most pronounced in neurons with high-tumor burden. A single acute dose of AZD8055, a combined mTORC1/2 inhibitor, reversed the glioma-induced alterations on the excitatory neurons, including the alterations in ribosome-bound transcripts, dendritic spine density, and stimulus evoked responses seen by calcium imaging. These results point to mTOR-driven pathological plasticity in neurons at the infiltrative margin of glioma - manifested by alterations in ribosome-bound mRNA, dendritic spine density, and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity. Collectively, our work identifies the pathological changes that tumor-associated excitatory neurons experience as both hyperlocal and reversible under the influence of mTOR inhibition, providing a foundation for developing therapies targeting neuronal signaling in glioma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander R", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation":

Despite inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes and hyperactive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, the mechanisms underlying TSC-associated neurological symptoms remain incompletely understood. Here we generate a Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model in which Tsc1 inactivation in late embryonic radial glia causes social and cognitive impairment and spontaneous seizures. Tsc1 depletion occurs in a subset of layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons, leading to development of cytomegalic pyramidal neurons (CPNs) that mimic dysplastic neurons in human TSC, featuring abnormal dendritic and axonal overgrowth, enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and increased susceptibility to seizure-like activities. We provide evidence that enhanced synaptic excitation in CPNs contributes to cortical hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis. In contrast, astrocytic regulation of synapse formation and synaptic transmission remains unchanged after late embryonic radial glial Tsc1 inactivation, and astrogliosis evolves secondary to seizures.", "Keywords": ["CP: Neuroscience", "astrogliosis", "cortical hyperexcitability", "cytomegalic dysplastic neurons", "epileptogenesis", "tuberous sclerosis complex"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Pyramidal Cells", "Seizures", "Tuberous Sclerosis", "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 Protein", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wudu", "Last Name": "Lado", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jia Jie", "Last Name": "Teoh", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ahrom", "Last Name": "Ham", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian J A", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine A", "Last Name": "Schevon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wayne N", "Last Name": "Frankel", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Taub Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guomei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Herein, we combined methods for single unit analysis of microelectrode array recordings with wide-field optical mapping of Thy1-GCaMP pyramidal cells in an ex vivo acute slice model of diffusely infiltrating glioma. This enabled simultaneous tracking of individual neurons from both excitatory and inhibitory populations throughout seizure-like events. Moreover, our approach allowed for observation of how the crosstalk between these neurons varied spatially, as we recorded across an extended region of glioma-infiltrated cortex. In tumour-bearing slices, we observed marked alterations in single units classified as putative fast-spiking interneurons, including reduced firing, activity concentrated within excitatory bursts and deficits in local inhibition. These results were correlated with increases in overall excitability. Mechanistic perturbation of this system with the mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 revealed increased firing of putative fast-spiking interneurons and restoration of local inhibition, with concomitant decreases in overall excitability.

Though sodium fluorescein does not selectively accumulate in glioma cells, it allows for real-time identification of regions of blood brain barrier breakdown, corresponding to the contrast-enhancing cores of high-grade gliomas. In addition to its high predictive value for identifying pathologic tissue, use of fluorescein has been shown to improve rates of GTR. In stereotactic needle biopsies, it helps reduce procedure time by rapidly confirming the presence of diagnostic tissue. Furthermore, in non-enhancing, low-grade gliomas, it labels focal regions of vascular dysregulation that have been correlated with high-grade features.

The mixture of neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells that remain after surgery form the biological context for adjuvant therapeutic intervention and recurrence. We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and histological analysis on radiographically guided biopsies taken from different regions of GBM and showed that the tissue contained within the contrast-enhancing (CE) core of tumors have different cellular and molecular compositions compared with tissue from the nonenhancing (NE) margins of tumors. Comparisons with the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that the samples from CE regions resembled the proneural, classical, or mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, whereas the samples from the NE regions predominantly resembled the neural subtype. Computational deconvolution of the RNA-seq data revealed that contributions from nonneoplastic brain cells significantly influence the expression pattern in the NE samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that the cell type-specific expression patterns were functionally distinct and highly enriched in genes associated with the corresponding cell phenotypes. Comparing the RNA-seq data from the GBM samples to that of nonneoplastic brain revealed that the differentially expressed genes are distributed across multiple cell types. Notably, the patterns of cell type-specific alterations varied between the different GBM subtypes: the NE regions of proneural tumors were enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor genes, whereas the NE regions of mesenchymal GBM were enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes. These subtype-specific patterns provide new insights into molecular and cellular composition of the infiltrative margins of GBM.", "Keywords": ["glioma", "microenvironment", "tumor heterogeneity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Neoplasms", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "RNA, Neoplasm", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Transcriptome", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Pisapia", "Affiliation": "Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Hani R", "Last Name": "Malone", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Sonabend", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Samanamud", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer S", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Matei", "Last Name": "Banu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Athanassios", "Last Name": "Dovas", "Affiliation": "Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Sameer A", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Sisti", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurological Surgery, pc561@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Systems Biology, and Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032 pc561@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "Pathology and Cell Biology, pc561@columbia.edu jnb2@columbia.edu pas2182@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2014Aug26"}, {"PMID": "24628868", "Title": "Superficial temporal artery pseudoaneurysm following trigeminal nerve stimulator placement.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Electrode", "peripheral nerve stimulator", "pseudoaneurysm", "superficial temporal artery", "trigeminal neuropathy"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Aneurysm, False", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Humans", "Male", "Temporal Arteries", "Trigeminal Nerve"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Ellis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pisapia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Winfree", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society", "PubDate": "2014Dec"}, {"PMID": "23504257", "Title": "Murine cell line model of proneural glioma for evaluation of anti-tumor therapies.", "Abstract": "Molecular subtypes of glioblastoma (GBM) with distinct alterations have been identified. There is need for reproducible, versatile preclinical models that resemble specific GBM phenotypes to facilitate preclinical testing of novel therapies. We present a cell line-based murine proneural GBM model and characterize its response to radiation therapy. Proneural gliomas were generated by injecting PDGF-IRES-Cre retrovirus into the subcortical white matter of adult mice that harbor floxed tumor suppressors (Pten and p53) and stop-floxed reporters. Primary cell cultures were generated from the retrovirus induced tumors and maintained in vitro for multiple passages. RNA sequencing-based expression profiling of the resulting cell lines was performed. The tumorigenic potential of the cells was assessed by intracranial injection into adult na\u00efve mice from different strains. Tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). BLI for tumor cells and brain slices were obtained and compared to in vivo BLI. Response to whole-brain radiation was assessed in glioma-bearing animals. Intracranial injection of Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) glioma cells led to formation of GBM-like tumors with 100 % efficiency (n = 48) and tumorigenesis was retained for more than 3 generations. The cell lines specifically resembled proneural GBM based on expression profiling by RNA-Seq. Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) cell number correlated with BLI signal. Serial BLI measured tumor growth and correlated with size and location by ex vivo imaging. Moreover, BLI predicted tumor-related mortality with a 93 % risk of death within 5 days following a BLI signal between 1 \u00d7 10(8) and 5 \u00d7 10(8) photons/s cm(2). BLI signal had transient but significant response following radiotherapy, which corresponded to a modest survival benefit for radiated mice (p < 0.05). Intracranial injection of Pdgf(+)Pten(-/-)p53(-/-)luciferase(+) cells constitutes a novel and highly reproducible model, recapitulating key features of human proneural GBM, and can be used to evaluate tumor-growth and response to therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor", "Glioma", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Sonabend", "Affiliation": "Gabriele Bartoli Brain Tumor Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center, 1130 St. Nicholas Ave Rm. 1001, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Lei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Leung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Soderquist", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Celina", "Last Name": "Crisman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Carminucci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Sisti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mike", "Last Name": "Castelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey N", "Last Name": "Bruce", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Canoll", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neuro-oncology", "PubDate": "2013May"}]
