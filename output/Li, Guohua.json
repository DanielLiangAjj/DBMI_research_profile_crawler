These studies, however, are limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up duration. This study aims to develop an interaction-based classification method building on a statistic named Influence Score (i.e., I-score) for prediction of MCI and dementia using naturalistic driving data collected from the Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) project. Naturalistic driving trajectories were collected through in-vehicle recording devices for up to 44 months from 2977 participants who were cognitively intact at the time of enrollment. These data were further processed and aggregated to generate 31 time-series driving variables. Because of high dimensional time-series features for driving variables, we used I-score for variable selection. I-score is a measure to evaluate variables' ability to predict and is proven to be effective in differentiating between noisy and predictive variables in big data. It is introduced here to select influential variable modules or groups that account for compound interactions among explanatory variables. It is explainable regarding to what extent variables and their interactions contribute to the predictiveness of a classifier. In addition, I-score boosts the performance of classifiers over imbalanced datasets due to its association with the F1 score. Using predictive variables selected by I-score, interaction-based residual blocks are constructed over top I-score modules to generate predictors and ensemble learning aggregates these predictors to boost the prediction of the overall classifier. Experiments using naturalistic driving data show that our proposed classification method achieves the best accuracy (96%) for predicting MCI and dementia, followed by random forest (93%) and logistic regression (88%). In terms of F1 score and AUC, our proposed classifier achieves 98% and 87%, respectively, followed by random forest (with an F1 score of 96% and an AUC of 79%) and logistic regression (with an F1 score of 92% and an AUC of 77%). The results indicate that incorporating I-score into machine learning algorithms could considerably improve the model performance for predicting MCI and dementia in older drivers. We also performed the feature importance analysis and found that the right to left turn ratio and the number of hard braking events are the most important driving variables to predict MCI and dementia.", "Keywords": ["I-score", "Interaction-Based Residual Blocks", "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia", "Naturalistic Driving Data"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Algorithms", "Random Forest", "Machine Learning"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Di", "Affiliation": "Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Columbia University, USA; Data Science Institute, Columbia University, USA.

This work assessed the relationship between geography (i.e., urban vs. non-urban residence) and social isolation in a cohort of older drivers. Methods: The AAA LongROAD cohort with 2,989 older adult drivers from across the country were included. Social isolation was measured at baseline and at two subsequent annual follow-ups using PROMIS v2.0 Social Isolation 4a. The effect of geographic location with social isolation was assessed through with multivariable regression using a generalized estimating equation model. Results: The rate of social isolation in urban areas was 21% lower (adjusted RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.46, 1.36) compared to non-urban areas after adjusting for covariates, though not significant. Discussion: Social isolation is a predictor of poor health outcomes and geographic considerations have been lacking in the literature. The panel data in this analysis provides more evidence for causality though the under-representation of non-urban areas potentially reduces the power for the results.

Evidence about the effectiveness of PDMPs in reducing prescription opioid-related adverse outcomes is mixed. We conducted a systematic review to examine whether PDMP implementation within the United States is associated with changes in 4 prescription opioid-related outcome domains: opioid prescribing behaviors, opioid diversion and supply, opioid-related morbidity and substance-use disorders, and opioid-related deaths. We searched for eligible publications in Embase, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. A total of 29 studies, published between 2009 and 2019, met the inclusion criteria. Of the 16 studies examining PDMPs and prescribing behaviors, 11 found that implementing PDMPs reduced prescribing behaviors. All 3 studies on opioid diversion and supply reported reductions in the examined outcomes. In the opioid-related morbidity and substance-use disorders domain, 7 of 8 studies found associations with prescription opioid-related outcomes. Four of 8 studies in the opioid-related deaths domain reported reduced mortality rates. Despite the mixed findings, emerging evidence supports that the implementation of state PDMPs reduces opioid prescriptions, opioid diversion and supply, and opioid-related morbidity and substance-use disorder outcomes. When PDMP characteristics were examined, mandatory access provisions were associated with reductions in prescribing behaviors, diversion outcomes, hospital admissions, substance-use disorders, and mortality rates.

Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to evaluate the association between baseline frailty status and low-mileage driving.

While physical activity affects several chronic conditions thought to be associated with motor vehicle crashes (MVCs), it is unclear if increased physical activity leads to fewer MVCs. This study explores whether self-reported vigorous and moderate physical activity is associated with MVCs in the previous year. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from the LongROAD study, a large multisite prospective cohort study of 2990 older adult drivers, we examined variables related to physical activity and performed a multivariate regression analysis to examine the association of physical activity health behaviors with self-reported MVCs. Results: Overall, 41.2% of participants reported vigorous and 69.6% of participants reported moderate exercise at least once per week. Eleven percent of participants reported at least 1 MVC in the previous year. Neither vigorous nor moderate physical activity was significantly associated with self-reported MVCs in the previous year. Select variables that were significantly associated with self-reported MVC included self-reported unsafe driving practices (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.29), and fall in the past 12 months (OR 1.46, CI 1.14-1.85). Conclusions: We were unable to detect a significant association between self-reported physical activity and MVCs in the past year among this group of older drivers.

Methods This was a retrospective observational study of the 2003-2014 New York State Inpatient Database. PH was categorized as primary or secondary and pregnancy as loss or termination of pregnancy, preterm birth, or term birth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of maternal morbidity was used, including 17 diagnoses and 5 procedures. Changes were assessed using Cochran-Armitage trend tests. Results Of 2,940,868 pregnancy-related discharges, 746 indicated a diagnosis of PH (25/100,000; 95% CI 24-27). PH was secondary in 677/746 (91%) discharges and 488/746 were term births (65%). Prevalence of secondary PH increased from 17 to 30/100,000 between 2003- 2004 and 2013-2014 (+\u200969%; P\u2009<\u20090.001), with an increase in the prevalence of heart valve disease, obesity, and systemic hypertension. Primary PH decreased 81% (P\u2009=\u20090.002). Term-birth PH discharges increased from 13 to 22/100,000 between 2003-2004 and 2013-2014 (+\u200966%; P\u2009=\u20090.003), without change in preterm births and loss or termination of pregnancies. No change in morbidity in PH discharges was observed between 2003-2004 and 2013-2014, contrasting with a 64% increase in discharges without PH.

A better characterization of risk factors for SMM may identify targets for improving maternal outcomes. This study aims to characterize patient-, hospital-, and neighborhood-level factors associated with SMM during childbirth. Methods SMM during childbirth was identified in the 2013-2014 State Inpatients Database for New York. Hospital and neighborhood characteristics were abstracted from the American Hospital Association and the Area Health Resources files. Multilevel modeling was used to identify factors associated with SMM, with and without blood transfusion, and its between-hospital variation. Results 403,116 delivery-related discharges from 139 hospitals were analyzed; 1557 (0.39%) recorded SMM without blood transfusion. In the final multilevel model, 7 patient-level factors were associated with a greater than fourfold increase in the risk of SMM: pulmonary hypertension, postpartum hemorrhage, placenta accreta, chronic kidney disease, cardiac conduction disorders, emergent cesarean delivery, and preeclampsia. Three hospital-level factors were associated with SMM: proportion of non-White patients, proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries, and coding intensity. No neighborhood-level factors were predictive of SMM. The proportion of variation in SMM explained by the model was 23.5 with 23.2% related to patient-level factors. The model explained 55% of the between-hospital variation, primarily related to patient-level factors. Similar results were observed for SMM with blood transfusion. Conclusions This study confirms the association between patient-level factors and SMM. It identifies patient-level factors as the major driver of between-hospital variation in SMM.

The study utilized baseline questionnaire data from 2990 participants from the Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers (LongROAD) study. Fifteen in-vehicle technologies and 12 aftermarket vehicle adaptations were investigated. Overall, 57.2% of participants had at least one advanced technology in their primary vehicle. The number of technologies in a vehicle was significantly related to being male, having a higher income, and having a higher education level. The majority of respondents learned to use these technologies on their own, with \"figured-it-out-myself\" being reported by 25%-75% of respondents across the technologies.

However, it is not clear whether they have really produced a three-dimensional impervious seal that is important for reducing diseases associated with root canal treatment. A review of the literature was performed to identify models that have been employed for evaluating the seal of the root canal system. In vitro and in vivo models are not totally adept at quantifying the seal of root canals obturated with classic materials. Thus, one has to resort to clinical outcomes to examine whether there are real benefits associated with the use of recently introduced materials for obturating root canals. However, there is no simple answer because endodontic treatment outcomes are influenced by a host of other predictors that are more likely to take precedence over the influence of obturation materials. From the perspective of clinical performance, classic root filling materials have stood the test of time. Because many of the recently introduced materials are so new, there is not enough evidence yet to support their ability to improve clinical performance. This emphasizes the need to translate anecdotal information into clinically relevant research data on new biomaterials.", "Keywords": ["Leakage models", "Root canal", "Root filling materials", "Sealability", "Treatment outcome"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Dental Pulp Cavity", "Humans", "Materials Testing", "Root Canal Filling Materials", "Root Canal Obturation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guo-Hua", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, Fuzhou Dongfang Hospital, Fuzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Li-Na", "Last Name": "Niu", "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Olsen", "Affiliation": "North Shore Endodontics, North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Gustavo", "Last Name": "De-Deus", "Affiliation": "UNIGRANRIO, School of Dentistry, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Ashraf A", "Last Name": "Eid", "Affiliation": "Department of Dental and Biomedical Material Sciences, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Ji-Hua", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Prosthodontics, School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Pashley", "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Biology, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Franklin R", "Last Name": "Tay", "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA."}], "Journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "PubDate": "2014Mar"}, {"PMID": "24076302", "Title": "Drug use and fatal motor vehicle crashes: a case-control study.", "Abstract": "Drugged driving is a serious safety concern, but its role in motor vehicle crashes has not been adequately studied. Using a case-control design, the authors assessed the association between drug use and fatal crash risk. Cases (n=737) were drivers who were involved in fatal motor vehicle crashes in the continental United States during specific time periods in 2007, and controls (n=7719) were participants of the 2007 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers. Overall, 31.9% of the cases and 13.7% of the controls tested positive for at least one non-alcohol drug. The estimated odds ratios of fatal crash involvement associated with specific drug categories were 1.83 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39, 2.39] for marijuana, 3.03 (95% CI: 2.00, 4.48) for narcotics, 3.57 (95% CI: 2.63, 4.76) for stimulants, and 4.83 (95% CI: 3.18, 7.21) for depressants. Drivers who tested positive for both alcohol and drugs were at substantially heightened risk relative to those using neither alcohol nor drugs (Odds Ratio=23.24; 95% CI: 17.79, 30.28).
