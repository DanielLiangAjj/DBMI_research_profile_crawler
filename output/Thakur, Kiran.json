This study analyzes the chemokine signals and attracted immune cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during PML to define immune cell subpopulations relevant for the PML immune response. In addition to chemokines that indicate a general state of inflammation, like CCL5 and CXCL10, the CSF of PML patients specifically contains CCL2 and CCL4. Single-cell transcriptomics of CSF cells suggests an enrichment of distinct CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cells expressing chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3, in addition to ITGA4 and the genetic PML risk genes STXBP2 and LY9. This suggests that specific immune cell subpopulations migrate into the central nervous system to mitigate PML, and their absence might coincide with PML development. Monitoring them might hold clues for PML risk, and boosting their recruitment or function before therapeutic immune reconstitution might improve its risk-benefit ratio.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "central nervous system", "cerebrospinal fluid", "chemokines", "immune cell migration", "multiple sclerosis", "natalizumab", "progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy", "single-cell RNA sequencing", "viral encephalitis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Deffner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tilman", "Last Name": "Schneider-Hohendorf", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Schulte-Mecklenbeck", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Falk", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "I-Na", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Ostkamp", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Louisa", "Last Name": "M\u00fcller-Miny", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Eva Maria", "Last Name": "Schumann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Goelz", "Affiliation": "Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA; Biogen, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Cahir-McFarland", "Affiliation": "Biogen, Cambridge, MA, USA; Abata Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kiran T", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luisa", "Last Name": "Klotz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gerd", "Last Name": "Meyer Zu H\u00f6rste", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Catharina C", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Heinz", "Last Name": "Wiendl", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Oliver M", "Last Name": "Grauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany.

The development of neuroscience research aimed at defining the burden of neurological diseases across the lifespan, as well as optimizing diagnosis and treatment strategies, is fundamental to improving neurological health in resource-limited settings. One of the key factors to advancing neuroscience research in LMICs is the establishment of effective collaborations based on responsible and trustworthy partnerships between local scientists in LMICs and international collaborators. LMIC researchers face many logistical, institutional, and individual level challenges as they embark on their neuroscience research journey. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for improving LMIC investigator-led research that should focus on human and institutional infrastructure development. With regard to human capacity building, potential areas for offering support include enhancing research methodology training, offering instruction in manuscript and grant-writing, institutionalizing mentorship programs, and providing opportunities to conduct funded, mentored research to disseminate in high-impact journals. The foundational elements required for implementing and optimizing neuroscience research within an institution include an institutional review board, mentorship programs, data management, research administration, and laboratory facilities. This institutional capacity varies significantly across and within countries, and many rely on collaborations with better-resourced institutions to initiate research. Successful equitable collaborations ensure the engagement of all local and international stakeholders, as well as implementation of a self-sustaining long-term program. Building research capacity in LMICs is an essential endeavor that requires ongoing commitment to training independent scientists. As research capacity increases, LMIC institutions and governments should consider developing competitive research grant programs to support innovative studies led by local researchers, foster regional collaborations, and hence create a sustainable and independent neuroscience research environment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Resource-Limited Settings", "Developing Countries", "Capacity Building"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melody T", "Last Name": "Asukile", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia."}, {"First Name": "Joseph R", "Last Name": "Zunt", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, Global Health, Medicine (Infectious Diseases) and Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Kiran T", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York."}], "Journal": "Seminars in neurology", "PubDate": "2024Apr"}, {"PMID": "38441114", "Title": "Autoimmune and inflammatory neurological disorders in the intensive care unit.", "Abstract": "The present review summarizes the diagnostic approach to autoimmune encephalitis (AE) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and provides practical guidance on therapeutic management.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Encephalitis", "Seizures", "Intensive Care Units", "Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System", "Hashimoto Disease"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Camille", "Last Name": "Legouy", "Affiliation": "GHU Paris Psychiatrie & Neurosciences, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Cervantes", "Affiliation": "Divisions of Neurocritical Care and Neuroinfectious Disease, Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Romain", "Last Name": "Sonneville", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, IAME, INSERM UMR1137."}, {"First Name": "Kiran T", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Current opinion in critical care", "PubDate": "2024Apr01"}, {"PMID": "38323691", "Title": "Accuracy of automated analyzers for the estimation of CSF cell counts: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "This systematic review evaluates the evidence for accuracy of automated analyzers that estimate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell counts (WBC) compared to manual microscopy.

Three phase 3 trials initially conducted for BNT162b2, MRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S were included in the analysis.The amount and quality of evidence for possible neurological adverse events in the context of FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccinations is overall low tier. The current body of evidence continues to suggest that COVID-19 vaccinations have a high neurological safety profile; however, the risks and benefits of vaccination must continue to be closely monitored.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273", "Ad26COVS1", "BNT162 Vaccine", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "Retrospective Studies", "SARS-CoV-2", "Vaccination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Abhilasha P", "Last Name": "Boruah", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP), New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kimia", "Last Name": "Heydari", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP), New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anne E", "Last Name": "Wapniarski", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP), New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Marissa", "Last Name": "Caldwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP), New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kiran T", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP), New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Seminars in neurology", "PubDate": "2023Apr"}, {"PMID": "37093609", "Title": "Characteristics of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Associated With Sarcoidosis Without Therapeutic Immune Suppression.", "Abstract": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can occur in the context of systemic sarcoidosis (S-PML) in the absence of therapeutic immune suppression and can initially be mistaken for neurosarcoidosis or other complications of sarcoidosis.

The isolated virus from stool sampling was found to be a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type\u00a02, derived from the oral polio vaccine. Since the discovery of this case, local wastewater surveillance has revealed evidence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type\u00a02 in local counties, as well as in New York City, representing community transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, routine vaccination administration has declined globally, with increasing numbers of communities not vaccinated for poliovirus. Now, with evidence of local community transmission, the clinical implication for at-risk unvaccinated individuals is significant. Here, we review the epidemiological origin of this discovered strain of poliovirus, national and international methods of surveillance for poliovirus, and neurological features of poliovirus. We also highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in monitoring suspected cases, as well as the unique role neurologists might play in national and global poliomyelitis surveillance.

While encephalopathy may present clinically as delirium, subsyndromal delirium, or coma and may be a result of systemic causes such as hypoxia, COVID-19 has also been associated with more prolonged encephalopathy due to less common but nevertheless severe complications, such as inflammation of the brain parenchyma (with or without cerebrovascular involvement), demyelination, or seizures, which may be disproportionate to COVID-19 severity and require specific management. Given the large number of patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, even these relatively unlikely complications are increasingly recognized and are particularly important because they require specific management. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide pragmatic guidance on the management of COVID-19 encephalopathy through consensus agreement of the Global COVID-19 Neuro Research Coalition. A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, medRxiv, and bioRxiv was conducted between January 1, 2020, and June 21, 2021, with additional review of references cited within the identified bibliographies. A modified Delphi approach was then undertaken to develop recommendations, along with a parallel approach to score the strength of both the recommendations and the supporting evidence. This review presents analysis of contemporaneous evidence for the definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of COVID-19 encephalopathy and practical guidance for clinical assessment, investigation, and both acute and long-term management.", "Keywords": ["Neurology", "Neuropathology, COVID-19, Encephalopathy"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adult", "COVID-19", "Consensus", "Brain Diseases", "Prognosis", "Delirium", "COVID-19 Testing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Benedict D", "Last Name": "Michael", "Affiliation": "National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Protection Unit for Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Liverpool, United Kingdom (Michael, Tamborska, Wood, Solomon);

Multiple intersecting factors, including environmental changes, host immunological factors, and pathogen dynamics, are intimately connected to the emergence and re-emergence of communicable diseases. There is a large and expanding list of communicable diseases that can cause neurological damage, either through direct or indirect routes. Novel pathogens of neurotropic potential have been identified through advanced diagnostic techniques, including metagenomic next-generation sequencing, but there are also known pathogens which have expanded their geographic distribution to infect non-immune individuals. Factors including population growth, climate change, the increase in animal and human interface, and an increase in international travel and trade are contributing to the expansion of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Challenges exist around antimicrobial misuse giving rise to antimicrobial-resistant infectious neurotropic organisms and increased susceptibility to infection related to the expanded use of immunomodulatory treatments. In this article, we will review key concepts around emerging and re-emerging pathogens and discuss factors associated with neurotropism and neuroinvasion. We highlight several neurotropic pathogens of interest, including West Nile virus (WNV), Zika Virus, Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), and Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV). We emphasize neuroinfectious diseases which impact the central nervous system (CNS) and focus on flaviviruses, a group of vector-borne pathogens that have expanded globally in recent years and have proven capable of widespread outbreak.", "Keywords": ["CNS", "flavivirus", "neuroinfectious disease", "neurotropism", "neurovirulence"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marissa", "Last Name": "Caldwell", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abhilasha P", "Last Name": "Boruah", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP), New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kiran T", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care and Hospitalist Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP), 177 Fort Washington Avenue, Milstein Hospital, 8GS-300, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Therapeutic advances in infectious disease", "PubDate": "2022Jan-Dec"}, {"PMID": "35713518", "Title": "Determining an infectious or autoimmune etiology in encephalitis.", "Abstract": "Early presentation and workup for acute infectious (IE) and autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are similar.

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

This retrospective case series assessed the incidence of and risks for electrographic seizures in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent continuous video electroencephalography monitoring (cvEEG) between March 1st, 2020 and June 30th, 2020. One hundred and twenty-two patients were initially identified who resulted SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab positivity with any electroencephalography order placed in the EMR. Seventy-nine patients met study inclusion criteria: age \u226518 years, >1 h of cvEEG monitoring, and positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Six (8%) of the 79 patients suffered electrographic seizures (ES), three of whom suffered non-convulsive status epilepticus. Acute hyperkinetic movements were the most common reason for cvEEG in patients with ES (84%). None of the patients undergoing cvEEG for persistent coma (29% of all patients) had ES. Focal slowing (67 vs. 10%), sporadic interictal epileptiform discharges (EDs; 33 vs. 6%), and periodic/rhythmic EDs (67 vs. 1%) were proportionally more frequent among patients with electrographic seizures than those without these seizures. While 15% of patients without ES had generalized periodic discharges (GPDs) with triphasic morphology on EEG, none of the patients with ES had this pattern. Further study is required to assess the predictive values of these risk factors on electrographic seizure incidence and subsequent outcomes.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "EEG", "coronavirus", "seizure", "status epilepticus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brandon L", "Last Name": "Waters", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Neurological Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Michalak", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Neurological Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Brigham", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Neurological Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kiran T", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Neurological Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Amelia", "Last Name": "Boehme", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Epidemiology, Sergievsky Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Neurological Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Neurological Institute, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33423010", "Title": "Evaluation of a screening tool for the identification of neurological disorders in rural Uganda.", "Abstract": "Neurological disorders are common in sub-Saharan African, but accurate neuroepidemiologic data are lacking from the region.

The clinical presentation of flaccid and often profound muscle weakness (which can invoke respiratory failure and other critical complications) can mimic several other acute neurological illnesses. There is no single sensitive and specific test for AFM, and the diagnosis relies on identification of several important clinical, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid characteristics.

We also investigated whether specific electrographic features are associated with persistent seizures or status epilepticus after acute presentation. In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed records of children and adults with anti-NMDARE between 2010 and 2014 who were included in the Rare Epilepsy of New York City database, which included the text of physician notes from five academic medical centers. Clinical history (e.g., seizure semiology) and EEG features (e.g., background organization, slowing, epileptiform activity, seizures, sleep architecture, extreme delta brush) were abstracted. We compared clinical features associated with persistent seizures (ongoing seizures after one month from presentation) and status epilepticus, using bivariate and multivariable analyses. Among the 38 individuals with definite anti-NMDARE, 32 (84%) had seizures and 29 (76%) had seizures captured on EEG. Electrographic-only seizures were identified in five (13%) individuals. Seizures started at a median of four days after initial symptoms (IQR: 3-6 days). Frontal lobe-onset focal seizures were most common (n=12; 32%). Most individuals (31/38; 82%) were refractory to anti-seizure medications. Status epilepticus was associated with younger age (15 years [9-20] vs. 23 years [18-27]; p=0.04) and Hispanic ethnicity (30 [80%] vs. 8 [36%]; p=0.04). Persistent seizures (ongoing seizures after one month from presentation) were associated with younger age (nine years [3-14] vs. 22 years [15-28]; p<0.01). Measured electrographic features were not associated with persistent seizures. Seizures associated with anti-NMDARE are primarily focal seizures originating in the frontal lobes. Younger patients may be at increased risk of epileptogenesis and status epilepticus.

However, neurological sequelae from novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can occur. Patients with neurological conditions may be at higher risk of developing worsening of their underlying problem. Here we document our initial experiences as neurologic consultants at a single center quaternary hospital at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective case series of adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 who required neurological evaluation in the form of a consultation or primary neurological care from March 13, 2020 to April 1, 2020. Results: Thirty-three patients (ages 17-88 years) with COVID-19 infection who required neurological or admission to a primary neurology team were included in this study. The encountered neurological problems associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were encephalopathy (12 patients, 36.4%), seizure (9 patients, 27.2%), stroke (5 patients, 15.2%), recrudescence of prior neurological disease symptoms (4 patients, 12.1%), and neuromuscular (3 patients, 9.1%). The majority of patients who required evaluation by neurology had elevated inflammatory markers.

Background: Rapid diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) infections are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality. The ME panel is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rapid multiplex PCR assay that targets 14 bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Previous studies show an overall agreement of 93-99% between the ME panel and conventional diagnostic testing. However, few studies have evaluated the clinical implementation of the ME assay, which is available for routine use at our institution. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective chart review of inpatients who underwent ME panel testing from August 2016 to May 2017. Clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data were reviewed to determine the clinical significance of results. Indication for lumbar puncture (LP), time to results of the ME panel, and duration of antimicrobial therapy were evaluated. Results: Seven hundred and five inpatients underwent ME testing, of whom 480 (68.1%) had clinical suspicion for CNS infection with 416 (59.0%) receiving empiric antimicrobial treatment for CNS infection. The median time-to-result of the ME panel was 1.5 h (IQR, 1.4-1.7). Overall agreement between the ME panel results and clinico-laboratory assessment was 98.2%. Forty-five patients tested positive by ME, of which 12 (26.6%) were determined likely to be clinically insignificant. Conclusions: Routine availability of the ME panel led to overutilization of diagnostic test ordering, as demonstrated by the fact that over one-third of ME panel tests performed were ordered for patients with little or no suspicion for CNS infection. The median time from LP to ME panel result was 1.5 h (IQR, 1.4-1.7). The ME panel's rapid turn-around time contributed to the overuse of the test. Approximately one-quarter of positive ME results were deemed clinically insignificant, though the impact of these positive results requires additional evaluation. Twenty-four and forty-eight hours after the ME panel resulted, 68 and 25% of patients started on empiric therapy remained on antibiotics, respectively. The median time from diagnosis to discontinuation and/or narrowing of antibiotic coverage was 25.6 h (IQR, 3.6-42.5).

This article will address concepts of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, and will provide updates on the neurological manifestations of select emerging and reemerging infections, including Ebola virus, bacterial meningitis, enterovirus 71, Zika virus, cerebral malaria, and Japanese encephalitis. Emerging and reemerging neurotropic infectious diseases, including Zika virus, have recently been major global health threats. Factors contributing to the emergence of infectious diseases include closer contact with zoonoses, population growth in cities, globalization, environmental changes, and the rise in antibiotic resistance. Serotype replacement of bacterial meningitis, the possibility of viral persistence in the central nervous system in Ebola virus, antibiotic resistance of malaria, and the evolution of neurovirulent strains of Zika virus display some of the developing challenges that accompany various neurotropic infectious diseases. Neurologists should be aware of the factors contributing to the emergence and reemergence of neurotropic infectious diseases. As emerging and reemerging neurotropic infectious continue to be a major global health security threat, clinicians should be aware of the risks to travelers and current guidelines on prevention and management.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Communicable Disease Control", "Communicable Diseases", "Endemic Diseases", "Epidemiological Monitoring", "Global Health", "Humans", "Nervous System Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Savina", "Last Name": "Reid", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care and Hospitalist Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Haley", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kiran T", "Last Name": "Thakur", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care and Hospitalist Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Seminars in neurology", "PubDate": "2018Apr"}, {"PMID": "29791949", "Title": "The Global Neurological Burden of Tuberculosis.", "Abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement of tuberculosis (TB) is the most severe manifestation of TB and accounts for approximately 5 to 10% of all extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases and approximately 1% of all TB cases. TB meningitis (TBM) is the most common form of CNS TB, though other forms occur, often in conjunction with TBM, including intracranial tuberculomas, tuberculous brain abscesses, and spinal tubercular arachnoiditis. CNS TB often presents with nonspecific clinical features that mimic symptoms of other neurological conditions, often making diagnosis difficult. Defining neuroimaging characteristics of TBM include thick basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, and parenchymal infarctions most commonly involving the basal ganglia and internal capsule. Traditional cerebrospinal fluid sample analysis frequently requires lengthy times-to-result and have low sensitivity. Given the pitfalls of conventional CNS TB diagnostic methods, various molecular-based methods, including immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays have emerged as alternative diagnostic tools due to their rapidity, sensitivity, and specificity. Expert panels on TBM have recently emphasized the need for standard research procedures with updated case definitions and standardized study methods, which will hopefully pave the way for more robust multicenter international studies.

Due to her recent travel, Zika-associated Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) was suspected and she underwent evaluation for recent flavivirus exposure. Zika virus RNA was not detected in serum, but Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) was detected in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Dengue virus IgM in serum was equivocal and dengue virus IgG was detected in the serum. Plaque-reduction neutralization testing showed elevated titers to both Zika virus and dengue virus, providing evidence of recent infection with a flavivirus. The patient was diagnosed with probable Zika virus-associated GBS based on clinical findings, ancillary testing, and laboratory assays according to current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Zika virus transmission in the Americas is resulting in increasing numbers of patients presenting with Zika virus-associated neurological syndromes.

The biennial publication serves as a guide for countries, particularly low- and lower-middle-income countries, to develop their own national essential medicines list (EML), and many nongovernmental organizations base their medication supplies on the WHO EML. Over the last 40 years, WHO has expanded the EML in response to treatment gaps for infectious diseases, pediatrics, palliative care, and cancer. In contrast, neurotherapeutics are poorly represented on the Model List despite the global burden of neurologic disorders, which have continued to increase in the last decade. It is imperative that the neurology community advocate for more evidence-based neurologic medicines on the WHO EML.

HIV/AIDS is an independent risk factor for stroke. Our study aimed to report the risk factors and short-term clinical outcomes of African Americans with HIV infection and new-onset stroke admitted at the Johns Hopkins Hospitals (2000-2012). Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the association between potential predictors and odds of an unfavorable outcome, defined as a higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score on hospital discharge. African Americans comprised 105/125 (84%) of HIV-infected new-onset stroke inpatients (median age 50 years; 69% men; median CD4 140/mL; ischemic 77%; 39% taking highly active antiretroviral therapy). Vascular risk factors were common: hypertension (67%), cigarette smoking (66%), dyslipidemia (42%), hepatitis C (48%), intravenous drug abuse (32%), and prior myocardial infarction (29%). Prior aspirin and statin use were uncommon (18%, 9%). Unfavorable outcome (mRS score 4-6, n\u2009=\u200922 of 90 available records) was noted in 24% of patients, including seven in-hospital deaths. On multivariate analyses, higher CD4 count on hospital admission was associated with a lower mRS (-0.2 mRS points per 1 unit increase in CD4, 95% CI (-0.3, 0), p\u2009=\u20090.03). Intracerebral hemorrhage was also associated with a lower mRS (1.0 points lower, 95% CI (0.2, 1.8) compared to ischemic stroke, p\u2009=\u20090.01) after adjustment for other potential predictors.
