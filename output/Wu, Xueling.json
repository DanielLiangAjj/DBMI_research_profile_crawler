The microbial community characteristics exhibited common co-networks for resisting composting environment stresses. Vermiculite contributed to enhancing the keystone taxa Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota and caused the ecological function network to diversify in the warming and maturation phases, with more complexity and tightness in the thermophilic phase (with super-generalist species existing). The enhanced microbial interactions induced by vermiculite possessed a greater capacity to facilitate the metabolisms of carbohydrates and amino acids and cellulolysis, thereby promoting composting humification, and nitrogen retention in the final compost and composting maturity.

As amyloid b protein (Ab) is one of the key players responsible for the pathogenesis of AD, we sought to investigate the protective effects of fisetin in an Ab1-42-induced rat model of AD. In this model, the protective effects of fisetin on learning and memory impairment induced by Ab1-42 were determined via the Morris water maze and passive avoidance test. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity, anti-inflammation, and apoptosis effect of fisetin were investigated using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. The results showed that intragastric (i.g.) administration of fisetin (100, 50, and 25 mg/kg) improved previous learning and memory impairments in Ab1-42-treated rats. Hippocampal tissue from these fisetin-treated rats revealed that the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were markedly enhanced, and that the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were significantly reduced. Meanwhile, fisetin also significantly attenuated Ab1-42-induced cholinergic dysfunction such as elevated the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and reduced the activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE). In addition, hippocampal tissue obtained from fisetin-treated rats revealed a reversal of Ab1-42-induced effects on apoptotic pathway protein (caspase-3) expression and inflammatory response of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). This indicated that the amount of degenerating hippocampal neurons with apoptotic features was dramatically reduced after treatment with fisetin. Collectively, these findings suggest that fisetin has potential as a treatment agent for Alzheimer's disease and that its effects occur through several mechanisms, including inhibition of oxidative stress, adjustments to previous cholinergic dysfunction, anti-inflammatory actions, and decreased apoptotic activity.", "Keywords": ["Ab1-42", "fisetin", "mechanism", "protective effects", "Alzheimer's disease"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Rats", "Alzheimer Disease", "Central Nervous System", "Flavonols", "Amyloidogenic Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yunting", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Biochemical Engineering of Beijing Union University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Biochemical Engineering of Beijing Union University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wujiang", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Biochemical Engineering of Beijing Union University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yanxia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Biochemical Engineering of Beijing Union University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Biochemical Engineering of Beijing Union University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shuo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Nankai University, Tianjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Qing", "Last Name": "Huo", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Biochemical Engineering of Beijing Union University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yaxuan", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Engineering, College of Biochemical Engineering of Beijing Union University, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Folia neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "37584411", "Title": "The cryobiopsy in interstitial lung diseases guided by probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy is feasible.", "Abstract": "Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLB) is routinely used to diagnose the interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Herein, the ability of a mixed inoculum of electricigenic Castellaniella species to perform simultaneous denitrification and anode respiration coupled with cathodic metals recovery was investigated in a BES. Results showed that 500\u00a0mg/L NO3--N significantly decreased power generation, whereas 100 and 250\u00a0mg/L NO3--N had a lesser impact. The single-chamber MFCs (SCMFCs) fed with 100 and 250\u00a0mg/L NO3--N concentrations achieved a removal efficiency higher than 90% in all cycles. In contrast, the removal efficiency in the SCMFCs declined dramatically at 500\u00a0mg/L NO3--N, which might be attributable to decreased microbial viability as revealed by SEM and CLSM. EPS protein content and enzymatic activities of the biofilms decreased significantly at this concentration. Cyclic voltammetry results revealed that the 500\u00a0mg/L NO3--N concentration decreased the redox activities of anodic biofilms, while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the internal resistance of the SCMFCs at this concentration increased significantly.

Current treatment strategies primarily involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, determined by TNM stages, histologic types, and genetic profiles. Plenty of studies have been trying to identify robust prognostic gene expression signatures. Even for high performance signatures, they usually have few shared genes. This is not totally unexpected, since a prognostic signature is associated with patient survival and may contain no upstream regulators. Identification of master regulators driving disease progression is a vital step to understand underlying molecular mechanisms and develop new treatments. Methods: In this study, we have utilized a robust workflow to identify potential master regulators that drive poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. This workflow takes gene expression signatures that are associated with poor survival of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR-TKI resistance, and responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors, respectively, and identifies recurrent master regulators from seven public gene expression datasets by a regulatory network-based approach. Results: We have found that majority of the master regulators driving poor prognosis in early stage LUAD are cell-cycle related according to Gene Ontology annotation. However, they were demonstrated experimentally to promote a spectrum of processes such as tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Master regulators predicted from EGFR-TKI resistance signature and the EMT pathway signature are largely shared, which suggests that EMT pathway functions as a hub and interact with other pathways such as hypoxia, angiogenesis, TNF-\u03b1 signaling, inflammation, TNF-\u03b2 signaling, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways. Master regulators that repress immunotherapy are enriched with MYC targets, E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and mTOR signaling. Conclusion: Our study uncovered possible mechanisms underlying recurrence, resistance to targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The predicted master regulators may serve as potential therapeutic targets in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.", "Keywords": ["TKI resistance", "immunotherapy", "lung adenocarcinoma", "master regulator", "relapse"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qiong", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Disease, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiongfang", "Last Name": "Cha", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Disease, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Disease, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Disease, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Disease, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiantao", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in bioinformatics", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36096323", "Title": "Evaluation of fungal community assembly and function during food waste composting with Aneurinibacillus sp.

Inoculation reduced the content of total organic carbon, moisture content, nitrate nitrogen, and nitrite nitrogen. The LD3 inoculant was able to drive the changes in the assembly of the fungal community. In particular, inoculation with LD3 not only increased the relative abundance of Ascomycota and Trichocomaceae_unclassified for lignocellulose degradation at the mesophilic and cooling stages but also reduced the relative abundances of the opportunistic human pathogen Candida. Saprotroph was the predominant fungal trophic mode in composting, and inoculation with LD3 has a better inactivation effect on animal and plant pathogenic fungi during composting. Furthermore, the variation of the fungal community after inoculation with LD3 was the largest explained by temperature (30.64%).

Two thermotolerant alkali lignin-degrading bacteria isolates were identified as Bacillus sp. LD2 (LD2) and a novel species Aneurinibacillus sp. LD3 (LD3).

The metal and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies of the microbial fuel cells (MFCs) declined as Ni2+ concentration increased, which could be attributed to decreased microbial viability as revealed by SEM and CLSM. FTIR analysis revealed the involvement of various microbial biofilm functional groups, including hydroxyl, amides, methyl, amine, and carboxyl, in the uptake of Ni2+. The presence of Ni2+ on the anodic biofilms was confirmed by SEM-EDS and XPS analyses. CV demonstrated that the electron transfer performance of the anodic biofilms was negatively correlated with the various Ni2+ concentrations. EIS showed that the internal resistance of the MFCs increased with increasing Ni2+ concentration, resulting in a decrease in power output. High-throughput sequencing results revealed a decrease in Geobacter and an increase in Desulfovibrio in response to Ni2+ concentrations of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/L. Furthermore, the various Ni2+ concentrations decreased the expression of EET-related genes. The Ni2+-fed MFCs had a higher abundance of the nikR gene than the control group, which was important for Ni2+ resistance.

Due to a continuous shortage of medical resources, COVID-19 has raised alarm about medical and health resource allocation in China. A balanced spatial distribution of medical and health resources is a key livelihood issue in promoting the equalization of health services. This paper explores the spatial allocation equilibrium of two-tier medical and health resources and its influencing factors in Taiyuan. Using extracted POIs of medical and health resources of AMAP, we evaluated the spatial quantitative characteristics through the Health Resources Density Index, researched the spatial distribution pattern by kernel density analysis, hot spot analysis, and service area analysis, and identified the influencing factors of the spatial distribution equilibrium by the Geodetector model. The findings are as follows. The overall allocation level of medical and health resources in Taiyuan is low. There are tiered and regional differences; the response degree of primary care facilities to external factors is greater than that of hospitals; and the comprehensive influence of economic and topographic systems is crucial compared with other factors. Therefore, in order to promote the rational spatial distribution of medical and health resources in Taiyuan and to improve the construction of basic medical services within a 15 min radius, it is important to continuously improve the tiered healthcare system, uniformly deploy municipal medical and health resources, and increase the resource allocation to surrounding counties and remote mountainous areas.

Batch biosorption experiments showed that the optimal adsorption conditions were pH 7.0, 30 \u00b0C, 15 min, and an initial ion concentration of 4.0 mg L-1. The adsorption process fitted well with the pseudo-second order kinetic model, mainly based on chemisorption.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analyses confirmed the presence of Cd2+ on the cyanobacterial cell surface and intracellularly. Cd2+ could lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and photosynthesis inhibition in cyanobacterial cells, and glutathione (GSH) played an important role in alleviating Cd2+ toxicity. Analyses of three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) and high performance anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) revealed the changes of the composition and content of EPS after Cd2+ adsorption, respectively.

Compared with control, 6% bamboo sphere amendment increased total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP) and potassium (TK) contents by 13.61%, 19% and 17.42%, respectively. Furthermore, bamboo sphere enhanced bacterial-fungal diversity and improved microbial community composition by enhancing the relative abundance of thermo-tolerance and lignocellulolytic bacteria and fungi. The five most abundant genera in bamboo sphere composting comprised Bacillus (0-71.47%), Chloroplast-norank (0-47.17%), Pusillimonas (0-33.24%), Acinetobacter (0-27.98%) and unclassified Sphingobacteriaceae (0-22.62%).

We investigated immunological and virological events in rhesus macaques infected with the newly developed SHIV.C.CH848 (SHIVC) and treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Similar to HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection, SHIV.C.CH848 infection established viral reservoirs in CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells, accompanied by productive infection and depletion of CD4+ T cells in systemic and lymphoid tissues throughout SHIV infection. Despite 6 months of cART-suppressed viral replication, integrated proviral DNA levels remained stable, especially in CD4+ T cells, and the viral rebound was also observed after ART interruption. Autologous neutralizing antibodies to the parental HIV-1 strain CH848 were detected, with limited viral evolution at 5\u2009months postinfection. In comparison, heterogenous neutralizing antibodies in SHIV.C.CH848-infected macaques were not detected except for 1 (1 of 10) animal at 2\u2009years postinfection. These findings suggest that SHIV.C.CH848, a novel class of transmitted/founder SHIVs, can establish sustained viremia and viral reservoirs in rhesus macaques with clinical immunodeficiency consequences, providing a valuable SHIV model for HIV research.IMPORTANCE SHIVs have been extensively used in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model for HIV research. In this study, we investigated viral reservoirs in tissues and immune responses in an NHP model inoculated with newly generated transmitted/founder HIV-1 clade C-based SHIV.C.CH848. The data show that transmitted founder (T/F) SHIVC infection of macaques more closely recapitulates the virological and clinical features of HIV infection, including persistent viremia and viral rebound once antiretroviral therapy is discontinued.

The sodium chloride method was able to extract the maximum amount of EPS (86.15 \u00b1 1.50 mg g-1-DW), and could ensure minimum cell lysis by detecting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and using scanning electron microscopy. This method was therefore selected as the optimal extraction method and used in subsequent experiments. On this basis, the tolerance of C. pauculus 1490 and variations in EPS secretion after the addition of different metal ions was investigated. The tolerance levels of C. pauculus 1490 to Cd(ii), Ni(ii), Cu(ii) and Co(ii) were 300 mg L-1, 400 mg L-1, 400 mg L-1 and 400 mg L-1, respectively. Low concentrations of these heavy metal ions could promote bacterial growth, while increased concentrations were found to inhibit it. The results show that metal ions, especially Cd(ii), stimulate the secretion of EPS, with an EPS yield reaching 956.12 \u00b1 10.59 mg g-1-DW at 100 mg L-1.

Synechococcus PCC7002, a major marine cyanobacteria, is widely applied to remove metals from the ocean's photic zone. However, its ability to adsorb cesium (Cs) nuclides has received little attention. In this study, the biosorption behavior of Cs(I) from ultrapure distilled water by living Synechococcus PCC7002 was investigated based on kinetic and isotherm studies, and the biosorption mechanism was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman&nbsp;spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and three-dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy. Synechococcus PCC7002 showed extremely high tolerance to Cs ions and its minimal inhibitory concentration was 8.6 g/L. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in Synechococcus PCC7002 played a vital role in this tolerance. The biosorption of Cs by Synechococcus PCC7002 conformed to a Freundlich-type isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. The binding of Cs(I) was primarily attributed to the extracellular proteins in EPS, with the amino, hydroxyl, and phosphate groups on the cell walls contributing to Cs adsorption. The biosorption of Cs involved two mechanisms: Passive adsorption on the cell surface at low Cs concentrations and active intracellular adsorption at high Cs concentrations. The results demonstrate that the behavior and mechanism of Cs adsorption by Synechococcus PCC7002 differ based on the Cs ions concentration.", "Keywords": ["Biosorption", "Cs", "EPS", "Synechococcus PCC7002"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Runlan", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Hongsheng", "Last Name": "Chai", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Zhaojing", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuandong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaokun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Hunan Qingzhiyuan Environmental Protection Technology Co, Ltd.

So far, many methods have been developed to handle the TC contamination. Microbial remediation, which involves the use of microbes to biodegrade the pollutant, is considered cost-efficient and more suitable for practical application in soil. This study isolated several strains from TC-contaminated soil and constructed a TC-degrading bacterial consortium containing Raoultella sp. XY-1 and Pandoraea sp. XY-2, which exhibited better growth and improved TC degradation efficiency compared with single strain (81.72% TC was biodegraded within 12 days in Lysogeny broth (LB) medium). Subsequently, lab-scale soil remediation was conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in different soils and the environmental effects it brought. Results indicated that the most efficient TC degradation was recorded at 30 \u00b0C and in soil sample Y which had relatively low initial TC concentration (around 35 mg/kg): TC concentration decreased by 43.72% within 65 days. Soil properties were affected, for instance, at 30 \u00b0C, the pH value of soil sample Y increased to near neutral, and soil moisture content (SMC) of both soils declined. Analysis of bacterial communities at the phylum level showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the four dominant phyla, and the relative abundance of Proteobacteria significantly increased in both soils after bioremediation. Further analysis of bacterial communities at the genus level revealed that Raoultella sp. XY-1 successfully proliferated in soil, while Pandoraea sp. XY-2 was undetectable. Moreover, bacteria associated with nitrogen cycling, biodegradation of organic pollutants, soil biochemical reactions, and plant growth were affected, causing the decline in soil bacterial diversity. Variations in the relative abundance of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) and mobile gene elements (MGEs) were investigated, the results obtained indicated that tetD, tetG, tetX, intI1, tnpA-04, and tnpA-05 had higher relative abundance in original soils, and the relative abundance of most TRGs and MGEs declined after the microbial remediation. Network analysis indicated that tnpA may dominate the transfer of TRGs, and Massilia, Alkanibacter, Rhizomicrobium, Xanthomonadales, Acidobacteriaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae were possible hosts of TRGs or MGEs.

A slight declining north-south disequilibrium and a growing east-west disequilibrium exhibited in 2017, along with an increasing weight of eastern and southern pollution in the proportion of the overall pollution level. North-south disequilibrium existed stably throughout the year but east-west disequilibrium was erratic. Nearly half of the cities exhibited significant spillover effects, presenting 2 clusters with spillover by high concentrations and 3 clusters with spillover by low concentrations. Most cities in Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces showed a high but decreasing spillover effect, but increasing trend happened in the cities in Anhui and Shanxi provinces. A significant correlation appeared between the city population and PM2.5 concentration. Population density explained about 25% of the PM2.5 concentration change, and the explanation ability increased in 2017. A higher influence of population on PM2.5 concentration happened in the early stage of city development, and the influence exhibited spatial differences. The city population and PM2.5 spillover effect existed an overall positive correlation, but the population only addressed about 10% of the spillover effect change.

S3, a new hyper antimony-oxidizing bacterium previously isolated from contaminated mine soils. The results showed that Bacillus sp. S3 is a multi-metal resistant bacterial strain, especially to Sb(III), Cu(II) and Cr(VI). Toxic Cd(II), Cr(VI) and Cu(II) could stimulate the secretion of EPS in Bacillus sp. S3, significantly enhancing the adsorption and detoxification capacity of heavy metals. Both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) analysis further confirmed that proteins were the main compounds of EPS for metal binding. In contrast, the EPS production was not induced under Sb(III) stress. Furthermore, the TEM-EDX micrograph showed that Bacillus sp. S3 strain preferentially transported the Sb(III) to the inside of the cell rather than adsorbed it on the extracellular surface, indicating intracellular detoxification rather than extracellular EPS precipitation played an important role in microbial resistance towards Sb(III). Together, our study suggests that the toxicity response of EPS to heavy metals is associated with difference in EPS properties, metal types and corresponding environmental conditions, which is likely to contribute to microbial-mediated remediation.", "Keywords": ["Bioremediation", "Extracellular polymeric substance", "Intracellular accumulation", "Metal adsorption", "Metal tolerance"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacillus", "Biodegradation, Environmental", "Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix", "Metals, Heavy", "Soil", "Soil Microbiology", "Soil Pollutants"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Weimin", "Last Name": "Zeng", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenchen", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Runlan", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuandong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Guanzhou", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaokun", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University (CSU), Changsha, 410083, China. lijiaokun@csu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "Bioprocess and biosystems engineering", "PubDate": "2020Jan"}, {"PMID": "31509438", "Title": "Clinically relevant model of pneumococcal pneumonia, ARDS, and nonpulmonary organ dysfunction in mice.", "Abstract": "Pneumonia is responsible for more deaths in the United States than any other infectious disease. Severe pneumonia is a common cause of acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite the introduction of effective antibiotics and intensive supportive care in the 20th century, death rates from community-acquired pneumonia among patients in the intensive care unit remain as high as 35%. Beyond antimicrobial treatment, no targeted molecular therapies have yet proven effective, highlighting the need for additional research. Despite some limitations, small animal models of pneumonia and the mechanistic insights they produce are likely to continue to play an important role in generating new therapeutic targets. Here we describe the development of an innovative mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia developed for enhanced clinical relevance. We first reviewed the literature of small animal models of bacterial pneumonia that incorporated antibiotics. We then did a series of experiments in mice in which we systematically varied the pneumococcal inoculum and the timing of antibiotics while measuring systemic and lung-specific end points, producing a range of models that mirrors the spectrum of pneumococcal lung disease in patients, from mild self-resolving infection to severe pneumonia refractory to antibiotics. A delay in antibiotic treatment resulted in ongoing inflammation and renal and hepatic dysfunction despite effective bacterial killing. The addition of fluid resuscitation to the model improved renal function but worsened the severity of lung injury based on direct measurements of pulmonary edema and lung compliance, analogous to patients with pneumonia and sepsis who develop ARDS following fluid administration.", "Keywords": ["ARDS", "acute lung injury", "pneumococcus", "pneumonia", "sepsis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Fluid Therapy", "Inflammation", "Lung Injury", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Multiple Organ Failure", "Pneumonia, Pneumococcal", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey E", "Last Name": "Gotts", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Bernard", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "Chun", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Roxanne H", "Last Name": "Croze", "Affiliation": "4D Molecular Therapeutics, Emeryville, California."}, {"First Name": "James T", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Nesseler", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, Pontchaillou, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Shanghai Jiaotong University, Respiratory Medicine, Renji Hospital, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Abbott", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Xiaohui", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn S", "Last Name": "Calfee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Matthay", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Landslide-related factors were extracted from topographic maps, geological maps, and satellite images. Twelve factors were selected as independent variables using correlation coefficient analysis and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) method. In total, 288 soil landslides were mapped using field surveys, historical records, and satellite images. The landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of all landslides were selected as the original training dataset and 30% were used for validation. Then, SMOTE was employed to generate datasets with sizes ranging from two to thirty times that of the training dataset to establish and compare the four machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping. In addition, we used slope units to subdivide the terrain to determine the landslide susceptibility. Finally, the landslide susceptibility maps were validated using statistical indexes and the area under the curve (AUC). The results indicated that the performances of the four machine learning methods showed different levels of improvement as the sample sizes increased. The RF model exhibited a more substantial improvement (AUC improved by 24.12%) than did the ANN (18.94%), SVM (17.77%), and LR (3.00%) models.

Compared to healthy adults, the five HIV-1 chronically infected adults displayed elevated mutation frequencies for all \u03bc, \u03b3, \u03b1, \u03ba, and \u03bb chains examined and slightly longer CDR3 lengths for \u03b3, \u03b1, and \u03bb.

Sustained activation of the STING signaling induced by cytosolic DNA has been considered to be the cause of a variety of autoimmune diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation.

Here we demonstrate that the STING protein undergoes a proteasome-mediated degradation in human diploid cell (HDC) lines including MRC-5 following the transfection of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The degradation of STING is accompanied by the increased expression of both RIG-I and IL-6. Employing the RIG-I siRNA knockdown and an IL-6 neutralizing antibody greatly inhibits the degradation of STING induced by dsDNA. We further demonstrate that both IL-6 and RIG-I are downstream molecules of STING along the DNA sensor pathway. Therefore, STING degradation mediated by RIG-I and IL-6 may serve as a negative feedback mechanism to limit the uncontrolled innate immune response induced by dsDNA. We have further shown that RIG-I and IL-6 promote STING degradation by activating/dephosphorylating UNC-51-like kinase (ULK1).

Furthermore, the viability and migration of 786\u2011O and, ACHN cells tranfected with miR\u2011100\u20115p was significantly increased compared with the negative control group. In addition, miR\u2011100\u20115p\u2011transfected 786\u2011O and ACHN cells demonstrated significantly reduced cellular apoptotic rates compared with the negative control group. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report an association between miR\u2011100\u20115p and RCC. The results of the current study suggest that tumor oncogene miR\u2011100\u20115p could be used as a diagnostic biomarker for RCC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Apoptosis", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Cells, Cultured", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Staging", "Oncogenes", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peijie", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518036, P.R.

Here, genomic and transcriptomic assays were performed to illuminate the adaptation mechanisms of an A. ferrivorans strain YL15, to the alpine acid mine drainage environment in Yulong copper mine in southwest China. Genomic analysis revealed that strain has a gene repertoire for metal-resistance, e.g., genes coding for the mer operon and a variety of transporters/efflux proteins, and for low pH adaptation, such as genes for hopanoid-synthesis and the sodium:proton antiporter. Genes for various DNA repair enzymes and synthesis of UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids precursor indicated hypothetical UV radiation-resistance mechanisms in strain YL15. In addition, it has two types of the acquired immune system-type III-B and type I-F CRISPR/Cas modules against invasion of foreign genetic elements. RNA-seq based analysis uncovered that strain YL15 uses a set of mechanisms to adapt to low temperature. Genes involved in protein synthesis, transmembrane transport, energy metabolism and chemotaxis showed increased levels of RNA transcripts.

However, this epitope region is structurally polymorphic as it can also form a helical conformation recognized by RV144 vaccine-induced MAb CH58. This structural polymorphism is a potential mechanism for masking the V1V2 vulnerable site. Designing immunogens that can induce conformation-specific antibody (Ab) responses may lead to vaccines targeting this vulnerable site. We designed a panel of immunogens engrafting the V1V2 domain into trimeric and pentameric scaffolds in structurally constrained conformations. We also fused V1V2 to an Fc fragment to mimic the unconstrained V1V2 conformation. We tested these V1V2-scaffold proteins for immunogenicity in rabbits and assessed the responses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and competition assays. Our V1V2 immunogens induced distinct conformation-specific Ab responses. Abs induced by structurally unconstrained immunogens reacted preferentially with unconstrained V1V2 antigens, suggesting recognition of the helical configuration, while Abs induced by the structurally constrained immunogens reacted preferentially with constrained V1V2 antigens, suggesting recognition of the \u03b2-strand conformation. The Ab responses induced by the structurally constrained immunogens were more broadly reactive and had higher titers than those induced by the structurally unconstrained immunogens. Our results demonstrate that immunogens presenting the different structural conformations of the gp120 V1V2 vulnerable site can be designed and that these immunogens induce distinct Ab responses with epitope conformation specificity.

These antibodies, which are present in the sera of most HIV-1-infected individuals, preferentially recognize Env in its CD4-bound conformation. Accordingly, recent studies showed that small CD4-mimetics (CD4mc) able to \"push\" Env into this conformation sensitize HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC mediated by HIV+ sera. Here we test whether CD4mc also expose epitopes recognized by anti-cluster A monoclonal antibodies such as A32, thought to be responsible for the majority of ADCC activity present in HIV+ sera and linked to decreased HIV-1 transmission in the RV144 trial. We made the surprising observation that CD4mc are unable to enhance recognition of HIV-1-infected cells by this family of antibodies in the absence of antibodies such as 17b, which binds a highly conserved CD4-induced epitope overlapping the co-receptor binding site (CoRBS). Our results indicate that CD4mc initially open the trimeric Env enough to allow the binding of CoRBS antibodies but not anti-cluster A antibodies. CoRBS antibody binding further opens the trimeric Env, allowing anti-cluster A antibody interaction and sensitization of infected cells to ADCC. Therefore, ADCC responses mediated by cluster A antibodies in HIV-positive sera involve a sequential opening of the Env trimer on the surface of HIV-1-infected cells.

Although, there has been accumulating evidence for the effects of edaphic conditions and geographical isolation on the genetic structure of pesudometallophytes, it is still a difficult problem in evolutionary biology to assess their relative importance. In this study, we investigated the spatial patterns of genetic variability, population differentiation and genetic groups in pseudometallophyte Commelina communis with 12 microsatellite loci. Eight metallicolous and six non-metallicolous populations of C. communis were sampled from cupriferous sites and surrounding non-contaminated areas in China. Neither significant reduction in genetic diversity nor apparent founder and bottleneck effects were observed in metallicolous populations of C. communis. Based on Bayesian and Neighbor-Joining clustering analyses and a principal coordinates analysis, all sampled populations were found to be mainly separated into three genetic groups, corresponding well to their geographical locations rather than edaphic origins. Moreover, a significant and strong correlation between population genetic divergence and geographical distance were detected by Mantel test (r = 0.33; P < 0.05) and multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR; \u03b2D = 0.57, P < 0.01). However, the effect of copper concentration on genetic patterns of C. communis was not significant (MMRR; \u03b2E = -0.17, P = 0.12). Our study clearly demonstrated that the extreme edaphic conditions in metalliferous areas had limited effects on the genetic variability in C. communis. Geographic distance played a more important role in affecting the genetic structure of C. communis than soil composition did.

We show that exclusively CXCR4- as compared to cocirculating CCR5-utilizing variants are less sensitive to neutralization by both contemporaneous autologous plasma and plasma pools from individuals that harbor only CCR5-using HIV-1. The CXCR4-utilizing variants, however, do not have a global antigenic change because they remain equivalently susceptible to antibodies that do not target coreceptor binding domains. Studies with envelope V3 loop directed antibodies and chimeric envelopes suggest that the neutralization susceptibility differences are potentially influenced by the V3 loop. In vitro passage of a neutralization sensitive CCR5-using virus in the presence of autologous plasma and activated CD4+ T cells led to the emergence of a CXCR4-utilizing virus in 1 of 3 cases.

We found that the expression of PALM3 was up-regulated in the lung tissues obtained from the mouse model of LPS-induced ALI. The LPS-evoked inflammatory response (neutrophils and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines [IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, MIP-2] in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF]), histologic lung injury (lung injury score), permeability of the alveolar capillary barrier (lung wet/dry weight ratio and BALF protein concentration) and mortality rates were attenuated in the PALM3 siRNA-treated mice. These results indicate that PALM3 contributes to the development of ALI in mice challenged with LPS. Inhibiting PALM3 through the intranasal application of specific siRNA protected against LPS-induced ALI.", "Keywords": ["Acute lung injury", "Paralemmin-3", "lipopolysaccharide"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Lung Injury", "Animals", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Lung", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shaoying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China; Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kunming General Hospital of Chengdu Military Command, Kunming, China."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunfeng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Pudong New Area Gongli Hospital, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Pin", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Institute of Field Internal Medicine, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuejun", "Last Name": "Lv", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Lanlan", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Qin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Guisheng", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.

However, atomic-level interactions had previously been determined only with antibodies from a single donor, thus making commonalities in recognition uncertain. Here we report the cocrystal structure of V1V2 with antibody CH03 from a second donor and model Env interactions of antibody CAP256-VRC26 from a third donor. These V1V2-directed bNAbs used strand-strand interactions between a protruding antibody loop and a V1V2 strand but differed in their N-glycan recognition. Ontogeny analysis indicated that protruding loops develop early, and glycan interactions mature over time. Altogether, the multidonor information suggested that V1V2-directed bNAbs form an 'extended class', for which we engineered ontogeny-specific antigens: Env trimers with chimeric V1V2s that interacted with inferred ancestor and intermediate antibodies. The ontogeny-based design of vaccine antigens described here may provide a general means for eliciting antibodies of a desired class.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Antibodies,

Although angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) participates in inflammation, whether it plays important roles in ALI and alveolar epithelial cell inflammatory injury remains unclear. We therefore investigated the role of angptl4 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and the associated mechanisms. Lentivirus-mediated short interfering RNA targeted to the mouse angptl4 gene (AngsiRNA) and a negative control lentivirus (NCsiRNA) were intranasally administered to mice. Lung inflammatory injury and the underlying mechanisms for regulation of angptl4 on the LPS-induced ALI were subsequently determined. We reported that angptl4 levels were increased both in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells and lung tissues obtained from a mouse model of LPS-induced ALI. Angptl4 expression was induced by LPS in alveolar epithelial cells, whereas LPS-induced lung inflammation (neutrophils infiltration in the lung tissues, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin 6), lung permeability (lung wet/dry weight ratio and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein concentration), tissue damage (caspase3 activation), and mortality rates were attenuated in AngsiRNA-treated mice. The inflammatory reaction (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin 6) and apoptosis rates were reduced in AngsiRNA(h)-treated A549 cells. Moreover, angptl4 promoted NF-kBp65 expression and suppressed SIRT1 expression both in mouse lungs and A549 cells. Additionally, SIRT1 antagonist nicotinamide (NAM) attenuated the inhibitory effects of AngsiRNA both on LPS-induced NF-kBp65 expression and IL6 expression. These findings suggest that silencing angptl4 protects against LPS-induced ALI via regulating SIRT1/NF-kB signaling pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Lung Injury", "Angiopoietin-Like Protein 4", "Angiopoietins", "Animals", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Silencing", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Mice", "NF-kappa B", "Signal Transduction", "Sirtuin 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Shaoying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Yunfeng", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Pudong New Area Gongli Hospital, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Pin", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Institute of Field Internal Medicine, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Fuyun", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Lanlan", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}, {"First Name": "Guisheng", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Institute of Respiratory Disease, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of cellular physiology", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "25631091", "Title": "HIV-1 fitness cost associated with escape from the VRC01 class of CD4 binding site neutralizing antibodies.", "Abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been isolated from selected HIV-1-infected individuals and shown to bind to conserved sites on the envelope glycoprotein (Env). However, circulating plasma virus in these donors is usually resistant to autologous isolated bNAbs, indicating that during chronic infection, HIV-1 can escape from even broadly cross-reactive antibodies. Here, we evaluate if such viral escape is associated with an impairment of viral replication. Antibodies of the VRC01 class target the functionally conserved CD4 binding site and share a structural mode of gp120 recognition that includes mimicry of the CD4 receptor. We examined naturally occurring VRC01-sensitive and -resistant viral strains, as well as their mutated sensitive or resistant variants, and tested point mutations in the backbone of the VRC01-sensitive isolate YU2. In several cases, VRC01 resistance was associated with a reduced efficiency of CD4-mediated viral entry and diminished viral replication. Several mutations, alone or in combination, in the loop D or \u03b223-V5 region of Env conferred a high level of resistance to VRC01 class antibodies, suggesting a preferred escape pathway. We further mapped the VRC01-induced escape pathway in vivo using Envs from donor 45, from whom antibody VRC01 was isolated. Initial escape mutations, including the addition of a key glycan, occurred in loop D and were associated with impaired viral replication; however, compensatory mutations restored full replicative fitness. These data demonstrate that escape from VRC01 class antibodies can diminish viral replicative fitness, but compensatory changes may explain the limited impact of neutralizing antibodies during the course of natural HIV-1 infection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies", "CD4 Antigens", "Genetic Fitness", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immune Evasion", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Neutralization Tests", "Sequence Alignment", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Viral Envelope Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lillian", "Last Name": "Tran", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sijy", "Last Name": "O'Dell", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martha C", "Last Name": "Nason", "Affiliation": "Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuxing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland, Rockville, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xueling", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "The Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "John R", "Last Name": "Mascola", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA john.mascola@nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}, {"PMID": "25473545", "Title": "A case of secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, but prior to myelodysplastic syndrome.", "Abstract": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder.

To compare its protective efficacy to that of VRC01 in vivo, we performed a series of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge experiments in nonhuman primates and calculated the doses of VRC07-523 and VRC01 that provide 50% protection (EC50). VRC07-523 prevented infection in NHPs at a 5-fold lower concentration than VRC01.

The resistance levels of six Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strains to 0.15 M copper and 0.2 M zinc were investigated, and eight metal resistance-related genes (afe-0022, afe-0326, afe-0329, afe-1143, afe-0602, afe-0603, afe-0604, and afe-1788) were sequenced and analyzed. The transcriptional expression levels of eight possible metal tolerance genes in six A. ferrooxidans strains exposed to 0.15 M Cu(2+) and 0.2 M Zn(2+) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), respectively. The copper resistance levels of six A. ferrooxidans strains declined followed by DY26, DX5, DY15, GD-B, GD-0, and YTW. The zinc tolerance levels of six A. ferrooxidans strains exposed to 0.2 M Zn(2+) from high to low were YTW > GD-B > DY26 > GD-0 > DX5 > DY15.

The goal of this study was to develop and optimize a human papillomavirus (HPV) neutralization assay using HPV pseudovirons with Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) as the reporter gene. For this purpose, high-titers Gluc pseudovirons were generated by cotransfecting 293TT cells with HPV structural genes and Gluc expressing plasmids. Six types of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, vaccines immunized serum samples and WHO international antibody standard were used to validate the new developed assay. The ideal circumstances of the assay were identified for cell counts (30,000/well for 96-well plate), pseudoviron inoculating size (100 times RLU above background) and incubation time (72\u2009hr). The sensitivity of the Gluc assay was comparable to secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay and higher than the green florescent protein (GFP) assay. The non-specific background for different types of sample was significantly different (rabbit sera\u2009>\u2009human sera\u2009>\u2009mouse sera, P\u2009<\u20090.01). The non-specific neutralization effects were not attributed to IgG antibody. The cutoff value for this assay was determined as 50% inhibition at a dilution of 1:40. Without requirements of sample dilution and different incubation times at different temperature before processing, the detection time was shortened from more than 90\u2009min to less than 5\u2009min for a 96-well plate compared with the SEAP-based assay.

Developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1) is a critical factor for cell migration and infiltration via the inhibition of the function of a major leukocyte adhesion receptor LFA-1 which prevents leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. In the present study, we hypothesized that MSC-based Del-1 gene therapy may have potential therapeutic applications for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury. The MSCs in the present assay were isolated from 6 week-old male mice. In order to investigate the therapeutic effect of the Del-1 gene on LPS-induced ALI mice, a lentivirus vector containing the Del-1 gene was constructed and transduced into the MSCs. In the in vivo assay, we induced lung injury with LPS injection and treated mice with different groups of MSCs, and compared with groups treated with MSCs alone, we observed that the administration with MSCs carrying Del-1 (MSCs-Del1) markedly alleviated the LPS-induced lung injury. There were significant decreases in the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the Del-1-expressed MSC-treated mice. Furthermore, compared with MSCs treated alone, Del1-MSC-treated mice also exhibited low lung injury scores, high protein concentrations and myeloperoxidase activity.

We previously characterized the VRC01 class of antibodies, which target the CD4-binding site on gp120, appear in multiple donors, and broadly neutralize HIV-1. Antibodies of this class have developmental commonalities, but typically share only \u223c50% amino acid sequence identity among different donors. Here we apply next-generation sequencing to identify VRC01 class antibodies in a new donor, C38, directly from B cell transcript sequences. We first tested a lineage rank approach, but this was unsuccessful, likely because VRC01 class antibody sequences were not highly prevalent in this donor. We next identified VRC01 class heavy chains through a phylogenetic analysis that included thousands of sequences from C38 and a few known VRC01 class sequences from other donors. This \"cross-donor analysis\" yielded heavy chains with little sequence homology to previously identified VRC01 class heavy chains. Nonetheless, when reconstituted with the light chain from VRC01, half of the heavy chain chimeric antibodies showed substantial neutralization potency and breadth. We then identified VRC01 class light chains through a five-amino-acid sequence motif necessary for VRC01 light chain recognition. From over a million light chain sequences, we identified 13 candidate VRC01 class members. Pairing of these light chains with the phylogenetically identified C38 heavy chains yielded functional antibodies that effectively neutralized HIV-1.

The tolerance levels of A. ferrooxidans DC to Mn(2+), Zn(2+), and Cd(2+) were determined, which were 0.52, 0.42, and 0.16\u00a0mol/L for ferrous iron-grown cells and 0.38, 0.18, and 0.08\u00a0mol/L for sulfur-grown cells, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR was employed to analyze the transcriptional levels of the metal-related genes when ferrous iron- and sulfur-grown cells of A. ferrooxidans DC, respectively, exposed to Mn(2+), Zn(2+), and Cd(2+). The metal-related genes were up-regulated when A. ferrooxidans DC exposed to Mn(2+).

Copper resistance gene afe_1073 was putatively considered to be involved in copper homeostasis in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC23270. In the present study, differential expression of afe_1073 in A. ferrooxidans strain DY26 and DC was assessed with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed the expression of afe_1073 in two strains increased with the increment of copper concentrations. The expression of DY26 was lower than that of DC at the same copper concentration although A. ferrooxidans strain DY26 possessed higher copper resistance than strain DC. In addition, bioinformatics analysis showed AFE_1073 was a typical transmembrane protein P1b1-ATPase, which could reduce the harm of Cu(+) by pumping it out from the cell. There were two mutation sites in AFE_1073 between DY26 and DC and one may change the hydrophobicity of AFE_1073, which could enhance the ability of DY26 to pump out Cu(+). Therefore, DY26 needed less gene expression of afe_1073 for resisting copper toxicity than that of DC at the same copper stress.

Both of the 16S rRNA gene and 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacers sequences of the three strains exhibited small variations, with 99.9-100%, 99.7-100% identity respectively. In contrast, according to the analysis of bacterial diversity based on rep-PCR and AP-PCR fingerprinting, they produced highly discriminatory banding patterns, and the similarity values between them varied from 61.97% to 71.64%. RAPD analysis showed that banding profiles of their genomic DNA exhibited obvious differences from each other with 53.44-75% similarity. These results suggested that in contrast to 16S rRNA genes and 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacers sequencing analysis, rep-PCR, AP-PCR fingerprinting and RAPD analysis possessed higher discriminatory power in identifying these closely related strains.

While the outer domain is conformationally more stable than other portions of the HIV-1 envelope, efforts to express the outer domain as an immunogen for eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies have not been successful, potentially because natural outer domain variants do not bind strongly to antibodies such as VRC01. In this study, we optimized the antigenic properties of the HIV-1 Env outer domain to generate OD4.2.2, from the KER2018 strain of clade A HIV-1, enabling it to bind antibodies such as VRC01 with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of OD4.2.2 in complex with VRC-PG04 was solved at 3.0-\u00c5 resolution and compared to known crystal structures including (i) the structure of core gp120 bound by VRC-PG04 and (ii) a circularly permutated version of the outer domain in complex with antibody PGT128. Much of the VRC-PG04 epitope was preserved in the OD4.2.2 structure, though with altered N and C termini conformations. Overall, roughly one-third of the outer domain structure appeared to be fixed in conformation, independent of alterations in termini, clade, or ligand, while other portions of the outer domain displayed substantial structural malleability.
