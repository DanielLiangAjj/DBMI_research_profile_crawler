[{"PMID": "38187779", "Title": "Human disease-specific cell signatures in non-lesional tissue in Multiple Sclerosis detected by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.", "Abstract": "Recent investigations of cell type changes in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using single-cell profiling methods have focused on active lesional and peri-lesional brain tissue, and have implicated a number of peripheral and central nervous system cell types. However, an important question is the extent to which so-called \"normal-appearing\" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors. Overall, our investigation sheds additional light on cell type- and disease-specific differences present even in non-lesional white and grey matter tissue, highlighting widespread cellular signatures that may be associated with downstream pathological changes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Dylan", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ivy", "Last Name": "Kosater", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Khairallah", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ya", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Fujita", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Sukriti", "Last Name": "Nag", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Dec20"}, {"PMID": "38016942", "Title": "INPP5D regulates inflammasome activation in human microglia.", "Abstract": "Microglia and neuroinflammation play an important role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We associated glial, vascular and neuronal subpopulations with AD-related traits for 424 aging individuals, and aligned them along the disease cascade using causal modeling. We identified two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations, one contributed to amyloid-\u03b2 proteinopathy while the other mediated the effect of amyloid-\u03b2 in accelerating tau proteinopathy, as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediated the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the coordinated dynamics of the entire cellular environment we devised the BEYOND methodology which uncovered two distinct trajectories of brain aging that are defined by distinct sequences of changes in cellular communities. Older individuals are engaged in one of two possible trajectories, each associated with progressive changes in specific cellular communities that end with: (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain aging.

studies. Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the IHC data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted RNA-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulations can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Brain", "Computational Biology", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Organ Specificity", "Phenotype", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ellis", "Last Name": "Patrick", "Affiliation": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ayla", "Last Name": "Ergun", "Affiliation": "Research and Development, Biogen, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Bernard", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Departments of Statistics and Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Casazza", "Affiliation": "Departments of Statistics and Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Cimpean", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Christina", "Last Name": "Yung", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Gaiteri", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational & Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Mostafavi", "Affiliation": "Departments of Statistics and Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32727516", "Title": "BIN1 protein isoforms are differentially expressed in astrocytes, neurons, and microglia: neuronal and astrocyte BIN1 are implicated in tau pathology.", "Abstract": "Identified as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility gene by genome wide-association studies, BIN1 has 10 isoforms that are expressed in the Central Nervous System (CNS).

have identified an increasing number of susceptibility genes, many of which are poorly characterized and have not previously been implicated in AD. Here, we evaluated the utility of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and astrocytes as tools to systematically test AD-relevant cellular phenotypes following perturbation of candidate genes identified by genome-wide studies. Lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs was used to modulate expression of 66 genes in astrocytes and 52 genes in induced neurons. Five genes (CNN2, GBA, GSTP1, MINT2 and FERMT2) in neurons and nine genes (CNN2, ITGB1, MINT2, SORL1, VLDLR, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SCARB2) in astrocytes significantly altered extracellular amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels. Knockdown of AP3M2, CNN2, GSTP1, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SORL1 reduced interleukin-6 levels in astrocytes. Only knockdown of FERMT2 led to a reduction in the proportion of TAU that is phosphorylated. Further, CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of FERMT2 in both familial AD (fAD) and fAD-corrected human neurons validated the findings of reduced extracellular A\u03b2. Interestingly, FERMT2 reduction had no effect on the A\u03b242:40 ratio in corrected neurons and a reduction of phospho-tau, but resulted in an elevation in A\u03b242:40 ratio and no reduction in phospho-tau in fAD neurons. Taken together, this study has prioritized 15 genes as being involved in contributing to A\u03b2 accumulation, phosphorylation of tau and/or cytokine secretion, and, as illustrated with FERMT2, it sets the stage for further cell-type-specific dissection of the role of these genes in AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Astrocytes", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cell Line", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Gene Targeting", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neurons", "Phenotype", "Proteostasis", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meichen", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert V", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina N", "Last Name": "Lagomarsino", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jishu", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Cell Circuits Program, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Cell Circuits Program, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy L", "Last Name": "Young-Pearse", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2019Mar01"}, {"PMID": "29802388", "Title": "A molecular network of the aging human brain provides insights into the pathology and cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "There is a need for new therapeutic targets with which to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major contributor to aging-related cognitive decline.

The data were analyzed to investigate whether the proteins were expressed together and in relation with metabolic disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's pathology and APOE genotype. We observed a change from a positive to a negative association between the proteins and hypertension according to the dementia status. Type-2 diabetes was negatively related with the proteins among participants without dementia; whereas participants with dementia and AD pathology showed a positive association with JNK. A significant association between IKK\u03b2 and JNK in participants with dementia and AD pathology was observed, but not in those without dementia. Otherwise, weak to moderate associations were observed among the protein loads. The presence of dementia was significantly associated with JNK and negatively associated with IKK\u03b2 and IRS1. Cognitive scores showed a significant positive relationship with IKK\u03b2 and a negative with IRS1, JNK and PKR.

In this study, we demonstrate that distinct sets of nucleoporins (Nups), components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), form S-S bonds and regulate nuclear transport through the NPC. Kinetic analysis of importin \u03b2 demonstrated that the permeability of the NPC was increased by dithiothreitol treatment and reduced by oxidative stress. The permeability of small proteins such as GFP was not affected by either oxidative stress or a reducing reagent. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the oxidative stress significantly induced S-S bond formation in Nups 358, 155, 153 and 62 but not 88 and 160. The direct involvement of cysteine residues in the formation of S-S bonds was confirmed by mutating conserved cysteine residues in Nup62, which abolished the formation of S-S bonds and enhanced the permeability of the NPC. Knocking down Nup62 reduced the stress-inducible S-S bonds of Nup155, suggesting that Nup62 and Nup155 are covalently coupled via S-S bonds. From these results, we propose that the inner channel of the NPC is somehow insulated from the cytoplasm and is more sensitive than the cytoplasm to the intracellular redox state.", "Keywords": ["Disulfide bridge", "Importin \u03b2", "Nuclear pore", "Nucleocytoplasmic transport", "Oxidative stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Active Transport, Cell Nucleus", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Cysteine", "Dithiothreitol", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Mutation", "Nuclear Pore", "Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "beta Karyopherins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shige H", "Last Name": "Yoshimura", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Yoshida-konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan. yoshimura@lif.kyoto-u.ac.jp"}, {"First Name": "Shotaro", "Last Name": "Otsuka", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Masahiro", "Last Name": "Kumeta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Taga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kunio", "Last Name": "Takeyasu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of cell science", "PubDate": "2013Jul15"}]
