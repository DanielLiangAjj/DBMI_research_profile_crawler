[{"PMID": "38948777", "Title": "The Role of Alpha-Synuclein in Synucleinopathy: Impact on Lipid Regulation at Mitochondria-ER Membranes.", "Abstract": "The protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy, which includes Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and mounting evidence suggests that lipid dyshomeostasis is a critical phenotype in these neurodegenerative conditions. Previously, we identified that \u03b1Syn localizes to mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), temporary functional domains containing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, including the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we have analyzed the lipid composition of postmortem human samples, focusing on the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson's disease and controls, as well as three less affected brain regions of Parkinson's donors. To further assess synucleinopathy-related lipidome alterations, similar analyses were performed on the striatum of multiple system atrophy cases. Our data show region-and disease-specific changes in the levels of lipid species. Specifically, our data revealed alterations in the levels of specific phosphatidylserine species in brain areas most affected in Parkinson's disease. Some of these alterations, albeit to a lesser degree, are also observed multiples system atrophy. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we show that \u03b1Syn contributes to regulating phosphatidylserine metabolism at MAM domains, and that \u03b1Syn dosage parallels the perturbation in phosphatidylserine levels. Our results support the notion that \u03b1Syn pathophysiology is linked to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which may contribute to the vulnerability of specific brain regions in synucleinopathy. These findings have significant therapeutic implications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Barbuti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Guardia-Laguarta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taekyung", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zena K", "Last Name": "Chatila", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xena", "Last Name": "Flowers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bruno Fr", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Simone B", "Last Name": "Larsen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nobutaka", "Last Name": "Hattori", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ulf", "Last Name": "Dettmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saranna", "Last Name": "Fanning", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manon", "Last Name": "Vilas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hasini", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rejko", "Last Name": "Kr\u00fcger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Estela", "Last Name": "Area-Gomez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Przedborski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun17"}, {"PMID": "38947015", "Title": "Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers correlate with early pathology and alterations in neuronal and glial gene expression.", "Abstract": "Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients undergoing cortical shunting frequently show early AD pathology on cortical biopsy, which is predictive of progression to clinical AD.

The heterogeneity of AD necessitates comprehensive approaches to postmortem studies, including the representation of historically underrepresented ethnic groups. In this cohort study, we evaluated small vessel disease pathologies and \u03b1-synuclein deposits among Hispanic decedents (HD, n\u2009=\u200992) and non-Hispanic White decedents (NHWD, n\u2009=\u2009184) from three Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers: Columbia University, University of California San Diego, and University of California Davis. The study included cases with a pathological diagnosis of Intermediate/High AD based on the National Institute on Aging- Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) and/or NIA-Reagan criteria. A 2:1 random comparison sample of NHWD was frequency-balanced and matched with HD by age and sex. An expert blinded to demographics and center origin evaluated arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and Lewy bodies/Lewy neurites (LBs/LNs) with a semi-quantitative approach using established criteria. There were many similarities and a few differences among groups. HD showed more severe Vonsattel grading of CAA in the cerebellum (p\u2009=\u20090.04), higher CAA density in the posterior hippocampus and cerebellum (ps\u2009=\u20090.01), and increased LBs/LNs density in the frontal (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and temporal cortices (p\u2009=\u20090.03), as determined by Wilcoxon's test. Ordinal logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, and center confirmed these findings except for LBs/LNs in the temporal cortex. Results indicate HD with AD exhibit greater CAA and \u03b1-synuclein burdens in select neuroanatomic regions when compared to age- and sex-matched NHWD with AD. These findings aid in the generalizability of concurrent arteriolosclerosis, CAA, and LBs/LNs topography and severity within the setting of pathologically confirmed AD, particularly in persons of Hispanic descent, showing many similarities and a few differences to those of NHW descent and providing insights into precision medicine approaches.", "Keywords": ["Autopsy", "Dementia, alzheimer disease research centers", "Disparities", "Histology", "LatinX", "Latino", "Lewy pathology", "Neurodegeneration", "Vascular pathology"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Female", "Male", "Aged", "Hispanic or Latino", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "White People", "Lewy Bodies", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "alpha-Synuclein", "Brain", "Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases", "Arteriolosclerosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hsin-Pei", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebeca", "Last Name": "Scalco", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naomi", "Last Name": "Saito", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laurel", "Last Name": "Beckett", "Affiliation": "Division of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "My-Le", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily Z", "Last Name": "Huie", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence S", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "DeCarli", "Affiliation": "Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Department of Neurology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Rissman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan M", "Last Name": "Mungas", "Affiliation": "Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Department of Neurology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lee-Way", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brittany N", "Last Name": "Dugger", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA. bndugger@ucdavis.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica communications", "PubDate": "2024May24"}, {"PMID": "38659743", "Title": "Bridging the Gap: Multi-Omics Profiling of Brain Tissue in Alzheimer's Disease and Older Controls in Multi-Ethnic Populations.", "Abstract": "Multi-omics studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed many potential disease pathways and therapeutic targets.

We previously showed that ZCCHC17 protein declines in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue before there is significant gliosis and neuronal loss, that ZCCHC17 loss partially replicates observed splicing abnormalities in AD brain tissue, and that maintenance of ZCCHC17 levels is predicted to support cognitive resilience in AD. Here, we assessed the functional consequences of reduced ZCCHC17 expression in primary cortical neuronal cultures using siRNA knockdown. Consistent with its previously identified role in synaptic gene expression, loss of ZCCHC17 led to loss of synaptic protein expression. Patch recording of neurons shows that ZCCHC17 loss significantly disrupted the excitation/inhibition balance of neurotransmission, and favored excitatory-dominant synaptic activity as measured by an increase in spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents and action potential firing rate, and a decrease in spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents. These findings are consistent with the hyperexcitable phenotype seen in AD animal models and in patients.

Elderly cognitively healthy individuals with APOE\u03b54 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOE\u03b54; however, these mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOE\u03b54 carriers without dementia might carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOE\u03b54-mediated AD pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in the National\u00a0Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD\u00a0FBS), Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOE\u03b54 carriers. In homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain (COL6A2) and are known to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and in vivo functional studies. An independent analysis in a large cohort of 7185 APOE\u03b54 homozygous carriers found that rs140926439 variant in FN1 was protective of AD (OR\u2009=\u20090.29; 95% CI [0.11, 0.78], P\u2009=\u20090.014) and delayed age at onset of disease by 3.37 years (95% CI [0.42, 6.32], P\u2009=\u20090.025). The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels were increased at the BBB in APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD. Brain expression of cognitively unaffected homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers had significantly lower FN1 deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOE\u03b54 carriers with AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOE\u03b54-mediated AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b-the ortholog for human FN1. We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced gliovascular remodeling, and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting that pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance, which is ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests that vascular deposition of FN1 is related to the pathogenicity of APOE\u03b54, and LOF variants in FN1 may reduce APOE\u03b54-related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential therapeutic interventions targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Animals", "Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Fibronectins", "Genetic Variation", "Gliosis", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Prabesh", "Last Name": "Bhattarai", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamil Iniyan", "Last Name": "Gunasekaran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Belloy", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dolly", "Last Name": "Reyes-Dumeyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "D\u00f6rthe", "Last Name": "J\u00fclich", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fcseyin", "Last Name": "Tayran", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elanur", "Last Name": "Yilmaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bengisu", "Last Name": "Turgutalp", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Columbia University New York, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gauthaman", "Last Name": "Sukumar", "Affiliation": "Henry M.

Furthermore, a majority of ZCCHC17 interactors also co-IP with known tau interactors, and we find a significant overlap between alternatively spliced genes in ZCCHC17 knockdown and tau overexpression neurons. These results demonstrate ZCCHC17's role in neuronal RNA processing and its interaction with pathology and cognitive resilience in AD, and suggest that the maintenance of ZCCHC17 function may be a therapeutic strategy for preserving cognitive function in the setting of AD pathology.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's", "ZCCHC17", "iPSC", "neurons", "synaptic"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Humans",

We identified the meninges as an important site of antigen presentation and CD8 T cell activation and clonal expansion and found that T cell activation in the meninges is a requirement for infiltration into the CNS. We further found that natural killer cells have the potential to negatively regulate T cell activation locally in the meninges through direct killing and are one of many regulatory mechanisms that work to control excessive neuroinflammation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Hobson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel H S", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Delaney", "Last Name": "Flaherty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harrison", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Ciener", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hasini", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chitra", "Last Name": "Singal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Shneider", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Jul14"}, {"PMID": "37429840", "Title": "Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) induces neurogenic plasticity by suppressing reactive astroglial Lcn2/Slc22a17 signaling in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Neurogenesis, crucial for brain resilience, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that induces astroglial reactivity at the expense of the pro-neurogenic potential, and restoring neurogenesis could counteract neurodegenerative pathology. However, the molecular mechanisms promoting pro-neurogenic astroglial fate despite AD pathology are unknown. In this study, we used APP/PS1dE9 mouse model and induced Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) expression in the hippocampus. Ngfr, which promotes neurogenic fate of astroglia during the amyloid pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish brain, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcomes. Histological analyses of the changes in proliferation and neurogenesis, single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies showed that the induced expression of Ngfr reduced the reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), which we found was sufficient to reduce neurogenesis in astroglia. Anti-neurogenic effects of Lcn2 was mediated by Slc22a17, blockage of which recapitulated the pro-neurogenicity by Ngfr. Long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Postmortem human AD hippocampi and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with reactive gliosis and reduced neurogenesis. Comparing transcriptional changes in mouse, zebrafish, and human AD brains for cell intrinsic differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression networks revealed common altered downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, such as PFKP, which can enhance proliferation and neurogenesis in vitro when blocked. Our study suggests that the reactive non-neurogenic astroglia in AD can be coaxed to a pro-neurogenic fate and AD pathology can be alleviated with Ngfr.

Most autopsy-based studies have focused on cohorts of non-Hispanic White decedents (NHWD), with few studies including Hispanic decedents (HD). We aimed to characterize the neuropathologic landscape of AD in NHWD (n\u2009=\u2009185) and HD (n\u2009=\u200992) evaluated in research programs across three institutions: University of California San Diego, University of California Davis, and Columbia University. Only persons with a neuropathologic diagnosis of intermediate/high AD determined by NIA Reagan and/or NIA-AA criteria were included. A frequency-balanced random sample without replacement was drawn from the NHWD group using a 2:1 age and sex matching scheme with HD. Four brain areas were evaluated: posterior hippocampus, frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Sections were stained with antibodies against A\u03b2 (4G8) and phosphorylated tau (AT8). We compared the distribution and semi-quantitative densities for neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuropil threads, core, diffuse, and neuritic plaques. All evaluations were conducted by an expert blinded to demographics and group status. Wilcoxon's two-sample test revealed higher levels of neuritic plaques in the frontal cortex (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and neuropil threads (p\u2009=\u20090.02) in HD, and higher levels of cored plaques in the temporal cortex in NHWD (p\u2009=\u20090.02). Results from ordinal logistic regression controlling for age, sex, and site of origin were similar. In other evaluated brain regions, semi-quantitative scores of plaques, tangles, and threads did not differ statistically between groups.

We distributed this survey to 40 brain banks and obtained a response rate of 95% (38 / 40). Most brain banks followed guidelines defined by the NIA-AA, having H&E staining in all recommended regions and targeted region-based amyloid beta, tau, and alpha-synuclein immunohistochemical staining.

Here, we investigate the function of ZCCHC17 and its role in AD pathogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation of ZCCHC17 followed by mass spectrometry analysis in human iPSC-derived neurons reveals that ZCCHC17's binding partners are enriched for RNA splicing proteins. ZCCHC17 knockdown results in widespread RNA splicing changes that significantly overlap with splicing changes found in AD brain tissue, with synaptic genes commonly affected. ZCCHC17 expression correlates with cognitive resilience in AD patients, and we uncover an APOE4 dependent negative correlation of ZCCHC17 expression with tangle burden. Furthermore, a majority of ZCCHC17 interactors also co-IP with known tau interactors, and we find significant overlap between alternatively spliced genes in ZCCHC17 knockdown and tau overexpression neurons. These results demonstrate ZCCHC17's role in neuronal RNA processing and its interaction with pathology and cognitive resilience in AD, and suggest that maintenance of ZCCHC17 function may be a therapeutic strategy for preserving cognitive function in the setting of AD pathology.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s", "ZCCHC17", "iPSC", "neurons", "synaptic"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anne Marie W", "Last Name": "Bartosch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Elliot H H", "Last Name": "Youth", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shania", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232."}, {"First Name": "Maria E", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Harrison", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "So Yeon", "Last Name": "Koo", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Archana", "Last Name": "Ashok", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sharanya", "Last Name": "Sivakumar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh K", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Logan C", "Last Name": "Dumitrescu", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany G", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ali S", "Last Name": "Ropri", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Annie J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612."}, {"First Name": "Tracy L", "Last Name": "Young-Pearse", "Affiliation": "Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115;

The suggested neuropathologic staging system and nomenclature have proven useful for autopsy practice and dementia research. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as cases with unusual features that do not fit with current diagnostic categories. The goal of this report is to update the neuropathologic criteria for the diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC, based primarily on published data. We provide practical suggestions about how to integrate available genetic information and comorbid pathologies [e.g., Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and Lewy body disease]. We also describe recent research findings that have enabled more precise guidance on how to differentiate LATE-NC from other subtypes of TDP-43 pathology [e.g., frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)], and how to render diagnoses in unusual situations in which TDP-43 pathology does not follow the staging scheme proposed in 2019. Specific recommendations are also made on when not to apply this diagnostic term based on current knowledge. Neuroanatomical regions of interest in LATE-NC are described in detail and the implications for TDP-43 immunohistochemical results are specified more precisely. We also highlight questions that remain unresolved and areas needing additional study. In summary, the current work lays out a number of recommendations to improve the precision of LATE-NC staging based on published reports and diagnostic experience.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Dementia",

"Epitranscriptomic regulation adds a layer of post-transcriptional control to brain function during development and adulthood. The identification of RNA-modifying enzymes has opened the possibility of investigating the role epitranscriptomic changes play in the disease process. NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 (NSun2) is one of the few known brain-enriched methyltransferases able to methylate mammalian non-coding RNAs. NSun2 loss of function due to autosomal-recessive mutations has been associated with neurological abnormalities in humans. Here, we show NSun2 is expressed in adult human neurons in the hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex. Strikingly, we unravel decreased NSun2 protein expression and an increased ratio of pTau/NSun2 in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as demonstrated by Western blotting and immunostaining, respectively. In a well-established Drosophila melanogaster model of tau-induced toxicity, reduction of NSun2 exacerbated tau toxicity, while overexpression of NSun2 partially abrogated the toxic effects. Conditional ablation of NSun2 in the mouse brain promoted a decrease in the miR-125b m6A levels and tau hyperphosphorylation. Utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal cultures, we confirmed NSun2 deficiency results in tau hyperphosphorylation. We also found that neuronal NSun2 levels decrease in response to amyloid-beta oligomers (A\u03b2O). Notably, A\u03b2O-induced tau phosphorylation and cell toxicity in human neurons could be rescued by overexpression of NSun2. Altogether, these results indicate that neuronal NSun2 deficiency promotes dysregulation of miR-125b and tau phosphorylation in AD and highlights a novel avenue for therapeutic targeting.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Methylation", "MicroRNA", "NSun2", "Neurodegeneration", "Tau phosphorylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Humans", "Adult", "Methyltransferases", "Phosphorylation", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Alzheimer Disease", "MicroRNAs", "tau Proteins", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yoon A", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tohid", "Last Name": "Siddiqui", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Blaze", "Affiliation": "Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mehmet Ilyas", "Last Name": "Cosacak", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Helmholtz Association, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tristan", "Last Name": "Winters", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Atul", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellen", "Last Name": "Tein", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Bartolini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Schahram", "Last Name": "Akbarian", "Affiliation": "Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caghan", "Last Name": "Kizil", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Hargus", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA. gh2374@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Ismael", "Last Name": "Santa-Maria", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, USA. is2395@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica", "PubDate": "2023Jan"}, {"PMID": "35306760", "Title": "Correlation of plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Blood-based phosphorylated tau (Ptau) 181 and 217 biomarkers are sensitive and specific for Alzheimer's disease.

This represents an opportunity to study early AD pathology in living patients. Here we report RNA-seq data on 106 cortical biopsies from this patient population. A restricted set of genes correlate with AD pathology in these biopsies, and co-expression network analysis demonstrates an evolution from microglial homeostasis to a disease-associated microglial phenotype in conjunction with increasing AD pathologic burden, along with a subset of additional astrocytic and neuronal genes that accompany these changes. Further analysis demonstrates that these correlations are driven by patients that report mild cognitive symptoms, despite similar levels of biopsy \u03b2-amyloid and tau pathology in comparison to patients who report no cognitive symptoms.

A large body of pre-clinical work has paved the way for the gradual clinical implementation of FUS-induced BBB opening. Even though the safety profile of FUS treatments in rodents has been extensively studied, the histological and behavioral effects of clinically relevant BBB opening in large animals are relatively understudied. Here, we examine the histological and behavioral safety profile following localized BBB opening in non-human primates (NHPs), using a neuronavigation-guided clinical system prototype. We show that FUS treatment triggers a short-lived immune response within the targeted region without exacerbating the touch accuracy or reaction time in visual-motor cognitive tasks. Our experiments were designed using a multiple-case-study approach, in order to maximize the acquired data and support translation of the FUS system into human studies. Four NHPs underwent a single session of FUS-mediated BBB opening in the prefrontal cortex. Two NHPs were treated bilaterally at different pressures, sacrificed on day 2 and 18 post-FUS, respectively, and their brains were histologically processed. In separate experiments, two NHPs that were earlier trained in a behavioral task were exposed to FUS unilaterally, and their performance was tracked for at least 3\u00a0weeks after BBB opening. An increased microglia density around blood vessels was detected on day 2, but was resolved by day 18. We also detected signs of enhanced immature neuron presence within areas that underwent BBB opening, compared to regions with an intact BBB, confirming previous rodent studies. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NHP cognitive performance did not deteriorate following BBB opening. These preliminary results demonstrate that neuronavigation-guided FUS with a single-element transducer is a non-invasive method capable of reversibly opening the BBB, without substantial histological or behavioral impact in an animal model closely resembling humans. Future work should confirm the observations of this multiple-case-study work across animals, species and tasks.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Biological Transport", "Biomarkers", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Cognition", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Microbubbles", "Models, Animal", "Neuronavigation", "Primates", "Quantitative Trait, Heritable", "Ultrasonic Waves"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Antonios N", "Last Name": "Pouliopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York City, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nancy", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York City, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Greg", "Last Name": "Jensen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York City, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Meaney", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

We present the clinical, neuropathological and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical centre. The mean age was 74\u2009years (38-97\u2009years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Hospital-associated complications were common, including eight patients (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, seven (17%) with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24\u2009h of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4\u2009weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischaemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared haemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, although none showed evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen patients (44%) exhibited pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, which was not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. The PCR analysis revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in the nasal epithelia. RNAscope\u00ae and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in coronavirus disease 2019 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but more likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischaemia. Further studies are needed to define whether these pathologies, if present in patients who survive coronavirus disease 2019, might contribute to chronic neurological problems.", "Keywords":

A chest radiograph revealed hazy bilateral opacities; and real-time-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on the nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Computed tomography of the head showed a large right cerebellar hemorrhage, with tonsillar herniation and intraventricular hemorrhage. One day after presentation, he was transitioned to comfort care and died shortly after palliative extubation. Autopsy performed 3\u00a0h after death showed cerebellar hemorrhage and acute infarcts in the dorsal pons and medulla.

first step of protein synthesis and have increasingly been studied for their nuclear and extra-cellular ex-translational activities. Human genetic conditions such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth have been attributed to dominant gain-of-function mutations in some tRNA synthetases. Unlike dominantly inherited gain-of-function mutations, recessive loss-of-function mutations can potentially elucidate ex-translational activities. We present here five individuals from four families with a multi-system disease associated with bi-allelic mutations in FARSB that encodes the beta chain of the alpha2beta2 phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase (FARS). Collectively, the mutant alleles encompass a 5'-splice junction non-coding variant (SJV) and six missense variants, one of which is shared by unrelated individuals. The clinical condition is characterized by interstitial lung disease, cerebral aneurysms and brain calcifications, and cirrhosis. For the SJV, we confirmed exon skipping leading to a frameshift associated with noncatalytic activity. While the bi-allelic combination of the SJV with a p.Arg305Gln missense mutation in two individuals led to severe disease, cells from neither the asymptomatic heterozygous carriers nor the compound heterozygous affected individual had any defect in protein synthesis. These results support a disease mechanism independent of tRNA synthetase activities in protein translation and suggest that this FARS activity is essential for normal function in multiple organs.", "Keywords": ["bi-allelic mutation", "cerebral calcifications", "cholesterol pneumonitis", "exome sequencing", "interstitial lung disease", "missense mutation", "multi-system disease", "non-canonical function", "non-coding variant", "tRNA synthetase"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Alleles", "Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Genes, Recessive", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Infant", "Lung Diseases", "Male", "Mutation", "Protein Biosynthesis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhiwen", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "IAS HKUST - Scripps R&D Laboratory, Institute for Advanced Study, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China;

contribute to the subtle amnesic changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by causing synaptic dysfunction. Here, we examined the time course of synaptic changes in mouse hippocampal neurons following exposure to A\u03b242 at picomolar concentrations, mimicking its physiological levels in the brain. We found opposite effects of the peptide with short exposures in the range of minutes enhancing synaptic plasticity, and longer exposures lasting several hours reducing it. The plasticity reduction was concomitant with an increase in the basal frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release, a higher basal number of functional presynaptic release sites, and a redistribution of synaptic proteins including the vesicle-associated proteins synapsin I, synaptophysin, and the post-synaptic glutamate receptor I. These synaptic alterations were mediated by cytoskeletal changes involving actin polymerization and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These in vitro findings were confirmed in vivo with short hippocampal infusions of picomolar A\u03b2 enhancing contextual memory and prolonged infusions impairing it. Our findings provide a model for initiation of synaptic dysfunction whereby exposure to physiologic levels of A\u03b2 for a prolonged period of time causes microstructural changes at the synapse which

Previous data showed a compelling efficacy of calpain inhibition against abnormal synaptic plasticity and memory produced by the excess of amyloid-\u03b2, a distinctive marker of the disease. Moreover, a beneficial effect of calpain inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease is predictable by the occurrence of calpain hyperactivation leading to impairment of memory-related pathways following abnormal calcium influxes that might ensue independently of amyloid-\u03b2 elevation. However, molecules currently available as effective calpain inhibitors lack adequate selectivity. This work is aimed at characterizing the efficacy of a novel class of epoxide-based inhibitors, synthesized to display improved selectivity and potency towards calpain 1 compared to the prototype epoxide-based generic calpain inhibitor E64.

Stress kinases are of special interest in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders due to their involvement in synaptic dysfunction and complex disease susceptibility. Clinical and preclinical evidence implicates the stress related kinase p38\u03b1MAPK as a potential neurotherapeutic target, but isoform selective p38\u03b1MAPK inhibitor candidates are lacking and the mixed kinase inhibitor drugs that are promising in peripheral tissue disease indications have limitations for neurologic indications. Therefore, pursuit of the neurotherapeutic hypothesis requires kinase isoform selective inhibitors with appropriate neuropharmacology features. Synaptic dysfunction disorders offer a potential for enhanced pharmacological efficacy due to stress-induced activation of p38\u03b1MAPK in both neurons and glia, the interacting cellular components of the synaptic pathophysiological axis, to be modulated. We report a novel isoform selective p38\u03b1MAPK inhibitor, MW01-18-150SRM (=MW150), that is efficacious in suppression of hippocampal-dependent associative and spatial memory deficits in two distinct synaptic dysfunction mouse models. A synthetic scheme for biocompatible product and positive outcomes from pharmacological screens are presented. The high-resolution crystallographic structure of the p38\u03b1MAPK/MW150 complex documents active site binding, reveals a potential low energy conformation of the bound inhibitor, and suggests a structural explanation for MW150's exquisite target selectivity.

Motivated by this reality, many laboratories (including our own) have focused on synaptic dysfunction in AD because synaptic changes are highly correlated with the severity of clinical dementia. In particular, memory formation is accompanied by altered synaptic strength, and this phenomenon (and its dysfunction in AD) has been a recent focus for many laboratories. The molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) is at a central converging point of pathways and mechanisms activated during the processes of synaptic strengthening and memory formation, as CREB phosphorylation leads to transcription of memory-associated genes. Disruption of these mechanisms in AD results in a reduction of CREB activation with accompanying memory impairment. Thus, it is likely that strategies aimed at these mechanisms will lead to future therapies for AD. In this review, we will summarize literature that investigates 5 possible therapeutic pathways for rescuing synaptic dysfunction in AD: 4 enzymatic pathways that lead to CREB phosphorylation (the cyclic adenosine monophosphate cascade, the serine/threonine kinases extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2, the nitric oxide cascade, and the calpains), as well as histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (2 enzymes that regulate the histone acetylation necessary for gene transcription).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Humans", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Teich", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Russell E", "Last Name": "Nicholls", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniela", "Last Name": "Puzzo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jole", "Last Name": "Fiorito", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosa", "Last Name": "Purgatorio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mauro", "Last Name": "Fa'", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics", "PubDate": "2015Jan"}, {"PMID": "25497947", "Title": "Resolution of urticarial vasculitis after treatment of neurocysticercosis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Albendazole", "Anthelmintics", "Humans", "Male", "Neurocysticercosis", "Remission Induction", "Urticaria", "Vasculitis", "Vasculitis, Leukocytoclastic, Cutaneous"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheila", "Last Name": "Shaigany", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Dermatology Consultation Service, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.

Alterations in membrane trafficking induced by Abeta oligomers mediates reduction in neuronal surface receptor expression that is the basis for inhibition of electrophysiological measures of synaptic plasticity and thus learning and memory. We have utilized phenotypic screens in mature, in vitro cultures of rat brain cells to identify small molecules which block or prevent the binding and effects of Abeta oligomers. Synthetic Abeta oligomers bind saturably to a single site on neuronal synapses and induce deficits in membrane trafficking in neuronal cultures with an EC50 that corresponds to its binding affinity. The therapeutic lead compounds we have found are pharmacological antagonists of Abeta oligomers, reducing the binding of Abeta oligomers to neurons in vitro, preventing spine loss in neurons and preventing and treating oligomer-induced deficits in membrane trafficking. These molecules are highly brain penetrant and prevent and restore cognitive deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Counter-screening these compounds against a broad panel of potential CNS targets revealed they are highly potent and specific ligands of the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor. Brain concentrations of the compounds corresponding to greater than 80% receptor occupancy at the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor restore cognitive function in transgenic hAPP Swe/Ldn mice. These studies demonstrate that synthetic and human-derived Abeta oligomers act as pharmacologically-behaved ligands at neuronal receptors--i.e. they exhibit saturable binding to a target, they exert a functional effect related to their binding and their displacement by small molecule antagonists blocks their functional effect. The first-in-class small molecule receptor antagonists described here restore memory to normal in multiple AD models and sustain improvement long-term, representing a novel mechanism of action for

Comparisons with the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that the samples from CE regions resembled the proneural, classical, or mesenchymal subtypes of GBM, whereas the samples from the NE regions predominantly resembled the neural subtype. Computational deconvolution of the RNA-seq data revealed that contributions from nonneoplastic brain cells significantly influence the expression pattern in the NE samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that the cell type-specific expression patterns were functionally distinct and highly enriched in genes associated with the corresponding cell phenotypes. Comparing the RNA-seq data from the GBM samples to that of nonneoplastic brain revealed that the differentially expressed genes are distributed across multiple cell types. Notably, the patterns of cell type-specific alterations varied between the different GBM subtypes: the NE regions of proneural tumors were enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor genes, whereas the NE regions of mesenchymal GBM were enriched in astrocytic and microglial genes.
