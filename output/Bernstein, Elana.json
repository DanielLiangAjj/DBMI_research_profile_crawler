The prevalence of PAH varies among the different CTDs, with systemic sclerosis (SSc) having the highest at 8%-12%. The most recent European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society\u00a0guidelines recommend routine annual screening for PAH in SSc and CTDs with SSc features. As CTDs can be associated with a myriad of presentations of pulmonary hypertension, a thorough evaluation to include a right heart catheterization to clearly delineate the hemodynamic profile is essential in developing an appropriate treatment plan. Treatment strategies will depend on the predominant phenotype of pulmonary vasculopathy. In general, management approach to CTD-PAH mirrors that of idiopathic PAH. Despite this, outcomes of CTD-PAH are inferior to those of idiopathic PAH, with those of SSc-PAH being particularly poor. Reasons for this may include extrapulmonary manifestations of CTDs, including renal disease and gastrointestinal involvement, concurrent interstitial lung disease, and differences in the innate response of the right ventricle to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Early referral for lung transplant evaluation of patients with CTD-PAH, particularly SSc-PAH, is recommended. It is hoped that in the near future, additional therapies may be added to the armamentarium of effective treatments for CTD-PAH. Ultimately, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CTD-PAH will be required to develop targeted therapies for this morbid condition.", "Keywords": ["connective tissue disease", "pulmonary arterial hypertension", "pulmonary hypertension", "scleroderma", "systemic lupus erythematosus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vikramjit", "Last Name": "Khangoora", "Affiliation": "Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program Inova Fairfax Hospital Falls Church Virginia USA."}, {"First Name": "Elana J", "Last Name": "Bernstein", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons Columbia University Irving Medical Center New York New York USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher S", "Last Name": "King", "Affiliation": "Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program Inova Fairfax Hospital Falls Church Virginia USA."}, {"First Name": "Oksana A", "Last Name": "Shlobin", "Affiliation": "Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program Inova Fairfax Hospital Falls Church Virginia USA."}], "Journal": "Pulmonary circulation", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "37689630", "Title": "Impact of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease on healthcare use: association between fvc decline and inpatient hospitalization.", "Abstract": "Many types of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) may transition to progressive chronic-fibrosing ILDs with rapid lung function decline and a negative survival prognosis.

ICF Core Sets and ICF Checklists are streamlined disease-specific resources for clinical use, service provision, and for use in health economics and health policy. ICF can disclose strengths and weaknesses across multiple patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and help consolidate best-fitting question-items from multiple PROMs. Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), are generally progressive, with restrictive physiology sometimes occurring in the context of multi-organ autoimmunity/inflammatory conditions such as connective tissue diseases (CTDs). In spite of significant associated morbidity and potential disability, ILD has yet to be linked to the ICF. Methods: Each instrument and their question-items within the consensus-recommended core sets for clinical trials in ILD were deconstructed to single concept units, and then linked per updated ICF linkage rules. Inter-linker agreement was established. Three additional subsequently validated measures were also included. Results: One-hundred-eleven ICF categories were identified for ten PROMs and three traditional objective measures that were amenable to ICF linkage. The proportion of agreement ranged from 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.91) to 0.93 (0.76, 0.99) with the overall proportion of inter-linker agreement being very high 0.86 (0.82, 0.89) for the initial instruments, with 94-100% for the three additional PROMs. Thirty-four new 'Personal Factors' emerged to capture disease-specific qualities not elsewhere described in ICF, e.g. 'pf_embarrassed by cough' or 'pf_panic/afraid when can't get a breath'. Conclusion: This first known effort in ICF linkage of ILD has provided important revelations on the current utility of the ICF in lung disease. Results have indicated areas for meaningful assessment of ICF descriptors for lung impairment. The mapping across PROMs provides insight into possibilities of developing more streamline and precise instrumentation. Finally, familiarity with the ICF in ILD may enable clinicians to experience a smoother transition with the imminent harmonization of ICD and ICF, ICD-11.", "Keywords": ["CTD-ILD", "ICD-11",

"Rheumatologic diseases are characterised by loss of immune tolerance, resulting in systemic inflammation. Inflammation and scarring of the endocardium, which lines the inner surface of the heart chambers and valves, can result in valvular thickening and dysfunction. Estimates of prevalence vary depending on the sensitivity of the screening methodology used and range from 30%-50% in systemic lupus and rheumatoid arthritis to 10%-30% in ankylosing spondylitis. Progression of valve disease is a slow process but can result in haemodynamically significant complications. Thromboembolic complications such as cerebrovascular occlusions pose a serious risk of morbidity. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies increases the risk of valvular disease and thrombotic complications. Anticoagulation is recommended in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, but the guidance on the role of immunosuppressive therapy to treat valvular disease is lacking. Surgical valve therapy may be considered in severe disease, but there is increased risk in patients with an autoimmune disease which includes a higher risk of infection, thromboembolic and bleeding complications, as well as cardiovascular events in the setting of premature atherosclerotic heart disease. Therefore, management should be provided in a multidisciplinary team that includes a rheumatologist, a cardiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon; medical therapy should be optimised before considering a high-risk valve surgery.", "Keywords": ["Heart Valve Diseases"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Heart Valve Diseases", "Autoimmune Diseases", "Thrombosis", "Antibodies,

Their association with the development and progression of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) in humans is unknown. Objectives: We evaluated the associations of blood monocyte count, and other immune cell types, with ILA, high-attenuation areas, and FVC in four independent cohorts. Methods: We included participants with measured monocyte counts and computed tomographic (CT) imaging enrolled in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, n\u2009=\u2009484), AGES-Reykjavik (Age/Gene Environment Susceptibility Study, n\u2009=\u20093,547), COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD, n\u2009=\u20092,719), and the ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points, n\u2009=\u2009646). Measurements and Main Results: After adjustment for covariates, a 1-SD increment in blood monocyte count was associated with ILA in MESA (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.8), AGES-Reykjavik (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), COPDGene (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4), and ECLIPSE (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4). A higher monocyte count was associated with ILA progression over 5 years in AGES-Reykjavik (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3). Compared with participants without ILA, there was a higher percentage of activated monocytes among those with ILA in MESA. Higher monocyte count was associated with greater high-attenuation areas in MESA and lower FVC in MESA and COPDGene. Associations of other immune cell types were less consistent.

improving the practice of diagnostic and preventive strategies in SSc.", "Abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc), the most lethal of rheumatologic conditions, is the cause of death in >50% of SSc cases, led by pulmonary fibrosis followed by pulmonary hypertension and then scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). Multiple other preventable and treatable SSc-related vascular, cardiac, gastrointestinal, nutritional and musculoskeletal complications can lead to disability and death. Vascular injury with subsequent inflammation transforming to irreversible fibrosis and permanent damage characterizes SSc. Organ involvement is often present early in the disease course of SSc, but requires careful history-taking and vigilance in screening to detect. Inflammation is potentially reversible provided that treatment intensity quells inflammation and other immune mechanisms. In any SSc phenotype, opportunities for early treatment are prone to be under-utilized, especially in slowly progressive phenotypes that, in contrast to severe progressive ILD, indolently accrue irreversible organ damage resulting in later-stage life-limiting complications such as pulmonary hypertension, cardiac involvement, and malnutrition. A single SSc patient visit often requires much more physician and staff time, organization, vigilance, and direct management for multiple organ systems compared to other rheumatic or pulmonary diseases. Efficiency and efficacy of comprehensive SSc care enlists trending of symptoms and bio-data. Financial sustainability of SSc care benefits from understanding insurance reimbursement and health system allocation policies for complex patients. Sharing care between recognised SSc centers and local cardiology/pulmonary/rheumatology/gastroenterology colleagues may prevent complications and poor outcomes, while providing support to local specialists. As scleroderma specialists, we offer a practical framework with tools to facilitate an optimal, comprehensive and sustainable approach to SSc care. Improved health outcomes in SSc relies upon recogntion, management and, to the extent possible, prevention of SSc and treatment-related complications.", "Keywords": ["Disability", "Interstitial lung disease", "Pulmonary fibrosis", "Pulmonary hypertension", "Quality of life", "Renal crisis", "Scleroderma", "Symptom burden", "Systemic sclerosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Lung", "Lung Diseases, Interstitial", "Patient Care", "Scleroderma, Systemic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lesley Ann", "Last Name": "Saketkoo", "Affiliation": "New Orleans Scleroderma and Sarcoidosis Patient Care and Research Center, New Orleans, USA; Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, USA; Louisiana State University School of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary Medicine, New Orleans, USA; University Medical Center - Comprehensive Pulmonary Hypertension Center and Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic Programs, New Orleans, USA.

Two drugs are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and indicated for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with SSc-associated ILD (SSc-ILD): nintedanib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and tocilizumab (the first biologic agent targeting the interleukin-6 pathway in SSc). In addition, 2 generic drugs with cytotoxic and immunoregulatory activity, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide, have shown comparable efficacy in a phase II trial but are not FDA-approved for SSc-ILD. In light of the heterogeneity of the disease, the optimal therapeutic strategy for the management of SSc-ILD is still to be determined. The objectives of this review are 2-fold: 1) review the body of research focused on the diagnosis and treatment of SSc-ILD; and 2) propose a practical approach for diagnosis, stratification, management, and therapeutic decision-making in this clinical context. This review presents a practical classification of SSc patients in terms of disease severity (subclinical versus clinical ILD) and associated risk of progression (low versus high risk).

Whether circulating coagulation cascade factors are linked to lung inflammation and scarring among community-dwelling adults is unknown. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that higher baseline D-dimer concentrations are associated with markers of early lung injury and scarring. Methods: Using the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort (n = 6,814), we examined associations of baseline D-dimer concentrations with high attenuation areas from examination 1 (2000-2002; n = 6,184) and interstitial lung abnormalities from examination 5 computed tomographic (CT) scans (2010-2012; n = 2,227), and serum MMP-7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7) and SP-A (surfactant protein-A) from examination 1 (n = 1,098). We examined longitudinal change in forced vital capacity (FVC) from examinations 3-6 (2004-2018, n = 3,562). We used linear logistic regression and linear mixed models to examine associations and adjust for potential confounders. Results: The mean (standard deviation) age of the cohort was 62 (10) years, and the D-dimer concentration was 0.35 (0.69) ug/ml. For every 10% increase in D-dimer concentration, there was an increase in high attenuation area percentage of 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.47) after adjustment for covariates. Associations were stronger among those older than 65 years (P values for interaction < 0.001). A 10% increase in D-dimer concentration was associated with an odds ratio of 1.05 for interstitial lung abnormalities (95% CI, 0.99-1.11). Higher D-dimer concentrations were associated with higher serum MMP-7 and a faster decline in FVC. D-dimer was not associated with SP-A. Conclusions: Higher D-dimer concentrations were associated with a greater burden of lung parenchymal abnormalities detected on CT scan, MMP-7, and FVC decline among community-dwelling adults.", "Keywords": ["D-dimer", "coagulation cascade", "interstitial lung disease", "lung function", "smoking"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Biomarkers", "Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products", "Humans", "Lung", "Lung Diseases, Interstitial", "Lung Injury", "Middle Aged", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Vital Capacity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Michaela R", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Elana J", "Last Name": "Bernstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Oelsner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Ganesh", "Last Name": "Raghu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Imre", "Last Name": "Noth", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Michael Y", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Salvatore", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, and."}, {"First Name": "John H M", "Last Name": "Austin", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, and."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "Departments of Radiology, Medicine, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa; and."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Anna J", "Last Name": "Podolanczuk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}], "Journal": "Annals of the American Thoracic Society", "PubDate": "2021Nov"}, {"PMID": "33831046", "Title": "What about tocilizumab?

healthcare crises and strained health resources. As the population of patients recovering from COVID-19 grows, it is paramount to establish an understanding of the healthcare issues surrounding them. COVID-19 is now recognized as a multi-organ disease with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Similarly to post-acute viral syndromes described in survivors of other virulent coronavirus epidemics, there are increasing reports of persistent and prolonged effects after acute COVID-19. Patient advocacy groups, many members of which identify themselves as long haulers, have helped contribute to the recognition of post-acute COVID-19, a syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond 4\u2009weeks from the onset of symptoms. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on post-acute COVID-19, its pathophysiology and its organ-specific sequelae.

We examined HLA associations in SSc and its autoantibody subsets in a large, newly recruited African American (AA) cohort and among European Americans (EA). In the AA population, the African ancestry-predominant HLA-DRB1*08:04 and HLA-DRB1*11:02 alleles were associated with overall SSc risk, and the HLA-DRB1*08:04 allele was strongly associated with the severe antifibrillarin (AFA) antibody subset of SSc (odds ratio = 7.4). These African ancestry-predominant alleles may help explain the increased frequency and severity of SSc among the AA population. In the EA population, the HLA-DPB1*13:01 and HLA-DRB1*07:01 alleles were more strongly associated with antitopoisomerase (ATA) and anticentromere antibody-positive subsets of SSc, respectively, than with overall SSc risk, emphasizing the importance of HLA in defining autoantibody subtypes. The association of the HLA-DPB1*13:01 allele with the ATA+ subset of SSc in both AA and EA patients demonstrated a transancestry effect. A direct correlation between SSc prevalence and HLA-DPB1*13:01 allele frequency in multiple populations was observed (r = 0.98, P = 3 \u00d7 10-6). Conditional analysis in the autoantibody subsets of SSc revealed several associated amino acid residues, mostly in the peptide-binding groove of the class II HLA molecules. Using HLA \u03b1/\u03b2 allelic heterodimers, we bioinformatically predicted immunodominant peptides of topoisomerase 1, fibrillarin, and centromere protein A and discovered that they are homologous to viral protein sequences from the Mimiviridae and Phycodnaviridae families. Taken together, these data suggest a possible link between HLA alleles, autoantibodies, and environmental triggers in the pathogenesis of SSc.", "Keywords": ["HLA", "autoantibodies", "mimivirus", "molecular mimicry", "scleroderma"], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American", "Alleles", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Antigens, Viral", "Autoantibodies", "Autoantigens", "Computational Biology", "Datasets as Topic", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Male", "Mimiviridae", "Molecular Mimicry", "Phycodnaviridae", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Risk Assessment", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pravitt", "Last Name": "Gourh", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; dan.kastner@nih.gov pravitt.gourh@nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "Sarah A", "Last Name": "Safran", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Theresa", "Last Name": "Alexander", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Steven E", "Last Name": "Boyden", "Affiliation": "Inflammatory Disease Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Nadia D", "Last Name": "Morgan", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224."}, {"First Name": "Ami A", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224."}, {"First Name": "Maureen D", "Last Name": "Mayes", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunogenetics, University of Texas McGovern Medical School, Houston, TX 77030."}, {"First Name": "Ayo", "Last Name": "Doumatey", "Affiliation": "Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Amy R", "Last Name": "Bentley", "Affiliation": "Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Shriner", "Affiliation": "Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Robyn T", "Last Name": "Domsic", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology & Clinical Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261."}, {"First Name": "Thomas A", "Last Name": "Medsger", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology & Clinical Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261."}, {"First Name": "Paula S", "Last Name": "Ramos", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425."}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Silver", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425."}, {"First Name": "Virginia D", "Last Name": "Steen", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC 20007."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Varga", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611."}, {"First Name": "Vivien", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08903."}, {"First Name": "Lesley Ann", "Last Name": "Saketkoo", "Affiliation": "Scleroderma Patient Care and Research Center, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70112."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Schiopu", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109."}, {"First Name": "Dinesh", "Last Name": "Khanna", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109."}, {"First Name": "Jessica K", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Rheumatology, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY 10021."}, {"First Name": "Brynn", "Last Name": "Kron", "Affiliation": "Rosalind Russell/Ephraim P.

The data collection methodology incorporates successful models from other SSc registries. The cohort is designed to provide linked bio-specimen and clinical outcomes data on a longitudinal cohort of SSc patients for validation of hypothesis-driven research and to provide a platform for studying patient-reported outcomes in scleroderma. The CONQUER registry was developed using the guidelines of the International Society for Biological Repositories, and was an iterative process between physicians with an expertise in SSc, patient stakeholders, and information technology experts. Enrollment commenced in June 2018. During the first 6\u00a0months of the CONQUER Scleroderma study, 151 SSc patients with less than 5\u00a0years of disease duration (from first non-Raynaud's symptom) have been recruited. The mean age is 51\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u00a0years, 83% are female, and 60% of patients have diffuse disease. Survey completion rates are above 88% for all patient-reported outcome surveys. Bio-specimen collection rates are over 97%, and disease severity score completion rates are over 98%. Pulmonary function test data is available on 91% of patients, and echocardiography is available 80%. The CONQUER scleroderma study provides a unique and growing resource for studying scleroderma in a longitudinal, US-based population.

These include groups working on arthritis, disease damage, disease activity, cardiac disease, juvenile SSc, the gastrointestinal tract, vascular component, calcinosis, scleroderma renal crisis, interstitial lung disease, and skin measurement. Members of the SCTC may join any one or more of these groups. Some of the WGs have only recently started their work, some are nearing completion of their mandated tasks and others are in the midst of their projects. All these projects, which are described in this paper, will help to improve clinical trials and observational studies by improving or developing better, more sensitive ways of measuring various aspects of the disease.
