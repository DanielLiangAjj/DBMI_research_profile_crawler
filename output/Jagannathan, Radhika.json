[{"PMID": "36867706", "Title": "CREB3L2-ATF4 heterodimerization defines a transcriptional hub of Alzheimer's disease gene expression linked to neuropathology.", "Abstract": "Gene expression is changed by disease, but how these molecular responses arise and contribute to pathophysiology remains less understood. We discover that \u03b2-amyloid, a trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD), promotes the formation of pathological CREB3L2-ATF4 transcription factor heterodimers in neurons. Through a multilevel approach based on AD datasets and a novel chemogenetic method that resolves the genomic binding profile of dimeric transcription factors (ChIPmera), we find that CREB3L2-ATF4 activates a transcription network that interacts with roughly half of the genes differentially expressed in AD, including subsets associated with \u03b2-amyloid and tau neuropathologies. CREB3L2-ATF4 activation drives tau hyperphosphorylation and secretion in neurons, in addition to misregulating the retromer, an endosomal complex linked to AD pathogenesis. We further provide evidence for increased heterodimer signaling in AD brain and identify dovitinib as a candidate molecule for normalizing \u03b2-amyloid-mediated transcriptional responses. The findings overall reveal differential transcription factor dimerization as a mechanism linking disease stimuli to the development of pathogenic cellular states.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Dimerization", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Gene Expression", "Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cl\u00e1udio", "Last Name": "Gouveia Roque", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyung Min", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ethan P", "Last Name": "McCurdy", "Affiliation": "Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Studies, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Radhika", "Last Name": "Jagannathan", "Affiliation": "Division of Aging and Dementia, Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa K", "Last Name": "Randolph", "Affiliation": "Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krystal", "Last Name": "Herline-Killian", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jimena", "Last Name": "Baleriola", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "Hengst", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New\u00a0York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2023Mar03"}, {"PMID": "27457617", "Title": "AJUBA LIM Proteins Limit Hippo Activity in Proliferating Cells by Sequestering the Hippo Core Kinase Complex in the Cytosol.", "Abstract": "The Hippo pathway controls organ growth and is implicated in cancer development. Whether and how Hippo pathway activity is limited to sustain or initiate cell growth when needed is not understood. The members of the AJUBA family of LIM proteins are negative regulators of the Hippo pathway. In mammalian epithelial cells, we found that AJUBA LIM proteins limit Hippo regulation of YAP, in proliferating cells only, by sequestering a cytosolic Hippo kinase complex in which LATS kinase is inhibited. At the plasma membranes of growth-arrested cells, AJUBA LIM proteins do not inhibit or associate with the Hippo kinase complex. The ability of AJUBA LIM proteins to inhibit YAP regulation by Hippo and to associate with the kinase complex directly correlate with their capacity to limit Hippo signaling during Drosophila wing development. AJUBA LIM proteins did not influence YAP activity in response to cell-extrinsic or cell-intrinsic mechanical signals. Thus, AJUBA LIM proteins limit Hippo pathway activity in contexts where cell proliferation is needed.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytosol", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Epithelial Cells", "HEK293 Cells", "Hippo Signaling Pathway", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "LIM Domain Proteins", "MCF-7 Cells", "Phosphoproteins", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "Wings, Animal", "YAP-Signaling Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Radhika", "Last Name": "Jagannathan", "Affiliation": "The ICCE Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory V", "Last Name": "Schimizzi", "Affiliation": "The ICCE Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "The ICCE Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Medicine (Oncology), Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Loza", "Affiliation": "The ICCE Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norikazu", "Last Name": "Yabuta", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Research Institute for Microbial Disease, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hitoshi", "Last Name": "Nojima", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Research Institute for Microbial Disease, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Gregory D", "Last Name": "Longmore", "Affiliation": "The ICCE Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Medicine (Oncology), Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, USA glongmor@dom.wustl.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "PubDate": "2016Oct15"}]
