[{"PMID": "37678880", "Title": "Serotonergic dysfunction impairs locomotor coordination in spinal muscular atrophy.", "Abstract": "Neuromodulation by serotonin regulates the activity of neuronal networks responsible for a wide variety of essential behaviours. Serotonin (or 5-HT) typically activates metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors, which in turn initiate second messenger signalling cascades and induce short and long-lasting behavioural effects. Serotonin is intricately involved in the production of locomotor activity and gait control for different motor behaviours. Although dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with mood disorders and spasticity after spinal cord injury, whether and to what extent such dysregulation is implicated in movement disorders has not been firmly established. Here, we investigated whether serotonergic neuromodulation is affected in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative disease caused by ubiquitous deficiency of the SMN protein. The hallmarks of SMA are death of spinal motor neurons, muscle atrophy and impaired motor control, both in human patients and mouse models of disease. We used a severe mouse model of SMA, that closely recapitulates the severe symptoms exhibited by type I SMA patients, the most common and most severe form of the disease. Together, with mouse genetics, optogenetics, physiology, morphology and behavioural analysis, we report severe dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission in the spinal cord of SMA mice, both at early and late stages of the disease. This dysfunction is followed by reduction of 5-HT synapses on vulnerable motor neurons. We demonstrate that motor neurons innervating axial and trunk musculature are preferentially affected, suggesting a possible cause for the proximo-distal progression of disease, and raising the possibility that it may underlie scoliosis in SMA patients. We also demonstrate that the 5-HT dysfunction is caused by SMN deficiency in serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem. The behavioural significance of the dysfunction in serotonergic neuromodulation is underlined by inter-limb discoordination in SMA mice, which is ameliorated when selective restoration of SMN in 5-HT neurons is achieved by genetic means. Our study uncovers an unexpected dysfunction of serotonergic neuromodulation in SMA and indicates that, if normal function is to be restored under disease conditions, 5-HT neuromodulation should be a key target for therapeutic approaches.", "Keywords": ["SMA", "locomotion", "motor neuron disease", "serotonin", "synapse"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Serotonin", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Motor Neurons", "Spinal Cord", "Disease Models, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicolas", "Last Name": "Delestr\u00e9e", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evangelia", "Last Name": "Semizoglou", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John G", "Last Name": "Pagiazitis", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aleksandra", "Last Name": "Vukojicic", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Estelle", "Last Name": "Drobac", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vasilissa", "Last Name": "Paushkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "George Z", "Last Name": "Mentis", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2023Nov02"}, {"PMID": "36130491", "Title": "SMN controls neuromuscular junction integrity through U7 snRNP.", "Abstract": "The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an essential synapse whose loss is a key hallmark of the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

The electrophysiological changes of motoneurons over development underlies how their function changes over the lifetime of an organism. After describing the properties of individual motoneurons, the chapter then turns to revealing how motoneurons interact within complex neural circuits, with other motoneurons as well as sensory neurons, and how these circuits change over development.

SMN deficiency causes the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMN interacts with itself and other proteins to form a complex that functions in the assembly of ribonucleoproteins. SMN is modified by SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier), but whether sumoylation is required for the functions of SMN that are relevant to SMA pathogenesis is not known.

Expression of a SIM-inactivated mutant of SMN in a mouse model of SMA slightly extends survival rate with limited and transient correction of motor deficits. Remarkably, although SIM-inactivated SMN attenuates motor neuron loss and improves neuromuscular junction synapses, it fails to prevent the loss of sensory-motor synapses.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency in the ubiquitously expressed protein SMN and is characterized by motor neuron death, skeletal muscle atrophy, as well as dysfunction and loss of both central and peripheral excitatory synapses. These disease hallmarks result in an overall reduction of neuronal activity in the spinal sensory-motor circuit. Here, we show that increasing neuronal activity by chronic treatment with the FDA-approved potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) improves motor behavior in both sexes of a severe mouse model of SMA. 4-AP restores neurotransmission and number of proprioceptive synapses and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), while having no effects on motor neuron death. In addition, 4-AP treatment with pharmacological inhibition of p53-dependent motor neuron death results in additive effects, leading to full correction of sensory-motor circuit pathology and enhanced phenotypic benefit in SMA mice. Our in vivo study reveals that 4-AP-induced increase of neuronal activity restores synaptic connectivity and function in the sensory-motor circuit to improve the SMA motor phenotype.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease, characterized by synaptic loss, motor neuron death, and reduced neuronal activity in spinal sensory-motor circuits. However, whether these are parallel or dependent events is unclear. We show here that long-term increase of neuronal activity by the FDA-approved drug 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) rescues the number and function of central and peripheral synapses in a SMA mouse model, resulting in an improvement of the sensory-motor circuit and motor behavior. Combinatorial treatment of pharmacological inhibition of p53, which is responsible for motor neuron death and 4-AP, results in additive beneficial effects on the sensory-motor circuit in SMA. Thus, neuronal activity restores synaptic connections and improves significantly the severe SMA phenotype.", "Keywords": ["motor neuron death", "neurodegeneration", "neuronal activity", "sensory-motor circuit", "spinal muscular atrophy", "synaptic dysfunction"], "MeSH terms": ["4-Aminopyridine", "Animals", "Cell Death", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Motor Neurons", "Movement Disorders", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Neuromuscular Junction", "Potassium Channel Blockers", "Proprioception", "Psychomotor Performance", "Sensation Disorders", "Survival of Motor Neuron 1 Protein", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian M", "Last Name": "Simon", "Affiliation": "Carl-Ludwig-Institute for Physiology, Leipzig University, Leipzig 04103, Germany christian.simon@medizin.uni-leipzig.de."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Blanco-Redondo", "Affiliation": "Rudolf-Sch\u00f6nheimer Institute for Biochemistry, Leipzig University, Leipzig 04103, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jannik M", "Last Name": "Buettner", "Affiliation": "Carl-Ludwig-Institute for Physiology, Leipzig University, Leipzig 04103, Germany."}, {"First Name": "John G", "Last Name": "Pagiazitis", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Emily V", "Last Name": "Fletcher", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Josiane K", "Last Name": "Sime Longang", "Affiliation": "Carl-Ludwig-Institute for Physiology, Leipzig University, Leipzig 04103, Germany."}, {"First Name": "George Z", "Last Name": "Mentis", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2021Jan13"}, {"PMID": "31851921", "Title": "Stasimon Contributes to the Loss of Sensory Synapses and Motor Neuron Death in a Mouse Model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.", "Abstract": "Reduced expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein causes the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

In the mouse spinal cord, a population of GABAergic interneurons, GABApre, forms synapses with the terminals of proprioceptive sensory neurons and controls information transfer at sensory-motor\u00a0connections through presynaptic inhibition. We show that reducing sensory glutamate release results in decreased expression of GABA-synthesizing enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 in GABApre terminals and decreased presynaptic inhibition.

Yet it remains unclear whether activity-dependent refinement has a role in the establishment of connections between sensory afferents and those motor pools that have synergistic biomechanical functions. We show here that genetically abolishing central sensory-motor neurotransmission leads to a selective enhancement in the number and density of such \"heteronymous\" connections, whereas other aspects of sensory-motor connectivity are preserved.
