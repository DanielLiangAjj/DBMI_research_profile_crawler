[{"PMID": "38798673", "Title": "Identification and Pharmacological Targeting of Treatment-Resistant, Stem-like Breast Cancer Cells for Combination Therapy.", "Abstract": "Tumors frequently harbor isogenic yet epigenetically distinct subpopulations of multi-potent cells with high tumor-initiating potential-often called Cancer Stem-Like Cells (CSLCs). These can display preferential resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Single-cell analyses can help elucidate Master Regulator (MR) proteins responsible for governing the transcriptional state of these cells, thus revealing complementary dependencies that may be leveraged via combination therapy. Interrogation of single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from seven metastatic breast cancer patients, using perturbational profiles of clinically relevant drugs, identified drugs predicted to invert the activity of MR proteins governing the transcriptional state of chemoresistant CSLCs, which were then validated by CROP-seq assays. The top drug, the anthelmintic albendazole, depleted this subpopulation in vivo without noticeable cytotoxicity. Moreover, sequential cycles of albendazole and paclitaxel-a commonly used chemotherapeutic -displayed significant synergy in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a TNBC patient, suggesting that network-based approaches can help develop mechanism-based combinatorial therapies targeting complementary subpopulations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Worley", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Heeju", "Last Name": "Noh", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Daoqi", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mikko M", "Last Name": "Turunen", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hongxu", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Evan", "Last Name": "Paull", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Aaron T", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Adina", "Last Name": "Grunn", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Mingxuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Kristina", "Last Name": "Guillan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erin C", "Last Name": "Bush", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Samantha J", "Last Name": "Brosius", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hanina", "Last Name": "Hibshoosh", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Prabhjot S", "Last Name": "Mundi", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Piero", "Last Name": "Dalerba", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}, {"First Name": "Filemon S", "Last Name": "Dela Cruz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew L", "Last Name": "Kung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA 10032."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May16"}, {"PMID": "38339887", "Title": "Environmental drivers of the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer in the United States.", "Abstract": "Incidence of early-onset (diagnosed before age 50) colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has increased alarmingly since the 1990s in the United States. This study investigated what environmental exposures may have driven this increase. We obtained EOCRC incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, and data for 11 exposures, for example, body mass index (BMI), from long-term national surveys. We aggregated these data for 30 to 49-year-olds during 1992 to 2016 by population subgroups defined by calendar period, age, race and sex, and used negative binomial regression models to identify and estimate associations of EOCRC with multiple exposures. Furthermore, we used counterfactual modeling to quantify contributions of identified risk factors to EOCRC incidence. The top models (with lowest Bayesian Information Criteria) consistently identified excess body weight, represented by overweight and obesity (BMI \u226525) or obesity alone (BMI \u226530), as the strongest risk factor. The best-performing model estimated increased EOCRC incidence due to overweight and obesity, with an incidence rate ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.20 (1.17-1.22) for white men, 1.04 (1.00-1.08) for black men, 1.17 (1.15-1.21) for white women and 1.03 (0.97-1.08) for black women. Increases in overweight and obesity prevalence contributed to an estimated 30% (standard error: 1%) for men and 28% (standard error: 2%) for women of ECORC incidence during 1992 to 2016.

Little is known, however, about miRNAs that regulate such properties in human colorectal carcinoma. In this study, we compared the expression levels of 754 miRNAs between paired samples of EpCAM+/CD44+ cancer cells (enriched in CSCs) and EpCAM+/CD44neg cancer cells (with CSC depletion) sorted in parallel from human primary colorectal carcinomas and identified miR-221 as the miRNA that displayed the highest level of preferential expression in EpCAM+/CD44+ cancer cells. High levels of miR-221 expression were associated with Lgr5+ cells in mouse colon crypts and reduced survival in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Constitutive overexpression of miR-221 enhanced organoid-forming capacity of both conventional colorectal carcinoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in vitro. Importantly, constitutive downregulation of miR-221 suppressed organoid-forming capacity in vitro and substantially reduced the tumorigenic capacity of CSC populations from PDX lines in vivo. Finally, the most abundant splicing isoform of the human Quaking (QKI) gene, QKI-5, was identified as a functional target of miR-221; overexpression of miR-221-reduced QKI-5 protein levels in human colorectal carcinoma cells. As expected, overexpression of QKI-5 suppressed organoid-forming capacity in vitro and tumorigenic capacity of colorectal carcinoma PDX cells in vivo. Our study reveals a mechanistic link between miR-221 and QKI and highlights their key role in regulating CSC properties in human colorectal cancer.

Annexin A1, a previously unrecognized modulator of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, is a key component through which F.\u00a0nucleatum exerts its stimulatory effect.

Microarray-based multigene-expression signatures derived from stem cells and progenitor cells hold promise, but they are difficult to use in clinical practice. Methods We used a new bioinformatics approach to search for biomarkers of colon epithelial differentiation across gene-expression arrays and then ranked candidate genes according to the availability of clinical-grade diagnostic assays. With the use of subgroup analysis involving independent and retrospective cohorts of patients with stage II or stage III colon cancer, the top candidate gene was tested for its association with disease-free survival and a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Results The transcription factor CDX2 ranked first in our screening test. A group of 87 of 2115 tumor samples (4.1%) lacked CDX2 expression. In the discovery data set, which included 466 patients, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival was lower among the 32 patients (6.9%) with CDX2-negative colon cancers than among the 434 (93.1%) with CDX2-positive colon cancers (hazard ratio for disease recurrence, 3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 7.38; P=0.002). In the validation data set, which included 314 patients, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival was lower among the 38 patients (12.1%) with CDX2 protein-negative colon cancers than among the 276 (87.9%) with CDX2 protein-positive colon cancers (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.36 to 4.29; P=0.003). In both these groups, these findings were independent of the patient's age, sex, and tumor stage and grade. Among patients with stage II cancer, the difference in 5-year disease-free survival was significant both in the discovery data set (49% among 15 patients with CDX2-negative tumors vs. 87% among 191 patients with CDX2-positive tumors, P=0.003) and in the validation data set (51% among 15 patients with CDX2-negative tumors vs. 80% among 106 patients with CDX2-positive tumors, P=0.004). In a pooled database of all patient cohorts, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival was higher among 23 patients with stage II CDX2-negative tumors who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy than among 25 who were not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (91% vs. 56%, P=0.006).

We previously reported that miR-142 and miR-150 are upregulated in human breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) as compared to the non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. In this study, we report that miR-142 efficiently recruits the APC mRNA to an RNA-induced silencing complex, activates the canonical WNT signaling pathway in an APC-suppression dependent manner, and activates the expression of miR-150. Enforced expression of miR-142 or miR-150 in normal mouse mammary stem cells resulted in the regeneration of hyperproliferative mammary glands in vivo. Knockdown of endogenous miR-142 effectively suppressed organoid formation by BCSCs and slowed tumor growth initiated by human BCSCs in vivo. These results suggest that in some tumors, miR-142 regulates the properties of BCSCs at least in part by activating the WNT signaling pathway and miR-150 expression.", "Keywords": ["APC", "WNT signaling pathway", "breast cancer", "cancer stem cells", "cell biology", "human", "human biology", "medicine", "miR-142", "miR-150", "mouse"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein", "Animals", "Argonaute Proteins", "Base Sequence", "Breast Neoplasms", "Carcinogenesis", "Cell Proliferation", "Clone Cells", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Hyperplasia", "Mammary Glands, Animal", "Mice", "MicroRNAs", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Organoids", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA-Induced Silencing Complex", "Transcription, Genetic", "Up-Regulation", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Taichi", "Last Name": "Isobe", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shigeo", "Last Name": "Hisamori", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Hogan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maider", "Last Name": "Zabala", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "David G", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Piero", "Last Name": "Dalerba", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shang", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ferenc", "Last Name": "Scheeren", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Angera H", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shaheen S", "Last Name": "Sikandar", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jessica S", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dalong", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Frederick M", "Last Name": "Dirbas", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Somlo", "Affiliation": "City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kaiqin", "Last Name": "Lao", "Affiliation": "Applied Biosystems, Foster City, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patrick O", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yohei", "Last Name": "Shimono", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2014Nov18"}, {"PMID": "24141493", "Title": "Quantitative assessment of single-cell RNA-sequencing methods.", "Abstract": "Interest in single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells.
