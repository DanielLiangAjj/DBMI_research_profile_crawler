[{"PMID": "38746102", "Title": "Follicular helper- and peripheral helper-like T cells drive autoimmune disease in human immune system mice.", "Abstract": "Human immune system (HIS) mice constructed in various ways are widely used for investigations of human immune responses to pathogens, transplants and immunotherapies. In HIS mice that generate T cells de novo from hematopoietic progenitors, T cell-dependent multisystem autoimmune disease occurs, most rapidly when the human T cells develop in the native NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl (NSG) mouse thymus, where negative selection is abnormal. Disease develops very late when human T cells develop in human fetal thymus grafts, where robust negative selection is observed. We demonstrate here that PD-1 + CD4 + peripheral (Tph) helper-like and follicular (Tfh) helper-like T cells developing in HIS mice can induce autoimmune disease. Tfh-like cells were more prominent in HIS mice with a mouse thymus, in which the highest levels of IgG were detected in plasma, compared to those with a human thymus. While circulating IgG and IgM antibodies were autoreactive to multiple mouse antigens, in vivo depletion of B cells and antibodies did not delay the development of autoimmune disease. Conversely, adoptive transfer of enriched Tfh- or Tph-like cells induced disease and autoimmunity-associated B cell phenotypes in recipient mice containing autologous human APCs without T cells. T cells from mice with a human thymus expanded and induced disease more rapidly than those originating in a murine thymus, implicating HLA-restricted T cell-APC interactions in this process. Since Tfh, Tph, autoantibodies and LIP have all been implicated in various forms of human autoimmune disease, the observations here provide a platform for the further dissection of human autoimmune disease mechanisms and therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Vecchione", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohsen", "Last Name": "Khosravi-Maharlooei", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nichole", "Last Name": "Danzl", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hao Wei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Grace", "Last Name": "Nauman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Madley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Waffarn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Winchester", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaolan", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Georgia", "Last Name": "Fousteri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May05"}, {"PMID": "38559188", "Title": "An engineered human cardiac tissue model reveals contributions of systemic lupus erythematosus autoantibodies to myocardial injury.", "Abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a highly heterogenous autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, including the heart. The mechanisms by which myocardial injury develops in SLE, however, remain poorly understood. Here we engineered human cardiac tissues and cultured them with IgG fractions containing autoantibodies from SLE patients with and without myocardial involvement. We observed unique binding patterns of IgG from two patient subgroups: (i) patients with severe myocardial inflammation exhibited enhanced binding to apoptotic cells within cardiac tissues subjected to stress, and (ii) patients with systolic dysfunction exhibited enhanced binding to the surfaces of viable cardiomyocytes. Functional assays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that IgGs from patients with systolic dysfunction exerted direct effects on engineered tissues in the absence of immune cells, altering tissue cellular composition, respiration and calcium handling. Autoantibody target characterization by phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) confirmed distinctive IgG profiles between patient subgroups. By coupling IgG profiling with cell surface protein analyses, we identified four pathogenic autoantibody candidates that may directly alter the function of cells within the myocardium. Taken together, these observations provide insights into the cellular processes of myocardial injury in SLE that have the potential to improve patient risk stratification and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "Keywords": ["Autoantibodies", "autoimmune disease", "cardiac tissue engineering", "myocardial inflammation", "systemic lupus erythematosus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Fleischer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trevor R", "Last Name": "Nash", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel A", "Last Name": "Tamargo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roberta I", "Last Name": "Lock", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriela", "Last Name": "Venturini", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaretha", "Last Name": "Morsink", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vanessa", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Morgan J", "Last Name": "Lamberti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pamela L", "Last Name": "Graney", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Liberman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Youngbin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard Z", "Last Name": "Zhuang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jaron", "Last Name": "Whitehead", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh K", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan G", "Last Name": "Seidman", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine E", "Last Name": "Seidman", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Geraldino-Pardilla", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Winchester", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Mar12"}, {"PMID": "38550577", "Title": "SAP-expressing T peripheral helper cells identify systemic lupus erythematosus patients with lupus nephritis.", "Abstract": "T follicular (TFH) and peripheral helper (TPH) cells have been increasingly recognized as a pathogenic subset of CD4 T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

We propose that priming MSCs prior to administration will improve their therapeutic efficacy. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) priming are cues common to situations of immune escape that have individually shown promise as MSC priming cues but have not been systematically compared. Using mixed lymphocyte reactions, we show that priming MSCs with either cue alone improves T-cell inhibition. However, combining the two cues results in additive effects and markedly enhances the immunosuppressive phenotype of MSCs. We demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces expression of numerous immunosuppressive proteins (IDO, PD-L1, HLA-E, HLA-G), whereas hypoxia switches MSCs to glycolysis, causing rapid glucose consumption and production of T-cell inhibitory lactate levels. Dual IFN-\u03b3/hypoxia primed MSCs display both attributes and have even higher induction of immunosuppressive proteins over IFN-\u03b3 priming alone (IDO and HLA-G), which may reflect another benefit of metabolic reconfiguration.", "Keywords": ["Mesenchymal stromal cells", "hypoxia", "immunosuppression", "interferon gamma", "metabolism", "priming"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Holly M", "Last Name": "Wobma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Kanai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Shih", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hao Wei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raimon", "Last Name": "Duran-Struuck", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Winchester", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shahar", "Last Name": "Goeta", "Affiliation": "Quantitative Proteomics and Metabolomics Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lewis M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Quantitative Proteomics and Metabolomics Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology and regenerative medicine", "PubDate": "2018Mar"}, {"PMID": "30352889", "Title": "What structures are seen by a T cell in the immune response to a lupus autoantigen?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["T cells", "autoantibodies", "autoimmune diseases", "systemic lupus erythematosus"], "MeSH terms": ["Autoantibodies", "Autoantigens", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "HLA-DR Antigens", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Winchester", "Affiliation": "Autoimmune and Molecular Diseases, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032, USA rjw8@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Annals of the rheumatic diseases", "PubDate": "2019Mar"}, {"PMID": "30217690", "Title": "An Adolescent with Left Ventricular Noncompaction and Ebstein Anomaly Presenting with Advanced Heart Failure: Discharge from Hospital with a Biventricular Assist Device.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["mechanical circulatory support", "pediatric heart failure", "ventricular assist device"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Ebstein Anomaly", "Echocardiography, Doppler", "Electrocardiography", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Heart Failure", "Heart-Assist Devices", "Humans", "Male", "Multimodal Imaging", "Patient Discharge", "Radiography, Thoracic", "Risk Assessment", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bibhuti B", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital Heart Institute, Hollywood, FL.

Quantitative tools to study these cells are critical to understand fundamental features of this important response; however, the large size and diversity of the alloreactive T cell repertoire in humans presents a great technical challenge.

To overcome these obstacles, we studied human immune system-reconstituted mice (hu-mice) rendered hypercholesterolemic by treatment with adeno-associated virus 8-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (AAV8-PCSK9) and a high-fat/high-cholesterol Western-type diet (WD).

Compared with hu-mice that had lower plasma cholesterol, the PCSK9-WD mice developed a T cell-mediated inflammatory response in the lung and liver. Human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells bearing an effector memory phenotype were significantly elevated in the blood, spleen, and lungs of PCSK9-WD hu-mice, whereas splenic and circulating regulatory T cells were reduced.

We first discuss the results from comparing the HLA typing of two PsO cohorts: one cohort providing the dermatologic perspective, consisting of patients with PsO without evidence of arthritic disease; and the second cohort providing the rheumatologic perspective, consisting of patients with PsA. We show that these two cohorts differ considerably in their predominant HLA alleles, indicating the heterogeneity of the overall PsO phenotype. Moreover, the genotype of patients in the PsA cohort was shown to be heterogeneous with significant elevations in the frequency of haplotypes containing HLA-B*08, HLA-C*06:02, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*38 and HLA-B*39. Because different genetic susceptibility genes imply different disease mechanisms, and possibly different clinical courses and therapeutic responses, we then review the evidence for a phenotypic difference among patients with PsA who have inherited different HLA alleles. We provide evidence that different alleles and, more importantly, different haplotypes implicated in determining PsA susceptibility are associated with different phenotypic characteristics that appear to be subphenotypes.

It is increasingly accepted that despite being considered prototypical effector cells, NK cells require signals to reach their full cytotoxic potential. We previously showed that IL-15 is capable of arming CD8 effector T cells to kill independently of their TCR via NKG2D in a cPLA2-dependent process. As NK cells also express NKG2D, we wanted to investigate whether this pathway functioned in an analogous manner and if resting NK cells could be primed to the effector phase by IL-15. Furthermore, to establish relevance to human disease we studied a possible role for this pathway in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis, since there are aspects of this disease that suggest a potential effector role for the innate immune system. We found that PsA patients had upregulated IL-15 and MIC in their affected synovial tissues, and that this unique inflammatory environment enabled NK cell activation and killing via NKG2D and cPLA2. Moreover, we were able to reproduce the phenotype of joint NK cells from blood NK cells by incubating them with IL-15.

The application of hypertonic media to constructs comprised of SDSCs or chondrocytes led to increased mechanical properties as compared to hypotonic (300mOsM) or isotonic (330mOsM) media (p<0.05). Constant exposure of SDSC-seeded constructs to 400mOsM media from day 0 to day 49 yielded a Young's modulus of 513\u00b189kPa and GAG content of 7.39\u00b10.52%ww on day 49, well within the range of values of native, immature bovine cartilage.

These findings suggest hypertonic loading as a straightforward strategy for 3D cultivation with significant benefits for cartilage tissue engineering strategies. In an effort to understand potential mechanisms responsible for the observed response, cell volume measurements in response to varying osmotic conditions were evaluated in relation to the Boyle-van't Hoff (BVH) law. Results confirmed that chondrocytes behave as perfect osmometers; however SDSCs deviated from the BVH relation.", "Keywords": ["Cartilage", "Chondrocytes", "Static osmotic loading", "Synovium-derived stem cells", "Tissue engineering"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cartilage", "Cattle", "Cells, Cultured", "Chondrocytes", "Elastic Modulus", "Osmotic Pressure", "Time Factors", "Tissue Engineering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sonal R", "Last Name": "Sampat", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew V", "Last Name": "Dermksian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sevan R", "Last Name": "Oungoulian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Winchester", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Chlo\u00eb", "Last Name": "Bulinski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerard A", "Last Name": "Ateshian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clark T", "Last Name": "Hung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of biomechanics", "PubDate": "2013Oct18"}, {"PMID": "23716070", "Title": "Association of fine specificity and repertoire expansion of anticitrullinated peptide antibodies with rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease.", "Abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
