Methods: ASD patients with baseline and 2-year radiographic and PROMs were included. Patients were grouped according to whether they answered yes or no to a recent history of pre-operative loss of balance. The groups were propensity-matched by age, pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis (PI-LL), and surgical invasiveness score. Results: In total, 212 patients were examined (106 in each group). Patients with gait imbalance had worse baseline PROM measures, including Oswestry disability index (45.2 vs. 36.6), SF-36 mental component score (44 vs. 51.8), and SF-36 physical component score (p < 0.001 for all). After 2 years, patients with gait imbalance had less pelvic tilt correction (-1.2 vs. -3.6\u00b0, p = 0.039) for a comparable PI-LL correction (-11.9 vs. -15.1\u00b0, p = 0.144). Gait imbalance patients had higher rates of radiographic proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) (26.4% vs. 14.2%) and implant-related complications (47.2% vs. 34.0%). After controlling for age, baseline sagittal parameters, PI-LL correction, and comorbidities, patients with imbalance had 2.2-times-increased odds of PJK after 2 years. Conclusions: Patients with a self-reported loss of balance/unsteady gait have significantly worse PROMs and higher risk of PJK.", "Keywords": ["adult spinal deformity", "balance", "radiological

This study aimed to assess whether TXA use in patients undergoing complex spinal deformity correction surgeries increases the risk of thromboembolic complications based on preexisting thromboembolic risk factors.", "Keywords": ["adult spinal deformity surgery", "antifibrinolytic therapy", "high-risk", "thromboembolic complications", "tranexamic acid"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Male", "Tranexamic Acid", "Middle Aged", "Antifibrinolytic Agents", "Thromboembolism", "Postoperative Complications", "Risk Factors", "Aged", "Adult", "Blood Loss, Surgical", "Retrospective Studies", "Spinal Curvatures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey P", "Last Name": "Mullin", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mohamed A R", "Last Name": "Soliman", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York."}, {"First Name": "Justin S", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "4Department of Neurosurgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "5Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Buell", "Affiliation": "6Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Bassel", "Last Name": "Diebo", "Affiliation": "7Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island."}, {"First Name": "Justin K", "Last Name": "Scheer", "Affiliation": "8Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Breton", "Last Name": "Line", "Affiliation": "9Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Virginie", "Last Name": "Lafage", "Affiliation": "10Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Lennox Hill Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Renaud", "Last Name": "Lafage", "Affiliation": "10Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Lennox Hill Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Klineberg", "Affiliation": "11Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Texas Health Houston, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Han Jo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "12Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Peter G", "Last Name": "Passias", "Affiliation": "13Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey L", "Last Name": "Gum", "Affiliation": "14Leatherman Spine Center, Louisville, Kentucky."}, {"First Name": "Khaled", "Last Name": "Kebaish", "Affiliation": "15Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Robert K", "Last Name": "Eastlack", "Affiliation": "16Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Scripps Clinic, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Alan H", "Last Name": "Daniels", "Affiliation": "7Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Soroceanu", "Affiliation": "17Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Mundis", "Affiliation": "16Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Scripps Clinic, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Hostin", "Affiliation": "18Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Baylor Scoliosis Center, Plano, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Themistocles S", "Last Name": "Protopsaltis", "Affiliation": "13Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "D Kojo", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "6Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Munish C", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "19Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "20Department of Surgery, Division of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Toronto and Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Frank J", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "10Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Lennox Hill Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "21Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher I", "Last Name": "Shaffrey", "Affiliation": "22Departments of Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery, Spine Division, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina;

Some data on MISS in AIS compared with conventional open scoliosis surgery (COSS) are conflicting. A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library, including studies reporting outcomes for MISS in AIS. The meta-analysis compared the operative, radiological, and clinical outcomes and complications between MISS and COSS in patients with AIS. Of the 208 records identified, 15 nonrandomized studies with 1,369 patients (reviews and case reports are excluded) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The mean scale was 6.1, and eight of the 15 included studies showed satisfactory quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. For operative outcomes, MISS had significant benefits in terms of estimated blood loss (standard mean difference [SMD], -1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.94 to -0.91) and hospitalization days (SMD, -2.99; 95% CI, -4.45 to -1.53) compared with COSS. However, COSS showed significantly favorable outcomes for operative times (SMD, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.92-2.51). No significant differences were observed in radiological outcomes, including Cobb's angle of the main curve and thoracic kyphosis. For clinical outcomes, MISS showed significant benefits on the visual analog scale score (SMD, -0.91; 95% CI, -1.36 to -0.47). The overall complication rates of MISS were similar to those of COSS (SMD, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.61-1.52). MISS using the posterior approach provides equivalent radiological and clinical outcomes and complication rates compared with COSS. Considering the lower estimated blood loss, shorter hospitalization days, and longer operative times in MISS, COSS is still the mainstay of surgical treatment in AIS; however, MISS using the posterior approach is also one of the surgical options of choice in the case of moderate AIS.", "Keywords": ["Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis", "Conventional open scoliosis surgery", "Meta-analysis", "Minimally invasive scoliosis surgery", "Systematic review"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hong Jin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, College of Medicine, Inje University, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Javier", "Last Name": "Pizones", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Castelein", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Per D", "Last Name": "Trobisch", "Affiliation": "Department of Spine Surgery, Eifelklinik St. Brigida, Simmerath, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Mitsuru", "Last Name": "Yagi", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, International University of Health and Welfare, School of Medicine, Narita, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rady Children's Hospital, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dong-Gune", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, College of Medicine, Inje University, Seoul, Korea."}], "Journal": "Asian spine journal", "PubDate": "2024Apr"}, {"PMID": "38091233", "Title": "Who gets staged surgery in severe pediatric and adolescent spine deformity?", "Abstract": "There is significant debate regarding the indications of staged surgery for severe adolescent spinal deformity, and the factors associated with the decision to perform staged compared to same-day surgery have not been previously investigated.

An algorithm to predict postoperative coronal compensation and avoid postoperative coronal imbalance (CIB) was proposed. Methods: Patients were categorized into CB and CIB groups according to the preoperative coronal balance distance (CBD). The apical vertebras distribution modifier was defined as negative (-) if the centers of the apical vertebras (CoAVs) were on either side of the central sacral vertical line (CSVL) and positive (+) if the CoAVs were on the same side of the CSVL. Results: A total of 80 AdIS patients, with an average age of 25.97 \u00b1 9.20 years, who underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) were prospectively recruited. The mean Cobb angle of the main curve was 107.25 \u00b1 21.11 degrees at preoperation. The mean follow-up time was 3.76 \u00b1 1.38 (2-8) years. At postoperation and follow-up, CIB occurred in 7 (70%) and 4 (40%) CB- patients, 23 (50%) and 13 (28.26%) CB+ patients, 6 (60%) and 6 (60%) CIB- patients, and 9 (64.29%) and 10 (71.43%) CIB+ patients. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was significantly better in the CIB- group compared with that of the CIB+ group in the dimension of back pain. To avoid postoperative CIB, the correction rate of the main curve (CRMC) should match the compensatory curve for CB-/+ patients; the CRMC should be greater than the compensatory curve for CIB- patients; and the CRMC should be less than the compensatory curve for CIB+ patients, and the inclination of the LIV needs to be reduced. Conclusions: CB+ patients have the least postoperative CIB rate and the best coronal compensatory ability. CIB+ patients are at a high risk of postoperative CIB and have the poorest coronal compensatory capacity in the event of postoperative CIB. The proposed surgical algorithm facilitates the handling of each type of coronal alignment.", "Keywords": ["apical vertebras", "classification", "coronal balance", "scoliosis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aixing", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100020, China."}, {"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Hai", "Affiliation": "Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100020, China."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "New York-Presbyterian Och Spine Hospital, New York, NY 10034, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhaomin", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510062, China."}, {"First Name": "Jincai", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100020, China."}], "Journal": "Journal of personalized medicine", "PubDate": "2023May26"}, {"PMID": "37310045", "Title": "Outcomes and reoperation rates of adult spinal deformity patients with baseline sagittal malalignment based on the cranial axis to the hip at 2 years postoperatively.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to discern whether patients with a cranial sagittal vertical axis to the hip (CrSVA-H) > 2 cm at 2 years postoperatively exhibit significantly worse patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and clinical outcomes compared with patients with CrSVA-H < 2 cm.", "Keywords": ["adult spinal deformity", "cranial axis", "patient-reported outcomes", "reoperation rates", "sagittal malalignment"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adult", "Middle Aged", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Lordosis", "Scoliosis", "Pain", "Treatment Outcome", "Spinal Fusion"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarthak", "Last Name": "Mohanty", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mikhail", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gabriella", "Last Name": "Greisberg", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Fthimnir M", "Last Name": "Hassan", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stephen R", "Last Name": "Stephan", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Zeeshan M", "Last Name": "Sardar", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "1Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Och Spine Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Along with the recognized regional, global, and sagittal spinopelvic parameters, poor paraspinal muscle quality has recently been acknowledged as a key determinant of the clinical outcomes of ASD. Although the Scoliosis Research Society-Schwab ASD classification system incorporates the radiological factors related to HRQoL, it cannot accurately predict the mechanical complications. With the rapid advances in surgical techniques, many surgical options for ASD have been developed, ranging from minimally invasive surgery to osteotomies. Therefore, structured patient-specific management is important in surgical decision-making, selecting the proper surgical technique, and to prevent serious complications in patients with ASD.

Particularly in spinal fusions from the lower thoracic spine down to pelvis, PJK is a major consideration. While the open posterior approach allows for excellent visualization and preparation of bony surfaces for fusion, disruption of posterior soft tissue structures increases risk of PJK postoperatively. Minimally invasive approaches, on the other hand, preserve posterior ligamentous structures and musculature at the proximal fusion levels however prevent the access afforded by an open approach. We describe here the hybrid open muscle-sparing approach-a technique that allows for decortication of bony surfaces as well as clear exposure of anatomic landmarks for freehand pedicle screw placement, while protecting the posterior soft tissue structures to reduce risk of PJK.", "Keywords": ["Deformity", "Hybrid approach", "Proximal junctional kyphosis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joe M", "Last Name": "Lombardi", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "The Spine Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Neurospine", "PubDate": "2021Mar"}, {"PMID": "33201497", "Title": "Interobserver and intraobserver reliability of determining the deformity angular ratio in severe pediatric deformity curves.", "Abstract": "Cross-sectional reliability study.", "Keywords": ["Cobb angle", "Deformity angular ratio", "Early onset scoliosis", "Neuromuscular scoliosis", "Pediatric", "Scoliosis", "Spinal deformity"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Humans", "Radiography", "Reproducibility of Results", "Scoliosis", "Spine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Scott L", "Last Name": "Zuckerman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, 5141 Broadway, New York, NY, 10034, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, 5141 Broadway, New York, NY, 10034, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meghan", "Last Name": "Cerpa", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York-Presbyterian, 5141 Broadway, New York, NY, 10034, USA. mc4338@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Burt", "Last Name": "Yaszay", "Affiliation": "Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Sponseller", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Erickson", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, Aurora, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sumeet", "Last Name": "Garg", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital Colorado Aurora, Aurora, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Pahys", "Affiliation": "Shriners Hospitals for Children, Philadelphia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Cahill", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brenda", "Last Name": "Sides", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Munish", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Fox Pediatric Spinal Deformity Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Spine deformity", "PubDate": "2021Mar"}, {"PMID": "33179128", "Title": "Can pelvic incidence change after spinal deformity correction to the pelvis with S2-alar-iliac screws?", "Abstract": "Pelvic incidence (PI) is assumed to be fixed, yet studies have reported PI changes after long fusions to the pelvis.

Patients are often introduced to opioids following surgical procedures-this is particularly relevant following spinal surgery. Surgeons can help reduce this opioid burden by finding alternatives to narcotic analgesia in the postoperative period. One such medication that has shown potential in this role is ketamine, which has been studied in various surgical specialties. A review was performed of current literature regarding ketamine use in the perioperative period specific to spinal surgery. This review focused on prospective randomized control trials; the primary endpoint was opioid consumption in the postoperative period, monitored through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use. Both pediatric and adult spinal surgery patients were included; cervical, thoracic, and lumbar procedures were also all included. 10 studies were selected for this reviewed based on inclusion criteria, published between 2004 and 2017. 7 of these studies demonstrated a significant decrease in postoperative opioid use with the integration of ketamine in the perioperative period, while 3 trials showed no significant difference in opioid consumption. There is inherent difficulty in standardizing studies of this nature-dosing protocols, medication timing, and supplemental analgesia were variable throughout the included studies. However, this review of the most up-to-date prospective studies indicate ketamine has potential to play a significant role in reducing opioid requirements following spinal surgery, and further study is warranted in this field.", "Keywords": ["Ketamine", "opioid", "pain control", "spinal surgery"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melvin C", "Last Name": "Makhni", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meghan", "Last Name": "Cerpa", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, The Spine Hospital at New York Presbyterian, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of spine surgery (Hong Kong)", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "33079774", "Title": "Are Higher Global Alignment and Proportion Scores Associated With Increased Risks of Mechanical Complications After Adult Spinal Deformity Surgery?

The S2AI screws are often used for lumbosacral fixation at the base of long spinal deformity constructs. In severe spinal deformities, additional pelvic fixation beyond the standard 2 screws may help achieve and maintain correction, and also increase the rigidity of the construct. With a thorough understanding of pelvic anatomy, multiple pelvic screws, such as bilateral dual S2AI screws, may be placed safely to achieve stability and accommodate additional rods to perform powerful correction techniques. We illustrate the safe use of multiple rods across the lumbosacral junction in this case, by using both a hook rod construct and domino connectors - ultimately though these additional rods rely on the integrity of the pelvic fixation to provide their support. We recommend at least 3 rods across the lumbosacral junction in any adult spinal deformity case requiring pelvic fixation, and would recommend considering more than 3 rods, especially across 3-column osteotomy sites.

His neurologic exam showed lower extremity myelopathy. During week 7 at a goal traction weight of 18.1 kg, his distal lower extremity exam declined from 4+/5 to 2/5. His traction weight was lowered to 11.3 kg. He subsequently sustained a ground-level fall and became paraparetic with a motor exam of 1-2/5. He subsequently underwent a T1-L4 posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion with a T7-9 vertebral column resection. Postoperatively, he was noted to have a complete return to his baseline neurologic exam. At his 4-month postoperative visit, he was now full strength in his lower extremities with complete resolution of his myelopathy.

The focus of this narrative literature review is to briefly summarize the history of ASD treatment, discuss the current state of the art of ASD care with focus on surgical treatment and current challenges, and conclude with a discussion of potential developments related to ASD surgery.In the past, care for ASD was primarily based on supportive measures, including braces and assistive devices, with few options for surgical treatments that were often deemed high risk and reserved for rare situations. Advances in anesthetic and critical care, surgical techniques, and instrumentation now enable almost routine surgery for many patients with ASD. Despite the advances, there are many remaining challenges currently impacting the care of ASD patients, including increasing numbers of elderly patients with greater comorbidities, high complication and reoperation rates, and high procedure cost without clearly demonstrated cost-effectiveness based on standard criteria. In addition, there remains considerable variability across multiple aspects of ASD surgery. For example, there is currently very limited ability to provide preoperative individualized counseling regarding optimal treatment approaches (e.g., operative vs nonoperative), complication risks with surgery, durability of surgery, and likelihood of achieving individualized patient goals and satisfaction. Despite the challenges associated with the current state-of-the-art ASD treatment, surgery continues to be a primary option, as multiple reports have demonstrated the potential for surgery to significantly improve pain and disability. The future of ASD care will likely include techniques and technologies to markedly reduce complication rates, including greater use of navigation and robotics, and a shift toward individualized medicine that enables improved counseling, preoperative planning, procedure safety, and patient satisfaction.Advances in the care of ASD patients have been remarkable over the past few decades. The current state of the art enables almost routine surgical treatment for many types of ASD that have the potential to significantly improve pain and disability. However, significant challenges remain, including high complication rates, lack of demonstrated cost-effectiveness, and limited ability to meaningfully counsel patients preoperatively on an individual basis.

The margin for error will be quantified by the maximal insertional arc (MIA).METHODSThe study population included 10 consecutive operative patients with adult idiopathic scoliosis who underwent primary surgery. All measurements were performed using 3D visualization software by an attending spine surgeon. The screw starting points were 2 mm lateral to the midline of the SAF in the mediolateral direction and in the center of the pedicle in the cephalocaudal direction. The DSP was on the dorsal cortex. The ventral starting point (VSP) was at the depth of the SAF. Measurements included distance to the pedicle isthmus, MIA, and screw trajectories.RESULTSTen patients and 110 vertebral levels (T1-11) were measured. The patients' average age was 41.4 years (range 18-64 years). The pedicle isthmus was largest at T1 (4.04 \u00b1 1.09 mm), and smallest at T5 (1.05 \u00b1 0.93 mm). The distance to the pedicle isthmus was 7.47 mm for the VSP and 11.92 mm for the DSP (p < 0.001). The MIA was 15.3\u00b0 for the VSP and 10.1\u00b0 for the DSP (p < 0.001).

The trajectory of these screws helps avoid the use of offset connectors due to the screws alignment with the proximal pedicle screw instrumentation. Current literature shows that S2AI screws are effective with low complication rates, but the path of these screws is intimately associated with major neural and vascular structures.

The goal of this study was to define the relationship between T1 slope (T1S) and cervical lordosis (CL). METHODS: This is a retrospective review of a prospective database. Surgical ASD cases were initially analyzed. Analysis across the sagittal parameters was performed. Linear regression analysis based on T1S was used to provide a clinically applicable equation to predict CL. Findings were validated using the postoperative alignment of the ASD patients. Further validation was then performed using a second, normative database. The range of normal alignment associated with horizontal gaze was derived from a multilinear regression on data from asymptomatic patients. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (mean age 54.7 years) were included. Analysis revealed a strong correlation between T1S and C0-7 lordosis (r = 0.886), C2-7 lordosis (r = 0.815), and C0-2 lordosis (r = 0.732). There was no significant correlation between T1S and T1S-CL. Linear regression analysis revealed that T1S-CL assumed a constant value of 16.5\u00b0 (R2 = 0.664, standard error 2\u00b0). These findings were validated on the postoperative imaging (mean absolute error [MAE] 5.9\u00b0). The equation was then applied to the normative database (MAE 6.7\u00b0 controlling for McGregor slope [MGS] between -5\u00b0 and 15\u00b0). A multilinear regression between C2-7, T1S, and MGS demonstrated a range of T1S-CL between 14.5\u00b0 and 26.5\u00b0 was necessary to maintain horizontal gaze. CONCLUSIONS: Normative CL can be predicted via the formula CL = T1S - 16.5\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0. This implies a threshold of deformity and aids in providing a goal for surgical correction. Just as pelvic incidence (PI) can be used to determine the ideal LL, T1S can be used to predict ideal CL. This formula also implies that a kyphotic cervical alignment is to be expected for individuals with a T1S < 16.5\u00b0.", "Keywords": ["ASD = adult spinal deformity", "C0 = occiput", "CBVA = chin-brow vertical angle", "CL = cervical lordosis (C2\u20137 lordosis)", "HRQOL = health-related quality of life", "LL = lumbar lordosis", "MAE = mean absolute error", "MGS = McGregor slope", "PI = pelvic incidence", "PT = pelvic tilt", "RMSE = root mean square error", "SVA = sagittal vertical axis", "T1 slope", "T1S = T1 slope", "T1S\u2212CL", "T1S\u2212CL = T1S minus CL", "TIA = thoracic inlet angle", "TK = thoracic kyphosis", "cSVA = cervical SVA", "cervical lordosis", "cervical mismatch", "deformity", "sagittal alignment"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cervical Vertebrae", "Female", "Humans", "Kyphosis", "Lordosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neck", "Postoperative Period", "Retrospective Studies", "Scoliosis", "Spinal Fusion", "Thoracic Vertebrae", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Blake N", "Last Name": "Staub", "Affiliation": "Spine Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Renaud", "Last Name": "Lafage", "Affiliation": "Spine Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Han Jo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Spine Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher I", "Last Name": "Shaffrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of Virginia Medical Center, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Gregory M", "Last Name": "Mundis", "Affiliation": "San Diego Center for Spinal Disorders, La Jolla, California."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Hostin", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Baylor Scoliosis Center, Plano, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Douglas", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Munish C", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Ames", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Klineberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California; and."}, {"First Name": "Shay", "Last Name": "Bess", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "Spine Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Virginie", "Last Name": "Lafage", "Affiliation": "Spine Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "International Spine Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

anteriorly. Prevalence of the disease is thought to be between 0.4% and 10%. The true cause of SK remains unclear; however, various theories include growth irregularities, mechanical factors, genetic factors, and/or poor bone quality as the causes. Patients with mild disease (less than 70\u00b0) generally have a favorable prognosis with good clinical outcomes. Most patients with SK are successfully treated nonsurgically with observation, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. Surgical intervention is indicated in patients with greater than 70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 thoracic curves, greater than 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 thoracolumbar curves, intractable pain, neurologic deficit, cardiopulmonary compromise, or poor cosmesis. Because of advances in posterior spinal instrumentation, surgery can typically be performed through a posterior-only approach. When surgical treatment is planned, appropriate selection of the upper- and lower-instrumented vertebrae is important to achieve a well-balanced spine, preserve motion segments, and reduce the risk of junctional kyphosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Conservative Treatment", "Humans", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Radiography", "Scheuermann Disease", "Spinal Fusion", "Thoracic Vertebrae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zeeshan M", "Last Name": "Sardar", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY (Dr. Sardar and Dr. Lenke), and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA (Dr. Ames)."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Ames", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons", "PubDate": "2019May15"}, {"PMID": "30401569", "Title": "Topical tranexamic acid in spinal surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a commonly used antifibrinolytic agent for perioperative blood conservation in several surgical specialties. Although historically administered intravenously, such systemic administration may be accompanied by severe side effects. Thus, the topical usage of TXA has been established in several fields but remains poorly evaluated in spine surgery. In this study, the authors aimed to review the medical literature on topical TXA usage in spine surgery to evaluate its safety and efficacy. We reviewed manuscripts and clinical trials exploring topical TXA usage in spine surgery published by April 1st, 2018. Postoperative blood loss volumes and hospitalization lengths of stay were evaluated with separate meta-analyses. We identified five articles and one unpublished clinical trial that were placebo-controlled and comprised 218 patients receiving topical TXA in spine surgery. Patients receiving topical TXA demonstrated significantly lower postoperative blood loss as compared to the placebo group (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD] 2.21, 95% CI 0.79-3.62, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and had a lower hospitalization duration (MD 0.99, 95% CI 0.49-1.49, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Overall, topical TXA favorably reduced postoperative blood loss and hospitalization duration in patients undergoing spinal surgery.

This paper reviews studies on biomarkers of low back pain (LBP) in human subjects. LBP is the leading cause of disability, caused by various spine-related disorders, including intervertebral disc degeneration, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and facet arthritis. The focus of these studies is inflammatory mediators, because inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of disc degeneration and associated pain mechanisms. Increasingly, studies suggest that the presence of inflammatory mediators can be measured systemically in the blood. These biomarkers may serve as novel tools for directing patient care. Currently, patient response to treatment is unpredictable with a significant rate of recurrence, and, while surgical treatments may provide anatomical correction and pain relief, they are invasive and costly. The review covers studies performed on populations with specific diagnoses and undefined origins of LBP. Since the natural history of LBP is progressive, the temporal nature of studies is categorized by duration of symptomology/disease. Related studies on changes in biomarkers with treatment are also reviewed. Ultimately, diagnostic biomarkers of LBP and spinal degeneration have the potential to shepherd an era of individualized spine medicine for personalized therapeutics in the treatment of LBP.", "Keywords": ["back pain", "biomarkers", "inflammation", "intervertebral disc degeneration", "spine"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Cytokines", "Humans", "Inflammation Mediators", "Intervertebral Disc Degeneration", "Low Back Pain", "Outcome Assessment, Health Care", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aysha N", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hayley E", "Last Name": "Jacobsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jansher", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York."}, {"First Name": "Christopher G", "Last Name": "Filippi", "Affiliation": "Lenox Hill Hospital, Northwell Health, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "Lenox Hill Hospital, Northwell Health, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "K Daniel", "Last Name": "Riew", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nadeen O", "Last Name": "Chahine", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "29191095", "Title": "Male sex may not be associated with worse outcomes in primary all-posterior adult spinal deformity surgery: a multicenter analysis.", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Adolescent spine deformity studies have shown that male patients require longer surgery and have greater estimated blood loss (EBL) and complications compared with female patients. No studies exist to support this relationship in adult spinal deformity (ASD). The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between sex and complications, deformity correction, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with ASD. It was hypothesized that male ASD patients would have greater EBL, longer surgery, and more complications than female ASD patients. METHODS A multicenter ASD cohort was retrospectively queried for patients who underwent primary posterior-only instrumented fusions with a minimum of 5 levels fused. The minimum follow-up was 2 years. Primary outcomes were EBL, operative time, intra-, peri-, and postoperative complications, radiographic correction, and HRQOL outcomes (Oswestry Disability Index, SF-36, and Scoliosis Research Society-22r Questionnaire). Poisson multivariate regression was used to control for age, comorbidities, and levels fused. RESULTS Ninety male and 319 female patients met the inclusion criteria. Male patients had significantly greater mean EBL (2373 ml vs 1829 ml, p = 0.01). The mean operative time, transfusion requirements, and final radiographic measurements did not differ between sexes. Similarly, changes in HRQOL showed no significant differences. Finally, there were no sex differences in the incidence of complications (total, major, or minor) at any time point after controlling for age, body mass index, comorbidities, and levels fused. CONCLUSIONS Despite higher EBL, male ASD patients did not experience more complications or require less deformity correction at the 2-year follow-up. HRQOL scores similarly showed no sex differences. These findings differ from adolescent deformity studies, and surgeons can counsel patients that sex is unlikely to influence the outcomes and complication rates of primary all-posterior ASD surgery.", "Keywords": ["AIS = adolescent idiopathic scoliosis", "ASD = adult spinal deformity", "BMI = body mass index", "CCI = Charlson Comorbidity Index", "EBL = estimated blood loss", "HRQOL = health-related quality of life", "MCS = mental component summary", "ODI = Oswestry Disability Index", "PCS = physical component summary", "SRS-22r = Scoliosis Research Society-22r Questionnaire", "adult spinal deformity", "blood loss", "complications", "deformity correction", "gender", "health-related quality of life", "patient-reported outcomes", "sex"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Retrospective Studies", "Scoliosis", "Sex Factors", "Spinal Fusion", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Bumpass", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey L", "Last Name": "Gum", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Norton Leatherman Spine Center, Louisville, Kentucky."}, {"First Name": "Christopher I", "Last Name": "Shaffrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Justin S", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Christopher P", "Last Name": "Ames", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Shay", "Last Name": "Bess", "Affiliation": "Denver International Spine Center, Presbyterian St. Luke's/Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Neuman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Klineberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California."}, {"First Name": "Gregory M", "Last Name": "Mundis", "Affiliation": "San Diego Center for Spinal Disorders, San Diego, California."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "Division of Spine Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Virginie", "Last Name": "Lafage", "Affiliation": "Division of Spine Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Han Jo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Division of Spine Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Douglas C", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Kansas, Kansas City, Kansas."}, {"First Name": "Khaled M", "Last Name": "Kebaish", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Hostin", "Affiliation": "Baylor Scoliosis Center, Plano, Texas; and."}, {"First Name": "Renaud", "Last Name": "Lafage", "Affiliation": "Division of Spine Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "International Spine Study Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "PubDate": "2017Dec"}, {"PMID": "29171797", "Title": "Health-related quality of life outcomes in complex adult spinal deformity surgery.", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Significant health-related quality of life (HRQOL) benefits have been observed for patients undergoing primary and revision adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. The purpose of this study was to report changes in HRQOL measures in a consecutive series of patients undergoing complex spinal reconstructive surgery, using Scoli-RISK-1 (SR-1) inclusion criteria. METHODS This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study. The SR-1 inclusion criteria were used to define patients with complex ASD treated between June 1, 2009, and June 1, 2011. Standard preoperative and perioperative data were collected, including the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22r instrument. The HRQOL changes were evaluated at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Standardized forms were used to collect surgery-related complications data for all patients. Complications were defined as minor, transient major, or permanent major. Patients who achieved a minimum 2-year follow-up were included in the analysis. RESULTS Eighty-four patients meeting SR-1 criteria were identified. Baseline demographic and surgical data were available for 74/84 (88%) patients. Forty-seven of 74 (64%) patients met the additional HRQOL criteria with a minimum 2-year follow-up (mean follow-up 3.4 years, range 2-6.5 years). Twenty-one percent of patients underwent posterior fusion only, 40% of patients had a posterior column osteotomy, and 38% had a 3-column osteotomy. Seventy-five percent of patients underwent a revision procedure. Significant improvements were observed in all SRS-22r domains: Pain: +0.8 (p < 0.001); Self-Image: +1.4 (p < 0.001); Function: +0.46 (p < 0.001); Satisfaction: +1.6 (p < 0.001); and Mental Health: +0.28 (p = 0.04). With the exception of Mental Health, more than 50% of patients achieved a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in SRS-22r domain scores (Mental Health: 20/47, 42.6%). A total of 65 complications occurred in 31 patients. This includes 29.8% (14/47) of patients who suffered a major complication and 17% (8/47) who suffered a postoperative neurological deficit, most commonly at the root level (10.6%, 5/47). Of the 8 patients who suffered a neurological deficit, 1 (13%) was able to achieve MCID in the SRS Function domain. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients experienced clinically relevant improvement in SRS-22r HRQOL scores after complex ASD surgery. The greatest improvements were seen in the SRS Pain and SRS Self-Image domains. Although 30% of patients suffered a major or permanent complication, benefits from surgery were still attained.

To mitigate the effects of this surgery on the growing pediatric spine, the authors report a novel technique used in 4 children with severe cervical-thoracic instability. These patients underwent instrumentation from the occiput to the upper thoracic region for stabilization, but without bone graft at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ). Subsequent surgery was then performed to remove the occipital instrumentation, thereby allowing further growth and increased motion across the CVJ. METHODS Three very young children (15, 30, and 30 months old) underwent occipital to thoracic posterior segmental instrumentation due to cervical or upper thoracic dislocation, progressive kyphosis, and myelopathy. The fourth child (10 years old) underwent similar instrumentation for progressive cervical-thoracic scoliosis. Bone graft was placed at and distal to C-2 only. After follow-up CT scans demonstrated posterior arthrodesis without unintended fusion from the occiput to C-2, 3 patients underwent removal of the occipital instrumentation. RESULTS Follow-up cervical spine flexion/extension radiographs demonstrated partial restoration of motion at the CVJ. One patient has not had the occipital instrumentation removed yet, because only 4 months have elapsed since her operation. CONCLUSIONS Temporary fixation to the occiput provides increased biomechanical stability for spinal stabilization in young children, without permanently eliminating motion and growth at the CVJ.

Retrospective studies may underreport neurological deficits due to selection, detection, and recall biases. Prospective studies are expensive and more difficult to perform, but they likely provide more accurate estimates of new neurological deficit rates. METHODS New neurological deficits were recorded in a prospective study of complex ASD surgeries (pSR1) with a defined outcomes measure (decrement in American Spinal Injury Association lower-extremity motor score) for neurological deficits. Using identical inclusion criteria and a subset of participating surgeons, a retrospective study was created (rSR1) and neurological deficit rates were collected. Continuous variables were compared with the Student t-test, with correction for multiple comparisons. Neurological deficit rates were compared using the Mantel-Haenszel method for standardized risks. Statistical significance for the primary outcome measure was p < 0.05. RESULTS Overall, 272 patients were enrolled in pSR1 and 207 patients were enrolled in rSR1. Inclusion criteria, defining complex spinal deformities, and exclusion criteria were identical. Sagittal Cobb measurements were higher in pSR1, although sagittal alignment was similar. Preoperative neurological deficit rates were similar in the groups. Three-column osteotomies were more common in pSR1, particularly vertebral column resection. New neurological deficits were more common in pSR1 (pSR1 17.3% [95% CI 12.6-22.2] and rSR1 9.0% [95% CI 5.0-13.0]; p = 0.01). The majority of deficits in both studies were at the nerve root level, and the distribution of level of injury was similar. CONCLUSIONS New neurological deficit rates were nearly twice as high in the prospective study than the retrospective study with identical inclusion criteria. These findings validate concerns regarding retrospective cohort studies and confirm the need for and value of carefully designed prospective, observational cohort studies in ASD.", "Keywords": ["3CO = 3-column osteotomy", "ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists", "ASD = adult spinal deformity", "ASIA = American Spinal Injury Association", "EBL = estimated blood loss", "VCR = vertebral column resection", "adult deformity", "complication", "neurological deficit", "pSR1 = the prospective study", "rSR1 = the retrospective study"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nervous System Diseases", "Operative Time", "Osteotomy", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk", "Spinal Curvatures", "Spinal Fusion"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence G", "Last Name": "Lenke", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jakub", "Last Name": "Godzik", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Ferran", "Last Name": "Pellise", "Affiliation": "Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Christopher I", "Last Name": "Shaffrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Justin S", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "Division of Orthopaedics, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christopher P", "Last Name": "Ames", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Leah Y", "Last Name": "Carreon", "Affiliation": "Norton Leatherman Spine Center, Louisville, Kentucky."}, {"First Name": "Michael G", "Last Name": "Fehlings", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Schwab", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Adam L", "Last Name": "Shimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Recent evidence has revealed sagittal plane malalignment to be a key driver of pain and disability in this population and has led to a significant shift toward a more evidence-based management paradigm. In this narrative review, we review the recent literature on the epidemiology, evaluation, management, and outcomes of degenerative adult spinal deformity (ASD). ASD is increasing in prevalence in North America due to an aging population and demographic shifts. It results from cumulative degenerative changes focused in the intervertebral discs and facet joints that occur asymmetrically to produce deformity. Deformity correction focuses on restoration of global alignment, especially in the sagittal plane, and decompression of the neural elements. General realignment goals have been established, including sagittal vertical axis <50 mm, pelvic tilt <22\u00b0, and lumbopelvic mismatch <\u00b19\u00b0; however, these should be tailored to the patient. Operative management, in carefully selected patients, yields satisfactory outcomes that appear to be superior to nonoperative strategies. ASD is characterized by malalignment in the sagittal and/or coronal plane and, in adults, presents with pain and disability. Nonoperative management is recommended for patients with mild, nonprogressive symptoms; however, evidence of its efficacy is limited. Surgery aims to restore global spinal alignment, decompress neural elements, and achieve fusion with minimal complications. The surgical approach should balance the desired correction with the increased risk of more aggressive maneuvers.

Hyperkyphosis is defined as excessive curvature of the thoracic spine and may be associated with adverse health effects. Hyperkyphosis in isolation or as a component of degenerative kyphoscoliosis has important implications for the surgical management of adult spinal deformity. Our objective was to review the literature on the epidemiology, etiology, natural history, management, and outcomes of thoracic hyperkyphosis. We performed a narrative review of literature on thoracic hyperkyphosis and its implications for adult spinal deformity surgery. Hyperkyphosis has a prevalence of 20% to 40% and is more common in the geriatric population. The cause is multifactorial and involves an interaction between degenerative changes, vertebral compression fractures, muscular weakness, and altered biomechanics. It may be associated with adverse health consequences including impaired physical function, pain and disability, impaired pulmonary function, and increased mortality. Nonoperative management may slow the progression of kyphosis and improve function. Surgery is rarely performed for isolated hyperkyphosis in the elderly due to the associated risk, but is an option when kyphosis occurs in the context of significant deformity. In this scenario, increased thoracic kyphosis influences selection of fusion levels and overall surgical planning. Kyphosis is common in older individuals and is associated with adverse health effects and increased mortality. Current evidence suggests a role for nonoperative therapies in reducing kyphosis and delaying its progression.
