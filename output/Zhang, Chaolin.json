Current studies linking individual RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to AS in a few neuron types underscore the need for holistic modeling. Here, we use network reverse engineering to derive a map of the neuron type-specific AS regulatory landscape from 133 mouse neocortical cell types defined by single-cell transcriptomes. This approach reliably inferred the regulons of 350 RBPs and their cell type-specific activities. Our analysis revealed driving factors delineating neuronal identities, among which we validated Elavl2 as a key RBP for MGE-specific splicing in GABAergic interneurons using an in vitro ESC differentiation system. We also identified a module of exons and candidate regulators specific for long- and short-projection neurons across multiple neuronal classes.

The proliferation of cells was evaluated by CCK-8 and Colony formation assay. The distribution of cells in cell cycle phases was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle, autophagy and MAPK signaling related proteins were detected by western blotting. Mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the efficacy of D-arabinose in vivo. The proliferation of cells was dramatically inhibited by D-arabinose exposure in a dose-dependent manner, which was relevant to cell cycle arrest, as demonstrated by G2/M cell cycle restriction and ectopic expression of cell cycle related proteins. Mechanistically, we further identified that D-arabinose is positively associated with autophagy and the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling in breast cancer. In contrast, 3-Ma or SB203580, the inhibitor of autophagy or p38 MAPK, reversed the efficacy of D-arabinose.

Here, we present DeltaSplice, a deep neural network model optimized to learn the impact of mutations on quantitative changes in alternative splicing from the comparative analysis of homologous genes.

We benchmarked DeltaSplice and several other state-of-the-art methods on various prediction tasks, including evolutionary sequence divergence on lineage-specific splicing and splicing-altering mutations in human populations and neurodevelopmental disorders, and demonstrated that DeltaSplice outperformed consistently. DeltaSplice predicted ~15% of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in the human brain as causal splicing-altering variants. It also predicted splicing-altering de novo mutations outside the splice sites in a subset of patients affected by autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, including 19 genes with recurrent splicing-altering mutations.

alterations and their contribution to pathogenesis are poorly characterized. Bone marrow fibrosis is a maladaptive feature of primary myelofibrosis (PMF). We performed lineage tracing and found that most collagen-expressing myofibroblasts were derived from leptin-receptor-positive (LepR+) mesenchymal cells, whereas a minority were from Gli1-lineage cells. Deletion of Gli1 did not impact PMF. Unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) confirmed that virtually all myofibroblasts originated from LepR-lineage cells, with reduced expression of hematopoietic niche factors and increased expression of fibrogenic factors. Concurrently, endothelial cells upregulated arteriolar-signature genes. Pericytes and Sox10+ glial cells expanded drastically with heightened cell-cell signaling, suggesting important functional roles in PMF. Chemical or genetic ablation of bone marrow glial cells ameliorated fibrosis and improved other pathology in PMF.

In order to recognize the development of coal production in China and prepare for future monitoring and prevention of safety incidents, this study mainly elaborated on\u00a0the basic situation of coal resources and national mining accidents over the past five\u00a0years\u00a0 (2017-2021), from four dimensions (accident level, type, region, and time), and then proposed the preventive measures based on accident statistical laws. The results show that the storage of coal resources has obvious geographic\u00a0characteristics, mainly concentrated in the Midwest, with coal resources in Shanxi and Shaanxi accounting for about 49.4%. The proportion of coal consumption has dropped from 70.2% to 56% between 2011\u00a0and\u00a02021, but still accounts for more than half\u00a0of the\u00a0all. Meanwhile, the accident-prone areas are positively correlated with the amount of coal production. Among different levels of coal mine accidents, general accidents had the highest number of accidents and deaths, with 692 accidents and 783 deaths, accounting for 87.6% and 54.64% respectively. The frequency of roof, gas, and transportation accidents is relatively high, and the number of single fatalities caused by gas accidents is the largest, about 4.18. In terms of\u00a0geographical distribution of accidents, the safety situation in Shanxi Province is the most severe. From the time distribution of coal mine accidents, the accidents mainly occurred in July and August, and rarely occurred in February and December. Finally, the \"4\u2009+\u20094\" safety management model is proposed, combining the statistical results with coal production in China.

Developmentally, interneurons migrate from a distal progenitor domain in order to populate the neocortex - a process that occurs at a slower rate in humans than in mice. In this study, we sought to identify factors that regulate the rate of interneuron maturation across the two species. Using embryonic mouse development as a model system, we found that the process of initiating interneuron migration is regulated by blood vessels of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), an interneuron progenitor domain. We identified two endothelial cell-derived paracrine factors, SPARC and SerpinE1, that enhance interneuron migration in mouse MGE explants and organotypic cultures.

Here, we systematically investigated AS regulation across over 100 transcriptomically defined neuronal types of the adult mouse cortex using deep single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

These programs consist of overlapping sets of alternative exons showing differential splicing at multiple hierarchical levels.

Importantly, these and additional RBPs also contribute to differential splicing between neuronal subclasses at multiple hierarchical levels, and some RBPs contribute to splicing dynamics that do not conform to the hierarchical structure defined by the transcriptional profiles.

They are dynamic phenomena characterized by large quantities of coal and gas ejected from working faces within a short time. Numerous researchers have conducted studies on outburst prediction, and a variety of indices have been developed to this end. However, these indices are usually empirical or based on local experience, and the accurate prediction of outbursts is not feasible due to the complicated mechanisms of outbursts. This study conducts outburst experiments using large-scale multifunctional equipment developed in the laboratory to develop a more robust outburst prediction method. In this study, the coal temperature during the outburst process was monitored using temperature sensors. The results show that the coal temperature decreased rapidly as the outburst progressed. Meanwhile, the coal temperature in locations far from the outburst mouth increased. The coal broken in the stress concentration state is the main factor causing the abnormal temperature rise. The discovery of these phenomena lays a theoretical foundation and provides an experimental basis for an effective outburst prediction method. An outburst prediction method based on monitoring temperature was proposed, and has a simpler and faster operation process and is not easily disturbed by coal mining activities. What is more, the critical values of coal temperature rises or temperature gradients can be flexibly adjusted according to the actual situations of different coal mines to predict outbursts more effectively and accurately.", "Keywords": ["coal and gas outburst", "coal temperature", "concentration stress", "outburst prediction", "outburst prevention"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chaolin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Gas and Fire Control for Coal Mines, Ministry of Education, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China."}, {"First Name": "Enyuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Gas and Fire Control for Coal Mines, Ministry of Education, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Disaster Dynamics and Control, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."}, {"First Name": "Shoujian", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Disaster Dynamics and Control, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400030, China."}], "Journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2020Sep27"}, {"PMID": "32915137", "Title": "Alternative splicing at neuroligin site A regulates glycan interaction and synaptogenic activity.", "Abstract": "Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating cell surface synaptic organizing complexes that control the properties of connections in brain circuits are poorly understood.

As a paradigmatic complex genetic disease, ASD has been intensively studied and thousands of gene mutations have been reported. Because these mutations rarely recur, it is difficult to (i) pinpoint the fewer disease-causing versus majority random events and (ii) replicate or verify independent studies. A coherent and systematic understanding of autism biology has not been achieved. We analyzed 3392 and 4792 autism-related mutations from two large-scale whole-exome studies across multiple resolution levels, that is, variants (single-nucleotide), genes (protein-coding unit), and pathways (molecular module). These mutations do not recur or replicate at the variant level, but significantly and increasingly do so at gene and pathway levels. Genetic association reveals a novel gene + pathway dual-hit model, where the mutation burden becomes less relevant. In multiple independent analyses, hundreds of variants or genes repeatedly converge to several canonical pathways, either novel or literature-supported. These pathways define recurrent and systematic ASD biology, distinct from previously reported gene groups or networks. They also present a catalog of novel ASD risk factors including 118 variants and 72 genes. At a subpathway level, most variants disrupt the pathway-related gene functions, and in the same gene, they tend to hit residues extremely close to each other and in the same domain. Multiple interacting variants spotlight key modules, including the cAMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) second-messenger system and mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptor) signaling regulation by GRKs (G protein-coupled receptor kinases).

"Neuronal maturation requires dramatic morphological and functional changes, but the molecular mechanisms governing this process are not well understood. Here, we studied the role of Rbfox1, Rbfox2, and Rbfox3 proteins, a family of tissue-specific splicing regulators mutated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. We generated Rbfox triple knockout (tKO) ventral spinal neurons to define a comprehensive network of alternative exons under Rbfox regulation and to investigate their functional importance in the\u00a0developing neurons. Rbfox tKO neurons exhibit defects in alternative splicing of many cytoskeletal, membrane, and synaptic proteins, and display immature electrophysiological activity. The axon initial segment (AIS), a subcellular structure important for action potential initiation, is diminished upon Rbfox depletion. We identified an Rbfox-regulated splicing switch in ankyrin G, the AIS \"interaction hub\" protein, that regulates ankyrin G-beta spectrin affinity and AIS assembly.

To evaluate functionality of the newly discovered AS events, we conducted comprehensive analyses on central nervous system (CNS) cell type-specific splicing, targets of tissue- or cell type-specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs), evolutionary selection pressure, and coupling of AS with nonsense-mediated decay (AS-NMD). We show that newly discovered events account for 23-42% of all cassette exons under tissue- or cell type-specific regulation. Furthermore, over 7,000 cassette exons are under evolutionary selection for regulated AS in mammals, 70% of which are new. Among these are 3,058 highly conserved cassette exons, including 1,014 NMD exons that may function directly to control gene expression levels. These NMD exons are particularly enriched in RBPs including splicing factors and interestingly also regulators for other steps of RNA metabolism. Unexpectedly, a second group of NMD exons reside in genes encoding chromatin regulators.

Despite the low information content in individual motif elements, our algorithm made specific predictions for successful experimental validation. Analysis of predicted sites also revealed cases of extensive and distal RBP-binding sites important for splicing regulation.
