Recent evidence suggests that crosstalk within the osteochondral unit may drive OA progression. While structural-biomechanical properties of bone and cartilage have been studied, potential interaction within the osteochondral unit in the context of OA has yet to be investigated. We performed comprehensive structural and biomechanical quantification of the cartilage, subchondral bone plate, and subchondral trabecular bone using 101 osteochondral cores collected from tibial plateaus of 12 control human cadavers (CT, 5 male/7 female) and 19 patients undergoing total knee replacement (OA, 6 male/13 female). For each sample, we quantified subchondral bone plate microstructure, plate-and-rod morphological properties of the subchondral trabecular bone using individual trabecula segmentation, and morphological and compositional properties of the articular cartilage. We also performed indentation testing on each compartment of the osteochondral unit to extract the respective structural-mechanical properties. Cartilage thickness was lower in moderate and severe OA regions, while OARSI score was higher only in severe OA regions. GAG content did not change in any OA region. Aggregate and shear moduli were lower only in severe OA regions, while permeability was lower only in moderate OA regions. In the subchondral bone plate, thickness and TMD were higher in moderate and severe OA regions. Tissue modulus of subchondral trabecular bone was lower in moderate OA regions despite a thicker and more mineralized subchondral bone plate; this deterioration was not observed in severe OA regions. Regression analysis revealed strong correlations between cartilage and subchondral trabecular bone properties in CT; these correlations were also found in moderate OA regions but were not observed in severe OA regions. In summary, our findings comprehensively characterize the human OA osteochondral unit.

Identifying pathogenic immune phenotypes in 'At-Risk' populations prior to clinical disease onset is crucial to establishing effective prevention strategies. Here, we applied mass cytometry to deeply characterize the immunophenotypes in blood from At-Risk individuals identified through the presence of serum antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPA) and/or first-degree relative (FDR) status (n=52), as compared to established RA (n=67), and healthy controls (n=48). We identified significant cell expansions in At-Risk individuals compared with controls, including CCR2+CD4+ T cells, T peripheral helper (Tph) cells, type 1 T helper cells, and CXCR5+CD8+ T cells. We also found that CD15+ classical monocytes were specifically expanded in ACPA-negative FDRs, and an activated PAX5 low na\u00efve B cell population was expanded in ACPA-positive FDRs. Further, we developed an \"RA immunophenotype score\" classification method based on the degree of enrichment of cell states relevant to established RA patients.

However, reports of its use and subsequent fatal arrhythmias in patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have raised concern regarding its cardiovascular (CV) safety. Therefore, we examined the relationship between HCQ use and corrected QT (QTc) length in SLE and RA patients without clinical CV disease (CVD).MethodsOne SLE (n=352) and two RA cohorts (n=178) with electrocardiograms (ECGs) collected as part of study data were analyzed. RA cohort participants were recruited from tertiary referral centers with additional referrals from community rheumatologists, while SLE subjects originated from the Columbia University Lupus Cohort. All patients met American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE or RA, and lacked known CVD. The exposure of interest was HCQ use and main outcome measure was QTc length [continuous or categorical (\u2265440 ms and \u2265500 ms)]. ResultsOf the combined SLE and RA cohorts (n=530), 70% were HCQ users and 44% had a QTc\u2265 440 ms. The adjusted mean QTc length was comparable between HCQ users vs non-users (438 ms vs 437 ms). In multivariable logistic models, HCQ use was not a significant predictor of a QTc\u2265440 ms for the entire cohort (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.48-1.23; p=0.27). Importantly, a QTc\u2265500 ms was inversely associated with HCQ use and not associated with arrhythmias or deaths. A significant interaction was found between HCQ use and use of anti-psychotics. Ultimately, the use of HCQ combined with any QTc prolonging medication as a group was associated with a QTc length (434 ms; 95%CI 430, 439) which was comparable to that of use of HCQ alone (433 ms; 95% CI 429, 437). ConclusionIn a combined cohort of SLE and RA patients without clinical CVD, adjusted QTc length was comparable between HCQ and non-HCQ users, supporting its CV safety in patients with rheumatic diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jon T", "Last Name": "Giles", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Thania", "Last Name": "Perez-Recio", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Paloma", "Last Name": "Pina", "Affiliation": "Northwestern Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Depender", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Yevgeniya", "Last Name": "Gartshteyn", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Anca", "Last Name": "Askanase", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Bathon", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Geraldino-Pardilla", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2021Jun29"}, {"PMID": "34101387", "Title": "2021 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.", "Abstract": "To develop updated guidelines for the pharmacologic management of rheumatoid arthritis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antirheumatic Agents", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Consensus", "Decision Support Techniques", "Humans", "Remission Induction", "Rheumatology", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Liana", "Last Name": "Fraenkel", "Affiliation": "Berkshire Medical Center, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."}, {"First Name": "Joan M", "Last Name": "Bathon", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Bryant R", "Last Name": "England", "Affiliation": "University of Nebraska Medical Center and VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System, Omaha, Nebraska."}, {"First Name": "E William", "Last Name": "St Clair", "Affiliation": "Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Thurayya", "Last Name": "Arayssi", "Affiliation": "Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar."}, {"First Name": "Kristine", "Last Name": "Carandang", "Affiliation": "University of California, San Diego."}, {"First Name": "Kevin D", "Last Name": "Deane", "Affiliation": "University of Colorado, Aurora."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Genovese", "Affiliation": "Stanford University Medical Center, Palo Alto, California."}, {"First Name": "Kent Kwas", "Last Name": "Huston", "Affiliation": "The Center for Rheumatic Disease/Allergy and Immunology, Kansas City, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Gail", "Last Name": "Kerr", "Affiliation": "Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Georgetown and Howard University, Washington, DC."}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Kremer", "Affiliation": "Albany Medical College and The Center for Rheumatology, Albany, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mary C", "Last Name": "Nakamura", "Affiliation": "University of California, San Francisco."}, {"First Name": "Linda A", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jasvinder A", "Last Name": "Singh", "Affiliation": "University of Alabama at Birmingham and Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin J", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Florida State University College of Medicine School of Physician Assistant Practice, Tallahassee."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Sparks", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Shilpa", "Last Name": "Venkatachalam", "Affiliation": "Global Healthy Living Foundation, Upper Nyack, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Weinblatt", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Mounir", "Last Name": "Al-Gibbawi", "Affiliation": "American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon."}, {"First Name": "Joshua F", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Corporal Michael J.

We sought to address whether RA immunomodulators reduce vascular inflammation, thereby reducing ASCVD risk, and whether such reduction depends on the type of immunomodulator. The TARGET (Treatments Against RA and Effect on 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose [18 F-FDG] Positron Emission Tomography [PET]/Computed Tomography [CT]) trial (NCT02374021) will enroll 150 patients with RA with active disease and an inadequate response to methotrexate. Participants will be randomized to add either a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (etanercept or adalimumab) or sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine to their background methotrexate. Participants will undergo full-body 18 F-FDG-labelled PET scanning at baseline and after 6 months. Efficacy and safety evaluations will occur every 6 weeks, with therapy modified in a treat-to-target approach. The primary outcome is the comparison of change in arterial inflammation in the wall of the aorta and carotid arteries between the randomized treatment groups, specifically, the change in the mean of the maximum target-to-background ratio of arterial 18 F-FDG uptake in the most diseased segment of either the aorta and carotid arteries. A secondary analysis will compare the effects of achieving low disease activity or remission with those of moderate to high disease activity on vascular inflammation. The TARGET trial will test, for the first time, whether RA treatments reduce arterial inflammation and whether such reduction differs according to treatment strategy with either TNF inhibitors or a combination of nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jon T", "Last Name": "Giles", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Pamela M", "Last Name": "Rist", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Katherine P", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Ahmed", "Last Name": "Tawakol", "Affiliation": "Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston."}, {"First Name": "Zahi A", "Last Name": "Fayad", "Affiliation": "Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York."}, {"First Name": "Venkatesh", "Last Name": "Mani", "Affiliation": "Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nina P", "Last Name": "Paynter", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Paul M", "Last Name": "Ridker", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Glynn", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Fengxin", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Broderick", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Meredith", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen M M", "Last Name": "Vanni", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Daniel H", "Last Name": "Solomon", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Joan M", "Last Name": "Bathon", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "ACR open rheumatology", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33831046", "Title": "What about tocilizumab?

These conditions include thrombotic complications, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular injury, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic illnesses, ocular symptoms, and dermatologic complications. Given that ACE2, the entry receptor for the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues, direct viral tissue damage is a plausible mechanism of injury. In addition, endothelial damage and thromboinflammation, dysregulation of immune responses, and maladaptation of ACE2-related pathways might all contribute to these extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

Moreover, immune responses tend to be stronger in female vs male humans and mice. Because it is challenging to distinguish intrinsic from extrinsic influences on human immune responses, we used a personalized immune (PI) humanized mouse model, in which immune systems were generated de novo from adult human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in immunodeficient mice. We assessed the effect of recipient sex and of donor autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes [T1D] and rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) on human B-cell development in PI mice. We observed that human B-cell levels were increased in female recipients regardless of the source of human HSCs or the strain of immunodeficient recipient mice. Moreover, mice injected with T1D- or RA-derived HSCs displayed B-cell abnormalities compared with healthy control HSC-derived mice, including altered B-cell levels, increased proportions of mature B cells and reduced CD19 expression. Our study revealed an HSC-extrinsic effect of recipient sex on human B-cell reconstitution. Moreover, the PI humanized mouse model revealed HSC-intrinsic defects in central B-cell tolerance that recapitulated those in patients with autoimmune diseases.

Furthermore, studies in preclinical models suggest that decreasing IL-6 activity may mitigate or reverse some of these deficits. The purpose of this trial was to test whether an IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, would improve residual positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. We randomized 36 clinically stable, moderately symptomatic (i.e., Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) >60) individuals with schizophrenia to 3 monthly infusions of 8\u2009mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo (normal saline). The primary outcome was effect at week 12 on the PANSS Total Score. Effects on the MATRICS, other PANSS subscales, Clinical Global Impression, and Global Assessment of Functioning were secondary outcomes. There were no observed treatment effects on any behavioral outcome measure. Baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) or cytokine levels did not predict treatment outcome, nor were there correlations between changes in these inflammatory markers and the measured outcomes. As expected, IL-6 and IL-8 increased, while CRP decreased, in the tocilizumab group compared with the placebo group.

clinical researchers from around the world in the field of immunology, molecular biology and rheumatology and other specialties. During the meeting, breakout sessions were held consisting of 5 disease-specific groups with 20-40 experts assigned to each group based on clinical or scientific expertise. Specific groups included: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematous, connective tissue diseases (e.g. Sjogren's syndrome, Systemic sclerosis, vasculitis including Bechet's and IgG4 related disease), and a basic science immunology group spanning all of the above clinical domains. In each group, experts were asked to consider and update previously identified unmet needs in 3 categorical areas: basic/translational science, clinical science and therapeutic development, and clinical care. Overall, similar primary unmet needs were identified within each disease foci, and several additional needs were identified since the time of last year's congress. Within translational/basic science, the need for better understanding the heterogeneity within each disease was highlighted so that predictive tools for therapeutic responses can be developed. Within clinical science and therapeutic trials, a strong focus was placed upon the need to identify pre-clinical states of disease allowing prevention in those at risk. The ability to cure remains perhaps the ultimate unmet need. Further, the need to develop new and affordable therapeutics, as well as to conduct strategic trials of currently approved therapies was again highlighted. Within the clinical care realm, improved co-morbidity management and patient-centered care were identified as unmet needs. Lastly, it was strongly felt there was a need to develop a scientific infrastructure for well-characterized, longitudinal cohorts paired with biobanks and mechanisms to support data-sharing.

When quantifying a protein, multiple peptides are generated using a specific protease such as trypsin, thereby allowing a choice of signature peptides with robust signals. In contrast, signature peptide selection can be constrained when the goal is to monitor a specific post-translational modification (PTM) or protein isoform, as the signature peptide must include the amino acid residue(s) of PTM attachment or sequence variation. This can force the selection of a signature peptide with a weak SRM response or one that is confounded by high background.
