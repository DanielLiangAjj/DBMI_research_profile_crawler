[{"PMID": "38877037", "Title": "Dan forms condensates in neuroblasts and regulates nuclear architecture and progenitor competence in vivo.", "Abstract": "Genome organization is thought to underlie cell type specific gene expression, yet how it is regulated in progenitors to produce cellular diversity is unknown. In Drosophila, a developmentally-timed genome reorganization in neural progenitors terminates competence to produce early-born neurons. These events require downregulation of Distal antenna (Dan), part of the conserved pipsqueak DNA-binding superfamily. Here we find that Dan forms liquid-like condensates with high protein mobility, and whose size and subnuclear distribution are balanced with its DNA-binding. Further, we identify a LARKS domain, a structural motif associated with condensate-forming proteins. Deleting just 13 amino acids from LARKS abrogates Dan's ability to retain the early-born neural fate gene, hunchback, in the neuroblast nuclear interior and maintain competence in vivo. Conversely, domain-swapping with LARKS from known phase-separating proteins rescues Dan's effects on competence. Together, we provide in vivo evidence for condensate formation and the regulation of progenitor nuclear architecture underlying neuronal diversification.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Nucleus", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurons", "Protein Domains", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gillie", "Last Name": "Benchorin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard Jangwon", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maggie Jiaqi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natalia", "Last Name": "Molotkova", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Minoree", "Last Name": "Kohwi", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. mk3632@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2024Jun14"}, {"PMID": "35177098", "Title": "Enhancer of trithorax/polycomb, Corto, regulates timing of hunchback gene relocation and competence in Drosophila neuroblasts.", "Abstract": "Neural progenitors produce diverse cells in a stereotyped birth order, but can specify each cell type for only a limited duration. In the Drosophila embryo, neuroblasts (neural progenitors) specify multiple, distinct neurons by sequentially expressing a series of temporal identity transcription factors with each division. Hunchback (Hb), the first of the series, specifies early-born neuronal identity. Neuroblast competence to generate early-born neurons is terminated when the hb gene relocates to the neuroblast nuclear lamina, rendering it refractory to activation in descendent neurons.

However, the DNA sequences and proteins regulating gene-lamina interactions are largely unknown. Exploiting the developmentally timed hunchback gene movement to the lamina in Drosophila neuroblasts, we identified a 250\u00a0bp intronic element (IE) both necessary and sufficient for relocation. The IE can target a reporter transgene to the lamina and silence it. Endogenously, however, hunchback is already repressed prior to relocation. Instead, IE-mediated relocation confers a heritably silenced gene state refractory to activation in descendent neurons, which terminates neuroblast competence to specify early-born identity. Surprisingly, we found that the Polycomb group chromatin factors bind the IE and are required for lamina relocation, revealing a nuclear architectural role distinct from their well-known function in transcriptional repression.

How genome architecture is established, maintained, and regulated to promote diverse cell fates and functions are fascinating questions with important implications in development and disease.

In Drosophila, the Hunchback transcription factor acts in neural progenitors (neuroblasts) to specify early-born neurons, in part by indirectly inducing the neuronal transcription of its target genes, including the hunchback gene. We used in vivo immuno-DNA FISH and found that the hunchback gene moves to the neuroblast nuclear periphery, a repressive subnuclear compartment, precisely when competence to specify early-born fate is lost and several hours and cell divisions after termination of its transcription. hunchback movement to the lamina correlated with downregulation of the neuroblast nuclear protein, Distal antenna (Dan).
