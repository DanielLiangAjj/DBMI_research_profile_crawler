The NLRP3 inflammasome aggravates atherosclerosis; however, cellular mechanisms connecting macrophage cholesterol accumulation to inflammasome activation are poorly understood. We investigated the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cholesterol-loaded macrophages and in atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr-/- mice with defects in macrophage cholesterol efflux. We found that accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages treated with modified LDL or cholesterol crystals, or in macrophages defective in the cholesterol efflux promoting transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, leads to activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes as a result of increased cholesterol trafficking from the plasma membrane to the ER, via Aster-B. In turn, the accumulation of cholesterol in the ER activates the inositol triphosphate-3 receptor, CaMKII/JNK, and induces NLRP3 deubiquitylation by BRCC3. An NLRP3 deubiquitylation inhibitor or deficiency of Abro1, an\u00a0essential scaffolding protein in the BRCC3-containing cytosolic complex, suppressed inflammasome activation, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), and atherosclerosis in\u00a0vivo.

role of inflammasomes and their major product IL-1\u03b2 (interleukin 1\u03b2) in human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Moreover, studies in mouse models indicate a causal role of inflammasomes and IL-1\u03b2 in atherosclerosis. However, recent studies have led to a more granular view of the role of inflammasomes in atherosclerosis. Studies in hyperlipidemic mouse models suggest that prominent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a second hit such as defective cholesterol efflux, defective DNA repair, clonal hematopoiesis or diabetes. Similarly in humans some mutations promoting clonal hematopoiesis increase coronary artery disease risk in part by promoting inflammasome activation. Recent studies in mice and humans point to a wider role of the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome in promoting cardiovascular disease including in some forms of clonal hematopoiesis and diabetes.

APOC3 acts by slowing the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, but lipid-free APOC3 has recently been reported to activate an inflammasome pathway in monocytes. We therefore investigated the contribution of hematopoietic inflammasome pathways to atherosclerosis in mouse models of type 1 diabetes. LDL receptor-deficient diabetes mouse models were transplanted with bone marrow from donors deficient in NOD, LRR and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) or gasdermin D (GSDMD), an inflammasome-induced executor of pyroptotic cell death. Mice with diabetes exhibited inflammasome activation and consistently, increased plasma interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18. Hematopoietic deletions of NLRP3, AIM2, or GSDMD caused smaller atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic mice. The increased lesion necrotic core size in diabetic mice was independent of macrophage pyroptosis because hematopoietic GSDMD deficiency failed to prevent necrotic core expansion in advanced lesions.

We focus on two key efferocytosis-induced pro-resolving mediators, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), and show that efferocytosis induces prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2/cyclooxygenase 2 (Ptgs2/COX2), leading to PGE2 synthesis and PGE2-mediated induction of TGF-\u03b21. ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation by AC-activated CD36 is necessary for Ptgs2 induction, but this is insufficient owing to an ERK-DUSP4 negative feedback pathway that lowers phospho-ERK. However, subsequent AC engulfment and phagolysosomal degradation lead to Dusp4 repression, enabling enhanced p-ERK and induction of the Ptgs2-PGE2-TGF-\u03b21 pathway.

Accumulating evidence suggests that impaired hepatic clearance of cholesterol-rich TRL remnants leads to their accumulation in arteries, promoting foam cell formation and inflammation.

While fibrates and fish oils reduce TRL, they have not been uniformly successful in reducing CVD, and there is a large unmet need for new approaches to reduce remnants and CVD. Rare genetic variants that lower triglyceride levels via activation of lipolysis and associate with reduced CVD suggest new approaches to treating dyslipidemia.

Some patients with severe Covid-19 experience a cytokine storm and display evidence of inflammasome activation leading to increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18; however, other reports have suggested reduced inflammatory responses to Sars-Cov-2. In this study we have examined the effects of the Sars-Cov-2 envelope (E) protein, a virulence factor in coronaviruses, on inflammasome activation and pulmonary inflammation. In cultured macrophages the E protein suppressed inflammasome priming and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Similarly, in mice transfected with E protein and treated with poly(I:C) to simulate the effects of viral RNA, the E protein, in an NLRP3-dependent fashion, reduced expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2, levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, and macrophage infiltration in the lung. To simulate the effects of more advanced infection, macrophages were treated with both LPS and poly(I:C). In this setting the E protein increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both murine and human macrophages. Thus, the Sars-Cov-2 E protein may initially suppress the host NLRP3 inflammasome response to viral RNA while potentially increasing NLRP3 inflammasome responses in the later stages of infection. Targeting the Sars-Cov-2 E protein especially in the early stages of infection may represent a novel approach to Covid-19 therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus Envelope Proteins", "Down-Regulation", "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress", "Humans", "Inflammasomes", "Interleukin-1beta", "Janus Kinases", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Poly I-C", "RNA, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mustafa", "Last Name": "Yalcinkaya", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenli", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad N", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "Lung Biology Lab, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andriana G", "Last Name": "Kotini", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Galina A", "Last Name": "Gusarova", "Affiliation": "Lung Biology Lab, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trevor P", "Last Name": "Fidler", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eirini P", "Last Name": "Papapetrou", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jahar", "Last Name": "Bhattacharya", "Affiliation": "Lung Biology Lab, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan R", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

The causal relationship between plasma HDL-cholesterol levels and CVD has been called into question by Mendelian randomization studies and the majority of clinical trials not showing any benefit of plasma HDL-cholesterol raising drugs on CVD. Nonetheless, recent Mendelian randomization studies including an increased number of CVD cases compared to earlier studies have confirmed that HDL-cholesterol levels and CVD are causally linked. Moreover, several studies in large population cohorts have shown that the cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL inversely correlates with CVD. Cholesterol efflux pathways exert anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects by suppressing proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and inflammation and inflammasome activation in macrophages. Cholesterol efflux pathways also suppress the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages, i.e. macrophage foam cell formation. Recent single-cell RNASeq studies on atherosclerotic plaques have suggested that macrophage foam cells have lower expression of inflammatory genes than non-foam cells, probably reflecting liver X receptor activation, upregulation of ATP Binding Cassette A1 and G1 cholesterol transporters and suppression of inflammation.

Clonal haematopoiesis increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke independently of traditional risk factors1. Among the common genetic variants that give rise to clonal haematopoiesis, the JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) mutation, which increases JAK-STAT signalling, occurs at a younger age and imparts the strongest risk of premature coronary heart disease1,2. Here we show increased proliferation of macrophages and prominent formation of necrotic cores in atherosclerotic lesions in mice that express Jak2VF selectively in macrophages, and in chimeric mice that model clonal haematopoiesis. Deletion of the essential inflammasome components caspase 1 and 11, or of the pyroptosis executioner gasdermin D, reversed these adverse changes. Jak2VF lesions showed increased expression of AIM2, oxidative DNA damage and DNA replication stress, and Aim2 deficiency reduced atherosclerosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of Jak2VF lesions revealed a landscape that was enriched for inflammatory myeloid cells, which were suppressed by deletion of Gsdmd. Inhibition of the inflammasome product interleukin-1\u03b2 reduced macrophage proliferation and necrotic formation while increasing the thickness of fibrous caps, indicating that it stabilized plaques. Our findings suggest that increased proliferation and glycolytic metabolism in Jak2VF macrophages lead to DNA replication stress and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome, thereby aggravating atherosclerosis.

Diabetes Treatment.", "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes, and tight glycemic control fails to reduce the risk of developing CVD. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists, are potent insulin sensitizers with antiatherogenic properties, but their clinical use is limited by side effects. PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation on two lysine residues (K268 and K293) induces brown remodeling of white adipose tissue and uncouples the adverse effects of TZDs from insulin sensitization. Here we show that PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation confers antiatherogenic properties and retains the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZD while circumventing its detriments. We generated mice homozygous with mice with deacetylation-mimetic PPAR\u03b3 mutations K268R/K293R (2KR) on an LDL-receptor knockout (Ldlr -/- ) background. 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice showed smaller atherosclerotic lesion areas than Ldlr -/- mice, particularly in aortic arches. With rosiglitazone treatment, 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice demonstrated a residual antiatherogenic response and substantial protection against bone loss and fluid retention. The antiatherosclerotic effect of 2KR was attributed to the protection of endothelium, indicated by improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and repressed expression of proatherogenic factors including inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6, and NADPH oxidase 2. Therefore, manipulating PPAR\u03b3 acetylation is a promising therapeutic strategy to control risk of CVD in diabetes treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Atherosclerosis", "Blotting, Western", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutation", "NADPH Oxidase 2", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II", "PPAR gamma", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Receptors, LDL", "Thiazolidinediones"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Longhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Lihong", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Kraakman", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Aaron", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Qianfen", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Maria Alicia", "Last Name": "Carrillo-Sepulveda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Osteopathic Medicine, New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury, NY."}, {"First Name": "Alan R", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY lq2123@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32180554", "Title": "Antisense oligonucleotide treatment produces a type I interferon response that protects against diet-induced obesity.", "Abstract": "In mouse models, deficiency of TTC39B (T39) decreases hepatic lipogenic gene expression and protects against diet-induced steatohepatitis.

Studies have shown either anti- or proinflammatory effects of HDL in macrophages, and there is no consensus on the underlying mechanisms. Here, we interrogate the effects of HDL on inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. Approach and Results: We cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages, treated them with reconstituted HDL or HDL isolated from APOA1Tg;Ldlr-/- mice, and challenged them with lipopolysaccharide. Transcriptional profiling showed that HDL exerts a broad anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced genes and proinflammatory effect in a subset of genes enriched for chemokines. Cholesterol removal by POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine) liposomes or \u03b2-methylcyclodextrin mimicked both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of HDL, whereas cholesterol loading by POPC/cholesterol-liposomes or acetylated LDL (low-density lipoprotein) before HDL attenuated these effects, indicating that these responses are mediated by cholesterol efflux. While early anti-inflammatory effects reflect reduced TLR (Toll-like receptor) 4 levels, late anti-inflammatory effects are due to reduced IFN (interferon) receptor signaling.

Several studies in hyperlipidemic mouse models found that the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome contributes to atherosclerosis, but recent work suggests that a second hit, such as defective cholesterol efflux or accumulation of oxidized mitochondrial DNA, may be required for significant inflammasome activation.

Alternatively, plasma or ER membrane cholesterol accumulation may condition macrophages for inflammasome activation in the presence of danger-associated molecular patterns, such as oxidized LDL.

Approach and Results- We measured CMEC in 2 cohorts aged 45 to 84 years at baseline derived from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Cohort 1 comprised 465 cases with incident cardiovascular disease events during 10 years of follow-up and 465 age- and sex-matched controls; cohort 2 comprised 407 cases with progression of carotid plaque measured by ultrasonography at 2 exams >10 years and 407 similarly matched controls. Covariates and outcome events were ascertained according to the MESA protocol. CMEC level was modestly correlated with HDL cholesterol ( R=0.13; P<0.001) but was not associated with age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use, smoking status, or statin use. Higher CMEC level was significantly associated with lower odds of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 0.82 per SD of CMEC [95% CI, 0.69-0.98; P=0.031] in the fully adjusted model) in cohort 1 but higher odds of carotid plaque progression (odds ratio, 1.24 per SD of CMEC [95% CI, 1.04-1.48; P=0.018] in the fully adjusted model) in cohort 2 but without dose-response effect. In subgroup analysis within cohort 1, higher CMEC was associated with lower risk of incident coronary heart disease events (odds ratio, 0.72 per SD of CMEC (95% CI, 0.5-0.91; P=0.007) while no association was found with stroke events.

relationship between plasma HDL-C and risk for age-related macular degeneration; (iii) only some mechanisms of lowering LDL-C appeared to increase risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D); and (iv) TG-lowering

In a syngeneic murine melanoma tumor model, B16F10, mice with global deletion of SR-B1 expression exhibited increased plasma HDL cholesterol (HDLc) levels and decreased tumor volume, indicating host SR-B1 does not directly contribute to HDL-associated anti-tumor activity. In mice with myeloid-specific loss of ABCA1 (Abca1-M/-M ; A1-M/-M), tumor growth was inhibited by \u223c4.8-fold relative to wild type (WT) animals. Abcg1-M/-M (G1-M/-M) animals were also protected by 2.5-fold relative to WT, with no further inhibition of tumor growth in Abca1/Abcg1 myeloid-specific double knockout animals (DKO). Analyses of tumor-infiltrating immune cells revealed a correlation between tumor protection and decreased presence of the immune suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subsets, Ly-6G+Ly-6CLo and Ly-6GnegLy-6CHi cells.

Although the result is different to earlier studies, this is likely related to the size and duration of the trial. The benefit of anacetrapib seems to be largely explained by lowering of non-HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), rather than increases in HDL-C. Although the magnitude of benefit for coronary heart disease appeared to be moderate, in part this may have reflected aspects of the trial design. Anacetrapib treatment was associated with a small increase in blood pressure, but was devoid of major side effects and was also associated with a small reduction in diabetes mellitus.

Atherosclerosis is a heterogeneous disease in which only a small fraction of lesions lead to heart attack, stroke, or sudden cardiac death. A distinct type of plaque containing large necrotic cores with thin fibrous caps often precipitates these acute events. Here, we show that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase \u03b3 (CaMKII\u03b3) in macrophages plays a major role in the development of necrotic, thin-capped plaques. Macrophages in necrotic and symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in humans as well as advanced atherosclerotic lesions in mice demonstrated activation of CaMKII. Western diet-fed LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice with myeloid-specific deletion of CaMKII had smaller necrotic cores with concomitantly thicker collagen caps. These lesions demonstrated evidence of enhanced efferocytosis, which was associated with increased expression of the macrophage efferocytosis receptor MerTK. Mechanistic studies revealed that CaMKII\u03b3-deficient macrophages and atherosclerotic lesions lacking myeloid CaMKII\u03b3 had increased expression of the transcription factor ATF6. We determined that ATF6 induces liver X receptor-\u03b1 (LXR\u03b1), an Mertk-inducing transcription factor, and that increased MerTK expression and efferocytosis in CaMKII\u03b3-deficient macrophages is dependent on LXR\u03b1.

Insight into the mechanisms of protection of these variants may facilitate the development of new therapies for lowering TRL levels. The gene APOC3 encodes apoC-III, a critical inhibitor of triglyceride (TG) lipolysis and remnant TRL clearance. Here we report a detailed interrogation of the mechanism of TRL lowering by the APOC3 Ala43Thr (A43T) variant, the only missense (rather than protein-truncating) variant in APOC3 reported to be TG lowering and protective against CHD. We found that both human APOC3 A43T heterozygotes and mice expressing human APOC3 A43T display markedly reduced circulating apoC-III levels. In mice, this reduction is due to impaired binding of A43T apoC-III to lipoproteins and accelerated renal catabolism of free apoC-III. Moreover, the reduced content of apoC-III in TRLs resulted in accelerated clearance of circulating TRLs. On the basis of this protective mechanism, we developed a monoclonal antibody targeting lipoprotein-bound human apoC-III that promotes circulating apoC-III clearance in mice expressing human APOC3 and enhances TRL catabolism in vivo. These data reveal the molecular mechanism by which a missense variant in APOC3 causes reduced circulating TG levels and, hence, protects from CHD.

HDL mediates cholesterol efflux from immune cells via the ATP binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1/G1). The significance of impaired cholesterol efflux pathways in autoimmunity is unknown. We observed that Abca1/g1-deficient mice develop enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) and glomerulonephritis suggestive of SLE. This lupus-like phenotype was recapitulated in mice with knockouts of Abca1/g1 in dendritic cells (DCs), but not in macrophages or T\u00a0cells. DC-Abca1/g1 deficiency increased LN and splenic CD11b+ DCs, which displayed cholesterol accumulation and inflammasome activation, increased cell surface levels of the\u00a0granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor, and enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion. Consequently, DC-Abca1/g1 deficiency enhanced T\u00a0cell activation and Th1 and Th17 cell polarization. Nlrp3 inflammasome deficiency diminished the enlarged LNs and enhanced Th1 cell polarization. These findings identify an essential role of DC cholesterol efflux pathways in maintaining immune tolerance.", "Keywords": ["Abc transporters", "Nlrp3", "autoimmunity", "cholesterol efflux pathways", "cholesterol transport", "dendritic cells", "high-density lipoprotein", "inflammasome", "lupus glomerulonephritis"], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1", "Adaptive Immunity", "Animals", "Cholesterol", "Dendritic Cells", "Immune Tolerance", "Inflammasomes", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Th1 Cells", "Th17 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marit", "Last Name": "Westerterp", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, 630 West 168 Street, P&S 8-401, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Section Molecular Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, 9713 AV Groningen, the Netherlands.

This study establishes that low plasma insulin levels have a detrimental effect on two major insulin target tissues: adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Mice with increased \u03b2-cell cholesterol levels were generated by conditional deletion of the ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, in \u03b2-cells (\u03b2-DKO mice). Insulin secretion was impaired in these mice under basal and high-glucose conditions, and glucose disposal was shifted from skeletal muscle to adipose tissue. The \u03b2-DKO mice also had increased body fat and adipose tissue macrophage content, elevated plasma interleukin-6 and MCP-1 levels, and decreased skeletal muscle mass. They were not, however, insulin resistant. The adipose tissue expansion and reduced skeletal muscle mass, but not the systemic inflammation or increased adipose tissue macrophage content, were reversed when plasma insulin levels were normalized by insulin supplementation. These studies identify a mechanism by which perturbation of \u03b2-cell cholesterol homeostasis and impaired insulin secretion increase adiposity, reduce skeletal muscle mass, and cause systemic inflammation.

Despite the fact that its synthetic agonists induce fatty liver, the liver X receptor (LXR) transcription factor remains a target of interest because of its anti-atherogenic, cholesterol removal, and anti-inflammatory activities. Here we show that tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein 39B (Ttc39b, C9orf52) (T39), a high-density lipoprotein gene discovered in human genome-wide association studies, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of LXR. Chow-fed mice lacking T39 (T39(-/-)) display increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels associated with increased enterocyte ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1) expression and increased LXR protein without change in LXR messenger RNA. When challenged with a high fat/high cholesterol/bile salt diet, T39(-/-) mice or mice with hepatocyte-specific T39 deficiency show increased hepatic LXR protein and target gene expression, and unexpectedly protection from steatohepatitis and death. Mice fed a Western-type diet and lacking low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr(-/-)T39(-/-)) show decreased fatty liver, increased high-density lipoprotein, decreased low-density lipoprotein, and reduced atherosclerosis. In addition to increasing hepatic Abcg5/8 expression and limiting dietary cholesterol absorption, T39 deficiency inhibits hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1, ADD1) processing. This is explained by an increase in microsomal phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, linked to an LXR\u03b1-dependent increase in expression of enzymes mediating phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids. The preservation of endogenous LXR protein activates a beneficial profile of gene expression that promotes cholesterol removal and inhibits lipogenesis. T39 inhibition could be an effective strategy for reducing both steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 5", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 8", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Animals", "Atherosclerosis", "Bile Acids and Salts", "Cholesterol, Dietary", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Diet, High-Fat", "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated", "Fatty Liver", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hepatocytes", "Ligands", "Lipogenesis", "Lipoproteins", "Lipoproteins, HDL", "Lipoproteins, LDL", "Liver X Receptors", "Male", "Mice", "Orphan Nuclear Receptors", "Phosphatidylcholines", "Protein Stability", "Proteolysis", "Receptors, LDL", "Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1", "Ubiquitination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joanne", "Last Name": "Hsieh", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Masahiro", "Last Name": "Koseki", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew M", "Last Name": "Molusky", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emi", "Last Name": "Yakushiji", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ikuyo", "Last Name": "Ichi", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Core Research, Ochanomizu University, Bunkyo-\u2009-ku, Tokyo 112-8610, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Marit", "Last Name": "Westerterp", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jahangir", "Last Name": "Iqbal", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn (SUNY Downstate Medical Center), Brooklyn, New York 11203, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robin B", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Abramowicz", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liana", "Last Name": "Tascau", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shunichi", "Last Name": "Takiguchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shizuya", "Last Name": "Yamashita", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Carrie L", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gilbert", "Last Name": "Di Paolo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "M Mahmood", "Last Name": "Hussain", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn (SUNY Downstate Medical Center), Brooklyn, New York 11203, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jay H", "Last Name": "Lefkowitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Rader", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan R", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2016Jul14"}, {"PMID": "27340266", "Title": "High-Density Lipoproteins, Endothelial Function, and Mendelian Randomization.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Editorials", "atherosclerosis", "endothelium", "lipoproteins, HDL", "nitric oxide"], "MeSH terms": ["Atherosclerosis", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Humans", "Lipoproteins", "Lipoproteins, HDL", "Lipoproteins, LDL", "Nitric Oxide", "Random Allocation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marit", "Last Name": "Westerterp", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY (M.W., N.W., A.R.T.);

Despite ongoing advances in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Continuous retention of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in the subendothelial space causes a local overabundance of free cholesterol. Because cholesterol accumulation and deposition of cholesterol crystals (CCs) trigger a complex inflammatory response, we tested the efficacy of the cyclic oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (CD), a compound that increases cholesterol solubility in preventing and reversing atherosclerosis. We showed that CD treatment of murine atherosclerosis reduced atherosclerotic plaque size and CC load and promoted plaque regression even with a continued cholesterol-rich diet. Mechanistically, CD increased oxysterol production in both macrophages and human atherosclerotic plaques and promoted liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated transcriptional reprogramming to improve cholesterol efflux and exert anti-inflammatory effects. In vivo, this CD-mediated LXR agonism was required for the antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects of CD as well as for augmented reverse cholesterol transport. Because CD treatment in humans is safe and CD beneficially affects key mechanisms of atherogenesis, it may therefore be used clinically to prevent or treat human atherosclerosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin", "Animals", "Atherosclerosis", "Biological Transport", "Cholesterol", "Crystallization", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Liver X Receptors", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "beta-Cyclodextrins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Zimmer", "Affiliation": "Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, University Hospital Bonn, 53105 Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alena", "Last Name": "Grebe", "Affiliation": "Institute of Innate Immunity, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Siril S", "Last Name": "Bakke", "Affiliation": "Institute of Innate Immunity, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany.

HDL also inhibits lipid oxidation, restores endothelial function, exerts anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic actions, and exerts anti-inflammatory actions in animal models. Such properties could contribute considerably to the capacity of HDL to inhibit atherosclerosis. Systemic and vascular inflammation has been proposed to convert HDL to a dysfunctional form that has impaired antiatherogenic effects. A loss of anti-inflammatory and antioxidative proteins, perhaps in combination with a gain of proinflammatory proteins, might be another important component in rendering HDL dysfunctional. The proinflammatory enzyme myeloperoxidase induces both oxidative modification and nitrosylation of specific residues on plasma and arterial apolipoprotein A-I to render HDL dysfunctional, which results in impaired ABCA1 macrophage transport, the activation of inflammatory pathways, and an increased risk of coronary artery disease.

While best standards of care, including high-dose statins, can ameliorate the risk of vascular complications, patients remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i) has previously highlighted atherogenic dyslipidaemia, defined as the imbalance between proatherogenic triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein B-containing-lipoproteins and antiatherogenic apolipoprotein A-I-lipoproteins (as in high-density lipoprotein, HDL), as an important modifiable contributor to lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk, especially in insulin-resistant conditions. As part of its mission to improve awareness and clinical management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia, the R3i has identified three key priorities for action: i) to improve recognition of atherogenic dyslipidaemia in patients at high cardiometabolic risk with or without diabetes; ii) to improve implementation and adherence to guideline-based therapies; and iii) to improve therapeutic strategies for managing atherogenic dyslipidaemia. The R3i believes that monitoring of non-HDL cholesterol provides a simple, practical tool for treatment decisions regarding the management of lipid-related residual cardiovascular risk. Addition of a fibrate, niacin (North and South America), omega-3 fatty acids or ezetimibe are all options for combination with a statin to further reduce non-HDL cholesterol, although lacking in hard evidence for cardiovascular outcome benefits. Several emerging treatments may offer promise. These include the next generation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\u03b1 agonists, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors and monoclonal antibody therapy targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. However, long-term outcomes and safety data are clearly needed. In conclusion, the R3i believes that ongoing trials with these novel treatments may help to define the optimal management of atherogenic dyslipidaemia to reduce the clinical and socioeconomic burden of residual cardiovascular risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dyslipidemias", "Humans", "Learning", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jean-Charles", "Last Name": "Fruchart", "Affiliation": "R3i Foundation, St, Alban-Anlage 46, Basel, CH 4010, Switzerland. jean-charles.fruchart@r3i.org."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Davignon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel P", "Last Name": "Hermans", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Khalid", "Last Name": "Al-Rubeaan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pierre", "Last Name": "Amarenco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerd", "Last Name": "Assmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Barter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Betteridge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Bruckert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ada", "Last Name": "Cuevas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Farnier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ele", "Last Name": "Ferrannini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Fioretto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jacques", "Last Name": "Genest", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Antonio M", "Last Name": "Gotto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dayi", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takashi", "Last Name": "Kadowaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatsuhiko", "Last Name": "Kodama", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Krempf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuji", "Last Name": "Matsuzawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jes\u00fas Mill\u00e1n", "Last Name": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cort\u00e9s", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carlos Calvo", "Last Name": "Monfil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hisao", "Last Name": "Ogawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Plutzky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Rader", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shaukat", "Last Name": "Sadikot", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raul D", "Last Name": "Santos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Evgeny", "Last Name": "Shlyakhto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Piyamitr", "Last Name": "Sritara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rody", "Last Name": "Sy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chee Eng", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lale", "Last Name": "Tokg\u00f6zo\u011flu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter P", "Last Name": "Toth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Valensi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Wanner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Zambon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Junren", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Zimmet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i)", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cardiovascular diabetology", "PubDate": "2014Jan24"}, {"PMID": "24436425", "Title": "Proliferating macrophages populate established atherosclerotic lesions.", "Abstract": "A new study reveals that the majority of macrophages in established atherosclerotic lesions are derived from local proliferation, rather than from the influx of blood-borne monocytes.

These differing perspectives may be reconciled by a modified HDL theory that emphasizes the antiatherogenic role of cholesterol flux pathways, initiated in cells by ABC transporters. ABCA1 and ABCG1 control the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and multipotential progenitor cells in the bone marrow and hematopoietic stem and multipotential progenitor cell mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. Thus, activation of cholesterol efflux pathways by HDL infusions or liver X receptor activation results in suppression of hematopoietic stem and multipotential progenitor cell mobilization and extramedullary hematopoiesis, leading to decreased production of monocytes and neutrophils and suppression of atherosclerosis. In addition, macrophage-specific knockout of transporters has confirmed their role in suppression of inflammatory responses in the arterial wall. Recent studies have also shown that ABCG4, a close relative of ABCG1, controls platelet production, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. ABCG4 is highly expressed in megakaryocyte progenitors, where it promotes cholesterol efflux to HDL and controls the proliferative responses to thrombopoietin. Reconstituted HDL infusions act in an ABCG4-dependent fashion to limit hypercholesterolemia-driven excessive platelet production, thrombosis, and atherogenesis, as occurs in human myeloproliferative syndromes.

Using three different mouse models of myeloproliferative disorders, including mice with defective cholesterol efflux pathways and two models based on expression of human leukemia disease alleles, we uncovered a mechanism by which proliferating and inflammatory myeloid cells take up and oxidize glucose during the feeding period, contributing to energy dissipation and subsequent loss of adipose mass. In vivo, lentiviral inhibition of Glut1 by shRNA prevented myeloproliferation and adipose tissue loss in mice with defective cholesterol efflux pathway in leukocytes. Thus, Glut1 was necessary to sustain proliferation and potentially divert glucose from fat storage. We also showed that overexpression of the human ApoA-I transgene to raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels decreased Glut1 expression, dampened myeloproliferation, and prevented fat loss. These experiments suggest that inhibition of Glut-1 and HDL cholesterol-raising therapies could provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat the energy imbalance observed in myeloproliferative disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 1", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Apolipoprotein A-I", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Glucose", "Glucose Transporter Type 1", "Glycolysis", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Interleukin-3", "Leukocytes", "Lipoproteins", "Lipoproteins, HDL", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Inbred DBA", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myeloproliferative Disorders", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emmanuel L", "Last Name": "Gautier", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marit", "Last Name": "Westerterp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neha", "Last Name": "Bhagwat", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan", "Last Name": "Shih", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Abdel-Wahab", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "L\u00fctjohann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gwendalyn J", "Last Name": "Randolph", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ross L", "Last Name": "Levine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alan R", "Last Name": "Tall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laurent", "Last Name": "Yvan-Charvet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "PubDate": "2013Feb11"}]
