CBMN assay cultures were prepared from fresh blood samples collected before and at 4 and 24 h after the start of TBI, corresponding to doses of 1.25 Gy and 3.75 Gy, respectively.

Complete blood counts with differential recorded before and after TBI at the 24-h time point showed a rapid increase in neutrophil (p = 0.0001) and decrease in lymphocyte (p = 0.0006) counts, resulting in a highly elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of 14.45 \u00b1 1.85 after 3.75 Gy TBI (pre-exposure = 4.62 \u00b1 0.49), indicating a strong systemic inflammatory response.

We have developed a bioengineered tissue platform for studying radiation damage in individualized settings. To demonstrate its utility, we determined the effects of radiation using engineered models of two human tissues known to be radiosensitive: engineered cardiac tissues (eCT, a target of chronic radiation damage) and engineered bone marrow (eBM, a target of acute radiation damage). We report the effects of high-dose neutrons, a proxy for simulated galactic cosmic rays, on the expression of key genes implicated in tissue responses to ionizing radiation, phenotypic and functional changes in both tissues, and proof-of-principle application of radioprotective agents. We further determined the extent of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and matrix remodeling gene expression changes, and found that these changes were associated with an early hypertrophic phenotype in eCT and myeloid skewing in eBM.

Radiation biodosimetry based on gene expression analysis of peripheral blood is a valuable tool to detect exposure to radiation after a radiological/nuclear incident and obtain useful biological information that could predict tissue and organismal injury. However, confounding factors, including chronic inflammation, can potentially obscure the predictive power of the method. GADD45A (Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene a) plays important roles in cell growth control, differentiation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. GADD45A-deficient mice develop an autoimmune disease, similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus, characterized by severe hematological disorders, kidney disease, and premature death. The goal of this study was to elucidate how pre-existing inflammation in mice, induced by GADD45A ablation, can affect radiation biodosimetry. We exposed wild-type and GADD45A knockout male C57BL/6J mice to 7 Gy of X rays and 24 h later RNA was isolated from whole blood and subjected to whole genome microarray and gene ontology analyses. Dose reconstruction analysis using a gene signature trained on gene expression data from irradiated wild-type male mice showed accurate reconstruction of either a 0 Gy or 7 Gy dose with root mean square error of \u00b1 1.05 Gy (R^2 = 1.00) in GADD45A knockout mice. Gene ontology analysis revealed that irradiation of both wild-type and GADD45A-null mice led to a significant overrepresentation of pathways associated with morbidity and mortality, as well as organismal cell death. However, based on their z-score, these pathways were predicted to be more significantly overrepresented in GADD45A-null mice, implying that GADD45A deletion may exacerbate the deleterious effects of radiation on blood cells. Numerous immune cell functions and quantities were predicted to be underrepresented in both genotypes; however, differentially expressed genes from irradiated GADD45A knockout mice predicted an increased deterioration in the numbers of T lymphocytes, as well as myeloid cells, compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, an overrepresentation of genes associated with radiation-induced hematological malignancies was associated with GADD45A knockout mice, whereas hematopoietic and progenitor cell functions were predicted to be downregulated in irradiated GADD45A knockout mice. In conclusion, despite the significant differences in gene expression between wild-type and GADD45A knockout mice, it is still feasible to identify a panel of genes that could accurately distinguish between irradiated and control mice, irrespective of pre-existing inflammation status.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Inflammation", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "X-Rays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Constantinos G", "Last Name": "Broustas", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sanjay", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Shuryak", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Taraboletti", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Jerry", "Last Name": "Angdisen", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Pelagie", "Last Name": "Ake", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Albert J", "Last Name": "Fornace", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20057."}, {"First Name": "Sally A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2023Sep01"}, {"PMID": "37414809", "Title": "Biomarker integration for improved biodosimetry of mixed neutron\u2009+\u2009photon exposures.", "Abstract": "There is a persistent risk of a large-scale malicious or accidental exposure to ionizing radiation that may affect a large number of people.

Complex exposures will consist of dose rates spanning the low dose rates (LDR) to very high-dose rates (VHDR) that need to be tested for assay validation. Here, we investigate how a range of relevant dose rates affect metabolomic dose reconstruction at potentially lethal radiation exposures (8 Gy in mice) from an initial blast or subsequent fallout exposures compared to zero or sublethal exposures (0 or 3 Gy in mice) in the first 2 days, which corresponds to an integral time individuals will reach medical facilities after a radiological emergency. Biofluids (urine and serum) were collected from both male and female 9-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice at 1 and 2 days postirradiation (total doses of 0, 3 or 8 Gy) after a VHDR of 7 Gy/s. Additionally, samples were collected after a 2-day exposure consisting of a declining dose rate (1 to 0.004 Gy/min) recapitulating the 7:10 rule-of-thumb time dependency of nuclear fallout. Overall similar perturbations were observed in both urine and serum metabolite concentrations irrespective of sex or dose rate, with the exception of xanthurenic acid in urine (female specific) and taurine in serum (VHDR specific). In urine, we developed identical multiplex metabolite panels (N6, N6,N6-trimethyllysine, carnitine, propionylcarnitine, hexosamine-valine-isoleucine, and taurine) that could identify individuals receiving potentially lethal levels of radiation from the zero or sublethal cohorts with excellent sensitivity and specificity, with creatine increasing model performance at day 1. In serum, individuals receiving a 3 or 8 Gy exposure could be identified from their pre-irradiation samples with excellent sensitivity and specificity, however, due to a lower dose response the 3 vs. 8 Gy groups could not be distinguished from each other.

In this study, we determined the impact of age on the peripheral blood cell gene expression profile of female mice exposed to radiation and identified differences and similarities with a previously obtained transcriptomic signature of male mice. Young (2 months) and old (24 months) female mice were irradiated with 4 Gy X-rays, total RNA was isolated from blood 24 hours later and subjected to whole-genome microarray analysis. Dose reconstruction analyses using a gene signature trained on gene expression data from irradiated young male mice showed accurate reconstruction of 0 or 4 Gy doses with root mean square error of \u00b10.75 Gy (R2 = 0.90) in young female mice. Although dose reconstruction for irradiated old female mice was less accurate than young female mice, the deviation from the actual radiation dose was not statistically significant. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that after irradiation, apoptosis-related functions were overrepresented, whereas functions related to quantities of various immune cell subtypes were underrepresented, among differentially expressed genes from young female mice, but not older animals. Furthermore, young mice significantly upregulated genes involved in phagocytosis, a process that eliminates apoptotic cells and preserves tissue homeostasis. Both functions were also overrepresented in young, but not old, male mice following 4 Gy X-irradiation. Lastly, functions associated with neutrophil activation that is essential for killing invading pathogens and regulating the inflammatory response were predicted to be uniquely enriched in young but not old female mice.

We have previously addressed low-dose rate (LDR, \u22641 Gy/day) exposures from internal emitters on biofluid small molecule signatures, but further research on the VHDR component of the initial blast is required. Here, we exposed 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice to an acute dose of 3 Gy using a reference dose rate of 0.7 Gy/min or a VHDR of 7 Gy/s, collected urine and serum at 1 and 7 d, then compared the metabolite signatures using either untargeted (urine) or targeted (serum) approaches with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry platforms. A Random Forest classification approach showed strikingly similar changes in urinary signatures at 1 d post-irradiation with VHDR samples grouping closer to control samples at 7 d. Identical metabolite panels (carnitine, trigonelline, xanthurenic acid, N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine, spermine, and hexosamine-valine-isoleucine-OH) could differentiate IR exposed individuals with high sensitivity and specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves 0.89-1.00) irrespective of dose rate at both days. For serum, the top 25 significant lipids affected by IR exposure showed slightly higher perturbations at 0.7 Gy/min vs. 7 Gy/s; however, identical panels showed excellent sensitivity and specificity at 1 d (three hexosylceramides (16:0), (18:0), (24:0), sphingomyelin [26:1], lysophosphatidylethanolamine [22:1]). Mice could not be differentiated from control samples at 7 d for a 3 Gy exposure based on serum lipid signatures.

However, confounding factors, including chronic inflammation or immune suppression, can potentially obscure the predictive power of the method. Members of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family respond to pro-inflammatory signals and environmental stresses, whereas genetic ablation of the p38 signaling pathway in mice leads to reduced susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis that model human rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, respectively. p38 is normally regulated by the MAP3K-MAP2K pathway in mammalian cells. However, in T cells there is an alternative pathway for p38 activation that plays an important role in antigen-receptor-activated T cells and participates in immune and inflammatory responses. To examine the role of p38 in response to radiation, we used two mouse models expressing either a p38\u03b1 dominant negative (DN) mutation that globally suppresses p38 signaling or a p38\u03b1\u03b2 double-knock-in (DKI) mutant, which inhibits specifically T-cell receptor activation. We exposed p38 wild-type (p38WT) and mutant male mice to 7 Gy X rays and 24 h later whole blood was isolated subjected to whole-genome microarray and gene ontology analysis. Irradiation of p38WT mice led to a significant overrepresentation of pathways associated with morbidity and mortality, as well as organismal cell death. In contrast, these pathways were significantly underrepresented in p38DN and p38DKI mutant mice, suggesting that p38 attenuation may protect blood cells from the deleterious effects of radiation. Furthermore, radiation exposure in p38 mutant mice resulted in an enrichment of phagocytosis-related pathways, suggesting a role for p38 signaling in restricting phagocytosis of apoptotic cells after irradiation.

High-throughput radiation biodosimetry techniques for such internal exposure are needed to assess potential risks of short-term toxicity and delayed effects (e.g., carcinogenesis) for exposed individuals. Previously, we used \u03b3-H2AX to reconstruct injected 137Cs activity in experimentally-exposed mice, and converted activity values into radiation doses based on time since injection and 137Cs-elimination kinetics. In the current study, we sought to assess the feasibility and possible advantages of combining \u03b3-H2AX with transcriptomics to improve 137Cs activity reconstructions. We selected five genes (Atf5, Hist2h2aa2, Olfr358, Psrc1, Hist2h2ac) with strong statistically-significant Spearman's correlations with injected activity and stable expression over time after 137Cs injection. The geometric mean of log-transformed signals of these five genes, combined with \u03b3-H2AX fluorescence, were used as predictors in a nonlinear model for reconstructing injected 137Cs activity. The coefficient of determination (R2) comparing actual and reconstructed activities was 0.91 and root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.95 MBq. These metrics remained stable when the model was fitted to a randomly-selected half of the data and tested on the other half, repeated 100 times. Model performance was significantly better when compared to our previous analysis using \u03b3-H2AX alone, and when compared to an analysis where genes are used without \u03b3-H2AX, suggesting that integrating \u03b3-H2AX with gene expression provides an important advantage.

Pathways impacting platelet aggregation and TP53 signaling appeared activated, but not consistently at all times in the study. Clustering of genes by pattern and identification of dose-rate-independent and -dependent genes provided insight into possible drivers of the dynamic transcriptome response in vivo, and also indicated that TP53 signaling may be upstream of very different transcript response patterns.

Since neutrons generally have a high relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for most physiological end points, it is important to understand the effect that neutrons would have on the biodosimetry methods that are being developed for medical triage purposes. We previously compared the transcriptomic response in human blood after neutron and photon irradiation. In this study, we analyzed the effect of mixed-field-neutron-photon radiation on gene expression responses in human peripheral blood, to elucidate the neutron contribution in the setting of a radiation exposure from an IND detonation. We used four combinations of mixed neutron-photon exposures, with increasing percentages of neutrons, to a cumulative dose of 3 Gy. The mixed-field exposures consisted of 0%, 5%, 15% and 25% of neutrons, where 0% corresponds to 3 Gy of pure X rays. A maximum neutron exposure, corresponding to 83% neutrons (0.75 Gy) was also used in the study. Increases were observed in both the number and expression level of genes, with increasing percentages of neutrons from 0% to 25% in the mixed-field exposures. Gene ontology analysis showed an overall predominance of TP53 signaling among upregulated genes across all exposures. Some TP53 regulated genes, such as EDA2R, GDF15 and VWCE, demonstrated increased expression with increasing neutron percentages in mixed-field exposures. Immune response, specifically natural-killer-cell mediated signaling, was the most significant biological process associated with downregulated genes. We observed significant suppression of T-cell-mediated signaling in mixed-field exposures, which was absent in the response to pure photons. In this first study investigating gene expression in human blood cells exposed to mixed neutron-photon fields similar to an actual IND explosion, we have identified a number of genes responding to the 3 Gy dose that showed increasing expression as the neutron percentage increased. Such genes may serve as better indicators of the expected biological damage than a report of total physical dose, and thus provide more relevant information for treating physicians.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Blood", "Gene Ontology", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Neutrons", "Photons", "Radiation Exposure", "Relative Biological Effectiveness", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sanjay", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "a Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Veljko", "Last Name": "Grilj", "Affiliation": "b Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, Columbia University, Irvington, New York 10533."}, {"First Name": "Constantinos G", "Last Name": "Broustas", "Affiliation": "a Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shanaz A", "Last Name": "Ghandhi", "Affiliation": "a Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Andrew D", "Last Name": "Harken", "Affiliation": "b Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, Columbia University, Irvington, New York 10533."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Garty", "Affiliation": "b Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, Columbia University, Irvington, New York 10533."}, {"First Name": "Sally A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "a Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "31138230", "Title": "Effect of dose and dose rate on temporal \u03b3-H2AX kinetics in mouse blood and spleen mononuclear cells in vivo following Cesium-137 administration.", "Abstract": "Cesium-137 (137Cs) is one of the major and most clinically relevant radionuclides of concern in a radiological dispersal device, \"dirty bomb\" scenario as well as in nuclear accidents and detonations.

This work was initially focused on determining the exposure dose to an individual using biological indicators. Gene expression signatures show promise for biodosimetric application, but little is known about how these signatures might translate for the assessment of radiological injury in radiosensitive individuals, who comprise a significant proportion of the general population, and who would likely require treatment after exposure to lower doses. Using Parp1-/- mice as a model radiation-sensitive genotype, we have investigated the effect of this DNA repair deficiency on the gene expression response to radiation. Although Parp1 is known to play general roles in regulating transcription, the pattern of gene expression changes observed in Parp1-/- mice 24 h postirradiation to a LD50/30 was remarkably similar to that in wild-type mice after exposure to LD50/30. Similar levels of activation of both the p53 and NF\u03baB radiation response pathways were indicated in both strains. In contrast, exposure of wild-type mice to a sublethal dose that was equal to the Parp1-/- LD50/30 resulted in a lower magnitude gene expression response. Thus, Parp1-/- mice displayed a heightened gene expression response to radiation, which was more similar to the wild-type response to an equitoxic dose than to an equal absorbed dose. Gene expression classifiers trained on the wild-type data correctly identified all wild-type samples as unexposed, exposed to a sublethal dose or exposed to an LD50/30. All unexposed samples from Parp1-/- mice were also correctly classified with the same gene set, and 80% of irradiated Parp1-/- samples were identified as exposed to an LD50/30.

Current methods of biodosimetry, such as the dicentric chromosome assay, are time consuming and require sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel. Therefore, scalable biodosimetry approaches, including gene expression profiles in peripheral blood cells, are being investigated. Due to the limited availability of appropriate human samples, biodosimetry development has relied heavily on mouse models, which are not directly applicable to human response. Therefore, to explore the feasibility of using non-human primate (NHP) models to build and test a biodosimetry algorithm for use in humans, we irradiated ex vivo peripheral blood samples from both humans and rhesus macaques with doses of 0, 2, 5, 6 and 7 Gy, and compared the gene expression profiles 24 h later using Agilent human microarrays. Among the dose-responsive genes in human and using non-human primate, 52 genes showed highly correlated expression patterns between the species, and were enriched in p53/DNA damage response, apoptosis and cell cycle-related genes. When these interspecies-correlated genes were used to build biodosimetry models with using NHP data, the mean prediction accuracy on non-human primate samples was about 90% within 1 Gy of delivered dose in leave-one-out cross-validation.

A \"multi-gene\" approach utilizing all gene values for cross-species conversion and applying the converted values on the NHP biodosimetry models, gave a leave-one-out cross-validation prediction accuracy for human samples highly comparable (up to 94%) to that for non-human primates.

A large-scale radiological incident would result in an immediate critical need to assess the radiation doses received by thousands of individuals. Casualties will be exposed to different doses and dose rates due to their geographical position and sheltering conditions, and dose rate is one of the principal factors that determine the biological consequences of a given absorbed dose. In these scenarios, high-throughput platforms are required to identify the biological dose in a large number of exposed individuals for clinical monitoring and medical treatment. The Rapid Automated Biodosimetry Tool (RABiT) is designed to be completely automated from the input of blood sample into the machine to the output of a dose estimate. The primary goal of this paper was to quantify the dose rate effects for RABiT-measured micronuclei in vitro in human lymphocytes. Blood samples from healthy volunteers were exposed in vitro to different doses of X-rays to acute and protracted doses over a period up to 24 h. The acute dose was delivered at ~1.03 Gy/min and the low dose rate exposure at ~0.31 Gy/min. The results showed that the yield of micronuclei decreases with decreasing dose rate starting at 2 Gy, whereas response was indistinguishable from that of acute exposure in the low dose region, up to 0.5 Gy.

To study the effects of prolonged exposure to ingested radionuclides, we have performed long-term (30 day) internal-emitter mouse irradiations using soluble-injected 137CsCl and 90SrCl2 radioisotopes. The effect of ionizing radiation on the induction and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in peripheral mouse lymphocytes in vivo was determined using the \u03b3-H2AX biodosimetry marker. Using a serial sacrifice experimental design, whole-body radiation absorbed doses for 137Cs (0 to 10 Gy) and 90Sr (0 to 49 Gy) were delivered over 30 days following exposure to each radionuclide. The committed absorbed doses of the two internal emitters as a function of time post exposure were calculated based on their retention parameters and their derived dose coefficients for each specific sacrifice time. In order to measure the kinetic profile for \u03b3-H2AX, peripheral blood samples were drawn at 5 specific timed dose points over the 30-day study period and the total \u03b3-H2AX nuclear fluorescence per lymphocyte was determined using image analysis software. A key finding was that a significant \u03b3-H2AX signal was observed in vivo several weeks after a single radionuclide exposure. A mechanistically-motivated model was used to analyze the temporal kinetics of \u03b3-H2AX fluorescence. Exposure to either radionuclide showed two peaks of \u03b3-H2AX: one within the first week, which may represent the death of mature, differentiated lymphocytes, and the second at approximately three weeks, which may represent the production of new lymphocytes from damaged progenitor cells.

Gene expression was measured using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Microarrays, and the data was analyzed using BRB-ArrayTools. Between 466-6,213 genes were differentially expressed, depending on the time after 137Cs administration. At early times (2-3 days), the majority of responsive genes were expressed above control levels, while at later times (20-30 days) most responding genes were expressed below control levels. Numerous genes were overexpressed by day 2 or 3, and then underexpressed by day 20 or 30, including many Tp53-regulated genes. The same pattern was seen among significantly enriched gene ontology categories, including those related to nucleotide binding, protein localization and modification, actin and the cytoskeleton, and in the integrin signaling canonical pathway. We compared the expression of several genes three days after 137CsCl injection and three days after an acute external gamma-ray exposure, and found that the internal exposure appeared to produce a more sustained response. Many common radiation-responsive genes are altered by internally administered 137Cs, but the gene expression pattern resulting from continued irradiation at a decreasing dose rate is extremely complex, and appears to involve a late reversal of much of the initial response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cesium Radioisotopes", "Gene Ontology", "Male", "Mice", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Radiation Dosage", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sunirmal", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "a\u2009 Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shanaz A", "Last Name": "Ghandhi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Waylon", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Doyle-Eisele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dunstana", "Last Name": "Melo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raymond", "Last Name": "Guilmette", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sally A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2014Oct"}, {"PMID": "24937130", "Title": "ATM regulates insulin-like growth factor 1-secretory clusterin (IGF-1-sCLU) expression that protects cells against senescence.", "Abstract": "Downstream factors that regulate the decision between senescence and cell death have not been elucidated. Cells undergo senescence through three pathways, replicative senescence (RS), stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) and oncogene-induced senescence. Recent studies suggest that the ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM) kinase is not only a key protein mediating cellular responses to DNA damage, but also regulates cellular senescence induced by telomere end exposure (in RS) or persistent DNA damage (in SIPS). Here, we show that expression of secretory clusterin (sCLU), a known pro-survival extracellular chaperone, is transcriptionally up-regulated during both RS and SIPS, but not in oncogene-induced senescence, consistent with a DNA damage-inducible mechanism. We demonstrate that ATM plays an important role in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) expression, that in turn, regulates downstream sCLU induction during senescence. Loss of ATM activity, either by genomic mutation (ATM-deficient fibroblasts from an ataxia telangiectasia patient) or by administration of a chemical inhibitor (AAI, an inhibitor of ATM and ATR), blocks IGF-1-sCLU expression in senescent cells. Downstream, sCLU induction during senescence is mediated by IGF-1R/MAPK/Egr-1 signaling, identical to its induction after DNA damage. In contrast, administration of an IGF-1 inhibitor caused apoptosis of senescent cells. Thus, IGF-1 signaling is required for survival, whereas sCLU appears to protect cells from premature senescence, as IMR-90 cells with sCLU knockdown undergo senescence faster than control cells. Thus, the ATM-IGF-1-sCLU pathway protects cells from lethality and suspends senescence.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins", "Cell Line", "Cellular Senescence", "Clusterin", "DNA Damage", "DNA Repair", "Humans", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Stress, Physiological", "Transcriptional Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiuquan", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Radiation Oncology, Laboratory of Molecular Cell Stress Responses, Program in Cell Stress and Cancer Nanomedicine, Simmons Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Masatoshi", "Last Name": "Suzuki", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Radiation Oncology, Laboratory of Molecular Cell Stress Responses, Program in Cell Stress and Cancer Nanomedicine, Simmons Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shanaz A", "Last Name": "Ghandhi", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sally A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Boothman", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology and Radiation Oncology, Laboratory of Molecular Cell Stress Responses, Program in Cell Stress and Cancer Nanomedicine, Simmons Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24673254", "Title": "Development of a metabolomic radiation signature in urine from patients undergoing total body irradiation.", "Abstract": "The emergence of the threat of radiological terrorism and other radiological incidents has led to the need for development of fast, accurate and noninvasive methods for detection of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to extend radiation metabolomic biomarker discovery to humans, as previous studies have focused on mice. Urine was collected from patients undergoing total body irradiation at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at 4-6 h postirradiation (a single dose of 1.25 Gy) and 24 h (three fractions of 1.25 Gy each). Global metabolomic profiling was obtained through analysis with ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). Prior to further analyses, each sample was normalized to its respective creatinine level. Statistical analysis was conducted by the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Fisher's exact test and markers were validated against pure standards. Seven markers showed distinct differences between pre- and post-exposure samples. Of those, trimethyl-l-lysine and the carnitine conjugates acetylcarnitine, decanoylcarnitine and octanoylcarnitine play an important role in the transportation of fatty acids across mitochondria for subsequent fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. The remaining metabolites, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid are the final products of the purine catabolism pathway, and high levels of excretion have been associated with increased oxidative stress and radiation induced DNA damage. Further analysis revealed sex differences in the patterns of excretion of the markers, demonstrating that generation of a sex-specific metabolomic signature will be informative and can provide a quick and reliable assessment of individuals in a radiological scenario. This is the first radiation metabolomics study in human urine laying the foundation for the use of metabolomics in biodosimetry and providing confidence in biomarker identification based on the overlap between animal models and humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Humans", "Male", "Metabolomics", "Whole-Body Irradiation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Evagelia C", "Last Name": "Laiakis", "Affiliation": "a\u2009 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology, Georgetown University, Washington DC;"}, {"First Name": "Tytus D", "Last Name": "Mak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sebastien", "Last Name": "Anizan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sally A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Barker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Suzanne L", "Last Name": "Wolden", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Albert J", "Last Name": "Fornace", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}, {"PMID": "24168352", "Title": "Widespread decreased expression of immune function genes in human peripheral blood following radiation exposure.", "Abstract": "We report a large-scale reduced expression of genes in pathways related to cell-type specific immunity functions that emerges from microarray analysis 48 h after ex vivo \u03b3-ray irradiation (0, 0.5, 2, 5, 8 Gy) of human peripheral blood from five donors. This response is similar to that seen in patients at 24 h after the start of total-body irradiation and strengthens the rationale for the ex vivo model as an adjunct to human in vivo studies. The most marked response was in genes associated with natural killer (NK) cell immune functions, reflecting a relative loss of NK cells from the population. T- and B-cell mediated immunity genes were also significantly represented in the radiation response. Combined with our previous studies, a single gene expression signature was able to predict radiation dose range with 97% accuracy at times from 6-48 h after exposure.

We have developed a qRT-PCR protocol that allows us to assay multiple gene products in small samples, starting at 100 cells and going down to a single cell, and have used it to study radiation responses at the single-cell level. Since the accuracy of qRT-PCR depends greatly on the choice of \"housekeeping\" genes used for normalization, initial studies concentrated on determining the optimal panel of such genes. Using an endogenous control array, it was found that for IMR90 cells, common housekeeping genes tend to fall into one of two categories-those that are relatively stably expressed regardless of the number of cells in the sample, e.g., B2M, PPIA, and GAPDH, and those that are more variable (again regardless of the size of the population), e.g., YWHAZ, 18S, TBP, and HPRT1. Further, expression levels in commonly studied radiation-response genes, such as ATF3, CDKN1A, GADD45A, and MDM2, were assayed in 100, 10, and single-cell samples. It is here that the value of single-cell analyses becomes apparent. It was observed that the expression of some genes such as FGF2 and MDM2 was relatively constant over all irradiated cells, while that of others such as FAS was considerably more variable. It was clear that almost all cells respond to ionizing radiation but the individual responses were considerably varied. The analyses of single cells indicate that responses in individual cells are not uniform and suggest that responses observed in populations are not indicative of identical patterns in all cells. This in turn points to the value of single-cell analyses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Ponnaiya", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, VC11-240, New York, NY, 10032, USA, bp156@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sally A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shanaz A", "Last Name": "Ghandhi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lubomir B", "Last Name": "Smilenov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles R", "Last Name": "Geard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manuela", "Last Name": "Buonanno", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Radiation and environmental biophysics", "PubDate": "2013Nov"}]
