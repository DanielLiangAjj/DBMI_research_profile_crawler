Although all patients should be made aware of HIV PrEP; the diagnosis of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is an important indicator of potential HIV PrEP need. In a previous evaluation of Get2PrEP (G2P), we found that an electronic medical record laboratory comments did not increase the frequency of PrEP discussions between patients and providers. In Get2PrEP2 (G2P2), we hypothesized that active, personalized messaging to providers about HIV PrEP would increase the documentation of PrEP discussions, referrals, and/or provision of HIV PrEP to individuals diagnosed with an STI.", "Keywords": ["HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (HIV PrEP)", "ending the HIV epidemic", "provider feedback", "sexual health", "sexually transmitted infections"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Zucker", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Theodore", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Carnevale", "Affiliation": "HIV Prevention Program in the Comprehensive Health Program, Ambulatory Care Network West, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eshiemomoh", "Last Name": "Osilama", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Norman", "Last Name": "Archer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lily", "Last Name": "Bonadonna", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Wadden", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Morley", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simian", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathrine", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alwyn", "Last Name": "Cohall", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Magdalena E", "Last Name": "Sobieszczyk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Open forum infectious diseases", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38770814", "Title": "Lessons learnt from daily oral PrEP delivery to inform national planning for PrEP ring introduction for women in low-income and middle-income countries: a qualitative inquiry of international stakeholders.", "Abstract": "Some African countries plan to introduce and scale-up new long-acting pre-exposure prophylaxis methods (LA-PrEP), like the monthly dapivirine vaginal ring (PrEP ring) and injectable cabotegravir.

Surveillance, a cornerstone of disease control and prevention, can be strengthened to promote more timely, efficient, and equitable practices by incorporating health information exchange (HIE) and other large-scale health data sources into reporting. New York City patient-level electronic health record data between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were obtained from Healthix, the largest US public HIE. Healthix data were linked to neighborhood-level information from the American Community Survey. In this casecontrol study, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV-positive cases were compared to controls to estimate the odds of receiving a specific laboratory test or positive result using generalized estimating equations with logit function and robust standard errors. Among 1,519,121 tests performed for chlamydia, 1,574,772 for gonorrhea, and 1,200,560 for HIV, 2%, 0.6% and 0.3% were positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV, respectively. Chlamydia and gonorrhea co-occurred in 1,854 cases (7% of chlamydia and 21% of gonorrhea total cases). Testing behavior was often incongruent with geographic and sociodemographic patterns of positive cases. For example, people living in areas with the highest levels of poverty were less likely to test for gonorrhea but almost twice as likely to test positive compared to those in low poverty areas. Regional HIE enabled review of testing and cases using granular and complementary data not typically available given existing reporting practices. Enhanced surveillance spotlights potential incongruencies between testing patterns and STI risk in certain populations, signaling potential under- and over-testing. These and future insights derived from HIE data may be used to continuously inform public health practice and drive further improvements in provision and evaluation of services and programs.", "Keywords": ["disease surveillance", "health equity", "health information exchange", "infectious diseases", "public health informatics", "sexually transmitted infections"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Harry", "Last Name": "Reyes Nieva", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zucker", "Last Name": "Jason", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Tucker", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, new York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "No\u00e9mie", "Last Name": "Elhadad", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences", "PubDate": "2024Apr12"}, {"PMID": "38156044", "Title": "Using a Health Information Exchange to Characterize Changes in HIV Viral Load Suppression and Disparities During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York City.", "Abstract": "HIV viral suppression requires sustained engagement in care.

These illustrative examples showed organizational structures and bureaucratic processes persisting unchanged as linguistic changes on equity occurred. We posit that within this global health framework of equity, non-convergence of language purporting global health equity with static praxis is damaging on many levels. We underscore that the epistemological-praxis disconnect creates organizational psychology akin to cognitive dissonance within individuals, particularly among practitioners from the global south. This dissonance perpetuates inequity across global health organizations uniquely structurally impedes decolonization by and in the institutions that promote global health, and undermines the achievement of current goals across the global health system.

The End-The-Epidemic (EtE) initiative calls for identifying persons with HIV who remain undiagnosed, linking and retaining persons living with HIV to maximize viral suppression, and facilitate access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for patients at increased risk of HIV. HIV screening represents the first step to both the primary and secondary HIV prevention cascades. We conducted an online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey of residents at all stages of training within four residency programs at one institution in Northern Manhattan between August 2017 and August 2018. All internal medicine, emergency medicine, obstetrics and gynecology trainees, and pediatrics were invited to complete the survey via email. Of 298 eligible trainees, 142 (48%) completed the survey. Most trainees were aware of the HIV testing law and agreed that HIV testing was their responsibility, but few successfully screened most of their patients. Most trainees were not knowledgeable about non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) or PrEP, but felt that it was important to provide these services across settings. Barriers to HIV, nPEP, and PrEP varied across specialties. Ending the HIV epidemic will require efforts across clinical specialties. In this survey from an EtE jurisdiction, most trainees felt that it is important to provide HIV prevention services in most settings; however, their knowledge and comfort with HIV prevention services other than testing were low. Barriers varied across specialties, and developing specialty-specific materials for trainees may be beneficial.", "Keywords": ["HIV prevention", "HIV testing", "PEP", "PrEP", "medical resident", "medical trainee"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "HIV Infections", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "New York City", "Post-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Zucker", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Carnevale", "Affiliation": "New York-Presbyterian Hospital HIV Prevention Program, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Theodore", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathrine", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Gold", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Winetsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Scherer", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alwyn", "Last Name": "Cohall", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Magdalena", "Last Name": "Sobieszczyk", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Olender", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "AIDS patient care and STDs", "PubDate": "2021May"}, {"PMID": "33604406", "Title": "HIV-1 Infection Does Not Change Disease Course or Inflammatory Pattern of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients Presenting at a Large Urban Medical Center in New York City.", "Abstract": "The clinical impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among people with HIV (PWH) remains unclear.

Based on San Francisco's Rapid ART Program Initiative for HIV Diagnoses (RAPID) model, most iART programs in the US condense ART initiation, insurance acquisition, housing assessment, and mental health and substance use evaluation into an initial visit. However, the RAPID model does not explicitly address structural racism and homophobia, HIV-related stigma, medical mistrust, and other important factors at the time of diagnosis experienced more poignantly by African American, Latinx, men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgender patient populations. These factors negatively impact initial and subsequent HIV care engagement and exacerbate significant health disparities along the HIV care continuum. While iART has improved time to viral suppression and linkage to care rates, its association with retention in care and viral suppression, particularly in vulnerable populations, remains controversial. Considering that in the US the HIV epidemic is sharply defined by healthcare disparities, we argue that incorporating an explicit health equity approach into the RAPID model is vital to ensure those who disproportionately bear the burden of HIV are not left behind.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "antiretroviral therapy", "health equity", "rapid"], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American",

world. However, data characterizing economic determinants of condom use among female sex workers (FSW) are limited, including in Senegal. We recruited 718 FSWs via respondent-driven sampling. Bivariate and multivariable regressions were conducted to assess the associations between economic variables and condom use at last sex. Paying rent (aRR: 1.07, 95%CI 1.01-1.13) was positively associated with condom use at last sex with new clients. No statistically significant associations were found between condom use and financial responsibility for dependent children, having additional source of income, sharing sex work earnings, or the ability to borrow from other FSWs, regardless of sexual partner types. The relationship between economic marginalization and consistent condom use among sex workers is complex reinforcing the need for behavioral economic research and prevention to be integrated into HIV prevention and treatment research and programs.", "Keywords": ["Condom use", "Economic", "Female sex worker", "HIV/AIDS", "Partner type", "Senegal"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Condoms", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Safe Sex", "Senegal", "Sex Workers", "Sexual Partners", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA. fan.yang@med.unc.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sosthenes", "Last Name": "Ketende", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Larissa", "Last Name": "Jennings Mayo-Wilson", "Affiliation": "Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie E", "Last Name": "Lyons", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Liestman", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daouda", "Last Name": "Diouf", "Affiliation": "Enda Sant\u00e9, Dakar, Senegal."}, {"First Name": "Fatou M", "Last Name": "Drame", "Affiliation": "Enda Sant\u00e9, Dakar, Senegal."}, {"First Name": "Karleen", "Last Name": "Coly", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gnilane", "Last Name": "Turpin", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Souleymane", "Last Name": "Mboup", "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche en Sant\u00e9, de Surveillance Epidemiologique Et de Formations, Dakar, Senegal."}, {"First Name": "Coumba", "Last Name": "Toure-Kane", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Bacteriologie-Virologie, CHU Aristide Le Dantec, Dakar, Senegal."}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "USAID, Office of HIV/AIDS, Bureau for Global Health, Arlington, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "USAID, Office of HIV/AIDS, Bureau for Global Health, Arlington, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Halimatou", "Last Name": "Diop-Ndiaye", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Bacteriologie-Virologie, CHU Aristide Le Dantec, Dakar, Senegal."}, {"First Name": "Nafissatou", "Last Name": "Leye-Diouf", "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche en Sant\u00e9, de Surveillance Epidemiologique Et de Formations, Dakar, Senegal."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin", "Last Name": "Kennedy", "Affiliation": "Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Baral", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA."}], "Journal": "AIDS and behavior", "PubDate": "2020Oct"}, {"PMID": "32112512", "Title": "Modelling impact and cost-effectiveness of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in 13 low-resource countries.", "Abstract": "Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provision is a priority intervention for high HIV prevalence settings and populations at substantial risk of HIV acquisition.

Twelve health facilities and surrounding communities in the Mbeya Region of Tanzania were randomly assigned to intervention or control arms. Population-level effects were measured through two cross-sectional household surveys of women ages 15-49, at baseline (n = 1,299) and at 28 months following program scale-out (n = 1,250). Delivery of gender-based violence services was assessed through routine recording in health facility registers. Generalized linear mixed effects models and analysis of variance were used to test intervention effects on population and facility outcomes, respectively. At baseline, 52 percent of women reported experience of recent intimate partner violence. The odds of reporting experience of this violence decreased by 29 percent from baseline to follow-up in the absence of the intervention (time effect OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57-0.89). While the intervention contributed an additional 15 percent reduction, the effect was not statistically significant. The program, however, was found to contribute to positive, community-wide changes including less tolerance for certain forms of violence, more gender equitable norms, better knowledge about gender-based violence, and increased community actions to address violence. The program also led to increased utilization of gender-based violence services at health facilities. Nearly three times as many client visits for gender-based violence were recorded at intervention (N = 1,427) compared to control (N = 489) facilities over a 16-month period. These visits were more likely to include provision of an HIV test (55.3% vs. 19.6%, p = .002). The study demonstrated the feasibility and impact of integrating gender-based violence and HIV programming to combat both of these major public health problems. Further opportunities to scale out GBV prevention and response strategies within HIV/AIDS service delivery platforms should be pursued.

Some have interpreted early monitoring reports from new programs delivering oral PrEP to adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) as suggestive of low uptake. However, a lack of common definitions complicates interpretation of oral PrEP uptake and coverage measures, because various indicators with different meanings and uses are used interchangeably. Furthermore, operationalising these measures in real-world settings is challenged by the difficulties in defining the denominator for measuring uptake and coverage among AGYW, due to the lack of data and experience required to identify the subset of AGYW at substantial risk of HIV infection. This paper proposes an intervention-centric cascade as a framework for developing a common lexicon of metrics for uptake and coverage of oral PrEP among AGYW. In codifying these indicators, approaches to clearly define metrics for uptake and coverage are outlined, and the discussion on 'low' uptake is reframed to focus on achieving the highest possible proportion of AGYW using oral PrEP when they need and want it Recommendations are also provided for making increased investments in implementation research to better quantify the sub-group of AGYW in potential need of oral PrEP.and for improving monitoring systems to more efficiently address bottlenecks in the service delivery of oral PrEP to AGYW so that implementation can be taken to scale.",

Often implicit in the decision to limit investment in these epidemic settings are assumptions including that commercial sex is not significant to the sustained transmission of HIV, and HIV interventions designed to reach \"all segments of society\" will reach female sex workers and clients. Emerging empiric and model-based evidence is challenging these assumptions. This article highlights the frameworks and estimates used to characterize the role of sex work in HIV epidemics as well as the relevant empiric data landscape on sex work in generalized HIV epidemics and their strengths and limitations. Traditional approaches to estimate the contribution of sex work to HIV epidemics do not capture the potential for upstream and downstream sexual and vertical HIV transmission. Emerging approaches such as the transmission population attributable fraction from dynamic mathematical models can address this gap. To move forward, the HIV scientific community must begin by replacing assumptions about the epidemiology of generalized HIV epidemics with data and more appropriate methods of estimating the contribution of unprotected sex in the context of sex work.", "Keywords": ["Generalized HIV epidemics", "HIV", "Mathematical models", "Population attributable fraction", "Sex work", "Sub-Saharan Africa"], "MeSH terms": ["Africa South of the Sahara", "Communicable Disease Control", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Needs Assessment", "Prevalence", "Risk Assessment", "Sex Workers", "Sexual Behavior", "Unsafe Sex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sharmistha", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, St. Michael's Hospital, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Marie-Claude", "Last Name": "Boily", "Affiliation": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sheree", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Beyrer", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD."}, {"First Name": "James F", "Last Name": "Blanchard", "Affiliation": "Centre for Global Public Health, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Moses", "Affiliation": "Centre for Global Public Health, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "Office of HIV/AIDS, United States Agency for International Development, Washington, DC."}, {"First Name": "Nancy", "Last Name": "Phaswana-Mafuya", "Affiliation": "HIV/AIDS, STI, and Tuberculosis Department, Human Sciences Research Council, Port Elizabeth, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Vickerman", "Affiliation": "School of Social and Community Medicine, Bristol University, Bristol, UK."}, {"First Name": "Fatou", "Last Name": "Drame", "Affiliation": "Department of Geography, Universit\u00e9 Gaston-Berger, St. Louis, Senegal."}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Alary", "Affiliation": "D\u00e9partement de m\u00e9decine sociale et pr\u00e9ventive, Centre de recherche du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec-Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Stefan D", "Last Name": "Baral", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD.

For PMTCT, this gap results, in part, from inadequate adaptation of PMTCT interventions to the realities of the implementation environment, including client and health care worker behaviors and preferences, health care policies and systems, and infrastructure and resource constraints. Elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission can only be achieved through understanding of key implementation barriers and successful adaptation of scientifically proven interventions to the local environment. Central to such efforts is implementation science (IS), which aims to investigate and address major bottlenecks that impede effective implementation and to test new approaches to identifying, understanding, and overcoming barriers to the adoption, adaptation, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions. Advancing IS will require deliberate and strategic efforts to facilitate collaboration, communication, and relationship-building among researchers, implementers, and policy-makers. To speed the translation of effective PMTCT interventions into practice and advance IS more broadly, the US National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched the National Institutes of Health/President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief PMTCT IS Alliance, comprised of IS researchers, PMTCT program implementers, and policy-makers as an innovative platform for interaction and coordination.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Interinstitutional Relations", "Male", "National Institutes of Health (U.S.)", "Organizations, Nonprofit", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Sturke", "Affiliation": "*Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; \u2020Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, Washington, DC; \u2021Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; \u00a7Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator, US Department of State, Washington, DC; \u2016Anova Health Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa; \u00b6National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and #Office of Research on Women's Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Harmston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "R J", "Last Name": "Simonds", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lynne M", "Last Name": "Mofenson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George K", "Last Name": "Siberry", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "D Heather", "Last Name": "Watts", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "McIntyre", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nalini", "Last Name": "Anand", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Guay", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pim", "Last Name": "Brouwers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joan D", "Last Name": "Nagel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999)", "PubDate": "2014Nov01"}, {"PMID": "24918595", "Title": "Lessons learned from scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision focusing on adolescents: benefits, challenges, and potential opportunities for linkages with adolescent HIV, sexual, and reproductive health services.", "Abstract": "By December 2013, it was estimated that close to 6 million men had been circumcised in the 14 priority countries for scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), the majority being adolescents (10-19 years).

and innovative programming for men who have sex with men in sub-Saharan Africa.", "Abstract": "While still an understudied area, there is a growing body of studies highlighting epidemiologic data on men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) which challenge the attitudes of complacency and irrelevancy among donors and country governments that are uncomfortable in addressing key populations (KPs). While some of the past inaction may be explained by ignorance, new data document highly elevated and sustained HIV prevalence that is seemingly isolated from recent overall declines in prevalence. The articles in this series highlight new studies which focus on the stark epidemiologic burden in countries from concentrated, mixed and generalized epidemic settings. The issue includes research from West, Central, East and Southern Africa and explores the pervasive impact of stigma and discrimination as critical barriers to confronting the HIV epidemic among MSM and the intersecting stigma and marginalization found between living with HIV and sexual minority status. Interventions to remove barriers to service access, including those aimed at training providers and mobilizing communities even within stigmatized peri-urban settings, are featured in this issue, which further demonstrates the immediate need for comprehensive action to address HIV among MSM in all countries in the region, regardless of epidemic classification.", "Keywords": ["HIV programs", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "epidemiology", "men who have sex with men", "stigma and discrimination"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Africa South of the Sahara", "Data Collection", "Epidemiologic Methods", "HIV Infections", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "R Cameron", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "United States Agency for International Development, Office of HIV/AIDS, Washington, DC, USA; cwolf@usaid.gov."}, {"First Name": "Alison Surdo", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laurent", "Last Name": "Kapesa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Delivette", "Last Name": "Castor", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the International AIDS Society", "PubDate": "2013Dec02"}, {"PMID": "25276521", "Title": "\"Man, what took you so long?\" Social and individual factors affecting adult attendance at voluntary medical male circumcision services in Tanzania.", "Abstract": "In 2009, the Government of Tanzania embarked on scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services for HIV prevention in 8 priority regions, with the aim of serving 2.8 million boys and men ages 10-34 years by 2013.

Their inclusion in biomedical and behavioral research is critical to understanding and addressing HIV vulnerability. Using focus groups, we sought to understand the perceptions related to participating in biomedical research of acute/recent HIV-1 infection (AHI) using complex sampling and data collection methods to reach this hidden group at highest risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV. Given the potential impact of AHI on HIV transmission in MSM, it is important to understand this intersection for HIV prevention, care, and treatment purposes. The aim of this study was to understand how recruitment and data collection methods affect AHI research participation willingness particularly among MSM of color. Findings suggest that major barriers to research participation with complex sampling to identify AHI and intensive risk behavior collection such as diary methods are lack of anonymity, partner disclosure, and study fatigue.
