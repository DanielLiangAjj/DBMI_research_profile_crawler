Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of skin-infiltrating immune cells from the graft-induced C3H/HeJ mouse model of AA, coupled with antibody-based depletion to interrogate the functional role of specific cell types in AA in vivo. Since AA is predominantly T cell-mediated, we focused on dissecting lymphocyte function in AA. Both our scRNAseq and functional studies established CD8+ T cells as the primary disease-driving cell type in AA. Only the depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, NK, B, or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, was sufficient to prevent and reverse AA. Selective depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) showed that Treg are protective against AA in C3H/HeJ mice, suggesting that failure of Treg-mediated immunosuppression is not a major disease mechanism in AA. Focused analyses of CD8+ T cells revealed five subsets, whose heterogeneity is defined by an \"effectorness gradient\" of interrelated transcriptional states that culminate in increased effector function and tissue residency. scRNAseq of human AA skin showed that CD8+ T cells in human AA follow a similar trajectory, underscoring that shared mechanisms drive disease in both murine and human AA. Our study represents a comprehensive, systematic interrogation of lymphocyte heterogeneity in AA and uncovers a novel framework for AA-associated CD8+ T cells with implications for the design of future therapeutics.", "Keywords": ["T cells", "alopecia areata", "autoimmunity", "hair follicle", "single-cell RNA sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Humans", "Animals", "Alopecia Areata", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eunice Y", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Zhenpeng", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Abhinav", "Last Name": "Jaiswal", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10021."}, {"First Name": "Eddy Hsi Chun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Niroshana", "Last Name": "Anandasabapathy", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10021."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Christiano", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2023Jul18"}, {"PMID": "36928429", "Title": "Contamination source modeling with SCRuB improves cancer phenotype prediction from microbiome data.", "Abstract": "Sequencing-based approaches for the analysis of microbial communities are susceptible to contamination, which could mask biological signals or generate artifactual ones.

Among the most frequent chronic inflammatory skin diseases are atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, urticaria, lichen planus, and hidradenitis suppurativa, driven by a complex interplay of genetics and environmental factors. Autoimmunity is another important cause of chronic skin inflammation. The autoimmune response may be mainly T cell driven, such as in alopecia areata or vitiligo, or B cell driven in chronic spontaneous urticaria, pemphigus and pemphigoid diseases. Rare causes of chronic skin inflammation are autoinflammatory diseases, or rheumatic diseases, such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus or dermatomyositis. Whilst we have seen a significant improvement in diagnosis and treatment, several challenges remain. Especially for rarer causes of chronic skin inflammation, early diagnosis is often missed because of low awareness and lack of diagnostics. Systemic immunosuppression is the treatment of choice for almost all of these diseases. Adverse events due to immunosuppression, insufficient therapeutic responses and relapses remain a challenge. For atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, a broad spectrum of innovative treatments has been developed. However, treatment responses cannot be predicted so far. Hence, development of (bio)markers allowing selection of specific medications for individual patients is needed.

Immune checkpoint blockade enhanced the efficacy of TA99, which was associated with greater CD8+/Foxp3+, NK1.1+ and dendritic cell infiltrates, suggestive of an increased anti-tumor innate and adaptive immune responses. Further, MEK inhibition in melanoma cell lines increased the expression of melanosomal antigens in vitro, and combining TA99 and MEKi in vivo resulted in enhanced tumor control. Moreover, we found an improved therapeutic effect when YUMM tumor-bearing mice were treated with TA99 combined with MEKi and immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4). Our findings suggest that MEKi induced an increased expression of tumor-associated antigens, which in combination with anti-tumor antibodies, generated a robust adaptive anti-tumor response that was sustained by immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. We postulate that combining anti-tumor antibodies with standard-of-care strategies such as immune checkpoint blockade or targeted therapy, will improve therapeutic outcomes in cancer.", "Keywords": ["anti-tumor antibodies", "combination therapies", "immunotherapy", "melanoma", "targeted therapy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rolando", "Last Name": "P\u00e9rez-Lorenzo", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie O", "Last Name": "Erjavec", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Christiano", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Clynes", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Oncotarget", "PubDate": "2021Jan19"}, {"PMID": "33515242", "Title": "A semi-supervised model to predict regulatory effects of genetic variants at single nucleotide resolution using massively parallel reporter assays.", "Abstract": "Predicting regulatory effects of genetic variants is a challenging but important problem in functional genomics.

The spectrum of severity depends on the type of mutation in the COL7A1 gene. C7 is the major constituent of anchoring fibrils (AFs) at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Patients with RDEB lack functional C7 and have severely impaired dermal-epidermal stability, resulting in extensive blistering and open wounds on the skin that greatly affect the patient's quality of life. There are currently no therapies approved for the treatment of RDEB. Here, we demonstrated the correction of mutations in exon 19 (c.2470insG) and exon 32 (c.3948insT) in the COL7A1 gene through homology-directed repair (HDR). We used the clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas9-gRNAs system to modify induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with RDEB in both the heterozygous and homozygous states.

Patients with RDEB suffer from recurrent erosions in skin and mucous membranes and have a high risk for developing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCCs). TGF\u03b2 signaling has been associated with fibrosis and malignancy in RDEB. In this study, the activation of TGF\u03b2 signaling was demonstrated in col7a1-/- mice as early as a week after birth starting in the interdigital folds of the paws, accompanied by increased deposition of collagen fibrils and elevated dermal expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-13. Furthermore, human cord blood-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) that we previously demonstrated to significantly improve wound healing and prolong the survival of col7a1-/- mice showed the ability to suppress TGF\u03b2 signaling and MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression meanwhile upregulating anti-fibrotic TGF\u03b23 and decorin. In parallel, we cocultured USSCs in a transwell with RDEB patient-derived fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and cSCC, respectively. The patient-derived cells were constitutively active for STAT, but not TGF\u03b2 signaling. Moreover, the levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 were significantly elevated in the patient derived-keratinocytes and cSCCs. Although USSC coculture did not inhibit STAT signaling, it significantly suppressed the secretion of MMP-9 and MMP-13, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 from RDEB patient-derived cells. Since epithelial expression of these MMPs is a biomarker of malignant transformation and correlates with the degree of tumor invasion, these results suggest a potential role for USSCs in mitigating epithelial malignancy, in addition to their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic functions.

We recently demonstrated that human cord blood-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells promote wound healing and ameliorate the blistering phenotype in a RDEB (col7a1-/- ) mouse model. Here, we demonstrate significant therapeutic effect of a further novel stem cell product in RDEB, that is, human placental-derived stem cells (HPDSCs), currently being used as human leukocyte antigen-independent donor cells with allogeneic umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation in patients with malignant and nonmalignant diseases. HPDSCs are isolated from full-term placentas following saline perfusion, red blood cell depletion, and volume reduction. HPDSCs contain significantly higher level of both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic stem and progenitor cells than cord blood and are low in T cell content. A single intrahepatic administration of HPDSCs significantly elongated the median life span of the col7a1-/- mice from 2 to 7 days and an additional intrahepatic administration significantly extended the median life span to 18 days. We further demonstrated that after intrahepatic administration, HPDSCs engrafted short-term in the organs affected by RDEB, that is, skin and gastrointestinal tract of col7a1-/- mice, increased adhesion at the DEJ and deposited C7 even at 4 months after administration of HPDSCs, without inducing anti-C7 antibodies. This study warrants future clinical investigation to determine the safety and efficacy of HPDSCs in patients with severe RDEB.

We demonstrate the usefulness of our predictions by using several validation experiments. Using eQTL data from several sources, including the GTEx project, Geuvadis project, and TwinsUK cohort, we show that eQTLs in specific tissues tend to be most enriched among the predicted functional variants in relevant tissues in Roadmap. We further show how these integrated functional scores can be used for (1) deriving the most likely cell or tissue type causally implicated for a complex trait by using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and (2) estimating a tissue-based correlation matrix of various complex traits. We found large enrichment of heritability in functional components of relevant tissues for various complex traits, and FUN-LDA yielded higher enrichment estimates than existing methods. Finally, using experimentally validated functional variants from the literature and variants possibly implicated in disease by previous studies, we rigorously compare FUN-LDA with state-of-the-art functional annotation methods and show that FUN-LDA has better prediction accuracy and higher resolution than these methods.

Accordingly, Fn has been implicated in numerous wound healing studies, yet remains untested in its fibrillar conformation as found in fetal skin. Here, we show that high extensional (\u223c1.2 \u00d7105 s-1) and shear (\u223c3 \u00d7105 s-1) strain rates in rotary jet spinning (RJS) can drive high throughput Fn fibrillogenesis (\u223c10\u202fmL/min), thus producing nanofiber scaffolds that are used to effectively enhance wound healing. When tested on a full-thickness wound mouse model, Fn nanofiber dressings not only accelerated wound closure, but also significantly improved tissue restoration, recovering dermal and epidermal structures as well as skin appendages and adipose tissue.

Recent research has implicated microRNAs, a class of small noncoding RNAs, in diverse autoimmune diseases. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the role of microRNAs in AA. In this study, gene-based analyses were performed for microRNAs using data of the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis of AA to date. Nominally, significant P-values were obtained for 78 of the 617 investigated microRNAs. After correction for multiple testing, three of the 78 microRNAs remained significant. Of these, miR-30b/d was the most significant microRNA for the follow-up analyses, which also showed lower expression in the hair follicle of AA patients. Target gene analyses for the three microRNAs showed 42 significantly associated target genes. These included IL2RA, TNXB, and ERBB3, which had been identified as susceptibility loci in previous genome-wide association studies. Using luciferase assay, site-specific miR-30b regulation of the AA risk genes IL2RA, STX17, and TNXB was validated. This study implicates microRNAs in the pathogenesis of AA.

Skin is a complex tissue that hosts various specialized cell types and performs many roles including physical barrier, immune and sensory functions. Therefore, modeling skin in\u00a0vitro presents technical challenges for tissue engineering. Since the first attempts at engineering human epidermis in 1970s, there has been a growing interest in generating full-thickness skin constructs mimicking physiological functions by incorporating various skin components, such as vasculature and melanocytes for pigmentation. Development of biomimetic in\u00a0vitro human skin models with these physiological functions provides a new tool for drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine and basic research for skin biology. This goal, however, has long been delayed by the limited availability of different cell types, the challenges in establishing co-culture conditions, and the ability to recapitulate the 3D anatomy of the skin. Recent breakthroughs in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and microfabrication techniques such as 3D-printing have allowed for building more reliable and complex in\u00a0vitro skin models for pharmaceutical screening. In this review, we focus on the current developments and prevailing challenges in generating skin constructs with vasculature, skin appendages such as hair follicles, pigmentation, immune response, innervation, and hypodermis. Furthermore, we discuss the promising advances that iPSC technology offers in order to generate in\u00a0vitro models of genetic skin diseases, such as epidermolysis bullosa and psoriasis. We also discuss how future integration of the next generation human skin constructs onto microfluidic platforms along with other tissues could revolutionize the early stages of drug development by creating reliable evaluation of patient-specific effects of pharmaceutical agents. Impact statement Skin is a complex tissue that hosts various specialized cell types and performs many roles including barrier, immune, and sensory functions. For human-relevant drug testing, there has been a growing interest in building more physiological skin constructs by incorporating different skin components, such as vasculature, appendages, pigment, innervation, and adipose tissue. This paper provides an overview of the strategies to build complex human skin constructs that can faithfully recapitulate human skin and thus can be used in drug development targeting skin diseases. In particular, we discuss recent developments and remaining challenges in incorporating various skin components, availability of iPSC-derived skin cell types and in\u00a0vitro skin disease models. In addition, we provide insights on the future integration of these complex skin models with other organs on microfluidic platforms as well as potential readout technologies for high-throughput drug screening.", "Keywords": ["Skin constructs", "drug testing", "microphysiological systems", "skin-on-a-chip"], "MeSH terms": ["Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Lab-On-A-Chip Devices", "Microchip Analytical Procedures", "Microfluidics", "Regenerative Medicine", "Skin", "Skin Diseases", "Tissue Engineering"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H E", "Last Name": "Abaci", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zongyou", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanne", "Last Name": "Doucet", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joanna", "Last Name": "Jack\u00f3w", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Christiano", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)", "PubDate": "2017Nov"}, {"PMID": "28300084", "Title": "Alopecia areata.", "Abstract": "Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder characterized by transient, non-scarring hair loss and preservation of the hair follicle.

Skin biopsies of affected skin show a lymphocytic infiltrate in and around the bulb or the lower part of the hair follicle in the anagen (hair growth) phase. A breakdown of immune privilege of the hair follicle is thought to be an important driver of alopecia areata. Genetic studies in patients and mouse models have shown that alopecia areata is a complex, polygenic disease. Several genetic susceptibility loci were identified to be associated with signalling pathways that are important to hair follicle cycling and development.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease with a lifetime risk of 1.7%; there are no FDA-approved treatments for AA. We previously identified a dominant IFN-\u03b3 transcriptional signature in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in human and mouse AA skin and showed that treatment with JAK inhibitors induced durable hair regrowth in mice by targeting this pathway. Here, we investigated the use of the oral JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AA. METHODS. We initiated an open-label clinical trial of 12 patients with moderate-to-severe AA, using oral ruxolitinib, 20 mg twice per day, for 3-6 months of treatment followed by 3 months follow-up off drug. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with 50% or greater hair regrowth from baseline to end of treatment. RESULTS. Nine of twelve patients (75%) demonstrated a remarkable response to treatment, with average hair regrowth of 92% at the end of treatment. Safety parameters remained largely within normal limits, and no serious adverse effects were reported. Gene expression profiling revealed treatment-related downregulation of inflammatory markers, including signatures for CTLs and IFN response genes and upregulation of hair-specific markers. CONCLUSION. In this pilot study, 9 of 12 patients (75%) treated with ruxolitinib showed significant scalp hair regrowth and improvement of AA. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to further assess the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in the treatment of AA. TRIAL REGISTRATION. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01950780. FUNDING.

Recently, we showed that IFN-\u03b3-producing NKG2D(+)CD8(+) T cells actively infiltrate the hair follicle and are responsible for its destruction in C3H/HeJ AA mice. Our transcriptional profiling of human and mouse alopecic skin showed that the IFN pathway is the dominant signaling pathway involved in AA. We showed that IFN-inducible chemokines (CXCL9/10/11) are markedly upregulated in the skin of AA lesions, and further, that the IFN-inducible chemokine receptor, CXCR3, is upregulated on alopecic effector T cells. To demonstrate whether CXCL9/10/11 chemokines were required for development of AA, we treated mice with blocking Abs to CXCR3, which prevented the development of AA in the graft model, inhibiting the accumulation of NKG2D(+)CD8(+) T cells in the skin and cutaneous lymph nodes. These data demonstrate proof of concept that interfering with the Tc1 response in AA via blockade of IFN-inducible chemokines can prevent the onset of AA.

Understanding of the pathophysiology of AA is increasing, due in part to recent genetic findings implicating common variants at several genetic loci. To date, no study has investigated the contribution of copy number variants (CNVs) to AA, a prominent class of genomic variants involved in other autoimmune disorders. Here, we report a genomewide- and a candidate gene-focused CNV analysis performed in a cohort of 585 patients with AA and 1340 controls of Central European origin. A nominally significant association with AA was found for CNVs in the following five chromosomal regions: 4q35.2, 6q16.3, 9p23, 16p12.1 and 20p12.1. The most promising finding was a 342.5-kb associated region in 6q16.3 (duplications in 4/585 patients; 0/1340 controls). The duplications spanned the genes MCHR2 and MCHR2-AS1, implicated in melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) signalling. These genes have not been implicated in previous studies of AA pathogenesis. However, previous research has shown that MCHR2 affects the scale colour of barfin flounder fish via the induction of melanin aggregation. AA preferentially affects pigmented hairs, and the hair of patients with AA frequently shows a change in colour when it regrows following an acute episode of AA. This might indicate a relationship between AA, pigmentation and MCH signalling. In conclusion, the present results provide suggestive evidence for the involvement of duplications in MCHR2 in AA pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["MCHR2", "alopecia areata", "copy number variants", "genetic complex disorder", "molecular genetics"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alopecia Areata", "Belgium", "Chromosome Mapping", "Cohort Studies", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Europe", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Germany", "Humans", "Hypothalamic Hormones", "Male", "Melanins", "Netherlands", "Pigmentation", "Pituitary Hormones", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Receptors, Pituitary Hormone", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Johannes", "Last Name": "Fischer", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Franziska", "Last Name": "Degenhardt", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Hofmann", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Silke", "Last Name": "Redler", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "F Buket", "Last Name": "Basmanav", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stefanie", "Last Name": "Heilmann-Heimbach", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Hanneken", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kathrin A", "Last Name": "Giehl", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hans", "Last Name": "Wolff", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Susanne", "Last Name": "Moebus", "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Roland", "Last Name": "Kruse", "Affiliation": "Dermatological Practice, Paderborn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gerhard", "Last Name": "Lutz", "Affiliation": "Hair & Nail, Dermatological Practice, Wesseling, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Bettina", "Last Name": "Blaumeiser", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, University and University Hospital of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Markus", "Last Name": "B\u00f6hm", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Garcia Bartels", "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Center for Hair and Skin Science, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ulrike", "Last Name": "Blume-Peytavi", "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Center for Hair and Skin Science, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Petukhova", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Christiano", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus M", "Last Name": "N\u00f6then", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Regina C", "Last Name": "Betz", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Journal": "Experimental dermatology", "PubDate": "2017Jun"}, {"PMID": "27153397", "Title": "Mechanisms and Disease Associations of Haplotype-Dependent Allele-Specific DNA Methylation.", "Abstract": "Haplotype-dependent allele-specific methylation (hap-ASM) can impact disease susceptibility, but maps of this phenomenon using stringent criteria in disease-relevant tissues remain sparse.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive view of the role and regulation of cell-cell adhesion in prostate cancer aggressiveness by examining the functional implications of both E-cadherin and Desmoglein 2 (DSG2). E-cadherin expression was first examined using immunofluorescence in 50 normal prostate tissues and in a cohort of 414 prostate cancer patients. Correlation and survival analyses were performed to assess its clinical significance. In primary prostate cancer patients, reduced expression of both E-cadherin and DSG2 is significantly associated with an earlier biochemical recurrence. Transgenic DU145 E-cadherin knockdown and constitutively active AKT overexpression lines were generated. Functional implications of such genetic alterations were analyzed in vitro and in vivo, the latter by using tumorigenesis as well as extravasation and metastatic tumor formation assays. We observed that loss of E-cadherin leads to impaired primary and metastatic tumor formation in vivo, suggesting a tumor promoter role for E-cadherin in addition to its known role as a tumor suppressor. Activation of AKT leads to a significant reduction in E-cadherin expression and nuclear localization of Snail, suggesting a role for the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the transient repression of E-cadherin. This reduced expression may be regulated by separate mechanisms as neither the loss of E-cadherin nor activation of AKT significantly affected DSG2 expression.

The small scale of the design reduces the amount of culture medium and the number of cells required by 36 fold compared to conventional transwell cultures. Our HSE-on-a-chip platform has the capability to recirculate the medium at desired flow rates without the need for pump or external tube connections. We demonstrate that the platform can be used to maintain HSEs for three weeks with proliferating keratinocytes similar to conventional HSE cultures. Immunohistochemistry analyses show that the differentiation and localization of keratinocytes was successfully achieved, establishing all sub-layers of the epidermis after one week. Basal keratinocytes located at the epidermal-dermal interface remain in a proliferative state for three weeks. We use a transdermal transport model to show that the skin barrier function is maintained for three weeks. We also validate the capability of the HSE-on-a-chip platform to be used for drug testing purposes by examining the toxic effects of doxorubucin on skin cells and structure.

Many drugs fail toxicity testing during clinical trials, since the cells on which they have been tested do not adequately model three-dimensional tissues or their interaction with other organs in the body. There is a need to develop microphysiological systems that reliably represent both an intact tissue and also the interaction of a particular tissue with other systems throughout the body. As the port of entry for many drugs is via topical delivery, the skin is the first line of exposure, and also one of the first organs to demonstrate a reaction after systemic drug delivery.

However, multiple attempts to recapitulate this process in humans using human dermal papilla cells in human skin have failed, suggesting that human dermal papilla cells lose key inductive properties upon culture. Here, we performed global gene expression analysis of human dermal papilla cells in culture and discovered very rapid and profound molecular signature changes linking their transition from a 3D to a 2D environment with early loss of their hair-inducing capacity. We demonstrate that the intact dermal papilla transcriptional signature can be partially restored by growth of papilla cells in 3D spheroid cultures.
