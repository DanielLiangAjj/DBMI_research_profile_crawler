Growing research highlights dopaminergic alterations in adult OCD, yet pediatric studies are limited by methodological constraints. This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N\u2009=\u2009135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n\u2009=\u200964 had an OCD diagnosis. N\u2009=\u200947 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.51) and ventral tegmental area (p\u2009=\u20090.006, d\u2009=\u20090.50).

Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.001, d\u2009=\u20091.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms.

Conventional neuroimaging approaches rely on group averages that assume homogenous patient populations. If subgroups are present, these approaches can increase variability and can lead to discrepancies in the literature. They can also obscure differences between various subgroups. To address this issue, we used unsupervised machine learning to identify subgroup clusters of patients with OCD who were assessed by task-based fMRI. We predominantly focused on activation of cognitive control and performance monitoring neurocircuits, including three large-scale brain networks that have been implicated in OCD (the frontoparietal network, cingulo-opercular network, and default mode network). Participants were patients with OCD (n\u2009=\u2009128) that included both adults (ages 24-45) and adolescents (ages 12-17), as well as unaffected controls (n\u2009=\u200964). Neural assessments included tests of cognitive interference and error processing. We found three patient clusters, reflecting a \"normative\" cluster that shared a brain activation pattern with unaffected controls (65.9% of clinical participants), as well as an \"interference hyperactivity\" cluster (15.2% of clinical participants) and an \"error hyperactivity\" cluster (18.9% of clinical participants). We also related these clusters to demographic and clinical correlates. After post-hoc correction for false discovery rates, the interference hyperactivity cluster showed significantly longer reaction times than the other patient clusters, but no other between-cluster differences in covariates were detected. These findings increase precision in patient characterization, reframe prior neurobehavioral research in OCD, and provide a starting point for neuroimaging-guided treatment selection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Adolescent", "Humans", "Young Adult", "Middle Aged", "Child", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Unsupervised Machine Learning", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Brain", "Brain Mapping"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alessandro S", "Last Name": "De Nadai", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA. adenadai@txstate.edu."}, {"First Name": "Kate D", "Last Name": "Fitzgerald", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luke J", "Last Name": "Norman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefanie R", "Last Name": "Russman Block", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin A", "Last Name": "Mannella", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph A", "Last Name": "Himle", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephan F", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2023Jan"}, {"PMID": "35149958", "Title": "Self-regulation and Psychopathology in Young Children.", "Abstract": "The current study examined concurrent relationships between children's self-regulation, measured behaviorally and by parent-report, and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

This notion is further supported by use of the same treatments-cognitive behavioral therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitor medication-for managing both OCD and non-OCD anxiety disorders in clinical settings. While early intervention with these gold standard treatments is recommended for pediatric OCD and anxiety disorders, young patients often remain symptomatic even after treatment. To guide the development of novel, mechanistically targeted treatments to better resolve OCD and anxiety symptoms, the identification of neural circuits underlying psychological constructs with relevance across disorders has been recommended. One construct that may be relevant for understanding pediatric OCD and anxiety disorders is cognitive control, given the difficulty that young patients experience in dismissing obsessions, compulsions, and worry despite recognition that these symptoms are excessive and unreasonable. In this review, we examine findings from a growing body of literature implicating brain-behavioral markers of cognitive control in pediatric OCD and anxiety disorders, including before and after treatment.

At the same time, neuroimaging studies of OCD have had notable limitations, including reliance on relatively small samples. International collaborative efforts to increase statistical power by combining samples from across sites have been bolstered by the ENIGMA consortium; this provides specific technical expertise for conducting multi-site analyses, as well as access to a collaborative community of neuroimaging scientists. In this article, we outline the background to, development of, and initial findings from ENIGMA's OCD working group, which currently consists of 47 samples from 34 institutes in 15 countries on 5 continents, with a total sample of 2,323 OCD patients and 2,325 healthy controls. Initial work has focused on studies of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, structural connectivity, and brain lateralization in children, adolescents and adults with OCD, also including the study on the commonalities and distinctions across different neurodevelopment disorders. Additional work is ongoing, employing machine learning techniques. Findings to date have contributed to the development of neurobiological models of OCD, have provided an important model of global scientific collaboration, and have had a number of clinical implications. Importantly, our work has shed new light on questions about whether structural and functional alterations found in OCD reflect neurodevelopmental changes, effects of the disease process, or medication impacts. We conclude with a summary of ongoing work by ENIGMA-OCD, and a consideration of future directions for neuroimaging research on OCD within and beyond ENIGMA.", "Keywords": ["ENIGMA", "MRI", "cortical

Some methodologists claim that a one-stage individual-participant data (IPD) mega-analysis can be superior to a two-stage aggregated data meta-analysis, since more detailed computations can be performed in a mega-analysis. Before definitive conclusions regarding the performance of either method can be drawn, it is necessary to critically evaluate the methodology of, and results obtained by, meta- and mega-analyses. Methods: Here, we compare the inverse variance weighted random-effect meta-analysis model with a multiple linear regression mega-analysis model, as well as with a linear mixed-effects random-intercept mega-analysis model, using data from 38 cohorts including 3,665 participants of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We assessed the effect sizes and standard errors, and the fit of the models, to evaluate the performance of the different methods. Results: The mega-analytical models showed lower standard errors and narrower confidence intervals than the meta-analysis. Similar standard errors and confidence intervals were found for the linear regression and linear mixed-effects random-intercept models. Moreover, the linear mixed-effects random-intercept models showed better fit indices compared to linear regression mega-analytical models. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that results obtained by meta- and mega-analysis differ, in favor of the latter. In multi-center studies with a moderate amount of variation between cohorts, a linear mixed-effects random-intercept mega-analytical framework appears to be the better approach to investigate structural neuroimaging data.", "Keywords": ["IPD meta-analysis", "MRI", "linear mixed-effect models", "mega-analysis", "neuroimaging"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Premika S W",
