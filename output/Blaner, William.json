[{"PMID": "37713257", "Title": "Discovery of Nonretinoid Inhibitors of CRBP1: Structural and Dynamic Insights for Ligand-Binding Mechanisms.", "Abstract": "The dysregulation of retinoid metabolism has been linked to prevalent ocular diseases including age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease. Modulating retinoid metabolism through pharmacological approaches holds promise for the treatment of these eye diseases. Cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1) is the primary transporter of all-trans-retinol (atROL) in the eye, and its inhibition has recently been shown to protect mouse retinas from light-induced retinal damage. In this report, we employed high-throughput screening to identify new chemical scaffolds for competitive, nonretinoid inhibitors of CRBP1. To understand the mechanisms of interaction between CRBP1 and these inhibitors, we solved high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the protein in complex with six selected compounds. By combining protein crystallography with hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we quantified the conformational changes in CRBP1 caused by different inhibitors and correlated their magnitude with apparent binding affinities. Furthermore, using molecular dynamic simulations, we provided evidence for the functional significance of the \"closed\" conformation of CRBP1 in retaining ligands within the binding pocket. Collectively, our study outlines the molecular foundations for understanding the mechanism of high-affinity interactions between small molecules and CRBPs, offering a framework for the rational design of improved inhibitors for this class of lipid-binding proteins.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular", "Ligands", "Vitamin A", "Eye", "Carrier Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Plau", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Morgan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Thiel College, Greenville, Pennsylvania 16125, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yuriy", "Last Name": "Fedorov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Surajit", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14850, United States."}, {"First Name": "Drew J", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edward W", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marcin", "Last Name": "Golczak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2023Oct20"}, {"PMID": "37648113", "Title": "Dietary Vitamin A Affects the Function of Incretin-Producing Enteroendocrine Cells in Male Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.", "Abstract": "Retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is an intracellular carrier for vitamin A in the absorptive enterocytes.

Alternatively, retinoids in the mouse hypothalamus were altered through retinol-binding protein 4 (Rbp4) gene knockdown.

Misfolding and deposition of transthyretin or prealbumin protein causes ATTR-CM in the context of a normal (wild-type) or variant TTR sequence. Variant ATTR-CM is most commonly caused by the substitution of valine for isoleucine at position 122 in transthyretin (Val122Ile or pV142I, almost exclusively observed in individuals of West African ancestry), demonstrated in 3.4% of self-identified Black individuals in the United States with an estimated 1.5\u2009million carriers. Despite the large number of known pV142I carriers, the proportion of older Black patients with heart failure attributable to ATTR-CM remains unknown. Methods To address this knowledge gap, the SCAN-MP (Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis with Nuclear Imaging in Minority Populations) study was funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R01HL139671) to enroll a targeted population of self-identified, community-dwelling Black or Caribbean Hispanic patients (many of whom are of West African ancestry) >60\u2009years of age with heart failure and identify ATTR-CM by noninvasive nuclear imaging. The principal objective of SCAN-MP is to determine the prevalence of ATTR-CM in this population. Secondary objectives will explore TTR genotype, demographics, progression of variant versus wild-type ATTR-CM, and biochemical mechanisms of transthyretin amyloid fibril formation. Conclusions The SCAN-MP study is the largest, prospective study of cardiac amyloidosis in Black and Hispanic individuals. Both wild-type and variant ATTR-CM are now treatable with the US Food and Drug-approved drug tafamidis. The insights gained from SCAN-MP are likely to improve those at risk for or afflicted with ATTR-CM.

The lack of Rbp4 appeared to have a greater impact on scotopic rod-mediated responses than on cone function at early ages. Also, despite severely impaired delivery of retinol, bisretinoid lipofuscin that forms as a byproduct of the visual cycle was measurable by HPLC and by quantitative fundus autofluorescence. In mice carrying an Rpe65 amino acid variant that slows visual cycle kinetics, Rbp4 deficiency had a less pronounced effect on 11-cis-retinal levels.

Alcohol is known to deplete hepatic vitamin A content, which has been linked to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. It has been suggested that induction of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) contributes to alcohol-induced hepatic vitamin A depletion, but the possible contributions of other retinoid-catabolizing CYPs have not been well studied. The main objective of this study was to better understand alcohol-induced hepatic vitamin A depletion and test the hypothesis that alcohol-induced depletion of hepatic vitamin A is due to CYP-mediated oxidative catabolism. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of chronic alcohol consumption, including wild type and Cyp2e1 -/- mice. Our results show that chronic alcohol consumption is associated with decreased levels of hepatic retinol, retinyl esters, and retinoic acid. Moreover, the depletion of hepatic retinoid is associated with the induction of multiple retinoid catabolizing CYPs, including CYP26A1, and CYP26B1 in alcohol fed wild type mice. In Cyp2e1 -/- mice, alcohol-induced retinol decline is blunted but retinyl esters undergo a change in their acyl composition and decline upon alcohol exposure like WT mice. In conclusion, the alcohol induced decline in hepatic vitamin A content is associated with increased expression of multiple retinoid-catabolizing CYPs, including the retinoic acid specific hydroxylases CYP26A1 and CYP26B1.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Retinoids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Afroza", "Last Name": "Ferdouse", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Rishi R", "Last Name": "Agrawal", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Madeleine A", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Remodeling-Related Cardiovascular Diseases, Ministry of Education, Beijing Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Disorders, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robin D", "Last Name": "Clugston", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "34115520", "Title": "Vitamin A and Vitamin E: Will the Real Antioxidant Please Stand Up?", "Abstract": "Vitamin A, acting through its metabolite, all-trans-retinoic acid, is a potent transcriptional regulator affecting expression levels of hundreds of genes through retinoic acid response elements present within these genes.

This apparent contradiction in the understanding of how vitamin A acts mechanistically within the body is a major focus of this review. Vitamin E, which is generally understood to act as a lipophilic antioxidant protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids present in membranes, is often proposed to be a transcriptional regulator. The evaluation of this claim is another focus of the review. We conclude that vitamin A is an indirect antioxidant, whose indirect function is to transcriptionally regulate a number of genes involved in mediating the body's canonical antioxidant responses. Vitamin E, in addition to being a direct antioxidant, prevents the increase of peroxidized lipids that alter both metabolic pathways and gene expression profiles within tissues and cells. However, there is little compelling evidence that vitamin E has a direct transcriptional mechanism like that of vitamin A.

To better understand the physiological role of CRBP2, we determined its protein-lipid interactome using a fluorescence-based retinol replacement assay adapted for a high-throughput screening format. By examining chemical libraries of bioactive lipids, we provided evidence for the selective interaction of CRBP2 with a subset of nonretinoid ligands with the highest affinity for sn-1 and sn-2 MAGs that contain polyunsaturated C18-C20 acyl chains. We also elucidated the structure-affinity relationship for nonretinoid ligands of this protein. We further dissect the molecular basis for this ligand's specificity by analyzing high-resolution crystal structures of CRBP2 in complex with selected derivatives of MAGs. Finally, we identify T51 and V62 as key amino acids that enable the broadening of ligand selectivity to MAGs in CRBP2 as compared with retinoid-specific CRBP1.

Studies of mice lacking Rbp2 establish that Rbp2 is not required in times of dietary retinoid-sufficiency.

Our study provides new insights into molecular interactions between PCBs and retinoids (vitamin A and its metabolites) by defining a role for constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in the disruption of retinoid homeostasis by non-coplanar 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153). Administration of four weekly 50\u202fmg/kg doses of PCB153 to C57BL/6 male mice resulted in a significant decline in the tissue concentrations of retinyl esters, retinol and all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), while no decline in hepatic and adipose tissue retinoid levels were detected in Car-null littermates. Our data imply that disrupted retinoid homeostasis occurs as a consequence of PCB153-induced activation of CAR, and raise the possibility that CAR signaling can affect atRA homeostasis in vivo. A strong correlation between the changes in retinoid metabolism and extensive upregulation of hepatic CAR-driven Cyp2b10 expression implicates this CYP isoform as contributing to retinoid homeostasis disruption via atRA oxidation during PCB153 exposure. In response to PCB153-induced CAR activation and disruption of retinoid homeostasis, expression of hepatic Pepck, Cd36 and adipose tissue Ppar\u03b3, Cd36, Adipoq, and Rbp4 were altered; however, this was reversed by administration of exogenous dietary retinoids (300\u202fIU daily for 4\u202fweeks).

This functional coordination of L-Fabp with Plin5 was 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent and was eliminated by AMPK inhibition.

Mutant mice exhibited increased levels of retinoic acid-responsive genes, including p21, and decreased oxidative stress as evaluated by serum and liver markers.

The extensive distribution of BPA in the environment poses risks to humans. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying BPA toxicity as well as its effective detoxification and elimination are not well understood. We have investigated specifically for BPA the notion raised in the literature that the optimal sensing, detoxification, and elimination of xenobiotics requires retinoid (natural derivatives and synthetic analogs of vitamin A) actions. The objective of the study was to explore how retinoids, both those stored in the liver and those originating from recent oral intake, help maintain an optimal xenobiotic detoxification response, affecting mRNA expression and activities of elements of xenobiotic detoxification system upon BPA administration to mice. Wild-type and mice lacking hepatic retinoid stores (Lrat-/-) were acutely treated with BPA (50\u2009mg/kg body weight), with or without oral supplementation with retinyl acetate. Hepatic mRNA expression levels of the genes encoding nuclear receptors and their downstream targets involved in xenobiotic biotransformation, phase I and phase II enzyme activities, and levels of oxidative damage to cellular proteins and lipids in hepatic microsomes, mitochondria and cytosol, were assessed. BPA treatment induced hepatic activities needed for its detoxification and elimination in wild-type mice. However, BPA failed to induce these activities in the livers of Lrat-/- mice. Oral supplementation with retinyl acetate restored phase I and phase II enzyme activities, but accelerated BPA-induced oxidative damage through enhancement of non-mitochondrial ROS production. Thus, the activities of the enzymes involved in the hepatic elimination of BPA require hepatic retinoid stores. The extent of hepatic damage that arises from acute BPA intoxication is directly affected by retinoid administration during the period of BPA exposure and hepatic retinoid stores that have accumulated over the lifetime of the organism.", "Keywords": ["cytochrome P450", "hepatic stellate cells", "retinoic acid", "retinyl esters", "vitamin A", "xenobiotics", "oxidative stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Benzhydryl Compounds", "Inactivation, Metabolic", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Phenols", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Retinoids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Igor O", "Last Name": "Shmarakov", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Chernivtsi National University, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}, {"First Name": "Vira L", "Last Name": "Borschovetska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Chernivtsi National University, Chernivtsi, Ukraine."}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology", "PubDate": "2017May01"}, {"PMID": "27830502", "Title": "Vitamin A Absorption, Storage and Mobilization.", "Abstract": "It is well established that chylomicron remnant (dietary) vitamin A is taken up from the circulation by hepatocytes, but more than 80 % of the vitamin A in the liver is stored in hepatic stellate cells (HSC).

Since retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), a protein that is required for mobilizing stored vitamin A, is synthesized solely by hepatocytes and not HSCs, it similarly is not known how vitamin A is transferred from HSCs to hepatocytes. Although it has long been thought that RBP4 is absolutely essential for delivering vitamin A to tissues, recent research has proven that this notion is incorrect since total RBP4-deficiency is not lethal. In addition to RBP4, vitamin A is also found in the circulation bound to lipoproteins and as retinoic acid bound to albumin.

Herein, we explored a potential non-adrenergic mechanism by which Lcn2 regulates thermogenesis and lipid metabolism. We found that Lcn2 is a retinoic acid target gene, and retinoic acid concurrently stimulated UCP1 and Lcn2 expression in adipocytes. Lcn2 KO mice exhibited a blunted effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on body weight and fat mass, lipid metabolism, and retinoic acid signaling pathway activation in adipose tissue under the high fat diet-induced obese condition. We further demonstrated that Lcn2 is required for the full action of ATRA on the induction of UCP1 and PGC-1\u03b1 expression in brown adipocytes and the restoration of cold intolerance in Lcn2 KO mice. Interestingly, we discovered that Lcn2 KO mice have decreased levels of retinoic acid and retinol in adipose tissue. The protein levels of STRA6 responsible for retinol uptake were significantly decreased in adipose tissue. The retinol transporter RBP4 was increased in adipose tissue but decreased in the circulation, suggesting the impairment of RBP4 secretion in Lcn2 KO adipose tissue. Moreover, Lcn2 deficiency abolished the ATRA effect on RBP4 expression in adipocytes. All the data suggest that the decreased retinoid level and action are associated with impaired retinol transport and storage in adipose tissue in Lcn2 KO mice.

Using ontological analysis of global gene expression studies, we demonstrate that many genes involved in retinoic acid (RA) synthesis or regulated by RA are differentially expressed in human tissues and ASCs from subcutaneous and visceral fat. The endogenous level of RA is higher in visceral ASCs; this is associated with upregulation of the RA synthesis gene through the visceral-specific developmental factor WT1. Excessive RA-mediated activity impedes the adipogenic capability of ASCs at early but not late stages of adipogenesis, which can be reversed by antagonism of RA receptors or knockdown of WT1.

Liver accounts for 70% of total body retinoid stores. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major micronutrient deficiency around the world. The provitamin A carotenoid, \u03b2-carotene, is a significant source of vitamin A in the diet. \u03b2-Carotene 15,15' oxygenase-1 (BCO1) and \u03b2-carotene 9',10' oxygenase-2 (BCO2) are the two known carotenoid cleavage enzymes in humans. BCO1 and BCO2 are highly expressed in liver and intestine. Hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells are two main cell types involved in the hepatic metabolism of retinoids. Stellate-like cells in the intestine also show ability to store vitamin A. Liver is also known to accumulate carotenoids, however, their uptake, retention and metabolism in specific liver and intestinal cell types is still unknown. Hence, we studied the cellular and subcellular expression and localization of BCO1 and BCO2 proteins in rat liver and intestine. We demonstrate that both BCO1 and BCO2 proteins are localized in hepatocytes and mucosal epithelium. We also show that BCO1 is also highly expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and portal endothelial cells in liver. At the subcellular level in liver, BCO1 is found in cytosol, while BCO2 is found in mitochondria. In intestine, immunohistochemistry showed strong BCO1 immunoreactivity in the duodenum, particularly in Brunner's glands.

Freshly isolated HSCs from Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-/-) mice have increased lipid droplet (LD) size, but the functional consequences of this are unknown. Our aim was to determine whether LXRs link cholesterol to retinoid storage in HSCs and how this impacts activation. Primary HSCs from Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-/-) and wild-type mice were profiled by gene array during in vitro activation. Lipid content was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Primary HSCs were treated with nuclear receptor ligands, transfected with small interfering RNA and plasmid constructs, and analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-/-) HSCs have increased cholesterol and retinyl esters. The retinoid increase drives intrinsic retinoic acid receptor signaling, and activation occurs more rapidly in Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-/-) HSCs. We identify Rab18 as a novel retinoic acid-responsive, LD-associated protein that helps mediate stellate cell activation. Rab18 mRNA, protein, and membrane insertion increase during activation. Both Rab18 guanosine triphosphatase activity and isoprenylation are required for stellate cell LD loss and induction of activation markers. These phenomena are accelerated in Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-/-) HSCs, where there is greater retinoic acid flux.

The enhanced recruitment of ROR\u03b3 to ROREs in their promoter region, increased histone acetylation, and reporter and mutation analysis support the concept that ROR\u03b3 regulates the transcription of several lipid metabolic genes directly by binding ROREs in their promoter regulatory region.

We determined that the severity of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance that mice develop when fed a HFD is in part a consequence of osteoblast-dependent insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in osteoblasts led to a decrease in circulating levels of the active form of osteocalcin, thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance developed in osteoblasts as the result of increased levels of free saturated fatty acids, which promote insulin receptor ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.

Our data suggests that alcohol feeding initially stimulates a futile cycle of RE hydrolysis and synthesis, and that the change in RE acyl composition is associated with a change in the acyl composition of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. The alcohol-induced change in RE acyl composition was specific to the liver, and was not seen in lung or white adipose tissue. This shift in hepatic RE fatty acyl composition is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and may be an early biomarker for events associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acyltransferases", "Adipose Tissue, White", "Alcohol Drinking", "Animals", "Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase", "Diterpenes", "Esterification", "Esters", "Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase", "Hydrolysis", "Liver", "Liver Diseases, Alcoholic", "Lung", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Phosphatidylcholines", "Retinyl Esters", "Vitamin A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robin D", "Last Name": "Clugston", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Man Xia", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul D", "Last Name": "Berk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ira J", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Li-Shin", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "23914132", "Title": "The retina rapidly incorporates ingested C20-D\u2083-vitamin A in a swine model.", "Abstract": "To determine how the retina uses vitamin A for vision, we studied the flux of oral vitamin A into and out of the swine retina.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Absorption", "Animals", "Deuterium", "Male", "Models, Animal", "Models, Biological", "Retina", "Sus scrofa", "Vitamin A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Doina M", "Last Name": "Mihai", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongfeng", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Romanov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ilyas", "Last Name": "Washington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular vision", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23847122", "Title": "Vitamin E: the enigmatic one!", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Vitamin E", "Vitamin E Deficiency"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Blaner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of lipid research", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23839944", "Title": "The STRA6 receptor is essential for retinol-binding protein-induced insulin resistance but not for maintaining vitamin A homeostasis in tissues other than the eye.", "Abstract": "The plasma membrane protein STRA6 is thought to mediate uptake of retinol from its blood carrier retinol-binding protein (RBP) into cells and to function as a surface receptor that, upon binding of holo-RBP, activates a JAK/STAT cascade.

To investigate these activities in vivo, we generated and analyzed Stra6-null mice. We show that the contribution of STRA6 to retinol uptake by tissues in vivo is small and that, with the exception of the eye, ablation of Stra6 has only a modest effect on retinoid homeostasis and does not impair physiological functions that critically depend on retinoic acid in the embryo or in the adult.

To determine how LpL affects the biology of adipose tissue, we created adipose-specific LpL knock-out (ATLO) mice, and we compared them with whole body LpL knock-out mice rescued with muscle LpL expression (MCK/L0) and wild type (WT) mice. ATLO LpL mRNA and activity were reduced, respectively, 75 and 70% in gonadal adipose tissue (GAT), 90 and 80% in subcutaneous tissue, and 84 and 85% in brown adipose tissue (BAT). ATLO mice had increased plasma TG levels associated with reduced chylomicron TG uptake into BAT and lung. ATLO BAT, but not GAT, had altered TG composition. GAT from MCK/L0 was smaller and contained less polyunsaturated fatty acids in TG, although GAT from ATLO was normal unless LpL was overexpressed in muscle. High fat diet feeding led to less adipose in MCK/L0 mice but TG acyl composition in subcutaneous tissue and BAT reverted to that of WT. Therefore, adipocyte LpL in BAT modulates plasma lipoprotein clearance, and the greater metabolic activity of this depot makes its lipid composition more dependent on LpL-mediated uptake.

However, key features of alcohol-related human heart disease are not consistently reproduced in animal models. Accordingly, we studied cardiac histology, contractile function, cardiomyocyte long chain fatty acid (LCFA) uptake, and gene expression in male C57BL/6J mice consuming 0, 10, 14, or 18% ethanol in drinking water for 3months. At sacrifice, all EtOH groups had mildly decreased body and increased heart weights, dose-dependent increases in cardiac triglycerides and a marked increase in cardiac fatty acid ethyl esters. [(3)H]-oleic acid uptake kinetics demonstrated increased facilitated cardiomyocyte LCFA uptake, associated with increased expression of genes encoding the LCFA transporters CD36 and Slc27a1 (FATP1) in EtOH-fed animals. Although SCD-1 expression was increased, lipidomic analysis did not indicate significantly increased de novo LCFA synthesis. By echocardiography, ejection fraction (EF) and the related fractional shortening (FS) of left ventricular diameter during systole were reduced and negatively correlated with cardiac triglycerides. Expression of myocardial PGC-1\u03b1 and multiple downstream target genes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, including several in the electron transport and ATP synthase complexes of the inner mitochondrial membrane, were down-regulated. Cardiac ATP was correspondingly reduced. The data suggest that decreased expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and its target genes result in decreased cardiac ATP levels, which may explain the decrease in myocardial contractile function caused by chronic EtOH intake.
