Bile acids (BA) support fat digestion and undergo microbial metabolization in the gut. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an important modulator of the BA homeostasis. The capacity of inhibiting cancer-related processes when activated, make FXR an appealing therapeutic target.

In multiple GC mouse models, nociceptive nerves demonstrated the greatest degree of nerve expansion in an NGF-dependent manner. Neural tracing identified CGRP+ peptidergic neurons as the primary gastric sensory neurons. Three-dimensional co-culture models showed that sensory neurons directly connect with gastric cancer spheroids through synapse-like structures. Chemogenetic activation of sensory neurons induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Pharmacological ablation of sensory neurons or treatment with CGRP inhibitors suppressed tumor growth and extended survival.

We developed a curated list of 502 genes for monogenic disorders associated with liver phenotypes and analyzed ES data for these genes in 758 patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). For comparison, we examined ES data in 7856 self-declared healthy controls (HC), and 2187 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Candidate pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants were initially identified in 19.9% of participants, most of which were attributable to previously reported pathogenic variants with implausibly high allele frequencies. After variant annotation and filtering based on population minor allele frequency (MAF\u2009\u2264\u200910-4 for dominant disorders and MAF\u2009\u2264\u200910-3 for recessive disorders), we detected a significant enrichment of P/LP variants in the CLD cohort compared to the HC cohort (X2 test OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.06-8.18, p value\u2009=\u20094.5e-12). A second-level manual annotation was necessary to capture true pathogenic variants that were removed by stringent allele frequency and quality filters. After these sequential steps, the diagnostic rate of monogenic disorders was 5.7% in the CLD cohort, attributable to P/LP variants in 25 genes. We also identified concordant liver disease phenotypes for 15/22 kidney disease patients with P/LP variants in liver genes, mostly associated with cystic liver disease phenotypes. Sequencing results had many implications for clinical management, including familial testing for early diagnosis and management, preventative screening for associated comorbidities, and in some cases for therapy. Exome sequencing provided a 5.7% diagnostic rate in CLD patients and required multiple rounds of review to reduce both false positive and false negative findings. The identification of concordant phenotypes in many patients with P/LP variants and no known liver disease also indicates a potential for predictive testing for selected monogenic liver disorders.",

Sub-epithelial PDGFRAHi myofibroblasts are principal sources of BMP ligands and two molecularly distinct pools distribute asymmetrically along antral glands but together fail to support epithelial growth in vitro. In contrast, PDGFRALo CD55+ cells strategically positioned beneath gastric glands promote epithelial expansion in the absence of other cells or factors.

Deletion of p63 results in extensive neuroendocrine differentiation in the developing mouse esophagus and esophageal progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells. In human esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (eNEC) cells, p63 is transcriptionally silenced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Upregulation of the major p63 isoform \u0394Np63\u03b1, through either ectopic expression or EZH2 inhibition, promotes squamous transdifferentiation of eNEC cells.

The L2-IL-1\u03b2 transgenic mice, expressing human interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 in the oral, esophageal and forestomach squamous epithelia feature chronic inflammation and a stepwise development of Barrett's esophagus-like metaplasia, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma at the squamo-columnar junction. However, the functional consequences of IL-1\u03b2-mediated chronic inflammation in the oral and esophageal squamous epithelia remain elusive. We report for the first time that in addition to the previously described Barrett's esophagus-like metaplasia, the L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice also develop squamous epithelial dysplasia with progression to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the esophagus and the tongue. L2-IL-1\u03b2 showed age-dependent progression of squamous dysplasia to SCC with approximately 40% (n\u2009=\u200949) and 23.5% (n\u2009=\u200917) incidence rates for esophageal and tongue invasive SCC respectively, by 12-15\u00a0months of age. Interestingly, SCC development and progression in L2-IL-1\u03b2 was similar in both Germ Free (GF) and Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) conditions. Immunohistochemistry revealed a T cell predominant inflammatory profile with enhanced expression of Ki67, Sox2 and the DNA double-strand break marker, \u03b3-H2AX, in the dysplastic squamous epithelia of L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, immunomodulatory players, chemoattractants for inflammatory cells (T cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages) and oxidative damage marker, iNOS, were significantly increased in the esophageal and tongue tissues of L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice.

The cellular cause of OA is unknown. Here, using lineage tracing in mice, we show that the BMP-antagonist Gremlin 1 (Grem1) marks a novel chondrogenic progenitor (CP) cell population in the articular surface that generates joint cartilage and subchondral bone during development and adulthood. Notably, this CP population is depleted in injury-induced OA, and with age. OA is also induced by toxin-mediated ablation of Grem1 CP cells in young mice. Transcriptomic analysis and functional modelling in mice revealed articular surface Grem1-lineage cells are dependent on Foxo1; ablation of Foxo1 in Grem1-lineage cells led to early OA. This analysis identified FGFR3 signalling as a therapeutic target, and injection of its activator, FGF18, caused proliferation of Grem1-lineage CP cells, increased cartilage thickness, and reduced OA pathology. We propose that OA arises from the loss of CP cells at the articular surface secondary to an imbalance in progenitor cell homeostasis and present a new progenitor population as a locus for OA therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jia Q", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Toghrul H", "Last Name": "Jafarov", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher B", "Last Name": "Little", "Affiliation": "Raymond Purves Bone & Joint Research Laboratories, Kolling Institute, University of Sydney Faculty of Medicine and Health, Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Leonards, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Tongtong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Abdullah", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Georgette A", "Last Name": "Radford", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Vrbanac", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mari", "Last Name": "Ichinose", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Whittle", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Hunter", "Affiliation": "Northern Clinical School, University of Sydney, St. Leonards, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Tamsin Rm", "Last Name": "Lannagan", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Nobumi", "Last Name": "Suzuki", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jarrad M", "Last Name": "Goyne", "Affiliation": "Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Hiroki", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Haynes", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Danijela", "Last Name": "Menicanin", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Stan", "Last Name": "Gronthos", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Daniel L", "Last Name": "Worthley", "Affiliation": "Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Susan L", "Last Name": "Woods", "Affiliation": "Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Mar30"}, {"PMID": "37028407", "Title": "Graded BMP signaling within intestinal crypt architecture directs self-organization of the Wnt-secreting stem cell niche.", "Abstract": "Signals from the surrounding niche drive proliferation and suppress differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the bottom of intestinal crypts.

Fn encodes a unique amyloid-like adhesin, FadA complex (FadAc), consisting of intact pre-FadA and cleaved mature FadA, to promote colorectal cancer tumorigenesis. We aimed to evaluate circulating anti-FadAc antibody levels as a biomarker for colorectal cancer. Circulating anti-FadAc IgA and IgG levels were measured by ELISA in two study populations. In study 1, plasma samples from patients with colorectal cancer (n = 25) and matched healthy controls (n = 25) were obtained from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Plasma levels of anti-FadAc IgA were significantly increased in patients with colorectal cancer (mean \u00b1 SD: 1.48 \u00b1 1.07 \u03bcg/mL) compared with matched healthy controls (0.71 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcg/mL; P = 0.001). The increase was significant in both early (stages I and II) and advanced (stages III and IV) colorectal cancer. In study 2, sera from patients with colorectal cancer (n = 50) and patients with advanced colorectal adenomas (n = 50) were obtained from the Weill Cornell Medical Center biobank. Anti-FadAc antibody titers were stratified according to the tumor stage and location. Similar as study 1, serum levels of anti-FadAc IgA were significantly increased in patients with colorectal cancer (2.06 \u00b1 1.47 \u03bcg/mL) compared with patients with colorectal adenomas (1.49 \u00b1 0.99 \u03bcg/mL; P = 0.025). Significant increase was limited to proximal cancers, but not distal tumors. Anti-FadAc IgG was not increased in either study population, suggesting that Fn likely translocates through the gastrointestinal tract and interact with colonic mucosa.

Here, we use primary intestinal organoids modeling homeostatic, injured and tumorigenic epithelia to assess how the fibroblast-derived EGF family ligands neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and epiregulin (EREG) regulate the intestinal epithelium. NRG1 was expressed exclusively in the stroma, robustly increased crypt budding and protected intestinal epithelial organoids from radiation-induced damage. NRG1 also induced regenerative features in the epithelium, including a fetal-like transcriptome, suppression of the Lgr5+ stem cell pool and remodeling of the epithelial actin cytoskeleton. Intriguingly, unlike EGF and EREG, NRG1 failed to support the growth of pre-tumorigenic intestinal organoids lacking the tumor suppressor Apc, commonly mutated in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Interestingly, high expression of stromal NRG1 was associated with improved survival in CRC cohorts, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function.

IMCs produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which promotes LEC lymphangiogenesis and upregulation of pro-regenerative factors including RSPO3. Moreover, we found that IMC recruitment into the intestine is driven by invading microbial signals.

Infection with the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori has been linked to iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The H.\u00a0pylori virulence factor cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) is proposed to be especially pertinent in iron deficiency. Male INS-GAS/FVB mice were infected with the CagA+ strain pre-murine Sydney strain 1 (PMSS1) for 12-13 or 27-29 weeks to investigate the role of chronic H.\u00a0pylori infection in iron deficiency and neurological sequelae. Mice at both timepoints demonstrated significantly elevated gastric histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokines compared to sham-dosed controls. However, only mice at 27-29 weeks post infection had changes in hematological parameters, with significantly decreased erythrocyte count, hematocrit, serum hemoglobin, and increased serum total iron binding capacity. Gastric transcription of iron-regulatory genes Hamp and Bmp4 were significantly downregulated at both timepoints. In the brain, iron-dependent myelingergic and synaptic markers were significantly downregulated at 27-29 weeks. These results indicated that long-term infection of the CagA\u00a0+\u00a0PMSS1 strain of H.\u00a0pylori in this study caused anemia, altered gastric iron homeostasis, and neurological changes similar to those reported in other rodent H.\u00a0pylori CagA- strain infection models.", "Keywords": ["Helicobacter pylori", "INS-GAS mouse", "Iron deficiency anemia", "Pre-murine Sydney strain 1"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Animals", "Helicobacter pylori", "Iron", "Anemia, Iron-Deficiency", "Iron Deficiencies", "Brain", "Helicobacter Infections", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Melissa I", "Last Name": "Stair", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Animal Resource Program, Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, Winston Salem, NC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Caroline Bodi", "Last Name": "Winn", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Department of Comparative Medicine, Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical, Pfizer, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Monika A", "Last Name": "Burns", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hilda", "Last Name": "Holcombe", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen C", "Last Name": "Artim", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Merck Research Laboratories, Merck, South San Francisco, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhongming", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zeli", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sureshkumar", "Last Name": "Muthupalani", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Olga", "Last Name": "Franco-Mahecho", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen", "Last Name": "Ennis", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael K", "Last Name": "Georgieff", "Affiliation": "Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "James G", "Last Name": "Fox", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States.

Thus far, the roles of these ectopic epithelial cells in alveolar regeneration remain controversial. Here, we confirm that the ectopic tuft cells are originated from EBCs in mouse models and COVID-19 lungs. The differentiation of tuft cells from EBCs is promoted by Wnt inhibition while suppressed by Notch inhibition. Although progenitor functions have been suggested in other organs, pulmonary tuft cells don't proliferate or give rise to other cell lineages. Consistent with previous reports, Trp63CreERT2 and KRT5-CreERT2-labeled ectopic EBCs do not exhibit alveolar regeneration potential. Intriguingly, when tamoxifen was administrated post-viral infection, Trp63CreERT2 but not KRT5-CreERT2 labels islands of alveolar epithelial cells that are negative for EBC biomarkers. Furthermore, germline deletion of Trpm5 significantly increases the contribution of Trp63CreERT2-labeled cells to the alveolar epithelium.

Recent studies suggest a link between intestinal bacteria and mammary cancer. Here, we report that female ApcMin/+ mice infected with Helicobacter hepaticus exhibited an increased mammary and small/large intestine tumor burden compared with uninfected littermates. H. hepaticus DNA was detected in small/large intestine, mammary tumors, and adjacent lymph nodes, suggesting a migration pathway. CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) infiltrated and expressed high levels of Wnts, likely enhancing tumorigenesis through activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Our previous studies indicated that histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) marks a population of myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells and granulocytic MDSCs. Cytokines/chemokines secreted by IL-17-expressing mast cells and tumor tissues promoted Hdc+ MDSCs expansion and trafficking toward mammary tumors. Adoptive transfer of MDSCs isolated from H. hepaticus-infected mice increased MDSCs frequencies in peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, mammary gland, and lymph nodes in recipient ApcMin/+ mice. The adoptive transfer of H. hepaticus primed MDSCs also increased the size and number of mammary tumors. Our results demonstrate that H. hepaticus can translocate from the intestine to mammary tissues to promote mammary tumorigenesis with MDSCs. Targeting bacteria and MDSCs may be useful for the prevention and therapy of extraintestinal cancers.

The in vitro assays indicated that AURKA promoted IRE1\u03b1 protein phosphorylation, activating prosurvival UPR in FLO-1 and OE33 cells. The use of acidic bile salts to mimic reflux conditions in patients induced high AURKA and IRE1\u03b1 levels. This induction was abrogated by AURKA knockdown in EAC cells.

The kinase DCLK1 and intestinal Dclk1-positive cells have been reported to contribute to intestinal regeneration. Although Dclk1-positive cells are present in adult enteric ganglia, their cellular identity and response to acute injury have not been investigated in detail. Here, we reveal the presence of distinct Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like and Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types in adult myenteric ganglia. These ganglionic cells demonstrate distinct patterns of tracing over time yet show a similar expansion in response to elevated serotonergic signaling. Interestingly, Dclk1-tdTom+ glial-like and neuronal cell types appear resistant to acute irradiation injury-mediated cell death. Moreover, Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells show prominent changes in gene expression profiles induced by injury, in contrast to Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b- neuronal cell types. Finally, subsets of Dclk1-tdTom+/CD49b+ glial-like cells demonstrate prominent overlap with Nestin and p75NTR and strong responses to elevated serotonergic signaling or acute injury.

BE- development and its progression to cancer is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, there is currently no molecular risk prediction model that accurately identifies patients at high risk for EAC. Here, we investigated the impact of shortened telomeres in a mouse model for Barrett esophagus (L2-IL1B). The L2-IL1B mouse model is characterized by IL-1\u03b2-mediated inflammation, which leads to a Barrett-like metaplasia in the transition zone between the squamous forestomach and glandular cardia/stomach. Telomere shortening was achieved by mTERC knockout. In the second generation (G2) of mTERC knockout L2-IL1B.mTERC-/- G2 mice exhibited telomere dysfunction with significantly shorter telomeres as measured by qFISH compared to L2-IL1B mice, correlating with stronger DNA damage in the form of phosphorylation of H2AX (\u03b3H2AX). Macroscopically, tumor area along the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) was increased in L2-IL1B.mTERC-/- G2 mice, along with increased histopathological dysplasia. In vitro studies indicated increased organoid formation capacity in BE tissue from L2-IL1B.mTERC-/- G2 mice. In addition, pilot studies of human BE-, dysplasia- and EAC tissue samples confirmed that BE epithelial cells with or without dysplasia (LGD) had shorter telomeres compared to gastric cardia tissue. Of note, differentiated goblet cells retained longer telomeres than columnar lined BE epithelium. In conclusion, our studies suggest that shortened telomeres are functionally important for tumor development in a mouse model of BE and are associated with proliferating columnar epithelium in human BE.

Changes in composition or structure of bacterial communities in the stomach, either at the time of exposure or over the course of H. pylori infection, may contribute to gastric pathology. In this study, a population of 37 patients from the low-gastric-cancer-risk (LGCR) region of Tumaco, Colombia, and the high-gastric-cancer-risk (HGCR) region of T\u00faquerres, Colombia, were recruited for gastric endoscopy. Antral biopsy specimens were processed for histology and bacterial isolation. Fifty-nine distinct species among 26 genera were isolated by aerobic, anaerobic, and microaerobic culture and confirmed by 16S rRNA analysis. Urease-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were frequently isolated from gastric biopsy specimens. We asked whether coinfection of H. pylori with urease-positive S. salivarius and/or S. epidermidis had a demonstrable effect on H. pylori-induced gastritis in the germfree (GF) INS-GAS mouse model. Coinfections with S. salivarius and/or S. epidermidis did not affect gastric H. pylori colonization. At 5\u2009months postinfection, GF INS-GAS mice coinfected with H. pylori and S. salivarius had statistically higher pathological scores in the stomachs than mice infected with H. pylori only or H. pylori with S. epidermidis (P\u2009<\u20090.05). S. epidermidis coinfection with H. pylori did not significantly change stomach pathology, but levels of the proinflammatory cytokine genes Il-1\u03b2, Il-17A , and Il-22 were significantly lower than in H. pylori-monoinfected mice. This study demonstrates that non-H. pylori urease-positive bacteria may play a role in the severity of H. pylori-induced gastric cancer in humans. IMPORTANCE Chronic infection with H. pylori is the main cause of gastric cancer, which is a global health problem. In two Colombian populations with high levels of H. pylori prevalence, the regional gastric cancer rates are considerably different. Host genetic background, H. pylori biotype, environmental toxins, and dietary choices are among the known risk factors for stomach cancer. The potential role of non-H. pylori gastric microbiota in gastric carcinogenesis is being increasingly recognized. In this study, we isolated 59 bacterial species from 37 stomach biopsy samples of Colombian patients from both low-gastric-cancer-risk and high-gastric-cancer-risk regions. Urease-positive S. epidermidis and S. salivarius commonly cultured from the stomachs, along with H. pylori, were inoculated into germfree INS-GAS mice. S. salivarius coinfection with H. pylori induced significantly higher gastric pathology than in H. pylori-monoinfected mice, whereas S. epidermidis coinfection caused significantly lower H. pylori-induced proinflammatory cytokine responses than in H. pylori-monoinfected mice.

In meta-organisms, dietary components are digested and metabolized by the host and its gut microbiota. Fructose has been shown to induce proliferation and cell growth in pancreas and colon cancer cell lines and also alter the gut microbiota. In a previous study with the L2-IL-1B mouse model, we showed that a high-fat diet (HFD) accelerated EAC progression from its precursor lesion Barrett's esophagus (BE) through changes in the gut microbiota. Aiming to investigate whether a high-fructose diet (HFrD) also alters the gut microbiota and favors EAC carcinogenesis, we assessed the effects of HFrD on the phenotype and intestinal microbial communities of L2-IL1B mice. Results showed a moderate acceleration in histologic disease progression, a mild effect on the systemic inflammatory response, metabolic changes in the host, and a shift in the composition, metabolism, and functionality of intestinal microbial communities.

The physiological contribution of epithelial Wnt to tissue homeostasis remains unclear. We show here that blocking epithelial Wnts affects colonic Reg4+ epithelial cell differentiation and impairs colonic epithelial regeneration after injury in mice. Single-cell RNA analysis of intestinal stroma showed that the majority of Wnt-producing cells were contained in transgelin (Tagln+) and smooth muscle actin \u03b12 (Acta2+) expressing populations. We genetically attenuated Wnt production from these stromal cells using Tagln-Cre and Acta2-CreER drivers, and found that blockage of Wnt release from either epithelium or Tagln+ and Acta2+ stromal cells impaired colonic epithelial healing after chemical-induced injury. Aggregated blockage of Wnt release from both epithelium and Tagln+ or Acta2+ stromal cells drastically diminished epithelial repair, increasing morbidity and mortality.

gain traction for applications, such as hydrogen storage, it is essential to form the as-synthesized powder materials into shaped bodies with high packing densities to maximize their volumetric performance. Mechanical compaction, which involves compressing the materials at high pressure, has been reported to yield high monolith density but often results in a significant loss in accessible porosity. Herein, we sought to systematically control (1) crystal size, (2) solvation, and (3) compacting pressure in the pelletization process to achieve high packing density without compromising the porosity that makes MOFs functional. It was determined that solvation is the most critical factor among the three factors examined. Solvation that exceeds the pore volume prevents the framework from collapsing, allowing for porosity to be maintained through pelletization. Higher pelletization pressure results in higher packing density, with extensive loss of porosity being observed at a higher pressure if the solvation is below the pore volume. Lastly, we observed that the morphology and size of the MOF particles result in variation in the highest achievable packing efficiency, but these numbers (75%) are still greater than many existing techniques used to form MOFs. We concluded that the application of pressure through pelletization is a suitable and widely applicable technique for forming high-density MOF-monoliths.", "Keywords": ["formation", "formulation", "hydrogen storage", "metal\u2212organic frameworks", "monolith", "pelletization"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ashley M", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "William J", "Last Name": "Hoover", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Stoffel", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rachelle K", "Last Name": "Richardson", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Roberto C", "Last Name": "Flores", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Siegfried", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nicolaas A", "Last Name": "Vermeulen", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patrick E", "Last Name": "Fuller", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell H", "Last Name": "Weston", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Omar K", "Last Name": "Farha", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2021Nov10"}, {"PMID": "34327335", "Title": "Future directions in preclinical and translational cancer neuroscience research.", "Abstract": "Recent advances in cancer neuroscience necessitate the systematic analysis of neural influences in cancer as potential therapeutic targets in oncology.

The aims of the present study were to study the potential of ITCs in chemoprevention and in potentiating the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs in gastric cancer treatment. The chemoprevention was studied in chemically induced mouse model of gastric cancer, namely N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in drinking water, and in a genetically engineered mouse model of gastric cancer (the so-called INS-GAS mice). The pharmacological effects of ITCs with or without cisplatin were studied in human gastric cell lines MKN45, AGS, MKN74 and KATO-III, which were derived from either intestinal or diffused types of gastric carcinoma. The results showed that dietary phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) reduced the tumor size when PEITC was given simultaneously with MNU, but neither when administrated after MNU nor in INS-GAS mice. Treatments of gastric cancer cells with ITCs resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition on cell proliferation. Pretreatment of gastric cancer cells with ITCs enhanced the inhibitory effects of cisplatin (but not 5-fluorouracil) in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Treatments of gastric cancer cells with PEITC plus cisplatin simultaneously at different concentrations of either PEITC or cisplatin exhibited neither additive nor synergetic inhibitory effect. Furthermore, PEITC depleted glutathione and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that PEITC displayed anti-cancer effects, particularly when given before the tumor initiation, suggesting a chemopreventive effect in gastric cancer, and that pretreatment of PEITC potentiated the anti-cancer effects of cisplatin, possibly by reducing the intracellular pool of glutathione, suggesting a possible combination strategy of chemotherapy with pretreatment with PEITC.", "Keywords": ["cisplatin", "dietary (or plant) isothiocyanates", "gastric cancer", "glutamine", "glutathione", "mice"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hanne-Line", "Last Name": "Rabben", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Yosuke", "Last Name": "Kodama", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Masahiko", "Last Name": "Nakamura", "Affiliation": "Center for Clinical Pharmacy and Clinical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Atle Magnar", "Last Name": "Bones", "Affiliation": "Cell, Molecular Biology and Genomics Group, Department of Biology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Timothy Cragin", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Duan", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Chun-Mei", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Anders", "Last Name": "\u00d8verby", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pharmacology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33887218", "Title": "Reply.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Woosook", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Gastroenterology", "PubDate": "2021Aug"}, {"PMID": "33878160", "Title": "Anti-inflammatory chemoprevention attenuates the phenotype in a mouse model of esophageal adenocarcinoma.", "Abstract": "Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the main known precursor condition of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). BE is defined by the presence of metaplasia above the normal squamous columnar junction and has mainly been attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic reflux esophagitis. Thus, the rising incidence of EAC in the Western world is probably mediated by chronic esophageal inflammation, secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease in combination with environmental risk factors such as a Western diet and obesity. However, (at present) risk prediction tools and endoscopic surveillance have shown limited effectiveness. Chemoprevention as an adjunctive approach remains an attractive option to reduce the incidence of neoplastic disease. Here, we investigate the feasibility of chemopreventive approaches in BE and EAC via inhibition of inflammatory signaling in a transgenic mouse model of BE and EAC (L2-IL1B mice), with accelerated tumor formation on a high-fat diet (HFD). L2-IL1B mice were treated with the IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin or Sulindac. Interleukin-1b antagonism reduced tumor progression in L2-IL1B mice with or without a HFD, whereas both NSAIDs were effective chemoprevention agents in the accelerated HFD-fed L2-IL1B mouse model. Sulindac treatment also resulted in a marked change in the immune profile of L2-IL1B mice. In summary, anti-inflammatory treatment of HFD-treated L2-IL1B mice acted protectively on disease progression.

Tissue samples of GC were collected from 16 patients and 57 mice for gene expression profiling. Additional seven independent datasets of gene expression of human GC from the TCGA database were used for validation. In silico testing was performed by constructing interaction networks of ivermectin and the downstream effects in targeted signaling pathways. In vitro testing was carried out in human GC cell lines (MKN74 and KATO-III). In vivo testing was performed in a transgenic mouse model of GC (INS-GAS mice). Results: GC gene expression \"signature\" and data/pathway mining but not cMAP revealed nine molecular targets of ivermectin in both human and mouse GC associated with WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling as well as cell proliferation pathways. In silico inhibition of the targets of ivermectin and concomitant activation of ivermectin led to the inhibition of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in \"dose-depended\" manner. In vitro, ivermectin inhibited cell proliferation in time- and concentration-depended manners, and cells were arrested in the G1 phase at IC50 and shifted to S phase arrest at >IC50. In vivo, ivermectin reduced the tumor size which was associated with inactivation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling and cell proliferation pathways and activation of cell death signaling pathways.

This is of potential concern, as patients with Barrett's esophagus are treated with medications that suppress gastric acid production, resulting in increased physiologic levels of gastrin. We aimed to determine whether treatment with the novel gastrin/CCK2 receptor antagonist netazepide reduces expression of markers associated with inflammation and neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of netazepide in patients with Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia. Subjects were treated for 12 weeks, with endoscopic assessment at baseline and at end of treatment. The primary outcome was within-individual change in cellular proliferation as assessed by Ki67. Secondary analyses included changes in gene expression, assessed by RNA-sequencing, and safety and tolerability. A total of 20 subjects completed the study and were included in the analyses. There was no difference between arms in mean change in cellular proliferation (netazepide: +35.6 Ki67+ cells/mm2, SD 620.7; placebo: +307.8 Ki67+ cells/mm2, SD 640.3; P = 0.35). Netazepide treatment resulted in increased expression of genes related to gastric phenotype (TFF2, MUC5B) and certain cancer-associated markers (REG3A, PAX9, MUC1), and decreased expression of intestinal markers MUC2, FABP1, FABP2, and CDX1 No serious adverse events related to study drug occurred. The gastrin/CCK2 receptor antagonist netazepide did not reduce cellular proliferation in patients with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus.

Notch signaling, which plays a key role in regulating intestinal stem cell maintenance, has been implicated in a number of cancers. The kinase Dclk1 labels epithelial post-mitotic tuft cells at the squamo-columnar junction (SCJ), and has also been proposed to contribute to epithelial tumor growth. Here, we find that genetic activation of intracellular Notch signaling in epithelial Dclk1-positive tuft cells resulted in the accelerated development of metaplasia and dysplasia in a mouse model of BE (pL2.Dclk1.N2IC mice). In contrast, genetic ablation of Notch receptor 2 in Dclk1-positive cells delayed BE progression (pL2.Dclk1.N2fl mice), and led to increased secretory cell differentiation. The accelerated BE progression in pL2.Dclk1.N2IC mice correlated with changes to the transcriptomic landscape, most notably for the activation of oncogenic, proliferative pathways in BE tissues, in contrast to upregulated Wnt signalling in pL2.Dclk1.N2fl mice.

Elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6 and IL-8 together with activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), have been identified as important mediators of tumorigenesis. The inflammatory milieu apart from cancer cells and infiltrating immune cells contains myofibroblasts (MFs) that express aSMA and Vimentin. As we observed that increased NF-\u03baB activation and inflammation correlates with increased MF recruitment and an accelerated phenotype we here analyze the role of NF-\u03baB in MF during esophageal carcinogenesis in our L2-IL-1B mouse model. To analyze the effect of NF-\u03baB signaling in MFs, we crossed L2-IL-1B mice to tamoxifen inducible Vim-Cre (Vim-CreTm) mice and floxed RelA (p65fl/fl) mice to specifically eliminate NF-\u03baB signaling in MF (IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl). The interaction of epithelial cells and stromal cells was further analyzed in mouse BE organoids and patient-derived human organoids. Histological scoring of IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl mice showed a significantly attenuated phenotype compared with L2-IL-1B mice, with mild inflammation, decreased metaplasia and no dysplasia. This correlated with decreased proliferation and increased differentiation in cardia tissue of IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl compared with L2-IL-1B mice. Distinct changes of cytokines and chemokines within the local microenvironment in IL-1b.Vim-CreTm.p65fl/fl mice reflected the histopathological abrogated phenotype. Co-cultured NF-\u03baB inhibitor treated MF with mouse BE organoids demonstrated NF-\u03baB-dependent growth and migration. MFs are essential to form an inflammatory and procarcinogenic microenvironment and NF-\u03baB signaling in stromal cells emerges as an important driver of esophageal carcinogenesis.

Previously, treatment with the DNA hypomethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-dC; DAC) extended survival in the KPC-Brca1 mouse model of PDAC. Here we investigated the effects of DAC in the original KPC model and tested combination therapy with DAC followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Four protocols were tested: PBS vehicle, DAC, ICI (anti-PD-1 or anti-VISTA), and DAC followed by ICI. For each single-agent and combination treatment, tumor growth was measured by serial ultrasound, tumor-infiltrating lymphoid and myeloid cells were characterized, and overall survival was assessed. Single-agent DAC led to increased CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), PD1 expression, and tumor necrosis while slowing tumor growth and modestly increasing mouse survival without systemic toxicity. RNA-sequencing of DAC-treated tumors revealed increased expression of Chi3l3 (Ym1), reflecting an increase in a subset of tumor-infiltrating M2-polarized macrophages. While ICI alone had modest effects, DAC followed by either of ICI therapies additively inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival. The best results were obtained using DAC followed by anti-PD-1, which extended mean survival from 26 to 54 days (P < 0.0001). In summary, low-dose DAC inhibits tumor growth and increases both TILs and a subset of tumor-infiltrating M2-polarized macrophages in the KPC model of PDAC, and DAC followed by anti-PD-1 substantially prolongs survival. Because M2-polarized macrophages are predicted to antagonize antitumor effects, targeting these cells may be important to enhance the efficacy of combination therapy with DAC plus ICI. SIGNIFICANCE: In a pancreatic cancer model, a DNA hypomethylating drug increases tumor-infiltrating effector T cells, increases a subset of M2 macrophages, and significantly prolongs survival in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.See related commentary by Nephew, p. 4610.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Hot Temperature", "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Mice", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tamas A", "Last Name": "Gonda", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York. tamas.gonda@nyulangone.org Benjamin.tycko@hmh-cdi.org."}, {"First Name": "Jarwei", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Martha", "Last Name": "Salas", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics & Epigenetics, Hackensack-Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics & Epigenetics, Hackensack-Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Zhukovskaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ariel", "Last Name": "Siegel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ryota", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Zoila A", "Last Name": "Lopez-Bujanda", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles G", "Last Name": "Drake", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Tycko", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, New York University, New York, New York. tamas.gonda@nyulangone.org Benjamin.tycko@hmh-cdi.org."}], "Journal": "Cancer research", "PubDate": "2020Nov01"}, {"PMID": "32709613", "Title": "Mist1+ gastric isthmus stem cells are regulated by Wnt5a and expand in response to injury and inflammation in mice.", "Abstract": "The gastric epithelium undergoes continuous turnover.

Because of their molecular-scale porosity and periodic intraframework chemical functionality, MOFs are attractive scaffolds for supporting and/or organizing catalysts, photocatalysts, chemical-sensing elements, small enzymes, and numerous other functional-property-imparting, nanometer-scale objects. Notably, these objects can be installed after the synthesis of the MOF, eliminating the need for chemical and thermal compatibility of the objects with the synthesis milieu. Thus, postsynthetically functionalized MOFs can present three-dimensional arrays of high-density, yet well-separated, active sites. Depending on the application and corresponding morphological requirements, MOF materials can be prepared in thin-film form, pelletized form, isolated single-crystal form, polycrystalline powder form, mixed-matrix membrane form, or other forms. For certain applications, most obviously catalytic hydrolysis and electro- or photocatalytic water splitting, but also many others, an additional requirement is water stability. MOFs featuring hexa-zirconium(IV)-oxy nodes satisfy this requirement. For applications involving electrocatalysis, charge storage, photoelectrochemical energy conversion, and chemiresistive sensing, a further requirement is electrical conductivity, as embodied in electron or hole transport. As most MOFs, under most conditions, are electrically insulating, imparting controllable charge-transport behavior is both a chemically intriguing and chemically compelling challenge.Herein, we describe three strategies to render zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) tunably electrically conductive and, therefore, capable of transporting charge on the few nanometers (i.e., several molecular units) to few micrometers (i.e., typical dimensions for MOF microcrystallites) scale. The first strategy centers on redox-hopping between periodically arranged, chemically equivalent sites, essentially repetitive electron (or hole) self-exchange. Zirconium nodes are electrically insulating, but they can function as grafting sites for (a) redox-active inorganic clusters or (b) molecular redox couples. Alternatively, charge hopping based on linker redox properties can be exploited. Marcus's theory of electron transfer has proven useful for understanding/predicting trends in redox-hopping based conductivity, most notably, in accounting for variations as great as 3000-fold depending on the direction of charge propagation through structurally anisotropic MOFs. In MOF environments, propagation of electronic charge via redox hopping is necessarily accompanied by movement of charge-compensating ions. Consequently, rates of redox hopping can depend on both the identity and concentration of ions permeating the MOF. In the context of electrocatalysis, an important goal is to transport electronic charge fast enough to match or exceed the inherent activity of MOF-based or MOF-immobilized catalysts.Bandlike electronic conductivity is the focus of an alternative strategy: one based on the introduction of molecular guests capable of forming donor-acceptor charge transfer complexes with the host framework. Theory again can be applied predictively to alter conductivity. A third strategy similarly emphasizes electronic conductivity, but it makes use of added bridges in the form of molecular oligomers or inorganic clusters that can then be linked to span the length of a MOF crystallite. For all strategies, retention of molecular-scale porosity is emphasized, as this property is key to many applications. Finally, while our focus is on Zr-MOFs, the described approaches clearly are extendable to other MOF compositions, as has already been demonstrated, in part, in studies by others.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chung-Wei", "Last Name": "Kung", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}, {"First Name": "Subhadip", "Last Name": "Goswami", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}, {"First Name": "Idan", "Last Name": "Hod", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "NuMat Technologies, 8025 Lamon Avenue, Skokie, Illinois 60077, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jiaxin", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}, {"First Name": "Omar K", "Last Name": "Farha", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph T", "Last Name": "Hupp", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, Illinois 60208, United States."}], "Journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "PubDate": "2020Jun16"}, {"PMID": "32393543", "Title": "Interleukin-1\u03b2-induced pancreatitis promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via B lymphocyte-mediated immune suppression.", "Abstract": "Long-standing chronic pancreatitis is an established risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Chemical carcinogenesis of the stomach is associated with loss of G cells, increased symmetric stem cell division, glandular fission, and more rapid stem cell lineage tracing, a process that can be suppressed by exogenous gastrin treatment. This hormonal suppression is associated with a marked reduction in gastric cancer mutational load, as revealed by exomic sequencing.

Antibiotic treatment or increased dietary folate prevents gastric carcinogenesis in male INS-GAS mice. To determine potential synergistic effects, H. pylori-infected male INS-GAS mice were fed an amino acid defined (AAD) diet with increased folate and were treated with antibiotics after 18 weeks of H. pylori infection. Antibiotic therapy decreased gastric pathology, but dietary folate had no effect. However, the combination of antibiotics and the AAD diet induced anemia, gastric hemorrhage, and mortality. Clinical presentation suggested hypovitaminosis K potentially caused by dietary deficiency and dysbiosis. Based on current dietary guidelines, the AAD diet was deficient in vitamin K. Phylloquinone administered subcutaneously and via a reformulated diet led to clinical improvement with no subsequent mortalities and increased hepatic vitamin K levels. We characterized the microbiome and menaquinone profiles of antibiotic-treated and antibiotic-free mice. Antibiotic treatment decreased the abundance of menaquinone producers within orders Bacteroidales and Verrucomicrobiales. PICRUSt predicted decreases in canonical menaquinone biosynthesis genes, menA and menD. Reduction of menA from Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides uniformis, and Muribaculum intestinale were confirmed in antibiotic-treated mice. The fecal menaquinone profile of antibiotic-treated mice had reduced MK5 and MK6 and increased MK7 and MK11 compared to antibiotic-free mice.

Among the most provocative recent results in DGC has been that of highly recurrent missense mutations in the GTPase RHOA. The function of these mutations has remained unresolved. We demonstrate that RHOAY42C, the most common RHOA mutation in DGC, is a gain-of-function oncogenic mutant, and that expression of RHOAY42C with inactivation of the canonical tumor suppressor Cdh1 induces metastatic DGC in a mouse model. Biochemically, RHOAY42C exhibits impaired GTP hydrolysis and enhances interaction with its effector ROCK. RHOA Y42C mutation and Cdh1 loss induce actin/cytoskeletal rearrangements and activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which activates YAP-TAZ, PI3K-AKT, and \u03b2-catenin. RHOAY42C murine models were sensitive to FAK inhibition and to combined YAP and PI3K pathway blockade. These results, coupled with sensitivity to FAK inhibition in patient-derived DGC cell lines, nominate FAK as a novel target for these cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: The functional significance of recurrent RHOA mutations in DGC has remained unresolved. Through biochemical studies and mouse modeling of the hotspot RHOAY42C mutation, we establish that these mutations are activating, detail their effects upon cell signaling, and define how RHOA-mediated FAK activation imparts sensitivity to pharmacologic FAK inhibitors.See related commentary by Benton and Chernoff, p. 182.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p.

DCLK1-AL Increases Tumor Cell Invasion, Drug Resistance, and KRAS Activation and Can Be Targeted to Inhibit Tumorigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer.", "Abstract": "Oncogenic KRAS mutation plays a key role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumorigenesis with nearly 95% of PDAC harboring mutation-activated KRAS, which has been considered an undruggable target. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is often overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, and recent studies indicate that DCLK1+ PDAC cells can initiate pancreatic tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigate whether overexpressing DCLK1 activates RAS and promotes tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Human pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1 and MiaPaCa-2) were infected with lentivirus and selected to create stable DCLK1 isoform 2 (alpha-long, AL) overexpressing lines. The invasive potential of these cells relative to vector control was compared using Matrigel coated transwell assay. KRAS activation and interaction were determined by a pull-down assay and coimmunoprecipitation. Gemcitabine, mTOR (Everolimus), PI3K (LY-294002), and BCL-2 (ABT-199) inhibitors were used to evaluate drug resistance downstream of KRAS activation. Immunostaining of a PDAC tissue microarray was performed to detect DCLK1 alpha- and beta-long expression. Analysis of gene expression in human PDAC was performed using the TCGA PAAD dataset. The effects of targeting DCLK1 were studied using xenograft and Pdx1CreKrasG12DTrp53R172H/+ (KPC) mouse models. Overexpression of DCLK1-AL drives a more than 2-fold increase in invasion and drug resistance and increased the activation of KRAS. Evidence from TCGA PAAD demonstrated that human PDACs expressing high levels of DCLK1 correlate with activated PI3K/AKT/MTOR-pathway signaling suggesting greater KRAS activity. High DCLK1 expression in normal adjacent tissue of PDAC correlated with poor survival and anti-DCLK1 mAb inhibited pancreatic tumor growth in vivo in mouse models.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dongfeng", "Last Name": "Qu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel", "Last Name": "Weygant", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jiannan", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Parthasarathy", "Last Name": "Chandrakesan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "William L", "Last Name": "Berry", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randal", "Last Name": "May", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kamille", "Last Name": "Pitts", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sanam", "Last Name": "Husain", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stan", "Last Name": "Lightfoot", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guangyu", "Last Name": "An", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Clendenin", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ben Z", "Last Name": "Stanger", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney W", "Last Name": "Houchen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of oncology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31399638", "Title": "Muc5ac null mice are predisposed to spontaneous gastric antro-pyloric hyperplasia and adenomas coupled with attenuated H. pylori-induced corpus mucous metaplasia.", "Abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and is strongly associated with chronic Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection. The ability of Hp to closely adhere to the gastric surface protective mucous layer containing mucins (MUC in humans and Muc in animals), primarily Muc5ac, is integral in the stepwise pathogenesis from gastritis to cancer. To probe the role of Muc5ac in Hp-induced gastric pathology, Muc5ac-/- and Muc5ac+/+ (WT) mice were experimentally infected with Hp Sydney strain (SS1). At 16 weeks and 32 weeks post infection (wpi), groups of mice were euthanized and evaluated for the following: gastric histopathological parameters, immunohistochemical expression of mucins (Muc5ac, Muc1, Muc2), Trefoil factor family proteins (Tff1 and Tff2), Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolia lectin II (GSL II) (mucous metaplasia marker) and Clusterin (Spasmolytic Polypeptide Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) marker), Hp colonization density by qPCR and gastric cytokine mRNA levels. Our results demonstrate that Muc5ac-/- mice developed spontaneous antro-pyloric proliferation, adenomas and in one case with neuroendocrine differentiation; these findings were independent of Hp infection along with strong expression levels of Tff1, Tff2 and Muc1. Hp-infected Muc5ac-/- mice had significantly lowered gastric corpus mucous metaplasia at 16 wpi and 32 wpi (P\u2009=\u20090.0057 and P\u2009=\u20090.0016, respectively), with a slight reduction in overall gastric corpus pathology. GSII-positive mucous neck cells were decreased in Hp-infected Muc5ac-/- mice compared to WT mice and clusterin positivity was noted within metaplastic glands in both genotypes following Hp infection. Additionally, Hp colonization densities were significantly higher in Muc5ac-/- mice compared to WT at 16 wpi in both sexes (P\u2009=\u20090.05) along with a significant reduction in gastric Tnf\u03b1 (16 wpi-males and females, P\u2009=\u20090.017 and P\u2009=\u20090.036, respectively and 32 wpi-males only, P\u2009=\u20090.025) and Il-17a (16 wpi-males) (P\u2009=\u20090.025).

We interrogated genome-wide somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) at the exon level with high-resolution SNP arrays in DNA from formalin-fixed samples histologically confirmed as nondysplastic BE. The most frequent abnormalities were SCNAs involving FHIT exon 5, CDKN2A/B or both in 88% longitudinal BE progressors to DAC vs. 24% in both nonprogressor groups (p = 0.0004). Deletions in other genomic regions were found in 56% of preprogression-BE but only in one nonprogressor-BE (p = 0.0004).

TP53 losses were detected in concurrent-BE but not earlier in preprogression-BE tissues of patients who developed DAC. CDKN2A/p16 immunohistochemistry showed significant loss of expression in BE of progressors vs. nonprogressors, supporting the genomic data. Our data suggest a role for CDKN2A/B and FHIT in early progression of BE to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma that warrants future mechanistic research.

Using an in\u00a0vitro cancer progression model, we discover that F.\u00a0nucleatum stimulates the growth of colorectal cancer cells without affecting the pre-cancerous adenoma cells. Annexin A1, a previously unrecognized modulator of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, is a key component through which F.\u00a0nucleatum exerts its stimulatory effect. Annexin A1 is specifically expressed in proliferating colorectal cancer cells and involved in activation of Cyclin D1. Its expression level in colon cancer is a predictor of poor prognosis independent of cancer stage, grade, age, and sex. The FadA adhesin from F.\u00a0nucleatum up-regulates Annexin A1 expression through E-cadherin. A positive feedback loop between FadA and Annexin A1 is identified in the cancerous cells, absent in the non-cancerous cells. We therefore propose a\u00a0\"two-hit\" model in colorectal carcinogenesis, with somatic mutation(s) serving as the first hit, and F.\u00a0nucleatum as the second hit exacerbating cancer progression after benign cells become cancerous.

An important reason for this high mortality is that early disease is typically asymptomatic, and patients often present with advanced, incurable disease. Even in high-risk patients who routinely undergo endoscopic screening, lesions can be missed due to their small size or subtle appearance. Thus, current imaging approaches lack the sensitivity and specificity to accurately detect incipient GI tract cancers. Here we report our finding that a single dose of a high-sensitivity surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering nanoparticle (SERRS-NP) enables reliable detection of precancerous GI lesions in animal models that closely mimic disease development in humans. Some of these animal models have not been used previously to evaluate imaging probes for early cancer detection. The studies were performed using a commercial Raman imaging system, a newly developed mouse Raman endoscope, and finally a clinically applicable Raman endoscope for larger animal studies. We show that this SERRS-NP-based approach enables robust detection of small, premalignant lesions in animal models that faithfully recapitulate human esophageal, gastric, and colorectal tumorigenesis. This method holds promise for much earlier detection of GI cancers than currently possible and could lead therefore to marked reduction of morbidity and mortality of these tumor types.", "Keywords": ["Raman", "cancer", "early detection", "endoscopy", "nanoparticle", "preclinical"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endoscopy", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Nanoparticles", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Harmsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York 10065 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Rogalla", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics , Stanford University , Stanford , California 94305 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Ruimin", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York 10065 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Massimiliano", "Last Name": "Spaliviero", "Affiliation": "Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Sidney Kimmel Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancers , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York 10065 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Volker", "Last Name": "Neuschmelting", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York 10065 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Yoku", "Last Name": "Hayakawa", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine , Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Yoomi", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine , Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Yagnesh", "Last Name": "Tailor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine , Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Ricardo", "Last Name": "Toledo-Crow", "Affiliation": "Research Engineering Lab , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , New York 10065 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeon Woong", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Laser Biomedical Research Center, G.

Here, we found that subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in LSL-Kras +/G12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice accelerated PDAC development, whereas treatment with the systemic muscarinic agonist bethanechol restored the normal KC phenotype, thereby suppressing the accelerated tumorigenesis caused by vagotomy. In LSL-Kras +/G12D;LSL-Trp53 +/R172H;Pdx1-Cre mice with established PDAC, bethanechol significantly extended survival. These effects were mediated in part through CHRM1, which inhibited downstream MAPK/EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways in PDAC cells. Enhanced cholinergic signaling led to a suppression of the cancer stem cell (CSC) compartment, CD11b+ myeloid cells, TNF\u03b1 levels, and metastatic growth in the liver. Therefore, these data suggest that cholinergic signaling directly and indirectly suppresses growth of PDAC cells, and therapies that stimulate muscarinic receptors may be useful in the treatment of PDAC.Significance: Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or Chrm1 knockout accelerates pancreatic tumorigenesis, in part via expansion of the CSC compartment. Systemic administration of a muscarinic agonist suppresses tumorigenesis through MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, in early stages of tumor growth and in more advanced, metastatic disease. Therefore, CHRM1 may represent a potentially attractive therapeutic target. Cancer Discov; 8(11); 1458-73. \u00a92018 AACR.

The approach is based on condensed-phase grafting of molecular tin species onto the MOF nodes via irreversible reaction with hydroxyl and aqua ligands presented at the node surface, a self-limiting process termed solvothermal installation (of metal ions) in MOFs (SIM, a solution-phase analog of atomic layer deposition in MOFs). Treatment of the modified MOF with aerated steam at 120 \u00b0C converts the grafted tin molecules to tetratin(IV)oxy clusters, with the clusters being sited between insulating pairs of zirconia-like nodes (the zirconium component being key to endowing the parent material with requisite chemical and thermal stability). By introducing new O-H presenting ligands on the modified-MOF node, the high-temperature steam step additionally serves to reset the material to reactive form, thus enabling a second self-limiting tin-grafting step to be run (and after further steam treatment, enabling a third). Difference-envelop-density (DED) analyses of synchrotron-derived X-ray scattering data, with and without installed tin species, show that the clusters formed after one cycle are spatially isolated, but that repetitive SIM cycling adds metal and oxygen ions in a way that enshrouds nodes, links clusters, and yields continuous one-dimensional strands of oxy-tin(IV), oriented exclusively along the c axis of the MOF. Two-probe conductivity measurements show that the parent MOF and the version containing isolated oxy-tin(IV) clusters are electrically insulating, but that the versions featuring continuous strands show an electrical conductivity of 1.8 \u00d7 10-7 S/cm after three Sn-SIM cycles. When combined with interdigitated microelectrodes, the solvent-free and conductive-glass-modified material (three Sn-SIM cycles) displays a substantial and persistent increase in electrical conductivity during exposure to 5% H2, indicating a role for dissociated H2 as an electronic dopant. The increase can be repetitively reversed by alternating H2 with air, illustrating the ability of the conductive MOF to function as a resistive sensor for H2 and suggesting further potential applications that may capitalize on the combination of high volumetric surface area, high mesoporosity, high chemical and thermal stability, and significant electrical conductivity.", "Keywords": ["atomic layer deposition", "hydrogen sensor", "mesoporous materials", "solvothermal installation", "tin oxide", "zirconium-based MOFs"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chung-Wei", "Last Name": "Kung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ana E", "Last Name": "Platero-Prats", "Affiliation": "X-ray Science Division, Advanced Photon Source , Argonne National Laboratory , Argonne , Illinois 60439-4858 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Riki J", "Last Name": "Drout", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Junmo", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cornelius O", "Last Name": "Audu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark C", "Last Name": "Hersam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karena W", "Last Name": "Chapman", "Affiliation": "X-ray Science Division, Advanced Photon Source , Argonne National Laboratory , Argonne , Illinois 60439-4858 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Omar K", "Last Name": "Farha", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science , King Abdulaziz University , Jeddah 21589 , Saudi."}, {"First Name": "Joseph T", "Last Name": "Hupp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2018Sep12"}, {"PMID": "30067768", "Title": "Rapid gastrointestinal loss of Clostridial Clusters IV and XIVa in the ICU associates with an expansion of gut pathogens.", "Abstract": "Commensal gastrointestinal bacteria resist the expansion of pathogens and are lost during critical illness, facilitating pathogen colonization and infection.

We previously have shown that TFF2 gene delivery via adenovirus (Ad-Tff2) suppresses colon tumor growth in colitis associated cancer. Therefore, systemic administration of TFF2 peptide could potentially provide a similar benefit. Because TFF2 shows a poor pharmacokinetic, we sought to modify the TFF2 peptide in a manner that would lower its clearance rate but retain bioactivity. Given the absence of a sequence-based prediction of TFF2 functionality, we chose to genetically fuse the C-terminus of TFF2 with the carboxyl-terminal peptide of human chorionic gonadotropin \u03b2 subunit, and inserted into adenoviral vector that expresses Flag. The resulting Ad-Tff2-CTP-Flag construct translates into a TFF2 fused with two CTP and three Flag motifs. Administered Ad-Tff2-CTP-Flag decreased tumorigenesis and suppressed the expansion of myeloid cells in vivo. The fusion peptide TFF2-CTP-Flag delivered by adenovirus Ad-Tff2-CTP-Flag as well purified recombinant fusion TFF2-CTP-Flag was retained in the blood longer compared with wild-type TFF2 delivered by Ad-Tff2 or recombinant TFF2.

Stomachs from groups infected with H. pylori contained progressive spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) compared with germ-free and mice infected with ASF alone. The overall phenotype of the H. pylori-infected mice was dominated by Ulex europaeus lectin (UEAI)-positive foveolar hyperplasia that was distinct from GSII/CD44v9-positive SPEM.

These regions of foveolar cells were variably positive for CD44v9 as well as TFF3. Interestingly, an intravascular lesion identified in a dual H. pylori/ASF-infected mouse expressed both UEAI and Muc4.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent PGE2 production involves mobilisation of arachidonic acid. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LbGG) is one of the most widely used probiotics reported to colonise the colonic mucosa. LbGG contributes to the protection of the small intestine against radiation injury through the repositioning of mucosal COX-2 expressing cells. However, it is unknown if LbGG modulates PGE2 production in the colonic mucosa under homeostasis and the major cellular elements involved in these processes. Colonic epithelial and CD90+ mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as (myo) fibroblasts (CMFs), are abundant innate immune cells in normal colonic mucosa able to produce PGE2 . Herein, we tested the hypothesis that under colonic mucosal homeostasis, LbGG modulates the eicosanoid pathway resulting in increased PGE2 production in both epithelial and stromal cells. Among the five tested human colonic epithelial cell lines, only exposure of Caco-2 to LbGG for 24\u00a0hr led to the mobilisation of arachidonic acid with concomitant increase in the components within the leukotriene and COX-2-dependent PGE2 pathways. By contrast, CMFs isolated from the normal human colonic mucosa responded to LbGG with increased expression of COX-2 and PGE2 in the prostaglandin pathway, but not 5-LO in the leukotriene pathway. Oral gavage of C57BL/6 mice for 5\u00a0days with LbGG (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 Colony-Forming Unit (CFU)/dose) increased COX-2 expression in the colonic mucosa.

The in vivo and in vitro results showed that acting through histamine 1 receptor, histamine increased miR-206 and miR-216b, which worked in concert to target to Atg13, resulting in the reduction of autophagy activation under hypoxia and AMI condition. Further study revealed that Atg13 interacted with FADD to promote the activation of caspase-8 and cell apoptosis.

In mice, a distinct type of metaplasia known as spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is found in several inflammatory and genetically engineered models. Given the diversity of long- and short-term models of mouse SPEM, it remains unclear whether all models have a shared or distinct molecular mechanism. The origin of SPEM in mice is presently under debate. It is postulated that stem or progenitor cells acquire genetic alterations that then supply metaplastic cell clones, whereas the possibility of transdifferentiation or dedifferentiation from mature gastric chief cells has also been suggested. In this study, we report that loss of chief cells was sufficient to induce short-term regenerative SPEM-like lesions that originated from chief cell precursors in the gastric neck region. Furthermore, Lgr5+ mature chief cells failed to contribute to both short- and long-term metaplasia, whereas isthmus stem and progenitor cells efficiently contributed to long-term metaplasia. Interestingly, multiple administrations of high-dose pulsed tamoxifen induced expansion of Lgr5 expression and Lgr5-CreERT recombination within the isthmus progenitors apart from basal chief cells. Thus we conclude that short-term SPEM represents a regenerative process arising from neck progenitors following chief cell loss, whereas true long-term SPEM originates from isthmus progenitors. Mature gastric chief cells may be dispensable for SPEM development. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Recently, dedifferentiation ability in gastric chief cells during metaplasia development has been proposed. Our findings reveal that lesions that were thought to be acute metaplasia in fact represent normal regeneration supplied from neck lineage and that isthmus stem/progenitors are more responsible for sustained metaplastic changes.

Considerable evidence supports a major role for chronic inflammation and diverse chemokine pathways in the development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.Experimental Design: Here we utilized an IL1\u03b2 transgenic mouse model of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma and human patient imaging to analyze the importance of CXCR4-expressing cells during esophageal carcinogenesis.Results: IL1\u03b2 overexpression induces chronic esophageal inflammation and recapitulates the progression to Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. CXCR4 expression is increased in both epithelial and immune cells during disease progression in pL2-IL1\u03b2 mice and also elevated in esophageal adenocarcinoma patient biopsy samples. Specific recruitment of CXCR4-positive (CXCR4+) immune cells correlated with dysplasia progression, suggesting that this immune population may be a key contributor to esophageal carcinogenesis. Similarly, with progression to dysplasia, there were increased numbers of CXCR4+ columnar epithelial cells at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). These findings were supported by stronger CXCR4-related signal intensity in ex vivo fluorescence imaging and autoradiography with advanced dysplasia. Pilot CXCR4-directed PET/CT imaging studies in patients with esophageal cancer demonstrate the potential utility of CXCR4 imaging for the diagnosis and staging of esophageal cancer.Conclusion: In conclusion, the recruitment of CXCR4+ immune cells and expansion of CXCR4+ epithelial cells in esophageal dysplasia and cancer highlight the potential of CXCR4 as a biomarker and molecular target for diagnostic imaging of the tumor microenvironment in esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Increasing demand for myeloid cells via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment specifically recruits MB-HSCs and progenitors into the cell cycle; cycling MB-HSCs fail to revert into quiescence in the absence of histamine feedback, leading to their depletion, while an H2 agonist protects MB-HSCs from depletion after sepsis.

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen associated with gastric cancer development that is known to target mitochondria directly and exclusively through its pro-apoptotic and vacuolating cytotoxin VacA. By in vitro infection of gastric epithelial cells with wild-type and VacA-deficient H. pylori strains, treatment of cells with purified VacA proteins and infection of a mouse model, we show that H. pylori deregulates mitochondria by two novel mechanisms, both rather associated with host cell survival. First, early upon infection VacA induces transient increase of mitochondrial translocases and a dramatic accumulation of the mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance factors POLG and TFAM. These events occur when VacA is not detected intracellularly, therefore do not require the direct interaction of the cytotoxin with the organelle, and are independent of the toxin vacuolating activity.

In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63+KRT5+KRT7+) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells.

Video-rate super-resolution microscopy reveals movement of MOF particles when located outside of the cell boundary, and their subsequent immobilization when taken up by the cell. Through the use of optical sectioning structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we have captured high-resolution 3D images showing MOF uptake by HeLa cells over a 24 h period.

Volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen capacities are the key factors that determine the size and weight of the MOF-filled tank required to store a certain amount of hydrogen for reasonable driving range. Therefore, they must be optimized so the tank is neither too large nor too heavy. Because the goals of maximizing MOF volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen adsorption loadings individually are incompatible, an in-depth understanding of the trade-off between MOF volumetric and gravimetric loadings is necessary to achieve the best compromise between these properties. Here we study, both experimentally and computationally, the trade-off between volumetric and gravimetric cryo-adsorbed hydrogen deliverable capacity by taking an isoreticular series of highly stable zirconium MOFs, NU-1101, NU-1102, and NU-1103 as a case study. These MOFs were studied under recently proposed operating conditions: 77 K/100 bar \u2192160 K/5 bar. We found the difference between highest and lowest measured deliverable capacity in the MOF series to be ca. 40% gravimetrically, but only ca. 10% volumetrically. From our molecular simulation results, we found hydrogen \"monolayer\" adsorption to be proportional to the surface area, whereas hydrogen \"pore filling\" adsorption is proportional to the pore volume. Thus, we found that the higher variability in gravimetric deliverable capacity in contrast to the volumetric capacity, occurs due to the proportional relation between gravimetric surface area and pore volume in the NU-110x series in contrast to the inverse relation between volumetric surface area and void fraction. Additionally, we find better correlations with geometric surface areas than with BET areas. NU-1101 presents the highest measured volumetric performance with 46.6 g/L (9.1 wt %), whereas NU-1103 presents the highest gravimetric one with 12.6 wt % (43.2 g/L).", "Keywords": ["cryoadsorption", "energy storage", "molecular modeling", "nnoporous materials", "zirconium MOFs"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Diego A", "Last Name": "G\u00f3mez-Gualdr\u00f3n", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Colorado School of Mines , Golden, Colorado 80401, United States."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Garc\u00eda-Holley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruth M", "Last Name": "Sawelewa", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Colorado School of Mines , Golden, Colorado 80401, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edwin", "Last Name": "Argueta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Randall Q", "Last Name": "Snurr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph T", "Last Name": "Hupp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taner", "Last Name": "Yildirim", "Affiliation": "NIST center for Neutron Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology , Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, United States."}, {"First Name": "Omar K", "Last Name": "Farha", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, King Abdulaziz University , Jeddah 22254, Saudi Arabia."}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2017Oct04"}, {"PMID": "28380450", "Title": "The G-protein coupled receptor 56, expressed in colonic stem and cancer cells, binds progastrin to promote proliferation and carcinogenesis.", "Abstract": "Overexpression of human progastrin increases colonic mucosal proliferation and colorectal cancer progression in mice.

GPR56 was upregulated in transgenic mice overexpressing human progastrin.

A robust zirconium MOF, NU-1000, was rendered electronically conductive by first incorporating, via solvent-assisted ligand incorporation (SALI), a carefully designed pentathiophene derivative at a density of one pentamer per hexa-zirconium node. Using a cast film of the intermediate composite (termed pentaSALI) on conductive glass, the incorporated oligothiophene was electrochemically polymerized to yield the conductive composite, Epoly. Depending on the doping level of the polythiophene in the composite, it can be tuned from an insulating state to a semiconduting state with conductivity of 1.3 \u00d7 10-7 (S cm-1), which is comparable to values reported for 3-D conductive MOFs.

Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the main enzyme involved in histamine production. Here, we clarified the roles of HDC-expressing cells and histamine in heart failure post-MI using HDC-EGFP transgenic mice and HDC-knockout (HDC-/-) mice. HDC+CD11b+ myeloid cell numbers markedly increased in the injured hearts, and histamine levels were up-regulated in the circulation post-MI. HDC-/- mice exhibited more adverse cardiac remodeling, poorer left ventricular function and higher mortality by increasing cardiac fibrogenesis post-MI. In vitro assays further confirmed that histamine inhibited heart fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, histamine enhanced the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-6 phosphorylation level in murine heart fibroblasts, and the inhibitive effects of histamine on fibroblast proliferation could be blocked by JAK3/STAT6 signaling selective antagonist. STAT6-knockout (STAT6-/-) mice had a phenotype similar to that of HDC-/- mice post-MI; however, in contrast to HDC-/- mice, the beneficial effects of exogenous histamine injections were abrogated in STAT6-/- mice.

Among patients with Barrett esophagus, only about 0.3% annually will develop EAC. Because large numbers of patients are followed in endoscopic surveillance, there is a need for risk prediction among a growing population of patients with Barrett esophagus. We identified four potential biomarkers from an inflammation (IL1\u03b2)-dependent mouse model of Barrett esophagus and tested them in 189 patients with Barrett esophagus with and without high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/early cancer (T1). The primary goal was to distinguish patients with Barrett esophagus with no evidence of dysplasia from those with dysplasia. Increasing stem cell marker LGR5 and niche cell marker DCLK1 and decreasing differentiation marker (secretory mucus cells, TFF2+ cells) correlated with elevated tumor score in the mouse. Having outlined the origin of those markers in the Barrett esophagus mouse model, we showed the applicability for human Barrett esophagus. We compared 94 patients with nondysplastic Barrett esophagus tissue with 95 patients with Barrett esophagus and HGD or early cancer. Low levels of TFF2 (AUC 87.2%) provided the best discrimination between nondysplastic Barrett esophagus and Barrett esophagus with cancer, followed by high levels of DCLK1 (AUC 83.4%), low goblet cell ratio (AUC 79.4%), and high LGR5 (AUC 71.4%). The goblet cell ratio, rather than the presence of goblet cells per se, was found to be an important discriminator. These findings may be useful in developing future risk prediction models for patients with Barrett esophagus and ultimately to improve EAC surveillance.

Inactivation of RelA accelerated pancreatic lesion formation in Kras mice by abrogating the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) gene transcription signature. Using genetic and pharmacological tools, we determined that RelA activation promotes OIS via elevation of the SASP factor CXCL1 (also known as KC), which activates CXCR2, during pancreatic carcinogenesis. In Kras mice, pancreas-specific inactivation of CXCR2 prevented OIS and was correlated with increased tumor proliferation and decreased survival. Moreover, reductions in CXCR2 levels were associated with advanced neoplastic lesions in tissue from human pancreatic specimens. Genetically disabling OIS in Kras mice caused RelA to promote tumor proliferation, suggesting a dual role for RelA signaling in pancreatic carcinogenesis.

Our previous studies demonstrated that murine bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts (BMFs) enhanced tumor growth. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of BMF actions. We found that co-injection of BMFs with gastric cancer cells markedly promoted tumorigenesis. Co-cultured BMFs or BMF-conditioned medium (BMF-CM) induced the formation of spheres, which expressed stem cell signatures and exhibited features of self-renewal, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tumor initiation. Furthermore, CD44+ fractions in spheres were able to initiate tumorigenesis and re-establish tumors in serially passaged xenografts. In co-culture systems, BMFs secreted high levels of murine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), whereas cancer cells produced high level of transformation growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). BMF-CM and IL-6 activated BMFs to produce mHGF, which activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and upregulated TGF-\u03b21 in human cancer cells. In return, cancer cell-CM stimulated BMFs to produce IL-6, which was inhibited by anti-TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody. Blockade of HGF/Met, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 and TGF-\u03b21 signaling by specific inhibitors inhibited BMF-induced sphere formation. STAT3 knockdown in cancer cells also inhibited BMF-induced sphere formation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 overexpression in cancer cells was co-related with IL-6 and HGF overexpression in stromal cells in human gastric cancer tissues. Our results show that BMF-derived IL-6/HGF and cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b21 mediate the interactions between BMFs and gastric cancer cells, which regulate cancer stemness and promote tumorigenesis.

Lpd-/- mice, a transgenic mouse strain produced at MIT, have not previously shown a distinct immune phenotype and are not highly susceptible to other opportunistic infections. Predominantly male Lpd-/- mice with RP exhibited lesions consistent with invasive rectal carcinoma concomitant to clinically evident RP. Multiple inflammatory cytokines, CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations, and epithelial cells positive for a DNA damage biomarker, H2AX, were elevated in affected tissue, supporting their role in the neoplastic process. An evaluation of Lpd-/- mice with RP compared to EHS-infected, but clinically normal (CN) Lpd-/- animals indicated that all of these mice exhibit some degree of lower bowel inflammation; however, mice with prolapses had significantly higher degree of focal lesions at the colo-rectal junction. When Helicobacter spp. infections were eliminated in Lpd-/- mice by embryo transfer rederivation, the disease phenotype was abrogated, implicating EHS as a contributing factor in the development of rectal carcinoma.

Gastrokine-2 (GKN2) belongs to a family of secreted proteins expressed within normal gastric mucosal cells. GKN2 expression is frequently lost during GC progression, suggesting an inhibitory role; however, a causal link remains unsubstantiated. Here, we developed Gkn2 knockout and transgenic overexpressing mice to investigate the functional impact of GKN2 loss in GC pathogenesis. In mouse models of GC, decreased GKN2 expression correlated with gastric pathology that paralleled human GC progression. At baseline, Gkn2 knockout mice exhibited defective gastric epithelial differentiation but not malignant progression. Conversely, Gkn2 knockout in the IL-11/STAT3-dependent gp130F/F GC model caused tumorigenesis of the proximal stomach. Additionally, gastric immunopathology was accelerated in Helicobacter pylori-infected Gkn2 knockout mice and was associated with augmented T helper cell type 1 (Th1) but not Th17 immunity. Heightened Th1 responses in Gkn2 knockout mice were linked to deregulated mucosal innate immunity and impaired myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation. Finally, transgenic overexpression of human gastrokines (GKNs) attenuated gastric tumor growth in gp130F/F mice.

In this work, we present a simple nanocasting approach to provide a thermally stable secondary scaffold for MOF-based catalytic single sites, preventing their aggregation even after exposure to air at 600 \u00b0C. We describe the nanocasting of NU-1000, a MOF with 3 nm channels and Lewis-acidic oxozirconium clusters, with silica. By condensing tetramethylorthosilicate within the NU-1000 pores via a vapor-phase HCl treatment, a silica layer is created on the inner walls of NU-1000. This silica layer provides anchoring sites for the oxozirconium clusters in NU-1000 after the organic linkers are removed at high temperatures. Differential pair distribution functions obtained from synchrotron X-ray scattering confirmed that isolated oxozirconium clusters are maintained in the heated nanocast materials. Pyridine adsorption experiments and a glucose isomerization reaction demonstrate that the clusters remain accessible to reagents and maintain their acidic character and catalytic activity even after the nanocast materials have been heated to 500-600 \u00b0C in air. Density functional theory calculations show a correlation between the Lewis acidity of the oxozirconium clusters and their catalytic activity.

A large body of evidence has indicated that drug-induced hypochlorhydria per se does not increase the risk of gastric cancer. Early studies on the effects of vagotomy in chemically-induced rodent models of gastric cancer reported an increased risk of developing gastric cancer. This was most likely due to a delayed gastric emptying, which later has been accounted for by including an additional drainage procedure, e.g. pyloroplasty. In a recent study using three different mouse models of gastric cancer (including genetically engineered, chemically-induced and Helicobacter pylori-infected mice), either unilateral vagotomy or bilateral truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty was found to significantly attenuate tumorigenesis in the denervated side of the stomach at early preneoplastic stages as well as at later stages of tumorigenesis. Consistently, pharmacological denervation using botulinum toxin A or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (M3R) blockade inhibited tumorigenesis.

CpG methylation is a central mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation affecting cancer-related genes, and occurs early in gastric carcinogenesis. DNA samples from non-metaplastic gastric mucosa with variable levels of gastritis (non-metaplastic mucosa), intestinal metaplasia, or gastric cancer were screened with methylation arrays for CpG methylation of cancer-related genes and 30 gene targets were further characterized by high-definition bisulfite next-generation sequencing. In addition, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed for correlation of methylation with gene expression. Overall, 13 genes had significantly increased CpG methylation in gastric cancer vs non-metaplastic mucosa (BRINP1, CDH11, CHFR, EPHA5, EPHA7, FGF2, FLI1, GALR1, HS3ST2, PDGFRA, SEZ6L, SGCE, and SNRPN). Further, most of these genes had corresponding reduced expression levels in gastric cancer compared with intestinal metaplasia, including novel hypermethylated genes in gastric cancer (FLI1, GALR1, SGCE, and SNRPN), suggesting that they may regulate neoplastic transformation from non-malignant intestinal metaplasia to cancer. Our data suggest a tumor-suppressor role for FLI1 in gastric cancer, consistent with recently reported data in breast cancer. For the genes with strongest methylation/expression correlation, namely FLI1, the expression was lowest in microsatellite-unstable tumors compared with other gastric cancer molecular subtypes.

Helicobacter pylori, a class 1 carcinogen, infects about half of the world's population, thus creating a high likelihood of overlapping risk. This study determined the effect of H. pylori infection on iron homeostasis in INS-GAS mice. Two replicates of INS-GAS/FVB male mice (n = 9-12/group) were dosed with H. pylori (Hp) strain SS1 or sham dosed at 6-9 weeks of age, and were necropsied at 27-29 weeks of age. Hematologic and serum iron parameters were evaluated, as was gene expression in gastric and brain tissues. Serum ferritin was lower in Hp SS1-infected mice than uninfected mice (p < 0.0001). Infected mice had a lower red blood cell count (p<0.0001), hematocrit (p < 0.001), and hemoglobin concentration (p <0.0001) than uninfected mice. Relative expression of gastric hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (Hamp) was downregulated in mice infected with Hp SS1 compared to sham-dosed controls (p<0.001). Expression of bone morphogenic protein 4 (Bmp4), a growth factor upstream of hepcidin, was downregulated in gastric tissue of Hp SS1-infected mice (p<0.001).

The K14-Cdx2::L2-IL-1\u03b2 double transgenic mice had half as many metaplastic nodules as control L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. This effect was not due to a reduction in esophageal IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels nor diminished systemic inflammation. The diminished metaplasia was due to an increase in apoptosis in the K14-Cdx2::L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. Fluorescence activated cell sorting of immune cells infiltrating the metaplasia identified a population of CD11b+Gr-1+ cells that are significantly reduced in K14-Cdx2::L2-IL-1\u03b2 mice. These cells have features of immature granulocytes and have immune-suppressing capacity.

These mice exhibited shortened survival and enhanced tumor growth compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Previous studies have shown a pivotal role of HDC in maturation of bone marrow (BM)-derived myeloid cells. In our glioma models, brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BIL) demonstrated an increased frequency of CD11b+Gr1+ immature myeloid cells (IMC; both CD11b+Ly6G+ and CD11b+Ly6C+ subpopulations) as well as diminished CD8+ T cell infiltration and their effector functions in HDC-/- mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, HDC-/- IMC demonstrated a more profound immune suppression of CD8+ T cell proliferation and functions associated with increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) expression levels. Celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, which is vital for PGE2 production, abrogated suppressive capabilities of HDC-/- IMC. In addition, glioma-bearing HDC-eGFP mice, in which HDC promoter drives green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression, exhibited decreased HDC promoter activities in CD11b+Gr1+ cells in the BM, spleen, and intracranial tumor site compared with non-tumor bearing HDC-eGFP mice.

Here, we show that in wild type (WT) mice, ovalbumin (OVA) immunization elicits a typical TH2 response. In contrast, in HDC-/- mice, the response to OVA allergy is skewed towards infiltration by IL-17 expressing MCs. This response is inhibited by histamine treatment. The HDC-/- allergic IL-17-expressing MCs promote MDSC proliferation and upregulation of Cox-2 and Arg-1. OVA allergy in HDC-/- mice increases the growth of colon tumor cells in both the MC38 tumor cell implantation model and the AOM/DSS carcinogenesis model. Taken together, our results show that histamine represses IL-17-expressing MCs and their subsequent activation of MDSCs, attenuating the risk of colorectal cancer in the setting of food allergy.

We observed significantly greater expression of pluripotency genes, pro-survival genes, and quiescence markers in the Dclk1+ population. A significant increase in self-renewal capability (14-fold) was observed in in vitro isolated Dclk1+ cells. The unique genetic report presented in this manuscript suggests that Dclk1+ cells may maintain quiescence, pluripotency, and metabolic activity for survival/longevity.

These wounds developed into ulcers that infiltrated the outer intestinal wall. We determined that penetrating ulcer formation in this model resulted from increased hypoxia and smooth muscle wall necrosis. Prostaglandin I\u2082 (PGI\u2082) stimulated VEGF-dependent angiogenesis to prevent penetrating ulcers. Treatment of mucosally injured WT mice with a VEGFR inhibitor resulted in the development of penetrating ulcers, further demonstrating that VEGF is critical for mucosal repair. We next used this model to address the role of transplanted colonic MSCs (cMSCs) in intestinal repair. Compared with intravenously injected cMSCs, mucosally injected cMSCs more effectively prevented the development of penetrating ulcers, as they were more efficiently recruited to colonic wounds. Importantly, mucosally injected cMSCs stimulated angiogenesis in a VEGF-dependent manner.

BE is known as a precursor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Currently, the cell of origin for human BE has yet to be clearly identified. Therefore, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the initiation of BE metaplasia. Affymetrix gene expression microarray revealed that BE samples express decreased levels of Notch receptors (NOTCH2 and NOTCH3) and one of the the ligands (JAG1). Furthermore, BE tissue microarray showed decreased expression of NOTCH1 and its downstream target HES1. Therefore, Notch signaling was inhibited in human esophageal epithelial cells by expression of dominant-negative-Mastermind-like (dnMAML), in concert with MYC and CDX1 overexpression. Cell transdifferentiation was then assessed by 3D organotypic culture and evaluation of BE-lineage specific gene expression. Notch inhibition promoted transdifferentiation of esophageal epithelial cells toward columnar-like cells as demonstrated by increased expression of columnar keratins (K8, K18, K19, K20) and glandular mucins (MUC2, MUC3B, MUC5B, MUC17) and decreased expression of squamous keratins (K5, K13, K14). In 3D culture, elongated cells were observed in the basal layer of the epithelium with Notch inhibition. Furthermore, we observed increased expression of KLF4, a potential driver of the changes observed by Notch inhibition. Interestingly, knockdown of KLF4 reversed the effects of Notch inhibition on BE-like metaplasia. Overall, Notch signaling inhibition promotes transdifferentiation of esophageal cells toward BE-like metaplasia in part via upregulation of KLF4.

Recombinant TFF2, when applied intrarectally in a rodent model of hapten colitis, hastens mucosal healing and reduces inflammatory indexes. Additionally, TFF2 is expressed in immune organs, supporting a potential immunomodulatory and reparative role in the bowel. In this study we confirm that TFF2 is expressed in the colon and is specifically enriched in epithelial cells relative to colonic leukocytes. TFF2-deficient, but not TFF1-deficient, mice exhibit a more severe response to acute or chronic dextran sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis that correlates with a 50% loss of expression of TFF3, the principal colonic trefoil. In addition, the response to acute colitis is associated with altered expression of IL-6 and IL-33, but not other inflammatory cytokines. While TFF2 can reduce macrophage responsiveness and block inflammatory cell recruitment to the colon, the major role in limiting the susceptibility to acute colitis appears to be maintenance of barrier function. Bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrate that leukocyte expression of TFF2 is not sufficient for prevention of colitis induction but, rather, that the gastrointestinal epithelium is the primary source of TFF2. Together, these findings illustrate that epithelial TFF2 is an important endogenous regulator of gut mucosal homeostasis that can modulate immune and epithelial compartments. Because of its extreme stability, even in the corrosive gut lumen, TFF2 is an attractive candidate as an oral therapeutic scaffold for future drug development in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.", "Keywords": ["IL-33", "colitis", "dextran sodium sulfate", "mucosal immunity", "trefoil", "trefoil factor 2"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Cells, Cultured", "Colitis", "Colon", "Cytokines", "Dextran Sulfate", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Inflammation Mediators", "Interleukin-33", "Interleukin-6", "Interleukins", "Leukocytes", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mucins", "Muscle Proteins", "Peptides", "Severity of Illness Index", "Time Factors", "Trefoil Factor-1", "Trefoil Factor-2", "Trefoil Factor-3", "Weight Loss"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Louise M", "Last Name": "Judd", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; louise.judd@mcri.edu.au."}, {"First Name": "Heather V", "Last Name": "Chalinor", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia;"}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Walduck", "Affiliation": "RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia; and."}, {"First Name": "Daniel I", "Last Name": "Pavlic", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia;"}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "D\u00e4britz", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia;"}, {"First Name": "Zinaida", "Last Name": "Dubeykovskaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Irving Cancer Research Centre, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Irving Cancer Research Centre, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Trevelyan R", "Last Name": "Menheniott", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia;"}, {"First Name": "Andrew S", "Last Name": "Giraud", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia;"}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

In three separate mouse models of gastric cancer, surgical or pharmacological denervation of the stomach (bilateral or unilateral truncal vagotomy, or local injection of botulinum toxin type A) markedly reduced tumor incidence and progression, but only in the denervated portion of the stomach. Vagotomy or botulinum toxin type A treatment also enhanced the therapeutic effects of systemic chemotherapy and prolonged survival. Denervation-induced suppression of tumorigenesis was associated with inhibition of Wnt signaling and suppression of stem cell expansion. In gastric organoid cultures, neurons stimulated growth in a Wnt-mediated fashion through cholinergic signaling. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockout of the muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor suppressed gastric tumorigenesis. In gastric cancer patients, tumor stage correlated with neural density and activated Wnt signaling, whereas vagotomy reduced the risk of gastric cancer.

Using iTRAQ and LC-MS/MS we identified the adipokine, chemerin, as overexpressed in esophageal squamous cancer associated myofibroblasts (CAMs) compared with adjacent tissue myofibroblasts (ATMs). The chemerin receptor, ChemR23, is expressed by MSCs. Conditioned media (CM) from CAMs significantly increased MSC cell migration compared to ATM-CM; the action of CAM-CM was significantly reduced by chemerin-neutralising antibody, pretreatment of CAMs with chemerin siRNA, pretreatment of MSCs with ChemR23 siRNA, and by a ChemR23 receptor antagonist, CCX832. Stimulation of MSCs by chemerin increased phosphorylation of p42/44, p38 and JNK-II kinases and inhibitors of these kinases and PKC reversed chemerin-stimulated MSC migration. Chemerin stimulation of MSCs also induced expression and secretion of macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) that tended to restrict migratory responses to low concentrations of chemerin but not higher concentrations. In a xenograft model consisting of OE21 esophageal cancer cells and CAMs, homing of MSCs administered i.v. was inhibited by CCX832.

In this context, accessibility through the lumen using a minimally invasive approach provides a means for repetitive evaluation longitudinally by combining fluorescent endoscopic imaging technology with novel fluorescent nanoparticles that are phagocytized by immune cells in the microenvironment. The agent we developed for imaging is synthesized from Feraheme (ferumoxytol), a Food and Drug Administration-approved monocrystaline dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticle, which we conjugated to a near-infrared fluorochrome, CyAL5.5. We demonstrate a high level of uptake of the fluorescent nanoparticles by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the esophagus and spleen of L2Cre;p120ctnflox/flox mice. These mice develop esophageal dysplasia leading to squamous cell carcinoma; we have previously demonstrated that dysplastic and neoplastic esophageal lesions in these mice have an immune cell infiltration that is dominated by MDSCs. In the L2Cre;p120ctnflox/flox mice, evaluation of the spleen reveals that nearly 80% of CD45+ leukocytes that phagocytized the nanoparticle were CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs. After dexamethasone treatment, we observed concordant decreased fluorescent signal from esophageal lesions during fluorescent endoscopy and decreased CyAL5.5-fluorescent-positive immune cell infiltration in esophageal dysplastic lesions by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Our observations suggest that this translatable technology may be used for the early detection of dysplastic changes and the serial assessment of immunomodulatory therapy and to visualize changes in

Myofibroblasts are an important stromal cell type, which influence the tumour microenvironment by release of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, proteases, cytokines and chemokines. The mechanisms of secretion are poorly understood. Here, we describe the secretion of marker proteins in gastric cancer and control myofibroblasts in response to insulin-like growth factor (IGF) stimulation and, using functional genomic approaches, we identify proteins influencing the secretory response. IGF rapidly increased myofibroblast secretion of an ECM protein, TGF\u03b2ig-h3. The secretory response was not blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis and was partially mediated by increased intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)). The capacity for evoked secretion was associated with the presence of dense-core secretory vesicles and was lost in cells from patients with advanced gastric cancer. In cells responding to IGF-II, the expression of neuroendocrine marker proteins, including secretogranin-II and proenkephalin, was identified by gene array and LC-MS/MS respectively, and verified experimentally. The expression of proenkephalin was decreased in cancers from patients with advanced disease. Inhibition of secretogranin-II expression decreased the secretory response to IGF, and its over-expression recovered the secretory response consistent with a role in secretory vesicle biogenesis. We conclude that normal and some gastric cancer myofibroblasts have a neuroendocrine-like phenotype characterized by Ca(2+)-dependent regulated secretion, dense-core secretory vesicles and expression of neuroendocrine marker proteins; loss of the phenotype is associated with advanced cancer.

Male INS-GAS mice co-infected with H. pylori and H. polygyrus for 5 months were assessed for gastrointestinal lesions, inflammation-related mRNA expression, FoxP3(+) cells, epithelial proliferation, and gastric colonization with H. pylori and Altered Schaedler Flora. Despite similar gastric inflammation and high levels of proinflammatory mRNA, helminth co-infection increased FoxP3(+) cells in the corpus and reduced H. pylori-associated gastric atrophy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.04), dysplasia (p\u00a0<\u00a00.02) and prevented H. pylori-induced changes in the gastric flora (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This is the first evidence of helminth infection reducing H. pylori-induced gastric lesions while inhibiting changes in gastric flora, consistent with prior observations that gastric colonization with enteric microbiota accelerated gastric lesions in INS-GAS mice. Identifying how helminths reduce gastric premalignant lesions and impact bacterial colonization of the H. pylori infected stomach could lead to new treatment strategies to inhibit progression from chronic gastritis to cancer in humans.", "Keywords": ["Altered Schaedler Flora", "Gastric cancer", "Helicobacter pylori", "Heligmosomoides polygyrus", "INS-GAS mice"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Atrophy", "Coinfection", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Gastric Mucosa", "Helicobacter Infections", "Helminthiasis", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microbiota"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark T", "Last Name": "Whary", "Affiliation": "Division of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.

DCLK1\u207a tuft cells are increased in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis; however, the role of these cells within the gastrointestinal epithelium and their potential as cancer-initiating cells are poorly understood. Here, using a BAC-CreERT-dependent genetic lineage-tracing strategy, we determined that a subpopulation of DCLK1\u207a cells is extremely long lived and possesses rare stem cell abilities. Moreover, genetic ablation of Dclk1 revealed that DCLK1\u207a tuft cells contribute to recovery following intestinal and colonic injury. Surprisingly, conditional knockdown of the Wnt regulator APC in DCLK1\u207a cells was not sufficient to drive colonic carcinogenesis under normal conditions; however, dextran sodium sulfate-induced (DSS-induced) colitis promoted the development of poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma in mice lacking APC in DCLK1\u207a cells. Importantly, colonic tumor formation occurred even when colitis onset was delayed for up to 3 months after induced APC loss in DCLK1\u207a cells. Thus, our data define an intestinal DCLK1\u207a tuft cell population that is long lived, quiescent, and important for intestinal homeostasis and regeneration.

To test epigenetic therapy against this cancer, we used the DNA demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) in an aggressive mouse model of stromal rich PDAC (KPC-Brca1 mice). In untreated tumors, we found globally decreased 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) in malignant epithelial cells and in cancer-associated myofibroblasts (CAF), along with increased amounts of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-HmC) in CAFs, in progression from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to PDAC. DAC further reduced DNA methylation and slowed PDAC progression, markedly extending survival in an early-treatment protocol and significantly though transiently inhibiting tumor growth when initiated later, without adverse side effects. Escaping tumors contained areas of sarcomatoid transformation with disappearance of CAFs. Mixing-allografting experiments and proliferation indices showed that DAC efficacy was due to inhibition of both the malignant epithelial cells and the CAFs. Expression profiling and immunohistochemistry highlighted DAC induction of STAT1 in the tumors, and DAC plus IFN-\u03b3 produced an additive antiproliferative effect on PDAC cells.
