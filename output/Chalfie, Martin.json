Eukaryotic genomes contain multiple tubulin isotypes, and their missense mutations cause a range of neurodevelopmental defects. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons, we analyzed the effects of 67 tubulin missense mutations on neurite growth. Three types of mutations emerged: 1) loss-of-function mutations, which cause mild defects in neurite growth; 2) antimorphic mutations, which map to the GTP binding site and intradimer and interdimer interfaces, significantly reduce MT stability, and cause severe neurite growth defects; and 3) neomorphic mutations, which map to the exterior surface, increase MT stability, and cause ectopic neurite growth. Structure-function analysis reveals a causal relationship between tubulin structure and MT stability. This stability affects neuronal morphogenesis. As part of this analysis, we engineered several disease-associated human tubulin mutations into C. elegans genes and examined their impact on neuronal development at the cellular level. We also discovered an \u03b1-tubulin (TBA-7) that appears to destabilize MTs.

We found that some differences among the subtypes of Caenorhabditis elegans VC neurons, particularly the expression of the transcription factor gene unc-4, require histone modification, most likely H3K9 methylation. An EGF signal from the vulva alleviated the epigenetic repression of unc-4 in vulval VC neurons but not the more distant nonvulval VC cells, which kept unc-4 silenced. Loss of the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 or H3K9me2/3 binding proteins HPL-2 and LIN-61 or a novel chromodomain protein CEC-3 caused ectopic unc-4 expression in all VC neurons. Downstream of the EGF signaling in vulval VC neurons, the transcription factor LIN-11 and histone demethylases removed the suppressive histone marks and derepressed unc-4. Behaviorally, expression of UNC-4 in all the VC neurons caused an imbalance in the egg-laying circuit. Thus, epigenetic mechanisms help establish subtype-specific gene expression, which are needed for optimal activity of a neural circuit.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Histones", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Methylation", "Neurons", "Nuclear Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Vulva"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chaogu", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Siavash", "Last Name": "Karimzadegan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Victor", "Last Name": "Chiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Chalfie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23887421", "Title": "Chocolate habits of Nobel prizewinners.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cacao", "Diet", "Humans", "Male", "Nobel Prize"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Beatrice A", "Last Name": "Golomb", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sydney", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Chalfie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sheldon Lee", "Last Name": "Glashow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Roy J", "Last Name": "Glauber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David Hunter", "Last Name": "Hubel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric S", "Last Name": "Maskin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Greengard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Roberts", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susumu", "Last Name": "Tonegawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frank A", "Last Name": "Wilczek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric Michael", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Terrence J", "Last Name": "Sejnowski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Jul25"}, {"PMID": "23788625", "Title": "A combinatorial regulatory signature controls terminal differentiation of the dopaminergic nervous system in C. elegans.", "Abstract": "Terminal differentiation programs in the nervous system are encoded by cis-regulatory elements that control the expression of terminal features of individual neuron types. We decoded the regulatory information that controls the expression of five enzymes and transporters that define the terminal identity of all eight dopaminergic neurons in the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite. We show that the tightly coordinated, robust expression of these dopaminergic enzymes and transporters (\"dopamine pathway\") is ensured through a combinatorial cis-regulatory signature that is shared by all dopamine pathway genes. This signature is composed of an Ets domain-binding site, recognized by the previously described AST-1 Ets domain factor, and two distinct types of homeodomain-binding sites that act in a partially redundant manner. Through genetic screens, we identified the sole C. elegans Distalless/Dlx ortholog, ceh-43, as a factor that acts through one of the homeodomain sites to control both induction and maintenance of terminal dopaminergic fate. The second type of homeodomain site is a Pbx-type site, which is recognized in a partially redundant and neuron subtype-specific manner by two Pbx factors, ceh-20 and ceh-40, revealing novel roles of Pbx factors in the context of terminal neuron differentiation. Taken together, we revealed a specific regulatory signature and cognate, terminal selector-type transcription factors that define the entire dopaminergic nervous system of an animal. Dopaminergic neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb express a similar combinatorial transcription factor collective of Ets/Dlx/Pbx factors, suggesting deep phylogenetic conservation of dopaminergic regulatory programs.", "Keywords": ["cis-regulatory motif", "differentiation", "dopamine", "elegans", "homeodomain", "neuron"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nervous System", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Sequence Alignment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Doitsidou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA. maria.doitsidou@uis.no"}, {"First Name": "Nuria", "Last Name": "Flames", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Irini", "Last Name": "Topalidou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Namiko", "Last Name": "Abe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Terry", "Last Name": "Felton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Remesal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Popovitchenko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Chalfie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Hobert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2013Jun15"}, {"PMID": "23239512", "Title": "Being counted.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Chemistry", "History, 20th Century", "Humans", "Nobel Prize"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Chalfie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA. mc21@columbia.edu"}], "Journal": "Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)", "PubDate": "2013Jan02"}]
