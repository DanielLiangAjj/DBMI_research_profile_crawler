Interferons increase hematopoietic stem cells during infection by activating STAT1, but the mechanisms by which STAT1 regulates intrinsic programs in neural stem cells (NSCs) during neuroinflammation is less known. Here we explored the role of STAT1 on NSC self-renewal. We show that overexpressing Stat1 in NSCs derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) decreases NSC self-renewal capacity while Stat1 deletion increases NSC self-renewal, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis in isolated NSCs. Importantly, we find upregulation of STAT1 in NSCs in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and an increase in pathological T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 rather than interleukin 17 (IL-17) in the cerebrospinal fluid of affected mice. We find IFN-\u03b3 is superior to IL-17 in reducing proliferation and precipitating an abnormal NSC phenotype featuring increased STAT1 phosphorylation and Stat1 and p16ink4a gene expression. Notably, Stat1-/- NSCs were resistant to the effect of IFN-\u03b3. Lastly, we identified a Stat1-dependent gene expression profile associated with an increase in the Sox9 transcription factor, a regulator of self-renewal. Stat1 binds and transcriptionally represses Sox9 in a transcriptional luciferase assay. We conclude that Stat1 serves as an inducible checkpoint for NSC self-renewal that is upregulated during chronic brain inflammation leading to decreased self-renewal. As such, Stat1 may be a potential target to modulate for next generation therapies to prevent progression and loss of repair function in NSCs/neural progenitors in MS.", "Keywords": ["STAT1", "Sox9", "experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis", "interferons", "multiple sclerosis", "neural stem cells", "subventricular zone"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jaime", "Last Name": "Imitola", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Neural Stem Cells and Functional Neurogenetics, Division of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ethan W", "Last Name": "Hollingsworth", "Affiliation": "Medical Scientist Training Program, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fumihiro", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Neural Stem Cells and Functional Neurogenetics, Division of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Olah", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Wassim", "Last Name": "Elyaman", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Starossom", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Pia", "Last Name": "Kivis\u00e4kk", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samia J", "Last Name": "Khoury", "Affiliation": "Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in cellular neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "34482628", "Title": "Epigenomic features related to microglia are associated with attenuated effect of APOE \u03b54 on Alzheimer's disease risk in humans.", "Abstract": "Not all apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers who survive to advanced age develop Alzheimer's disease (AD); factors attenuating the risk of \u03b54 on AD may exist.

In rodents, sleep disruption causes microglial activation, inhibition of which improves cognition. However, data from humans are lacking. We studied participants in two cohort studies of older persons-the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. We assessed sleep fragmentation by actigraphy and related this to cognitive function, to neocortical microglial marker gene expression measured by RNA sequencing, and to the neocortical density of microglia assessed by immunohistochemistry. Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with higher neocortical expression of genes characteristic of aged microglia, and a higher proportion of morphologically activated microglia, independent of chronological age- and dementia-related neuropathologies. Furthermore, these were, in turn, associated with worse cognition. This suggests that sleep fragmentation is accompanied by accelerated microglial aging and activation, which may partially underlie its association with cognitive impairment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Microglia", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Sleep", "Sleep Deprivation", "Sleep Wake Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kirusanthy", "Last Name": "Kaneshwaran", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Hurvitz Brain Sciences Program, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Toronto, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Olah", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shinya", "Last Name": "Tasaki", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Bradshaw", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aron S", "Last Name": "Buchman", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew S P", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Hurvitz Brain Sciences Program, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Toronto, Canada."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "30644388", "Title": "Chi3l3 induces oligodendrogenesis in an experimental model of autoimmune neuroinflammation.", "Abstract": "In demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), neural stem cells (NSCs) can replace damaged oligodendrocytes if the local microenvironment supports the required differentiation process.

We then used this model system to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We found six loci (CD33, PILRB, NUP160, LRRK2, RGS1, and METTL21B) in which the risk haplotype drives the association with both disease susceptibility and altered expression of a nearby gene (cis-eQTL). In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells.

It is still unclear whether this microglia-induced neuroinflammation occurs globally or is confined to distinct brain regions. In this study, we investigated microglia activity in various brain regions upon healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology in both human and mouse samples. In purified microglia isolated from aging mouse brains, we found a profound gene expression pattern related to pro-inflammatory processes, phagocytosis, and lipid homeostasis. Particularly in white matter microglia of 24-month-old mice, abundant expression of phagocytic markers including Mac-2, Axl, CD16/32, Dectin1, CD11c, and CD36 was detected. Interestingly, in white matter of human brain tissue the first signs of inflammatory activity were already detected during middle age. Thus quantification of microglial proteins, such as CD68 (commonly associated with phagocytosis) and HLA-DR (associated with antigen presentation), in postmortem human white matter brain tissue showed an age-dependent increase in immunoreactivity already in middle-aged people (53.2 \u00b1 2.0 years). This early inflammation was also detectable by non-invasive positron emission tomography imaging using [11C]-(R)-PK11195, a ligand that binds to activated microglia. Increased microglia activity was also prominently present in the white matter of human postmortem early-onset AD (EOAD) brain tissue. Interestingly, microglia activity in the white matter of late-onset AD (LOAD) CNS was similar to that of the aged clinically silent AD cases. These data indicate that microglia-induced neuroinflammation is predominant in the white matter of aging mice and humans as well as in EOAD brains. This white matter inflammation may contribute to the progression of neurodegeneration, and have prognostic value for detecting the onset and progression of aging and neurodegeneration.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "aging", "microglia", "neuroinflammation", "white matter"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Divya", "Last Name": "Raj", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Zhuoran", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Marjolein", "Last Name": "Breur", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, VU University Medical CenterAmsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Janine", "Last Name": "Doorduin", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Inge R", "Last Name": "Holtman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Olah", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Ietje J", "Last Name": "Mantingh-Otter", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Debby", "Last Name": "Van Dam", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neurochemistry and Behavior, Institute Born-Bunge, University of AntwerpWilrijk, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Peter P", "Last Name": "De Deyn", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neurochemistry and Behavior, Institute Born-Bunge, University of AntwerpWilrijk, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Wilfred", "Last Name": "den Dunnen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Bart J L", "Last Name": "Eggen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Amor", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, VU University Medical CenterAmsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Boddeke", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Section Medical Physiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of GroningenGroningen, Netherlands."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in molecular neuroscience", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "27725632", "Title": "Tiam1/Rac1 complex controls Il17a transcription and autoimmunity.", "Abstract": "ROR\u03b3t is a master transcription factor of Th17 cells and considered as a promising drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Typically, these conditions present with multifocal CNS lesions making it impractical to inject NSCs locally, thus mandating optimization of vascular delivery of the cells to involved sites. Here, we analyzed NSCs for expression of molecular effectors of cell migration and found that these cells are natively devoid of E-selectin ligands. Using glycosyltransferase-programmed stereosubstitution (GPS), we glycan engineered the cell surface of NSCs (\"GPS-NSCs\") with resultant enforced expression of the potent E-selectin ligand HCELL (hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand) and of an E-selectin-binding glycoform of neural cell adhesion molecule (\"NCAM-E\"). Following intravenous (i.v.) injection, short-term homing studies demonstrated that, compared with buffer-treated (control) NSCs, GPS-NSCs showed greater neurotropism. Administration of GPS-NSC significantly attenuated the clinical course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), with markedly decreased inflammation and improved oligodendroglial and axonal integrity, but without evidence of long-term stem cell engraftment. Notably, this effect of NSC is not a universal property of adult stem cells, as administration of GPS-engineered mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells did not improve EAE clinical course. These findings highlight the utility of cell surface glycan engineering to boost stem cell delivery in neuroinflammatory conditions and indicate that, despite the use of a neural tissue-specific progenitor cell population, neural repair in EAE results from endogenous repair and not from direct, NSC-derived cell replacement.", "Keywords": ["HCELL", "exofucosylation", "glycan engineering", "multiple sclerosis", "neural stem cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Movement", "Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental", "Genetic Therapy", "Hyaluronan Receptors", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Neural Stem Cells", "Polysaccharides", "Selectins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jasmeen S", "Last Name": "Merzaban", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology Division of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Jaime", "Last Name": "Imitola", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah C", "Last Name": "Starossom", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bing", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jack", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology."}, {"First Name": "Amal J", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "Division of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Olah", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ayman F", "Last Name": "Abuelela", "Affiliation": "Division of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia."}, {"First Name": "Samia J", "Last Name": "Khoury", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Sackstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology Department of Medicine, Harvard Skin Disease Research Center rsackstein@partners.org."}], "Journal": "Glycobiology", "PubDate": "2015Dec"}, {"PMID": "24879792", "Title": "BCL6 controls Th9 cell development by repressing Il9 transcription.", "Abstract": "The transcriptional repressor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is required for the development of Th follicular cells, and it has been shown to suppress Th2 cell differentiation. We demonstrate that BCL6 is a key regulator of Th9 cell development. BCL6 expression is transiently downregulated in polarized Th9 cells, and forced expression of BCL6 in Th9 cells impairs Th9 cell differentiation. In contrast, BCL6 knockdown upregulated IL-9 production in Th9 cells. The function of BCL6 in Th9 cells is under the control of IL-2/JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that, in Th9 cells, BCL6 and STAT5 bind to adjacent motifs in the Il9 promoter. Furthermore, we found that STAT5 binding was associated with the abundance of a permissive histone mark at the Il9 promoter, whereas under conditions in which BCL6 binding was predominant, a repressive histone mark was prevalent. The effects of STAT5 and BCL6 on IL-9 transcription were further demonstrated using an IL-9 luciferase reporter assay in which BCL6 repressed STAT5-mediated Il9 transactivation. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, forced expression of BCL6 in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein35-55-specific Th9 cells resulted in decreased IL-9 production and induction of IFN-\u03b3, causing an exacerbation of the clinical disease.

Increasing evidence suggests that changes in microglia cells contribute to the age-related deterioration of the CNS. The most prominent age-related change of microglia is enhanced sensitivity to inflammatory stimuli, referred to as priming. It is unclear if priming is due to intrinsic microglia ageing or induced by the ageing neural environment. We have studied this in Ercc1 mutant mice, a DNA repair-deficient mouse model that displays features of accelerated aging in multiple tissues including the CNS. In Ercc1 mutant mice, microglia showed hallmark features of priming such as an exaggerated response to peripheral lipopolysaccharide exposure in terms of cytokine expression and phagocytosis. Specific targeting of the Ercc1 deletion to forebrain neurons resulted in a progressive priming response in microglia exemplified by phenotypic alterations.

In this study, we investigated how to reduce the proinflammatory properties of IMCs and IDCs and further convert them into immune regulatory dendritic cells (DCs). We found that IL-4 and retinoic acid (RA) cotreatment of GM-CSF-differentiated IDCs synergistically induced the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2, a rate-limiting enzyme for RA synthesis in DCs. IL-4 plus RA-treated IDCs upregulated CD103 expression and markedly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines upon activation. IL-4 plus RA-treated IDCs strongly induced CD4\u207aFoxp3\u207a regulatory T cell differentiation and suppressed Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factors Stat6 and RA receptor \u03b2 play important roles in aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2, induction. In addition, IL-4 and RA signaling pathways interact closely to enhance the regulatory function of treated DCs. Adoptive transfer of IL-4 plus RA-treated DCs significantly increased regulatory T cell frequency in vivo.
