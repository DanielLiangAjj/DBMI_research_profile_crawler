In fungi, the dependency on oxygen for sterol production has resulted in a shared transcriptional response, resembling prolyl hydroxylation of Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) in metazoans. Whether an analogous metazoan pathway exists is unknown. Here, we identify Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2), the key transcription factor driving sterol production in mammals, as an oxygen-sensitive regulator of cholesterol synthesis. SREBP2 degradation in hypoxia overrides the normal sterol-sensing response, and is HIF independent. We identify MARCHF6, through its NADPH-mediated activation in hypoxia, as the main ubiquitin ligase controlling SREBP2 stability. Hypoxia-mediated degradation of SREBP2 protects cells from statin-induced cell death by forcing cells to rely on exogenous cholesterol uptake, explaining why many solid organ tumours become auxotrophic for cholesterol. Our findings therefore uncover an oxygen-sensitive pathway for governing cholesterol synthesis through regulated SREBP2-dependent protein degradation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Oxygen", "Transcription Factors", "Hypoxia", "Cholesterol", "Sterols", "Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna S", "Last Name": "Dickson", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tekle", "Last Name": "Pauzaite", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Esther", "Last Name": "Arnaiz", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Brian M", "Last Name": "Ortmann", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "West", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Norbert", "Last Name": "Volkmar", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Anthony W", "Last Name": "Martinelli", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Zhaoqi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Niek", "Last Name": "Wit", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dennis", "Last Name": "Vitkup", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Kaser", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Lehner", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Nathan", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK. jan33@cam.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2023Aug09"}, {"PMID": "35739397", "Title": "Cancer cells depend on environmental lipids for proliferation when electron acceptors are limited.", "Abstract": "Production of oxidized biomass, which requires regeneration of the cofactor NAD+, can be a proliferation bottleneck that is influenced by environmental conditions.

Here, we show that de novo lipid biosynthesis can impose a substantial NAD+ consumption cost in proliferating cancer cells. When electron acceptors are limited, environmental lipids become crucial for proliferation because NAD+ is required to generate precursors for fatty acid biosynthesis. We find that both oxidative and even net reductive pathways for lipogenic citrate synthesis are gated by reactions that depend on NAD+ availability. We also show that access to acetate can relieve lipid auxotrophy by bypassing the NAD+ consuming reactions.

Despite recent progress in understanding ASD genetics, the nature of phenotypic heterogeneity across probands remains unclear. Notably, likely gene-disrupting (LGD) de novo mutations affecting the same gene often result in substantially different ASD phenotypes. Nevertheless, we find that truncating mutations affecting the same exon frequently lead to strikingly similar intellectual phenotypes in unrelated ASD probands. Analogous patterns are observed for two independent proband cohorts and several other important ASD-associated phenotypes. We find that exons biased toward prenatal and postnatal expression preferentially contribute to ASD cases with lower and higher IQ phenotypes, respectively. These results suggest that exons, rather than genes, often represent a unit of effective phenotypic impact for truncating mutations in autism. The observed phenotypic patterns are likely mediated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of splicing isoforms, with autism phenotypes usually triggered by relatively mild (15-30%) decreases in overall gene dosage. We find that each ASD\u00a0gene with recurrent mutations can be characterized by a parameter, phenotype dosage sensitivity (PDS), which quantifies the relationship between changes in a gene's dosage and changes in a given disease phenotype.

This mechanism relies on a new form of cellular memory, where cells effectively encode past stimulation levels in the abundance of cognate receptors on the cell surface.

Loss of Bcat1 and Bcat2, the enzymes responsible for BCAA use, impairs NSCLC tumor formation, but these enzymes are not required for PDAC tumor formation, arguing that tissue of origin is an important determinant of how cancers satisfy their metabolic requirements.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids, Branched-Chain", "Animals", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Minor Histocompatibility Antigens", "Mutation", "Nitrogen", "Organ Specificity", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pregnancy Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Transaminases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jared R", "Last Name": "Mayers", "Affiliation": "Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Multiple cell types and brain areas are affected, but the impact of ASD mutations appears to be strongest in cortical interneurons, pyramidal neurons and the medium spiny neurons of the striatum, implicating cortical and corticostriatal brain circuits. In females, truncating ASD mutations on average affect genes with 50-100% higher brain expression than in males.

In contrast, relatively little is known about the long-term evolution of species' phenotypic and genetic properties. This represents an important gap in our understanding of evolution, as exactly these proprieties play key roles in natural selection and adaptation to diverse environments. Here we perform a comparative analysis of bacterial growth and gene deletion phenotypes using hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Overall, bacterial phenotypic evolution can be described by a two-stage process with a rapid initial phenotypic diversification followed by a slow long-term exponential divergence. The observed average divergence trend, with approximately similar fractions of phenotypic properties changing per unit time, continues for billions of years. We experimentally confirm the predicted divergence trend using the phenotypic profiles of 40 diverse bacterial species across more than 60 growth conditions. Our analysis suggests that, at long evolutionary distances, gene essentiality is significantly more conserved than the ability to utilize different nutrients, while synthetic lethality is significantly less conserved. We also find that although a rapid phenotypic evolution is sometimes observed within the same species, a transition from high to low phenotypic similarity occurs primarily at the genus level.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteria", "Biological Evolution", "Gene Deletion", "Genome, Bacterial", "Phenotype", "Selection, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Germ\u00e1n", "Last Name": "Plata", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Systems Biology, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, Structural and Genetic Studies, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher S", "Last Name": "Henry", "Affiliation": "Mathemathics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dennis", "Last Name": "Vitkup", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Systems Biology, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2015Jan15"}, {"PMID": "24288370", "Title": "Genetic robustness and functional evolution of gene duplicates.", "Abstract": "Gene duplications are a major source of evolutionary innovations. Understanding the functional divergence of duplicates and their role in genetic robustness is an important challenge in biology. Previously, analyses of genetic robustness were primarily focused on duplicates essentiality and epistasis in several laboratory conditions. In this study, we use several quantitative data sets to understand compensatory interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae duplicates that are likely to be relevant in natural biological populations. We find that, owing to their high functional load, close duplicates are unlikely to provide substantial backup in the context of large natural populations. Interestingly, as duplicates diverge from each other, their overall functional load is reduced. At intermediate divergence distances the quantitative decrease in fitness due to removal of one duplicate becomes smaller. At these distances, yeast duplicates display more balanced functional loads and their transcriptional control becomes significantly more complex. As yeast duplicates diverge beyond 70% sequence identity, their ability to compensate for each other becomes similar to that of random pairs of singletons.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Evolution, Molecular", "Gene Duplication", "Genes, Fungal", "Phenotype", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Germ\u00e1n", "Last Name": "Plata", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032, USA, Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, Structural, and Genetic Studies, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032, USA and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dennis", "Last Name": "Vitkup", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nucleic acids research", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "24013487", "Title": "The COMBREX project: design, methodology, and initial results.", "Abstract": "Experimental data exists for only a vanishingly small fraction of sequenced microbial genes.
