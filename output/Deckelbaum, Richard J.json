[{"PMID": "38761420", "Title": "Omega-3 fatty acid diglyceride emulsions as a novel injectable acute therapeutic in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.", "Abstract": "Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), resulting from a lack of blood flow and oxygen before or during newborn delivery, is a leading cause of cerebral palsy and neurological disability in children. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the current standard of care in HIE, is only beneficial in 1 of 7-8 cases. Therefore, there is a critical need for more efficient treatments. We have previously reported that omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FA) carried by triglyceride (TG) lipid emulsions provide neuroprotection after experimental hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury in neonatal mice. Herein, we propose a novel acute therapeutic approach using an n-3 diglyceride (DG) lipid emulsions. Importantly, n-3 DG preparations had much smaller particle size compared to commercially available or lab-made n-3\u202fTG emulsions. We showed that n-3 DG molecules have the advantage of incorporating at substantially higher levels than n-3\u202fTG into an in vitro model of phospholipid membranes. We also observed that n-3 DG after parenteral administration in neonatal mice reaches the bloodstream more rapidly than n-3\u202fTG. Using neonatal HI brain injury models in mice and rats, we found that n-3 DG emulsions provide superior neuroprotection than n-3\u202fTG emulsions or TH in decreasing brain infarct size. Additionally, we found that n-3 DGs attenuate microgliosis and astrogliosis. Thus, n-3 DG emulsions are a superior, promising, and novel therapy for treating HIE.", "Keywords": ["diglycerides", "gliosis", "hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy", "lipid emulsion", "neuroprotection", "omega-3 fatty acids"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Animals, Newborn", "Fatty Acids, Omega-3", "Emulsions", "Mice", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Disease Models, Animal", "Male", "Brain"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hylde", "Last Name": "Zirpoli", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY 10032,\u00a0USA; Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Similar to AD, TBI models present with cellular metabolic alterations and modulated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Specifically, AD and TBI tissues display increases in amyloid-\u03b2 as well as its precursor, the\u00a0APP C-terminal fragment of 99 a.a. (C99). Our recent data in cell models of AD indicate that C99, due to its affinity for cholesterol, induces the formation of transient lipid raft domains in the ER known as mitochondria-associated\u00a0endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (\"MAM\" domains). The formation of these domains recruits and activates specific lipid metabolic enzymes that regulate cellular cholesterol trafficking and sphingolipid turnover. Increased C99 levels in AD cell models promote MAM formation and significantly modulate cellular lipid homeostasis. Here, these phenotypes were recapitulated in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult mice. Specifically, the injured cortex and hippocampus displayed significant increases in C99 and MAM activity, as measured by phospholipid synthesis, sphingomyelinase activity and cholesterol turnover. In addition, our cell type-specific lipidomics analyses revealed significant changes in microglial lipid composition that are consistent with the observed alterations in MAM-resident enzymes. Altogether, we propose that alterations in the regulation of MAM and relevant lipid metabolic pathways could contribute to the epidemiological connection between TBI and AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s", "Brain injury", "Contact sites", "Lipids", "Mitochondria", "Neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Alzheimer Disease", "Mitochondria", "Up-Regulation", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Lipids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rishi R", "Last Name": "Agrawal", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA. rra2124@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Delfina", "Last Name": "Larrea", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yimeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Biomarkers Core Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 10-105, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lingyan", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, Havemeyer Hall, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hylde", "Last Name": "Zirpoli", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leslie G", "Last Name": "Cummins", "Affiliation": "Analytical Imaging Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY, 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Emmanuele", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donghui", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, Havemeyer Hall, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Taekyung D", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank P", "Last Name": "Macaluso", "Affiliation": "Analytical Imaging Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY, 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "Biomarkers Core Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 622 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 10-105, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Kernie", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 710 W. 168th St., New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Deckelbaum", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Estela", "Last Name": "Area-Gomez", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St., Presbyterian Hospital 15E-1512, New York, NY, 10032, USA. estela.area@cib.csic.es."}], "Journal": "Cellular and molecular neurobiology", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "36243606", "Title": "Guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of hypolipidemia disorders.", "Abstract": "The Abetalipoproteinemia and Related Disorders Foundation was established in 2019 to provide guidance and support for the life-long management of inherited hypocholesterolemia disorders.

in infant formula that affect the immune system: recommendations from an expert panel.", "Abstract": "Bioactive ingredients for infant formula have been sought to reduce disparities in health outcomes between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Traditional food safety methodologies have limited ability to assess some bioactive ingredients. It is difficult to assess the effects of nutrition on the infant immune system because of coincident developmental adaptations to birth, establishment of the microbiome and introduction to solid foods, and perinatal environmental factors. An expert panel was convened to review information on immune system development published since the 2004 Institute of Medicine report on evaluating the safety of new infant formula ingredients and to recommend measurements that demonstrate the safety of bioactive ingredients intended for that use. Panel members participated in a 2-d virtual symposium in November 2020 and in follow-up discussions throughout early 2021. Key topics included identification of immune system endpoints from nutritional intervention studies, effects of human milk feeding and human milk substances on infant health outcomes, ontologic development of the infant immune system, and microbial influences on tolerance. The panel explored how \"nonnormal\" conditions such as preterm birth, allergy, and genetic disorders could help define developmental immune markers for healthy term infants. With consideration of breastfed infants as a reference, ensuring proper control groups, and attention to numerous potential confounders, the panel recommended a set of standard clinical endpoints including growth, response to vaccination, infection and other adverse effects related to inflammation, and allergy and atopic diseases. It compiled a set of candidate markers to characterize stereotypical patterns of immune system development during infancy, but absence of reference ranges, variability in methods and populations, and unreliability of individual markers to predict disease prevented the panel from including many markers as safety endpoints. The panel's findings and recommendations are applicable for industry, regulatory, and academic settings, and will inform safety assessments for immunomodulatory ingredients in foods besides infant formula.", "Keywords": ["bioactives", "development", "human milk", "immune system", "immunomodulation", "infant", "infant formula", "nutrition", "safety recommendations"], "MeSH terms": ["Female",

Injection of Omega-3 Triglyceride Emulsion Provides Very Similar Protection as Hypothermia in a Neonatal Mouse Model of Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is a currently accepted treatment for neonatal asphyxia and is a promising strategy in adult stroke therapy. We previously reported that acute administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) triglyceride emulsion (tri-DHA) protects against hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury in neonatal mice. We questioned if co-treatment with HT and tri-DHA would achieve synergic effects in protecting the brain from HI injury. Neonatal mice (10-day old) subjected to HI injury were placed in temperature-controlled chambers for 4 h of either HT (rectal temperature 31-32\u00b0C) or normothermia (NT, rectal temperature 37\u00b0C). Mice were treated with tri-DHA (0.375 g tri-DHA/kg bw, two injections) before and 1 h after initiation of HT. We observed that HT, beginning immediately after HI injury, reduced brain infarct volume similarly to tri-DHA treatment (~50%). Further, HT delayed 2 h post-HI injury provided neuroprotection (% infarct volume: 31.4 \u00b1 4.1 vs. 18.8 \u00b1 4.6 HT), while 4 h delayed HT did not protect against HI insult (% infarct volume: 30.7 \u00b1 5.0 vs. 31.3 \u00b1 5.6 HT). HT plus tri-DHA combination treatment beginning at 0 or 2 h after HI injury did not further reduce infarct volumes compared to HT alone.

We showed that exogenous DHA increased concentrations of DHA in brain mitochondria as well as DHA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) levels in the brain. The objective of the present study was to investigate the distribution of emulsion particles and changes in plasma lipid profiles after tri-DHA injection in na\u00efve mice and in animals subjected to HI injury. We also examined whether tri-DHA injection would change DHA- and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-derived SPM levels in the brain. To address this, neonatal (10-day-old) na\u00efve and HI mice were injected with radiolabeled tri-DHA emulsion (0.375\u00a0g tri-DHA/kg bw), and blood clearance and tissue distribution were analyzed. Among all the organs assayed, the lowest uptake of emulsion particles was in the brain (<0.4% recovered dose) in both na\u00efve and HI mice, while the liver had the highest uptake. Tri-DHA administration increased DHA concentrations in plasma lysophosphatidylcholine and non-esterified fatty acids. Additionally, treatment with tri-DHA after HI injury significantly elevated the levels of DHA-derived SPMs and monohydroxy-containing DHA-derived products in the brain. Further, tri-DHA administration increased resolvin E2 (RvE2, 5S,18R-dihydroxy-eicosa-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z,16E-pentaenoic acid) and monohydroxy-containing EPA-derived products in the brain. These results suggest that the transfer of DHA through plasma lipid pools plays an important role in DHA brain transport in neonatal mice subjected to HI injury. Furthermore, increases in EPA and EPA-derived SPMs following tri-DHA injection demonstrate interlinked metabolism of these two fatty acids. Hence, changes in both EPA and DHA profile patterns need to be considered when studying the protective effects of DHA after HI brain injury. Our results highlight the need for further investigation to differentiate the effects of DHA from EPA on neuroprotective pathways following HI damage.

Thus, mitochondrial \"protective\" molecules could be considered for new therapeutic regimens. We recently reported that acute administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) triglyceride lipid emulsion, immediately after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult, markedly attenuated brain infarct size. This was associated with an early change of DHA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) profiles. Specifically, DHA treatment induced a 50% increase of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) levels in ischemic brain. Based on these findings, we questioned if direct administration of NPD1 after HI injury also affords neuroprotection, and if so, by what mechanisms. Using HI insult to mimic ischemic stroke in neonatal mice, we observed that acute intraperitoneal injection of NPD1 immediately after HI injury prevented the expansion of the ischemic core by ~40% and improved coordination and motor abilities compared to the control group. At 7\u00a0days after HI injury, NPD1 treatment decreased ipsilateral hemisphere atrophy and preserved motor functions in wire-holding and bridge-crossing tests compared to control littermates. Brain mitochondria, isolated at 4\u00a0h after reperfusion from mice treated with NPD1, showed an increase in the capacity to buffer calcium after HI injury, as result of the preservation of mitochondrial membranes. Further, NPD1 induced a reduction of mitochondrial BAX translocation and oligomerization, attenuated cytochrome C release and decreased AIF nuclear translocation. To confirm whether NPD1 acts as BAX inhibitor, we evaluated NPD1 action co-administrated with a pro-apoptotic agent, staurosporine, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts as in vitro model of apoptosis. NPD1 exposure markedly decreased mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, blocking BAX translocation from cytosol to mitochondria and subsequently reducing caspase-3 activation. Our findings provide novel evidence that the neuroprotective action of NPD1 is elicited rapidly in the first few hours after ischemic injury and is associated with both preserved mitochondrial membrane structure and reduced BAX mitochondrial translocation and activation.", "Keywords": ["Apoptosis", "BAX", "DHA", "Ischemic brain injury", "Mitochondria", "NPD1"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Apoptosis", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Brain Infarction", "Brain Ischemia", "Docosahexaenoic Acids", "Ischemic Stroke", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mitochondria", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reperfusion Injury", "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hylde", "Last Name": "Zirpoli", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, 10032, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sergey A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, 10032, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Zoya V", "Last Name": "Niatsetskaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, 10032, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Korapat", "Last Name": "Mayurasakorn", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, 10032, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Denny Joseph", "Last Name": "Manual Kollareth", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, 10032, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Charles N", "Last Name": "Serhan", "Affiliation": "Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02115, MA, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vadim S", "Last Name": "Ten", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, 10032, NY, United States of America.

We questioned whether acute administration of n-3 rich triglyceride (TG) emulsions could preserve cardiac function and decrease injury after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insult. We used two different experimental models: in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and ex-vivo, C57BL/6 murine hearts were perfused using Langendorff technique (LT). In the LAD model, mice treated with n-3 TG emulsion (1.5 g/kg body weight), immediately after ischemia and 1 h later during reperfusion, significantly reduced infarct size and maintained cardiac function (p<0.05). In the LT model, administration of n-3 TG emulsion (300 mg TG/100 ml) during reperfusion significantly improved functional recovery (p<0.05). In both models, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as a marker of injury, were significantly reduced by n-3 TG emulsion. To investigate the mechanisms by which n-3 FAs protects hearts from I/R injury, we investigated changes in key pathways linked to cardioprotection. In the ex-vivo model, we showed that n-3 FAs increased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3\u03b2 proteins (p<0.05). Acute n-3 TG emulsion treatment also increased Bcl-2 protein level and reduced an autophagy marker, Beclin-1 (p<0.05). Additionally, cardioprotection by n-3 TG emulsion was linked to changes in PPAR\u03b3 protein expression (p<0.05). Rosiglitazone and p-AKT inhibitor counteracted the positive effect of n-3 TG; GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor plus n-3 TG significantly inhibited LDH release. We conclude that acute n-3 TG injection during reperfusion provides cardioprotection.

To determine how LpL affects the biology of adipose tissue, we created adipose-specific LpL knock-out (ATLO) mice, and we compared them with whole body LpL knock-out mice rescued with muscle LpL expression (MCK/L0) and wild type (WT) mice. ATLO LpL mRNA and activity were reduced, respectively, 75 and 70% in gonadal adipose tissue (GAT), 90 and 80% in subcutaneous tissue, and 84 and 85% in brown adipose tissue (BAT). ATLO mice had increased plasma TG levels associated with reduced chylomicron TG uptake into BAT and lung. ATLO BAT, but not GAT, had altered TG composition. GAT from MCK/L0 was smaller and contained less polyunsaturated fatty acids in TG, although GAT from ATLO was normal unless LpL was overexpressed in muscle. High fat diet feeding led to less adipose in MCK/L0 mice but TG acyl composition in subcutaneous tissue and BAT reverted to that of WT. Therefore, adipocyte LpL in BAT modulates plasma lipoprotein clearance, and the greater metabolic activity of this depot makes its lipid composition more dependent on LpL-mediated uptake. Loss of adipose LpL reduces fat accumulation only if accompanied by greater LpL activity in muscle.

H/I insult was induced in C57BL/6J 10-day-old mice by right carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% O(2) for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Intraperitoneal injection with n-3-rich TG emulsions, n-6 rich TG emulsions or saline for control was administered at different time points before and/or after H/I. In separate experiments, dose responses were determined with TG containing only docosahexaenoic acid (Tri-DHA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (Tri-EPA) with a range of 0.1-0.375 g n-3 TG/kg, administered immediately after H/I insult. Infarct volume and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured. Treatment with n-3 TG emulsions both before- and after- H/I significantly reduced total infarct volume by a mean of 43% when administered 90 min prior to H/I and by 47% when administered immediately after H/I. In post-H/I experiments Tri-DHA, but not Tri-EPA exhibited neuroprotective effects with both low and high doses (p<0.05). Moreover, delayed post-H/I treatment with Tri-DHA significantly decreased total infarct volume by a mean of 51% when administered at 0 hr, by 46% at 1 hr, and by 51% at 2 hr after H/I insult. No protective effect occurred with Tri-DHA injection at 4 hr after H/I. There were no n-3 TG related differences in CBF. A significant reduction in brain tissue death was maintained after Tri-DHA injection at 8 wk after the initial brain injury.

Decreased dietary intake is a major determinant of weight loss in HIV. Despite a biological rationale to treat undernutrition in adults receiving ART, few studies have provided data on feasibility, safety, effectiveness, and sustainability of specific macronutrient supplements with HIV treatment in adults, especially supplements such as a food basket, a supplement approach seldom evaluated in spite of its wide use. We present the rationale and design for a study of a locally procured macronutrient supplement given to HIV-infected patients initiating ART with a body mass index (BMI) \u226420.0 kg/m(2). The objective was to determine feasibility of procurement, distribution, safety and to obtain preliminary effectiveness data for a locally procured supplement. The design was a comparative study for 200 adult participants at two Kenya government-supported clinics. The primary outcome was BMI at 24 weeks. Supplement duration was 24 weeks, total follow-up was 48 weeks, and the study included a comparison site. Novel aspects of this study include use of a standardized macronutrient supplement to protect the participant against household food sharing, and a complementary micronutrient supplement. Comprehensive data collected included dietary intake, HIV-related quality-of-life, food security, neuropsychiatric assessments, laboratory studies, and household geomapping. Assessments were made at baseline, at 24 weeks, and at 48 weeks post-ART initiation. Challenges included establishing a partnership with local millers, distribution from the HIV clinic, food safety, and tracking of participants.
