[{"PMID": "38873597", "Title": "Crosstalk between efferocytic myeloid cells and T-cells and its relevance to atherosclerosis.", "Abstract": "The interplay between myeloid cells and T-lymphocytes is critical to the regulation of host defense and inflammation resolution. Dysregulation of this interaction can contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. Important among these diseases is atherosclerosis, which refers to focal lesions in the arterial intima driven by elevated apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, notably low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and characterized by the formation of a plaque composed of inflammatory immune cells, a collection of dead cells and lipids called the necrotic core, and a fibrous cap. As the disease progresses, the necrotic core expands, and the fibrous cap becomes thin, which increases the risk of plaque rupture or erosion. Plaque rupture leads to a rapid thrombotic response that can give rise to heart attack, stroke, or sudden death. With marked lowering of circulating LDL, however, plaques become more stable and cardiac risk is lowered-a process known as atherosclerosis regression. A critical aspect of both atherosclerosis progression and regression is the crosstalk between innate (myeloid cells) and adaptive (T-lymphocytes) immune cells. Myeloid cells are specialized at clearing apoptotic cells by a process called efferocytosis, which is necessary for inflammation resolution. In advanced disease, efferocytosis is impaired, leading to secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, inflammation, and, most importantly, defective tissue resolution. In regression, efferocytosis is reawakened aiding in inflammation resolution and plaque stabilization. Here, we will explore how efferocytosing myeloid cells could affect T-cell function and vice versa through antigen presentation, secreted factors, and cell-cell contacts and how this cellular crosstalk may contribute to the progression or regression of atherosclerosis.", "Keywords": ["T-lymphocytes", "atherosclerosis", "crosstalk", "efferocytosis", "inflammation", "myeloid", "resolution"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Atherosclerosis", "T-Lymphocytes", "Myeloid Cells", "Animals", "Cell Communication", "Phagocytosis", "Apoptosis", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Ngai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Santosh R", "Last Name": "Sukka", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38776184", "Title": "Low MBOAT7 expression, a genetic risk for MASH, promotes a pro-fibrotic pathway involving hepatocyte TAZ upregulation.", "Abstract": "The common genetic variant rs641738 C>T is a risk factor for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), including liver fibrosis, and is associated with decreased expression of the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme MBOAT7 (LPIAT1).

Although many studies in mouse NASH models have suggested therapies, translation to humans is poor, with no approved drugs for NASH. One explanation may lie in differences between mouse and human hepatocytes. We used NASH diet-fed chimeric mice reconstituted with human hepatocytes (hu-liver mice) to test a mechanism-based hepatocyte-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA), GalNAc-siTaz, shown previously to block the progression to fibrotic NASH in mice. Following ablation of endogenous hepatocytes, male mice were reconstituted with human hepatocytes from a single donor with the rs738409-C/G PNPLA3 risk variant, resulting in \u223c95% human hepatocyte reconstitution. The mice were then fed a high-fat choline-deficient l-amino acid-defined diet for 6\u00a0weeks to induce NASH, followed by six weekly injections of GalNAc-siTAZ to silence hepatocyte-TAZ or control GalNAc-siRNA (GalNAc-control) while still on the NASH diet. GalNAc-siTAZ lowered human hepatic TAZ and IHH, a TAZ target that promotes NASH fibrosis. Most important, GalNAc-siTAZ decreased liver inflammation, hepatocellular injury, hepatic fibrosis, and profibrogenic mediator expression versus GalNAc-control, indicating that GalNAc-siTAZ decreased the progression of NASH in mice reconstituted with human hepatocytes.

Lactate signalling via GPR132 promotes Myc protein stabilization and subsequent macrophage proliferation. This mechanism is validated in vivo using a mouse model of dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis, which elevates apoptotic cell burden and requires efferocytosis to prevent inflammation and necrosis. Thus, EIMP, a key process in tissue resolution, requires inputs from two independent processes: a signalling pathway induced by apoptotic cell-derived nucleotides and a cellular metabolism pathway involving lactate production.

These macrophages are thought to rely mainly on oxidative phosphorylation, but emerging evidence suggests a possible link between efferocytosis and glycolysis. To gain further insight into this issue, we investigated molecular-cellular mechanisms involved in efferocytosis-induced macrophage glycolysis and its consequences. We found that efferocytosis promotes a transient increase in macrophage glycolysis that is dependent on rapid activation of the enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2), which distinguishes this process from glycolysis in pro-inflammatory macrophages. Mice transplanted with activation-defective PFKFB2 bone marrow and then subjected to dexamethasone-induced thymocyte apoptosis exhibit impaired thymic efferocytosis, increased thymic necrosis, and lower expression of the efferocytosis receptors MerTK and LRP1 on thymic macrophages compared with wild-type control mice. In vitro mechanistic studies revealed that glycolysis stimulated by the uptake of a first apoptotic cell promotes continual efferocytosis through lactate-mediated upregulation of MerTK and LRP1. Thus, efferocytosis-induced macrophage glycolysis represents a unique metabolic process that sustains continual efferocytosis in a lactate-dependent manner. The differentiation of this process from inflammatory macrophage glycolysis raises the possibility that it could be therapeutically enhanced to promote efferocytosis and resolution in chronic inflammatory diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase", "Inflammation", "Lactic Acid", "Macrophages", "Phagocytosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maaike", "Last Name": "Schilperoort", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. ms6235@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Ngai", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Katerelos", "Affiliation": "Kidney Laboratory, Department of Nephrology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Power", "Affiliation": "Kidney Laboratory, Department of Nephrology, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. iat1@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature metabolism", "PubDate": "2023Mar"}, {"PMID": "36566259", "Title": "A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies WDFY3 as a regulator of macrophage efferocytosis.", "Abstract": "Phagocytic clearance of dying cells, termed efferocytosis, is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis, yet our understanding of efferocytosis regulation remains incomplete.

The results show that Wdfy3 knockout in macrophages specifically impairs uptake, but not binding, of apoptotic cells due to defective actin disassembly. Additionally, WDFY3 interacts with GABARAP, thus facilitating LC3 lipidation and subsequent lysosomal acidification to permit the degradation of apoptotic cell components. Mechanistically, while the C-terminus of WDFY3 is sufficient to rescue the impaired degradation induced by Wdfy3 knockout, full-length WDFY3 is required to reconstitute the uptake of apoptotic cells. Finally, WDFY3 is also required for efficient efferocytosis in vivo in mice and in vitro in primary human macrophages.

We show here that the accumulation of necHCs in human and mouse NASH liver is associated with an up-regulation of the \"don't-eat-me\" ligand CD47 on necHCs, but not on apoptotic hepatocytes, and an increase in the CD47 receptor SIRP\u03b1 on liver macrophages, consistent with impaired macrophage-mediated clearance of necHCs. In vitro, necHC clearance by primary liver macrophages was enhanced by treatment with either anti-CD47 or anti-SIRP\u03b1. In a proof-of-concept mouse model of inducible hepatocyte necroptosis, anti-CD47 antibody treatment increased necHC uptake by liver macrophages and inhibited markers of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, which is responsible for liver fibrogenesis. Treatment of two mouse models of diet-induced NASH with anti-CD47, anti-SIRP\u03b1, or AAV8-H1-shCD47 to silence CD47 in hepatocytes increased the uptake of necHC by liver macrophages and decreased markers of HSC activation and liver fibrosis.

In chronic liver disease, fibrosis is a major factor determining outcomes, but efficient antifibrotic therapies are lacking. Although platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 constitute key fibrogenic mediators, they do not account for the well-established link between cell death and fibrosis in the liver. Here, we hypothesized that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may link epithelial cell death to fibrogenesis in the injured liver. DAMP receptor screening identified purinergic receptor P2Y14 among several candidates as highly enriched in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver. Conversely, P2Y14 ligands uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose and UDP-galactose were enriched in hepatocytes and were released upon different modes of cell death. Accordingly, ligand-receptor interaction analysis that combined proteomic and single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed P2Y14 ligands and P2Y14 receptor as a link between dying cells and HSCs, respectively. Treatment with P2Y14 ligands or coculture with dying hepatocytes promoted HSC activation in a P2Y14-dependent manner. P2Y14 ligands activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling in HSCs, resulting in ERK-dependent HSC activation.

Mechanisms of efferocytosis-mediated resolution are incompletely understood. Here, we show that AC-derived methionine regulates resolution through epigenetic repression of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphatase Dusp4. We focus on two key efferocytosis-induced pro-resolving mediators, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21), and show that efferocytosis induces prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2/cyclooxygenase 2 (Ptgs2/COX2), leading to PGE2 synthesis and PGE2-mediated induction of TGF-\u03b21. ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation by AC-activated CD36 is necessary for Ptgs2 induction, but this is insufficient owing to an ERK-DUSP4 negative feedback pathway that lowers phospho-ERK. However, subsequent AC engulfment and phagolysosomal degradation lead to Dusp4 repression, enabling enhanced p-ERK and induction of the Ptgs2-PGE2-TGF-\u03b21 pathway. Mechanistically, AC-derived methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine, which is used by DNA methyltransferase-3A (DNMT3A) to methylate Dusp4. Bone-marrow DNMT3A deletion in mice blocks COX2/PGE2, TGF-\u03b21, and resolution in sterile peritonitis, apoptosis-induced thymus injury and atherosclerosis.

Impaired efferocytosis drives the formation of clinically dangerous necrotic atherosclerotic plaques, the underlying etiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). An intron of the gene encoding PHACTR1 contains rs9349379 (A>G), a common variant associated with CAD. As PHACTR1 is an actin-binding protein, we reasoned that if the rs9349379 risk allele G causes lower PHACTR1 expression in macrophages, it might link the risk allele to CAD via impaired efferocytosis. We show here that rs9349379-G/G was associated with lower levels of PHACTR1 and impaired efferocytosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages and human atherosclerotic lesional macrophages compared with rs9349379-A/A.

NASH has no approved therapies, and liver fibrosis shows poor response to existing pharmacotherapy, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.

To understand tPA-PAI-1 regulation in obesity, we focused on hepatocytes, a functionally important source of tPA and PAI-1 that sense obesity-induced metabolic stress. We showed that obese mice, like humans, had reduced fibrinolysis and increased plasma PAI-1 and tPA, due largely to their increased hepatocyte expression. A decrease in the PAI-1 (SERPINE1) gene corepressor Rev-Erb\u03b1 increased PAI-1, which then increased the tPA gene PLAT via a PAI-1/LRP1/PKA/p-CREB1 pathway. This pathway was partially counterbalanced by increased DACH1, a PLAT-negative regulator. We focused on the PAI-1/PLAT pathway, which mitigates the reduction in fibrinolysis in obesity. Thus, silencing hepatocyte PAI-1, CREB1, or tPA in obese mice lowered plasma tPA and further impaired fibrinolysis. The PAI-1/PLAT pathway was present in primary human hepatocytes, and associations among PAI-1, tPA, and PLAT in livers from obese and lean humans were consistent with these findings.

PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation on two lysine residues (K268 and K293) induces brown remodeling of white adipose tissue and uncouples the adverse effects of TZDs from insulin sensitization.

We generated mice homozygous with mice with deacetylation-mimetic PPAR\u03b3 mutations K268R/K293R (2KR) on an LDL-receptor knockout (Ldlr -/- ) background. 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice showed smaller atherosclerotic lesion areas than Ldlr -/- mice, particularly in aortic arches. With rosiglitazone treatment, 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice demonstrated a residual antiatherogenic response and substantial protection against bone loss and fluid retention. The antiatherosclerotic effect of 2KR was attributed to the protection of endothelium, indicated by improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and repressed expression of proatherogenic factors including inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6, and NADPH oxidase 2.

The recent discovery that the metabolite cargo of dead and dying cells ingested through efferocytosis by macrophages can alter metabolic pathways and downstream function of the efferocyte is markedly changing the way we think about macrophage immunometabolism. Metabolic transitions of macrophages contribute to their functions in all stages of atherosclerosis, from lesion initiation to formation of advanced lesions characterized by necrotic cores, to lesion regression following aggressive lipid lowering.

Two molecules that are elevated in hepatocytes in human NASH liver are cholesterol, whose mechanistic link to NASH remains incompletely understood, and TAZ, a transcriptional regulator that promotes fibrosis but whose mechanism of increase in NASH is unknown. We now show that increased hepatocyte\u00a0cholesterol upregulates TAZ and promotes fibrotic NASH. ASTER-B/C-mediated internalization of plasma membrane cholesterol activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC; ADCY10), triggering a calcium-RhoA-mediated pathway that suppresses \u03b2-TrCP/proteasome-mediated TAZ degradation.

We explore the role and regulation of hepatocyte-derived tPA as a source of basal plasma tPA activity and as a contributor to fibrinolysis after vascular injury. We show that hepatocyte tPA is downregulated by a pathway in which the corepressor DACH1 represses ATF6, which is an inducer of the tPA gene Plat Hepatocyte-DACH1-knockout mice show increases in liver Plat, circulating tPA, fibrinolytic activity, bleeding time, and time to thrombosis, which are reversed by silencing hepatocyte Plat Conversely, hepatocyte-ATF6-knockout mice show decreases in these parameters.

Hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function mouse models showed attenuated NASH-associated liver fibrosis, demonstrating causality to obesity-induced liver pathology. Conversely, forced activation of hepatocyte Notch induced fibrosis in both chow- and NASH diet-fed mice by increasing Sox9-dependent Osteopontin (Opn) expression and secretion from hepatocytes, which activate resident hepatic stellate cells. In a cross-sectional study, we found that OPN explains the positive correlation between liver Notch activity and fibrosis stage in patients.

We sought to determine whether these processes might be linked through Treg-cell-mediated enhancement of efferocytosis. In zymosan-induced peritonitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced\u00a0lung injury, Treg cells increased early in resolution, and Treg cell depletion decreased efferocytosis. In advanced atherosclerosis, where defective efferocytosis drives disease progression, Treg cell expansion improved efferocytosis.

In summary, Treg cells promote macrophage efferocytosis during inflammation resolution via a transcellular signaling pathway that enhances apoptotic cell internalization.

Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes resolution, inhibition of ERK activation delayed resolution, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX-derived SPM biosynthesis and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation resolution in settings where defective resolution promotes disease progression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase", "Calcium", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Cytoplasm", "Cytosol", "Enzyme Activation", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Inflammation Mediators", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Jurkat Cells", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Monocytes", "Neutrophils", "Peritonitis", "Phosphorylation", "Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases", "Signal Transduction", "c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bishuang", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Pathology and Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. bc2586@columbia.edu iat1@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Canan", "Last Name": "Kasikara", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Pathology and Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amanda C", "Last Name": "Doran", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Pathology and Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajasekhar", "Last Name": "Ramakrishnan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raymond B", "Last Name": "Birge", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Rutgers University, New Jersey Medical School Cancer Center, Newark, NJ 07103, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Pathology and Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. bc2586@columbia.edu iat1@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Science signaling", "PubDate": "2018Sep25"}, {"PMID": "30135135", "Title": "A New Activator of Hepatocyte CaMKII in Fasting and Type 2 Diabetes.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Fasting", "Hepatocytes", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lale", "Last Name": "Ozcan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY iat1@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2018Sep"}, {"PMID": "30108191", "Title": "The role of non-resolving inflammation in atherosclerosis.", "Abstract": "Non-resolving inflammation drives the development of clinically dangerous atherosclerotic lesions by promoting sustained plaque inflammation, large necrotic cores, thin fibrous caps, and thrombosis.

To overcome these obstacles, we studied human immune system-reconstituted mice (hu-mice) rendered hypercholesterolemic by treatment with adeno-associated virus 8-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (AAV8-PCSK9) and a high-fat/high-cholesterol Western-type diet (WD).

However, processes that promote pathological adipose tissue inflammation in obesity are incompletely understood. Here we show that obesity in mice stimulates hepatocytes to synthesize and secrete dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which acts with plasma factor Xa to inflame ATMs. Silencing expression of DPP4 in hepatocytes suppresses inflammation of VAT and insulin resistance; however, a similar effect is not seen with the orally administered DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin. Inflammation and insulin resistance are also suppressed by silencing expression of caveolin-1 or PAR2 in ATMs; these proteins mediate the actions of DPP4 and factor Xa, respectively.

Most importantly, silencing of hepatocyte TAZ in murine models of NASH prevented or reversed hepatic inflammation, hepatocyte death, and fibrosis, but not steatosis. Moreover, hepatocyte-targeted expression of TAZ in a model of steatosis promoted NASH features, including fibrosis. In\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo mechanistic studies revealed that a key mechanism linking hepatocyte TAZ to NASH fibrosis is TAZ/TEA domain (TEAD)-mediated induction of Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a secretory factor that activates fibrogenic genes in hepatic stellate cells.

A key cause of plaque necrosis is defective clearance of apoptotic cells, or efferocytosis, by lesional macrophages, but the mechanisms underlying defective efferocytosis and its possible links to impaired resolution in atherosclerosis are incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that proteolytic cleavage of the macrophage efferocytosis receptor c-Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) reduces efferocytosis and promotes plaque necrosis and defective resolution. In human carotid plaques, MerTK cleavage correlated with plaque necrosis and the presence of ischemic symptoms. Moreover, in fat-fed LDL receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice whose myeloid cells expressed a cleavage-resistant variant of MerTK, atherosclerotic lesions exhibited higher macrophage MerTK, lower levels of the cleavage product soluble Mer, improved efferocytosis, smaller necrotic cores, thicker fibrous caps, and increased ratio of proresolving versus proinflammatory lipid mediators.

These inflammatory cells, together with proliferating smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix, promote the formation of subendothelial lesions or plaques. In the vast majority of cases, these lesions do not cause serious clinical symptoms, which is due in part to a resolution-repair response that limits tissue damage. However, a deadly minority of lesions progress to the point where they can trigger acute lumenal thrombosis, which may then cause unstable angina, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or stroke. Many of these clinically dangerous lesions have hallmarks of defective inflammation resolution, including defective clearance of dead cells (efferocytosis), necrosis, a defective scar response, and decreased levels of lipid mediators of the resolution response. Efferocytosis is both an effector arm of the resolution response and an inducer of resolution mediators, and thus its defect in advanced atherosclerosis amplifies plaque progression.

Whereas MerTK deficiency promotes defective efferocytosis, inflammation, and plaque necrosis in advanced murine atherosclerosis, the role of Axl in advanced atherosclerosis progression is not known. Towards this end, bone marrow cells from Axl-/- or wild-type mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated Ldlr-/- mice. These chimeric mice were then fed the Western-type diet (WD) for 17 weeks. We demonstrate that lesional macrophages in WT mice express Axl but that Axl deficiency in bone marrow-derived cells does not affect lesion size, cellularity, necrosis, or inflammatory parameters in advanced atherosclerotic plaques.

Elucidating how CaMKII suppresses ATF6 is therefore essential to understanding this insulin resistance pathway. We show that CaMKII phosphorylates and blocks nuclear translocation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). As a result, HDAC4-mediated SUMOylation of the corepressor DACH1 is decreased, which protects DACH1 from proteasomal degradation. DACH1, together with nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR), represses Atf6 transcription, leading to activation of the PERK-TRB3 pathway and defective insulin signaling. DACH1 is increased in the livers of obese mice and humans, and treatment of obese mice with liver-targeted constitutively nuclear HDAC4 or DACH1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) increases ATF6, improves hepatocyte insulin signaling, and protects against hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.

Resolution is mediated in part by long-chain fatty acid-derived lipid mediators called specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). However, how SPMs are regulated during the inflammatory response, and how this process goes awry in inflammatory diseases, are poorly understood. We now show that signaling through the Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) receptor in cultured macrophages and in sterile inflammation in vivo promotes SPM biosynthesis by a mechanism involving an increase in the cytoplasmic:nuclear ratio of a key SPM biosynthetic enzyme, 5-lipoxygenase. This action of MerTK is linked to the resolution of sterile peritonitis and, after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, to increased circulating SPMs and decreased remote organ inflammation. MerTK is susceptible to ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)-mediated cell-surface cleavage under inflammatory conditions, but the functional significance is not known. We show here that SPM biosynthesis is increased and inflammation resolution is improved in a new mouse model in which endogenous MerTK was replaced with a genetically engineered variant that is cleavage-resistant (Mertk(CR)). Mertk(CR) mice also have increased circulating levels of SPMs and less lung injury after I/R. Thus, MerTK cleavage during inflammation limits SPM biosynthesis and the resolution response.

However, inflammation is not effectively resolved in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and can lead to tissue damage and exacerbation of the underlying condition. Therapeutics that dampen inflammation and enhance resolution are currently of considerable interest, in particular those that temper inflammation with minimal host collateral damage. Here we present the development and efficacy investigations of controlled-release polymeric nanoparticles incorporating the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) for targeted delivery to atherosclerotic plaques. Nanoparticles were nanoengineered via self-assembly of biodegradable polyester polymers by nanoprecipitation using a rapid micromixer chip capable of producing nanoparticles with retained IL-10 bioactivity post-exposure to organic solvent. A systematic combinatorial approach was taken to screen nanoparticles, resulting in an optimal bioactive formulation from in vitro and ex vivo studies. The most potent nanoparticle termed Col-IV IL-10 NP22 significantly tempered acute inflammation in a self-limited peritonitis model and was shown to be more potent than native IL-10. Furthermore, the Col-IV IL-10 nanoparticles prevented vulnerable plaque formation by increasing fibrous cap thickness and decreasing necrotic cores in advanced lesions of high fat-fed LDLr(-/-) mice. These results demonstrate the efficacy and pro-resolving potential of this engineered nanoparticle for controlled delivery of the potent IL-10 cytokine for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

Lesional macrophages are derived primarily from blood monocytes, although recent research has shown that lesional macrophage-like cells can also be derived from smooth muscle cells. Lesional macrophages take on different phenotypes depending on their environment and which intracellular signaling pathways are activated. Rather than a few distinct populations of macrophages, the phenotype of the lesional macrophage is more complex and likely changes during the different phases of atherosclerosis and with the extent of lipid and cholesterol loading, activation by a plethora of receptors, and metabolic state of the cells. These different phenotypes allow the macrophage to engulf lipids, dead cells, and other substances perceived as danger signals; efflux cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein; proliferate and migrate; undergo apoptosis and death; and secrete a large number of inflammatory and proresolving molecules.

We recently discovered that obesity activates a previously unknown pathway that promotes both excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) and defective insulin signaling in hepatocytes, leading to exacerbation of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obesity. At the hub of this new pathway is a kinase cascade involving calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), p38\u03b1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPKAPK2/3 (MK2/3). Genetic-based inhibition of these kinases improves metabolism in obese mice. Here, we report that treatment of obese insulin-resistant mice with an allosteric MK2/3 inhibitor, compound (cmpd) 28, ameliorates glucose homeostasis by suppressing excessive HGP and enhancing insulin signaling. The metabolic improvement seen with cmpd 28 is additive with the leading T2D drug, metformin, but it is not additive with dominant-negative MK2, suggesting an on-target mechanism of action. Allosteric MK2/3 inhibitors represent a potentially new approach to T2D that is highly mechanism based, has links to human T2D, and is predicted to avoid certain adverse effects seen with current T2D drugs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Glucose", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Insulin Resistance", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Obese", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lale", "Last Name": "Ozcan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY lo2192@columbia.edu iat1@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoming", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Shi-Xian", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Devram S", "Last Name": "Ghorpade", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Cremers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Hubbard", "Affiliation": "Tabomedex Biosciences, Boxford, MA."}, {"First Name": "Michael H", "Last Name": "Serrano-Wu", "Affiliation": "Tabomedex Biosciences, Boxford, MA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Gaestel", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Donald W", "Last Name": "Landry", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY lo2192@columbia.edu iat1@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "25872946", "Title": "C/EBP-Homologous Protein (CHOP) in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Regulates Their Proliferation in Aortic Explants and Atherosclerotic Lesions.", "Abstract": "Myeloid-derived C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), an effector of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced unfolded protein response, promotes macrophage apoptosis in advanced atherosclerosis, but the role of CHOP in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerosis is not known.", "Keywords": ["activating transcription factor 4", "atherosclerosis", "transcription factor CHOP", "unfolded protein response", "vascular smooth muscle cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Animals", "Aorta", "Apolipoproteins E", "Atherosclerosis", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Fibroblasts", "Immunoblotting", "Kruppel-Like Factor 4", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Microfilament Proteins", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "RNA Interference", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Tissue Culture Techniques", "Transcription Factor CHOP"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alex-Xianghua", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "From the Departments of Medicine (A.-X.Z., X.W., M.J.N., I.T.), Pathology and Cell Biology (C.S.L., I.T.), and Physiology and Cellular Biophysics (I.T.), Columbia University, New York, NY;

When administered to mice with preexisting lesions, Col IV-Ac2-26 NPs were targeted to lesions and led to a marked improvement in key advanced plaque properties, including an increase in the protective collagen layer overlying lesions (which was associated with a decrease in lesional collagenase activity), suppression of oxidative stress, and a decrease in plaque necrosis. In mice lacking FPR2/ALX in myeloid cells, these improvements were not seen.

The balance of arachidonic acid-derived mediators in leukocytes is thought to be achieved through intracellular localization of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX): nuclear 5-LOX favors the biosynthesis of proinflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB4), whereas, in theory, cytoplasmic 5-LOX could favor the biosynthesis of proresolving lipoxin A4 (LXA4). This balance is shifted in favor of LXA4 by resolvin D1 (RvD1), a specialized proresolving mediator derived from docosahexaenoic acid, but the mechanism is not known. Here we report a new pathway through which RvD1 promotes nuclear exclusion of 5-LOX and thereby suppresses LTB4 and enhances LXA4 in macrophages. RvD1, by activating its receptor formyl peptide receptor2/lipoxin A4 receptor, suppresses cytosolic calcium and decreases activation of the calcium-sensitive kinase calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII inhibition suppresses activation P38 and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 kinases, which reduces Ser271 phosphorylation of 5-LOX and shifts 5-LOX from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. As such, RvD1's ability to decrease nuclear 5-LOX and the LTB4:LXA4 ratio in vitro and in vivo was mimicked by macrophages lacking CaMKII or expressing S271A-5-LOX. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how a specialized proresolving mediator from the docosahexaenoic acid pathway shifts the balance toward resolution in the arachidonic acid pathway.

As a protective response to restore ER homeostasis, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated by three major ER sensors: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The activation of the various UPR signaling pathways displays a temporal pattern of activation at different stages of the disease. The ATF6 and IRE1\u03b1 pathways that promote the expression of protein chaperones in ER are activated in ECs in athero-susceptible regions of pre-lesional arteries and before the appearance of foam cells. The PERK pathway that reduces ER protein client load by blocking protein translation is activated in SMCs and macrophages in early lesions. The activation of these UPR signaling pathways aims to cope with the ER stress and plays a pro-survival role in the early stage of atherosclerosis. However, with the progression of atherosclerosis, the extended duration and increased intensity of ER stress in lesions lead to prolonged and enhanced UPR signaling. Under this circumstance, the PERK pathway induces expression of death effectors, and possibly IRE1\u03b1 activates apoptosis signaling pathways, leading to apoptosis of macrophages and SMCs in advanced lesions. Importantly, UPR-mediated cell death is associated with plaque instability and the clinical progression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, UPR signaling is linked to inflammation and possibly to macrophage differentiation in lesions.

Collectively, these data suggest that hyperlipidemia resulting in endogenous activation of the TRIF signaling pathway from TLR4 leads to pro-atherogenic events.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport", "Animals", "Aorta", "Atherosclerosis", "Coronary Vessels", "Cytokines", "Diet, Atherogenic", "Hyperlipidemias", "Lipoproteins, LDL", "Macrophages, Peritoneal", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Mutation", "Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 3"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "M Rachel", "Last Name": "Richards", "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology and Microbial Science, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audrey S", "Last Name": "Black", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Bonnet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Grant D", "Last Name": "Barish", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Connie W", "Last Name": "Woo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Linda K", "Last Name": "Curtiss", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter S", "Last Name": "Tobias", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Innate immunity", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
