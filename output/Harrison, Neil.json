However, the primary focus of this work has been motor symptoms, with little focus on the non-motor aspects of the disease. To address this, we combined longitudinal clinical non-motor assessment data and digital multi-sensor data from the Verily Study Watch for 149 participants from the Parkinson's Progression Monitoring Initiative (PPMI) cohort with a diagnosis of PD. We show that digitally collected physical activity and sleep measures significantly relate to clinical non-motor assessments of cognitive, autonomic, and daily living impairment. However, the poor predictive performance we observed, highlights the need for better targeted digital outcome measures to enable monitoring of non-motor symptoms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ann-Kathrin", "Last Name": "Schalkamp", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Neuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute, Cardiff, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn J", "Last Name": "Peall", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Neuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute, Cardiff, United Kingdom.

In a behavioural experiment, observers completed a temporal-order judgement (TOJ), simultaneity judgement (SJ) and simple reaction-time (RT) task and responded to audio-visual trials that were preceded by other audio-visual trials with either a bright or dim visual stimulus. It was found that the point of subjective simultaneity shifted, due to the visual intensity of the preceding stimulus, in the TOJ, but not SJ task, while the RT data revealed no effect of preceding intensity. Our data therefore provide some evidence that the perception of simultaneity rapidly recalibrates based on stimulus intensity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Visual Perception", "Auditory Perception", "Male", "Female", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Adult", "Acoustic Stimulation", "Young Adult", "Judgment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Horsfall", "Affiliation": "Institute of Population Health, 4591University of Liverpool, Waterhouse Building, Block B, Brownlow Street, Liverpool, L69 3GF, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, 4588Liverpool Hope University, Liverpool, L16 9JD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Institute of Population Health, 4591University of Liverpool, Waterhouse Building, Block B, Brownlow Street, Liverpool, L69 3GF, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sophie", "Last Name": "Wuerger", "Affiliation": "Institute of Population Health, 4591University of Liverpool, Waterhouse Building, Block B, Brownlow Street, Liverpool, L69 3GF, UK."}], "Journal": "Multisensory research", "PubDate": "2024Apr30"}, {"PMID": "38649377", "Title": "Common risk alleles for schizophrenia within the major histocompatibility complex predict white matter microstructure.", "Abstract": "Recent research has highlighted the role of complement genes in shaping the microstructure of the brain during early development, and in contributing to common allele risk for Schizophrenia.

Here, we investigate the interplay between sex hormones and CRP in the cross-sectional, observational Biomarkers in Depression Study. We measured serum high-sensitivity (hs-)CRP, in 64 healthy controls and 178 MDD patients, subdivided into those with hs-CRP below 3\u00a0mg/L (low-CRP; 53 males, 72 females) and with hs-CRP above 3\u00a0mg/L (high-CRP; 19 males, 34 females). We also measured interleukin-6, testosterone, 17-\u03b2-estradiol (E2), progesterone, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle-stimulating and luteinising hormones, and calculated testosterone-to-E2 ratio (T/E2), free androgen and estradiol indexes (FAI, FEI), and testosterone secretion index.

Stronger interactions in metals with nearly localized f-electron degrees of freedom increase the likelihood of these unconventional states. However, access to the quantum limit is typically impeded by the tendency of f-electrons to polarize in a strong magnetic field, consequently weakening the interactions. In this study, we propose that the quantum limit in such systems must be approached in reverse, starting from an insulating state at zero magnetic field. In this scenario, Landau levels fill in the reverse order compared to regular metals and are closely linked to a field-induced insulator-to-metal transition.

Using diffusion-weighted MRI from \u223c30,000 UK Biobank participants, we test the hypothesis that obesity (waist-to-hip ratio, WHR) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein (CRP), we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9\u00d710-4) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF (P<0.05).

However, the immune-related modifications associated with MDD may be not entirely captured by CRP alone. Analysing mRNA gene expression levels, we aimed to identify broader molecular immune-related phenotypes of MDD. We examined 168 individuals from the non-interventional, case-control, BIODEP study, 128 with a diagnosis of MDD and 40 healthy controls. Individuals with MDD were further divided according to serum high-sensitivity (hs)CRP levels (n\u2009=\u200959 with CRP <1, n\u2009=\u200933 with CRP 1-3 and n\u2009=\u200936 with CRP >3\u2009mg/L).

Nine of the 16 candidate genes were differentially expressed in MDD cases vs. controls, with no differences between CRP-based groups. Only CRP mRNA was clearly associated with serum CRP. In contrast, plasma (proteins) IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-16, IL-17A, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and neutrophils counts, were all differentially regulated between CRP-based groups (higher in CRP >3 vs. CRP <1 and/or controls), reflecting the gradient of CRP values. Secondary analyses on MDD individuals and controls with CRP values <1\u2009mg/L (usually interpreted as 'no inflammation') confirmed MDD cases still had significantly different mRNA expression of immune-related genes compared with controls. These findings corroborate an immune-related molecular activation in MDD, which appears to be independent of serum CRP levels.

A fundamental aspect of facilitating simulation is creating a safe educational environment. Edmondson's seminal work on creating psychological safety among interpersonal teams has been embraced by the healthcare simulation community. Psychological safety is an underpinning philosophy for creating simulation experiences in which learners can develop within a stimulating and challenging yet supportive social atmosphere. Through careful design and thoughtful delivery, the introductory phase of simulation, the pre-briefing, can effectively prepare learners for simulation, reduce learner anxiety, and promote psychological safety, to enhance learning experiences.

When sustained, this can precipitate major depressive episodes. In humans, this has been linked to opposing actions of inflammation on striatal/insula reward/punishment learning signals while in rodents, motivational impairments can be attenuated with minocycline, implicating a mechanistic role for microglia. Here we investigated whether minocycline also inhibits the reorienting effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on reward/punishment sensitivity in humans. Methods Using a crossover design, fifteen healthy volunteers underwent two experimental sessions in which they each received LPS (1\u00a0ng/kg) and placebo. Half (N\u00a0=\u00a08) received minocycline (100\u00a0mg bd) and half (N\u00a0=\u00a07) an identical looking placebo for 3\u00bd days before each session. Six hours post-injection participants completed a probabilistic instrumental learning task in which they had to learn to select high probability reward (win \u00a31) and avoid high probability punishment (lose \u00a31) stimuli to maximise their gains and minimize losses. Physiological and sickness responses were sampled hourly and blood sampled at baseline, 3 and 6\u00a0h post-injection.

Rodent studies have demonstrated a marked increase in glymphatic clearance during sleep which has been linked to a sleep-induced expansion of the extracellular space and concomitant reduction in intracellular volume. However, despite being implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple human neurodegenerative disorders, non-invasive techniques for imaging glymphatic clearance in humans are currently limited. Here we acquired multi-shell diffusion weighted MRI (dwMRI) in twenty-one healthy young participants (6 female, 22.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2 years) each scanned twice, once during wakefulness and once during sleep induced by a combination of one night of sleep deprivation and 10\u00a0mg of the hypnotic zolpidem 30\u00a0min before scanning. To capture hypothesised sleep-associated changes in intra/extracellular space, dwMRI were analysed using higher order diffusion modelling with the prediction that sleep-associated increases in interstitial (extracellular) fluid volume would result in a decrease in diffusion kurtosis, particularly in areas associated with slow wave generation at the onset of sleep. In line with our hypothesis, we observed a global reduction in diffusion kurtosis (t15=2.82, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) during sleep as well as regional reductions in brain areas associated with slow wave generation during early sleep and default mode network areas that are highly metabolically active during wakefulness. Analysis with a higher-order representation of diffusion (MAP-MRI) further indicated that changes within the intra/extracellular domain rather than membrane permeability likely underpin the observed sleep-associated decrease in kurtosis. These findings identify higher-order modelling of dwMRI as a potential new non-invasive method for imaging glymphatic clearance and extend rodent findings to suggest that sleep is also associated with an increase in interstitial fluid volume in humans.", "Keywords": ["Diffusion Kurtosis", "Diffusion MRI", "Glymphatic system", "Sleep"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Female", "Brain", "Glymphatic System", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Sleep", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bal\u00e1zs", "Last Name": "\u00d6rzsik", "Affiliation": "Radiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands; CISC, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, United Kingdom.

A DMD mouse model also displays a neuropsychiatric phenotype, including increased startle responses to threat which normalise when dystrophin is restored in the brain. We hypothesised that startle responses may also be increased in humans with DMD, which would have potential translational therapeutic implications. To investigate this, we first designed a novel discrimination fear-conditioning task and tested it in six healthy volunteers, followed by male DMD (n = 11) and Control (n = 9) participants aged 7-12 years. The aims of this methodological task development study were to: i) confirm the task efficacy; ii) optimise data processing procedures; iii) determine the most appropriate outcome measures. In the task, two neutral visual stimuli were presented: one 'safe' cue presented alone; one 'threat' cue paired with a threat stimulus (aversive noise) to enable conditioning of physiological startle responses (skin conductance response, SCR, and heart rate). Outcomes were the unconditioned physiological startle responses to the initial threat, and retention of conditioned responses in the absence of the threat stimulus. We present the protocol development and optimisation of data processing methods based on empirical data. We found that the task was effective in producing significantly higher physiological startle SCR in reinforced 'threat' trials compared to 'safe' trials (P < .001).

In contrast to muscle, in which a single full-length dystrophin isoform (Dp427) is produced, multiple isoforms are produced in the brain, and their deficiency accounts for the variability of CNS manifestations, with increased risk of comorbidities in patients carrying mutations affecting the 3' end of the gene, which disrupt expression of shorter Dp140 and Dp71 isoforms. A mouse model (mdx mouse) lacks Dp427 in muscle and CNS and exhibits exaggerated startle responses to threat, linked to the deficiency of dystrophin in limbic structures such as the amygdala, which normalize with postnatal brain dystrophin-restoration therapies. A pathological startle response is not a recognized feature of DMD, and its characterization has implications for improved clinical management and translational research. To investigate startle responses in DMD, we used a novel fear-conditioning task in an observational study of 56 males aged 7-12 years (31 affected boys, mean age 9.7 \u00b1 1.8 years; 25 controls, mean age 9.6 \u00b1 1.4 years). Trials of two neutral visual stimuli were presented to participants: one 'safe' cue presented alone; one 'threat' cue paired with an aversive noise to enable conditioning of physiological startle responses (skin conductance response and heart rate). Retention of conditioned physiological responses was subsequently tested by presenting both cues without the aversive noise in an 'Extinction' phase. Primary outcomes were the initial unconditioned skin conductance and change in heart rate responses to the aversive 'threat' and acquisition and retention of conditioned responses after conditioning. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were neuropsychological measures and genotype associations. The mean unconditioned skin conductance response was greater in the DMD group than controls [mean difference 3.0 \u00b5S (1.0, 5.1); P = 0.004], associated with a significant threat-induced bradycardia only in the patient group [mean difference -8.7 bpm (-16.9, -0.51); P = 0.04]. Participants with DMD found the task more aversive than controls, with increased early termination rates during the Extinction phase (26% of DMD group versus 0% of controls; P = 0.007). This study provides the first evidence that boys with DMD show similar increased unconditioned startle responses to threat to the mdx mouse, which in the mouse respond to brain dystrophin restoration. Our study provides new insights into the neurobiology underlying the complex neuropsychiatric co-morbidities in DMD and defines an objective measure of this CNS phenotype, which will be valuable for future CNS-targeted dystrophin-restoration studies.", "Keywords": ["Duchenne muscular dystrophy", "anxiety", "brain", "dystrophin", "fear conditioning"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Mice", "Animals", "Dystrophin", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Reflex, Startle", "Mice, Inbred mdx", "Brain", "Biomarkers", "Protein Isoforms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kate", "Last Name": "Maresh", "Affiliation": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London WC1N 1EH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andriani", "Last Name": "Papageorgiou", "Affiliation": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London WC1N 1EH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Ridout", "Affiliation": "Population, Policy and Practice Research and Teaching Department, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London WC1N 1EH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Mandy", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Skuse", "Affiliation": "Department of Behavioural and Brain Sciences, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London WC1N 1EH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Muntoni", "Affiliation": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London WC1N 1EH, UK."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2023Jan05"}, {"PMID": "34986186", "Title": "Effect of the subjective intensity of fatigue and interoception on perceptual regulation and performance during sustained physical activity.", "Abstract": "The subjective experience of fatigue impairs an individual's ability to sustain physical endurance performance.

Using rotational thombelastometry we found that almost all patients with severe COVID-19 had signs of hypercoagulability compared with non-COVID-19 controls. Specifically, the maximal clot firmness in the fibrin-based extrinsically activated test was almost twice the upper limit of normal in COVID patients, indicating a fibrin-mediated cause for hypercoagulability. To better understand the mechanism of this hypercoagulability we measured the components of the fibrinolytic pathways. Fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, but not plasminogen levels were elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. Our studies indicate that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 may be because of decreased fibrinolysis resulting from inhibition of plasmin through high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.

These interactions play important roles in health from supporting neural development, homeostasis and plasticity to modifying behaviour. Neuroimmunology is increasingly recognised as a field with the potential to deliver a significant positive impact on human health and treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Yet, translation to the clinic is hindered by fundamental knowledge gaps on the underlying mechanisms of action or the optimal timing of an intervention, and a lack of appropriate tools to visualise and modulate both systems. Here we propose ten key disease-agnostic research questions that, if addressed, could lead to significant progress within neuroimmunology in the short to medium term. We also discuss four cross-cutting themes to be considered when addressing each question: i) bi-directionality of neuroimmune interactions; ii) the biological context in which the questions are addressed (e.g. health vs disease vs across the lifespan); iii) tools and technologies required to fully answer the questions; and iv) translation into the clinic. We acknowledge that these ten questions cannot represent the full breadth of gaps in our understanding; rather they focus on areas which, if addressed, may have the most broad and immediate impacts.

Peripheral blood measures of cytokines and chemokines constitute the bulk of evidence, with consistent meta-analytic data implicating raised proinflammatory cytokines such as IL6, IL1\u03b2 and TNF. Among the potential mechanisms linking immunobiological changes to affective neurobiology is the accelerated biological ageing seen in MDD, particularly via the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, the cellular source of immunobiological markers remains unclear. Pre-clinical evidence suggests a role for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), thus here we aimed to explore the transcriptomic profile using RNA sequencing in PBMCs in a clinical sample of people with various levels of depression and treatment response comparing it with that in healthy controls (HCs). There were three groups with major depressive disorder (MDD): treatment-resistant (n\u2009=\u200994), treatment-responsive (n\u2009=\u200947) and untreated (n\u2009=\u200946). Healthy controls numbered 44. Using PBMCs gene expression analysis was conducted using RNAseq to a depth of 54.5 million reads. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. The data showed no robust signal differentiating MDD and HCs. There was, however, significant evidence of elevated biological ageing in MDD vs HC. Biological ageing was evident in these data as a transcriptional signature of 888 age-associated genes (adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.05, absolute log2fold\u2009>\u20090.6) that also correlated strongly with chronological age (spearman correlation coefficient of 0.72). Future work should expand clinical sample sizes and reduce clinical heterogeneity. Exploration of RNA-seq signatures in other leukocyte populations and single cell RNA sequencing may help uncover more subtle differences. However, currently the subtlety of any PBMC signature mitigates against its convincing use as a diagnostic or predictive biomarker.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Biomarkers", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Humans", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John J", "Last Name": "Cole", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "McColl", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mary-Ellen", "Last Name": "Lynall", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, UK and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Philip J", "Last Name": "Cowen", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, CB2 0SZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "de Boer", "Affiliation": "Janssen Research and Development, Experimental Medicine-Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Turnhoutseweg 30, 2340, Beerse, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Wayne C", "Last Name": "Drevets", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, San Diego, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre, Maindy Road, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Carmine", "Last Name": "Pariante", "Affiliation": "Stress, Psychiatry and Immunology Laboratory & Section of Perinatal Psychiatry, King's College, University of London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Pointon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, UK and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "NIMA consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carl", "Last Name": "Goodyear", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Bullmore", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, UK and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Cavanagh", "Affiliation": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.

Aberrant monoaminergic neurotransmission is increasingly considered a major contributor to fatigue pathophysiology. In this study, we aimed to compare the integrity of the monoaminergic white matter fibre tracts projecting from brainstem nuclei in a group of patients with MS (n\u00a0=\u00a068) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a034), and to investigate its association with fatigue. Fibre tracts integrity was assessed with the novel fixel-based analysis that simultaneously estimates axonal density, by means of 'fibre density', and white matter atrophy, by means of fibre 'cross section'. We focused on ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei as the main source of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotoninergic fibres within the brainstem, respectively. Fourteen tracts of interest projecting from these brainstem nuclei were reconstructed using diffusion tractography, and compared by means of the product of fibre-density and cross-section (FDC). Finally, correlations of monoaminergic axonal damage with the modified fatigue impact scale scores were evaluated in MS. Fixel-based analysis revealed significant axonal damage - as measured by FDC reduction - within selective monoaminergic fibre-tracts projecting from brainstem nuclei in MS patients, in comparison to healthy controls; particularly within the dopaminergic-mesolimbic pathway, the noradrenergic-projections to prefrontal cortex, and serotoninergic-projections to cerebellum. Moreover, we observed significant correlations between severity of cognitive fatigue and axonal damage within the mesocorticolimbic tracts projecting from ventral tegmental area, as well as within the locus coeruleus projections to prefrontal cortex, suggesting a potential contribution of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways to central fatigue in MS. Our findings support the hypothesis that axonal damage along monoaminergic pathways contributes to the reduction/dysfunction of monoamines in MS and add new information on the mechanisms by which monoaminergic systems contribute to MS pathogenesis and fatigue. This supports the need for further research into monoamines as therapeutic targets aiming to combat and alleviate fatigue in MS.", "Keywords": ["Fatigue", "Fixel-based analysis", "Monoaminergic system", "Multiple sclerosis", "Tractography"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Stem", "Cognition", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiziana", "Last Name": "Carandini", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, UK; Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.

Methylphenidate, a commonly prescribed drug in ADHD, improves attention but has mixed reports on risk-based decision making. Using a double-blinded placebo protocol, we studied the risk attitudes of ADHD patients and age-matched healthy volunteers while performing the 2-step sequential learning task and examined the effect of methylphenidate on their choices. We then applied a novel computational analysis using the hierarchical drift-diffusion model to extract parameters such as threshold ('a'-amount of evidence accumulated before making a decision), drift rate ('v'-information processing speed) and response bias ('z' apriori bias towards a specific choice) focusing specifically on risky choice preference. Critically, we show that ADHD patients on placebo have an apriori bias towards risky choices compared to controls. Furthermore, methylphenidate enhanced preference towards risky choices (higher apriori bias) in both groups but had a significantly greater effect in the patient population independent of clinical scores.

The inferior frontal gyrus is implicated in motor control, including inhibition of pre-potent actions through influences on downstream subcortical and motor regions. Although tic suppression in Tourette syndrome also engages the inferior frontal gyrus, it is unclear whether such prefrontal control of action is also dysfunctional: Tic suppression studies do not permit comparison with control groups, and neuroimaging studies of motor inhibition can be confounded by the concurrent expression or suppression of tics. Here, patients with Tourette syndrome were directly compared to control participants when performing an intentional inhibition task during functional MRI. Tic expression was recorded throughout for removal from statistical models. Participants were instructed to make a button press in response to Go cues, withhold responses to NoGo cues, and decide whether to press or withhold to 'Choose' cues. Overall performance was similar between groups, for both intentional inhibition rates (% Choose-Go) and reactive NoGo inhibition commission errors. A subliminal face prime elicited no additional effects on intentional or reactive inhibition. Across participants, the task activated prefrontal and motor cortices and subcortical nuclei, including pre-supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, caudate nucleus, thalamus and primary motor cortex. In Tourette syndrome, activity was elevated in the inferior frontal gyrus, insula and basal ganglia, most notably within the right inferior frontal gyrus during voluntary action and inhibition (Choose-Go and Choose-NoGo), and reactive inhibition (NoGo-correct). Anatomically, the locus of this inferior frontal gyrus hyperactivation during control of voluntary action matched that previously reported for tic suppression. In Tourette syndrome, activity within the caudate nucleus was also enhanced during both intentional (Choose-NoGo) and reactive (NoGo-correct) inhibition. Strikingly, despite the absence of overt motor behaviour, primary motor cortex activity increased in patients with Tourette syndrome but decreased in controls during both reactive and intentional inhibition. Additionally, severity of premonitory sensations scaled with functional connectivity of the pre-supplementary motor area to the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus and thalamus when choosing to respond (Choose-Go). Together, these results suggest that patients with Tourette syndrome use equivalent prefrontal mechanisms to suppress tics and withhold non-tic actions, but require greater inferior frontal gyrus engagement than controls to overcome motor drive from hyperactive downstream regions, notably primary motor cortex. Moreover, premonitory sensations may cue midline motor regions to generate tics through interactions with the basal ganglia.", "Keywords": ["Tourette\u2019s syndrome", "basal ganglia", "movement disorders", "neuropsychiatry", "tic disorder"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Charlotte L", "Last Name": "Rae", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex, Sussex BN1 9QH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jim", "Last Name": "Parkinson", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex, Sussex BN1 9QH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sophie", "Last Name": "Betka", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Sussex BN1 9RY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Cassandra D", "Last Name": "Gouldvan Praag", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Sussex BN1 9RY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Samira", "Last Name": "Bouyagoub", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Sussex BN1 9RY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Liliana", "Last Name": "Polyanska", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Sussex BN1 9RY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dennis E O", "Last Name": "Larsson", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex, Sussex BN1 9QH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Sussex BN1 9RY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sarah N", "Last Name": "Garfinkel", "Affiliation": "Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex, Sussex, UK."}, {"First Name": "Hugo D", "Last Name": "Critchley", "Affiliation": "Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex, Sussex, UK."}], "Journal": "Brain communications", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33381761", "Title": "Differential Synaptic Dynamics and Circuit Connectivity of Hippocampal and Thalamic Inputs to the Prefrontal Cortex.", "Abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates inputs from multiple subcortical regions including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). How the mPFC differentially processes these inputs is not known. One possibility is that these two inputs target discreet populations of mPFC cells. Alternatively, individual prefrontal cells could receive convergent inputs but distinguish between both inputs based on synaptic differences, such as communication frequency. To address this, we utilized a dual wavelength optogenetic approach to stimulate MD and vHPC inputs onto single, genetically defined mPFC neuronal subtypes. Specifically, we compared the convergence and synaptic dynamics of both inputs onto mPFC pyramidal cells, and parvalbumin (PV)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. We found that all individual pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the mPFC receive convergent input from both MD and vHPC. In contrast, PV neurons receive input biased from the MD, while VIP cells receive input biased from the vHPC. Independent of the target, MD inputs transferred information more reliably at higher frequencies (20\u00a0Hz) than vHPC inputs. Thus, MD and vHPC projections converge functionally onto mPFC pyramidal cells, but both inputs are distinguished by frequency-dependent synaptic dynamics and preferential engagement of discreet interneuron populations.", "Keywords": ["interneurons", "mediodorsal thalamus", "optogenetics", "prefrontal cortex", "ventral hippocampus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Canetta", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Teboul", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Holt", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott S", "Last Name": "Bolkan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nancy", "Last Name": "Padilla-Coreano", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil L", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Kellendonk", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Cerebral cortex communications", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33362292", "Title": "Employment\u00a0and further study outcomes for care-experienced graduates in the UK.", "Abstract": "Life outcomes for people who spent time in the care of the state as children ('care-experienced') are known to be significantly lower, on average, than for the general population. The reasons for this are complex and multidimensional, relating to social upheaval, disrupted schooling, mental and physical health issues and societal stigmatisation. Previous studies across several countries have demonstrated that they are significantly less likely to participate in higher education and more likely to withdraw early. However, little is currently known about their outcomes after graduation. This paper therefore explores the initial outcomes for the 1,010 full-time students identified as care-experienced within the cohort graduating from an undergraduate degree programme in the UK in 2016/17-the most recent year for which data are available. They were found to be slightly more likely to be unemployed and less likely to be in work (and particularly professional work) than their peers, but, conversely, more likely to be studying. These differences largely disappeared once background educational and demographic factors were controlled. The paper discusses the relationship between care-experience and other sites of inequality, concluding that care-experienced graduates are crucially over-represented in groups that are disadvantaged in the graduate labour market-e.g. by ethnicity, disability or educational history. This intersectional inequality largely explains their lower graduate outcomes. While there are important limitations with the data available, this speaks for the transformational potential of higher education in enabling care-experienced graduates to transcend childhood adversity. Recommendations for national policy and local practices conclude the paper.", "Keywords": ["Care leavers", "Care-experienced students", "Graduate outcomes", "Inequality", "Widening access", "Widening participation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Rees Centre, Department of Education, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Zo\u00eb", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Centre for Development and Research in Education, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Stevenson", "Affiliation": "Lifelong Learning Centre, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK."}], "Journal": "Higher education", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "33164874", "Title": "Asymmetric effects of graspable distractor disks on motor preparation of successive grasps: A behavioural and event-related potential (ERP) study.", "Abstract": "There is evidence that seeing a graspable object automatically elicits a preparatory motor process. However, it is unclear whether this implicit visuomotor process might influence the preparation of a successive grasp for a different object. We addressed the issue by implementing a combined behavioural and electrophysiological paradigm. Participants performed pantomimed grasps directed to small or large disks with either a two (pincer) or a five-finger (pentapod) grip, after the presentation of congruent (same size) or incongruent (different size) distractor disks. Preview reaction times (PRTs) and response-locked lateralized readiness potentials (R-LRPs) were recorded as online indices of motor preparation. Results revealed asymmetric effects of the distractors on PRTs and R-LRPs. For pincer grip disks, incongruent distractors were associated with longer PRTs and a delayed R-LRP peak. For pentapod grip disks, conversely, incongruent distractors were associated with shorter PRTs and a delayed R-LRP onset. Supporting an interpretation of these effects as tapping into motor preparation, we did not observe modulations of stimulus-locked LRP's (sensitive to sensory processing), or of the P300 component (related to reallocating attentional resources).

Recently, HCN channels have been implicated in preclinical models of substance abuse including alcohol. In the prefrontal cortex of rodents, HCN expression and Ih magnitude are developmentally regulated during adolescence and may be vulnerable to alcohol's effects. In mice, binge alcohol consumption during the adolescent period results in a sustained reduction in Ih that coincides with increased alcohol consumption in adulthood, yet the direct role HCN channels have on alcohol consumption are unknown. Here, we show that the genetic deletion of Hcn1 causes an increase in alcohol preference on intermittent 2-bottle choice task in homozygous null (HCN1-/-) male mice compared to wild-type littermates without affecting saccharine or quinine preference. The targeted viral deletion of HCN1 in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex resulted in a gradual loss of Hcn1 expression and a reduction in Ih magnitude during adolescence, however, this did not significantly affect alcohol consumption or preference. We conclude that while HCN1 regulates alcohol preference, the genetic deletion of Hcn1 in the medial prefrontal cortex does not appear to be the locus for this effect.", "Keywords": ["Hcn1", "alcohol", "prefrontal cortex"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Salling", "Affiliation": "Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil L", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain sciences", "PubDate": "2020Oct22"}, {"PMID": "33077715", "Title": "Correction: Whole-blood expression of inflammasome- and glucocorticoid-related mRNAs correctly separates treatment-resistant depressed patients from drug-free and responsive patients in the BIODEP study.", "Abstract": "We have corrected this Article post-publication, because Dr. Cattaneo's affiliation details were originally incorrect (she was affiliated with three institutions but is in fact only linked to one: Biological Psychiatry Unit, IRCCS Istituto Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli, Brescia).

Minocycline, a centrally-penetrant tetracycline antibiotic, inhibits microglial activation and enhances long-term potentiation, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in rodents, leading to clinical trials in human neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects of minocycline on human memory have not previously been investigated. Utilising a double-blind, randomised crossover study design, we recruited 20 healthy male participants (mean 24.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0 years) who were each tested in two experimental sessions: once after 3 days of Minocycline 150\u2009mg (twice daily), and once 3 days of placebo (identical administration). During each session, all completed an fMRI task designed to tap boundary- and landmark-based navigation (thought to rely on hippocampal and striatal learning mechanisms respectively). Given the rodent literature, we hypothesised that minocycline would selectively modulate hippocampal learning. In line with this, minocycline biased use of boundary- compared to landmark-based information (t980\u2009=\u20093.140, p\u2009=\u20090.002). However, though this marginally improved performance for boundary-based objects (t980\u2009=\u20091.972, p\u2009=\u20090.049), it was outweighed by impaired landmark-based navigation (t980\u2009=\u20096.374, p\u2009<\u20090.001) resulting in an overall performance decrease (t980\u2009=\u20093.295, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Furthermore, against expectations, minocycline significantly reduced activity during memory encoding in the right caudate (t977\u2009=\u20092.992, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and five other cortical regions, with no significant effect in the hippocampus. In summary, minocycline impaired human spatial memory performance, likely through disruption of striatal processing resulting in greater biasing towards reliance on boundary-based navigation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Minocycline", "Neurogenesis", "Spatial Memory"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sam C", "Last Name": "Berens", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex, Falmer, BN1 9QH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Chris M", "Last Name": "Bird", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex, Falmer, BN1 9QH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre, Cardiff University, Cardiff, CF24 4HQ, UK.

Participants (n = 20) reached for, and transported, a jar under three conditions: a control condition and two self-talk conditions aimed at eliciting either task-unrelated verbal processing or task-related conscious control, while EEG and hand kinematics were recorded. Compared to the control condition, both self-talk conditions increased self-reported verbal processing, but only the task-related self-talk condition increased left-temporal activity (i.e., alpha power decreased). However, as cortical activity increased across the entire scalp topography, conscious control likely elicits a multitude of processes that may not be explained by left-temporal activity or verbal processing alone, but by a widespread decrease in neural efficiency. No significant effects for T7-Fz connectivity were detected. Results suggest that left-temporal EEG alpha oscillations are unlikely to uniquely reflect verbal processing during conscious motor control.", "Keywords": ["Conscious motor processing", "Neural efficiency", "Reinvestment", "T7-Fz", "Verbal-analytical"], "MeSH terms": ["Consciousness", "Electroencephalography", "Hand", "Humans", "Motor Activity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Johnny V V", "Last Name": "Parr", "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Musculoskeletal Science and Sports Medicine, Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK.

We examined 130 depressed patients (58 treatment-resistant, 36 antidepressant-responsive and 36 currently untreated) and 40 healthy controls from the BIODEP study, and used whole-blood mRNA qPCR to measure the expression of 16 candidate mRNAs, some never measured before: interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, macrophage inhibiting factor (MIF), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), SGK1, FKBP5, the purinergic receptor P2RX7, CCL2, CXCL12, c-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), acquaporin-4 (AQP4), ISG15, STAT1 and USP-18. All genes but AQP4, ISG15 and USP-18 were differentially regulated. Treatment-resistant and drug-free depressed patients had both increased inflammasome activation (higher P2RX7 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines mRNAs expression) and glucocorticoid resistance (lower GR and higher FKBP5 mRNAs expression), while responsive patients had an intermediate phenotype with, additionally, lower CXCL12. Most interestingly, using binomial logistics models we found that a signature of six mRNAs (P2RX7, IL-1-beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, CXCL12 and GR) distinguished treatment-resistant from responsive patients, even after adjusting for other variables that were different between groups, such as a trait- and state-anxiety, history of childhood maltreatment and serum CRP.

treatment-resistant depression, including combinations with anti-inflammatory medications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antidepressive Agents", "Cytokines", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans",

challenges. However, most psychoactive agents act on multiple neurotransmitters, limiting the ability of fMRI to identify functional effects related to actions on discrete pharmacological targets. We recently introduced a multimodal approach, REACT (Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets), which offers the opportunity to disentangle effects of drugs on different neurotransmitters and clarify the biological mechanisms driving clinical efficacy and side effects of a compound. Here, we focus on methylphenidate (MPH), which binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), to unravel its effects on dopaminergic and noradrenergic functional circuits in the healthy brain at rest. We then explored the relationship between these target-enriched resting state functional connectivity (FC) maps and inter-individual variability in behavioural responses to a reinforcement-learning task encompassing a novelty manipulation to disentangle the molecular systems underlying specific cognitive/behavioural effects. Our main analysis showed a significant MPH-induced FC increase in sensorimotor areas in the functional circuit associated with DAT. In our exploratory analysis, we found that MPH-induced regional variations in the DAT and NET-enriched FC maps were significantly correlated with some of the inter-individual differences on key behavioural responses associated with the reinforcement-learning task. Our findings show that main MPH-related FC changes at rest can be understood through the distribution of DAT in the brain. Furthermore, they suggest that when compounds have mixed pharmacological profiles, REACT may be able to capture regional functional effects that are underpinned by the same cognitive mechanism but are related to engagement of distinct molecular targets.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Central Nervous System Stimulants", "Dopamine", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Methylphenidate", "Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ottavia", "Last Name": "Dipasquale", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. ottavia.dipasquale@kcl.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Martins", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Arjun", "Last Name": "Sethi", "Affiliation": "Forensic & Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mattia", "Last Name": "Veronese", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Swen", "Last Name": "Hesse", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Rullmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Sabri", "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Federico", "Last Name": "Turkheimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mitul A", "Last Name": "Mehta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mara", "Last Name": "Cercignani", "Affiliation": "Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2020Aug"}, {"PMID": "32457424", "Title": "Interferon and anti-TNF therapies differentially modulate amygdala reactivity which predicts associated bidirectional changes in depressive symptoms.", "Abstract": "A third of patients receiving Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) treatment for Hepatitis-C develop major depressive disorder (MDD). Conversely, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapies improve depression providing key empirical support for the \"inflammatory theory\" of depression. Heightened amygdala reactivity (particularly to negatively valanced stimuli) is a consistent finding within MDD; can predict treatment efficacy and reverses following successful treatment. However, whether IFN-\u03b1 and anti-TNF enhance/attenuate depressive symptoms through modulation of amygdala emotional reactivity is unknown. Utilizing a prospective study design, we recruited 30 patients (mean 48.0\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5 years, 21 male) initiating IFN-\u03b1 treatment for Hepatitis-C and 30 (mean 50.4\u2009\u00b1\u200915.7 years, 10 male) anti-TNF therapy for inflammatory arthritis. All completed an emotional face-processing task during fMRI and blood sampling before and after their first IFN-\u03b1 (4-h) or anti-TNF (24-h) injection and follow-up psychiatric assessments for 3 months of treatment. IFN-\u03b1 significantly increased depression symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAM-D) at 4 weeks (p\u2009<\u20090.001) but not 4-h after first dose (p\u2009>\u20090.1).

However, while much work has focused on the development of models of motivation based on classic tasks of externally-generated levels of effort for reward, there has been less focus on the question of self-generated motivation or volition. We developed a task that aims to capture separate measures of self-generated and externally-generated motivation, with two task variants for physical and cognitive effort, and sought to test and validate this measure in two populations of healthy volunteers (N = 27 and N = 28). Similar to previous reports, a sigmoid function represented a better overall fit to the effort-reward data than a linear or Weibull model. Individual sigmoid function shapes were governed by two free parameters: bias (the amount of reward needed for effort initiation) and reward insensitivity (the amount of increase in reward needed to accelerate effort expenditure). For both physical and cognitive effort, bias was higher in the self-generated condition, indicating reduced self-generated volitional effort initiation, compared to externally-generated effort initiation, across effort domains. Bias against initial effort initiation in the self-generated condition was related to a specific dimensional measure of anticipatory anhedonia. For physical effort only, reward insensitivity was also higher in the self-generated condition compared to the externally-generated motivation condition, indicating lower self-generated effort acceleration. This work provides a novel objective measure of self-generated motivation that may provide insights into mechanisms of anhedonia and related symptoms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Anhedonia", "Apathy", "Bias", "Cognition", "Decision Making", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Reward", "Volition"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laurel S", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Agnes", "Last Name": "Norbury", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Derek A", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neuroscience, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Valerie", "Last Name": "Voon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "James W", "Last Name": "Murrough", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32317380", "Title": "Extent of Fermi-surface reconstruction in the high-temperature superconductor HgBa2CuO4+\u03b4.", "Abstract": "High magnetic fields have revealed a surprisingly small Fermi surface in underdoped cuprates, possibly resulting from Fermi-surface reconstruction due to an order parameter that breaks translational symmetry of the crystal lattice.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities have been linked to both childhood trauma and depression, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the link between childhood trauma, HPA axis activity and antidepressant response in patients with depression. As part of the Wellcome Trust NIMA consortium, 163 depressed patients and 55 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Adult patients meeting Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Version-5 criteria for major depression were categorised into subgroups of treatment responder (n\u00a0=\u00a042), treatment non-responder (n\u00a0=\u00a080) and untreated depressed (n\u00a0=\u00a041) based on current depressive symptom severity measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and exposure to antidepressant medications established by Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was obtained. Baseline serum C-reactive protein was measured using turbidimetric detection. Salivary cortisol was analyzed at multiple time points during the day using the ELISA technique. Glucocorticoid resistance was defined as the coexistence of hypercortisolemia and inflammation. Our results show that treatment non-responder patients had higher exposure to childhood trauma than responders. No specific HPA axis abnormalities were found in treatment non-responder depressed patients. Untreated depressed showed increased diurnal cortisol levels compared with patients on antidepressant medication, and higher prevalence of glucocorticoid resistance than medicated patients and controls. The severity of childhood trauma was associated with increased diurnal cortisol levels only in individuals with glucocorticoid resistance. Therefore, our findings suggest that the severity of childhood trauma experience contributes to a lack of response to antidepressant treatment. The effects of childhood trauma on increased cortisol levels are specifically evident in patients with glucocorticoid resistance and suggest glucocorticoid resistance as a target for the development of personalized treatment for a subgroup of depressed patients with a history of childhood trauma rather than for all patients with resistance to antidepressant treatment.", "Keywords": ["Childhood trauma", "Cortisol response", "Glucocorticoid resistance", "HPA axis hyperactivity", "Inflammation", "Major depressive disorders", "Treatment resistant depression"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antidepressive Agents", "Child", "Depression", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Pituitary-Adrenal System"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Naghmeh", "Last Name": "Nikkheslat", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Kings College London, UK.

However, relatively little is known about how invalid emotion expectations (i.e. expecting a positive picture but seeing a negative picture) affect neural and behavioural responses. To investigate this, two experiments were conducted where participants viewed and rated the pleasantness of emotional pictures that were preceded by a cue. In Experiment 1, there were three cue conditions: uncertain, valid and invalid. The uncertain cue did not indicate the valence of the upcoming picture, whereas cues in the valid condition (70% of positive and negative cues) correctly indicated the valence of the upcoming picture. The remaining trials were invalid, where the valence of the picture differed from the expected valence. Behavioural results showed that invalidly cued negative pictures elicited more neutral valence ratings compared to validly cued pictures. In Experiment 2 we replicated the findings of Experiment 1, and in addition found an increased amplitude for the early (400-600\u202fms) portion of the late positive potential (LPP) for invalidly compared to validly cued pictures. Together, these results show that invalid expectations influence the neural and behavioural processing of subsequently presented emotional pictures, where invalidly cued pictures led to attenuated (i.e., more neutral) emotional responses, and enhanced early LPP amplitude, compared to validly cued pictures.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Cerebral Cortex", "Electroencephalography", "Emotions", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Uncertainty", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ann-Kathrin", "Last Name": "Johnen", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Liverpool Hope University, Liverpool, UK."}, {"First Name": "Neil R", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Liverpool Hope University, Liverpool, UK.

Here we report effects of impurities on the crystals of bound states, and doping-induced emergent ground states in Mg-doped SrCu2(BO3)2, which remain stable in high magnetic fields. Using four complementary magnetometry techniques and theoretical simulations, a rich impurity-induced phenomenology at high fields is discovered. The results demonstrate a rare example in which even a small doping concentration interacts strongly with both triplets and bound states of triplets, and thus plays a significant role in the magnetization process even at high magnetic fields.

However, it remains unclear whether the clinical phenotype of patients with inflammation-associated depression significantly overlaps with, or can be distinguished from that of patients with 'idiopathic' depression. Here we explored the Hamilton depression scale factor structure of 172 patients undergoing interferon-alpha treatment for hepatitis-C at the point of transition to a depressive episode of DSM IV defined major depression severity. The resulting factor structure was first compared with a model derived from 6 previous studies of 'idiopathic' MDD (Cole et al., 2004). This confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of HAMD scores in our interferon-alpha treated cohort did not plausibly fit that previously described for 'idiopathic' MDD. Instead, subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed a distinct four factor model with a novel primary factor grouping cognitive symptoms of depression and anxiety (HAMD items 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 15). The second sleep disorder factor (items 4, 5, 6) replicated previous findings in 'idiopathic' depression. A third and unique factor grouped somatic symptoms and function (items 7, 12, 13, 14 and item 1). The final factor (also common in idiopathic depression studies), grouped gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss (items 12 and 16). Severe depression items (3, 8, and 17) were excluded from analysis due to very low variance. At transition, interferon-alpha induced major depressive episodes therefore appears to have more associated anxiety features that covary with depressed mood than classical or 'idiopathic' MDD and a low likelihood of severe features such as suicidal ideation. Identification of this clinical phenotype may help identify patients with an inflammatory depression etiology and support the development of more effective and personalized therapies.", "Keywords": ["Depression", "Factor analysis", "Inflammation", "Interferon alpha"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Anxiety Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interferon-alpha", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phenotype", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Suicidal Ideation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Whale", "Affiliation": "Immunopsychiatry Research Clinic, Sussex Education Centre, Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton BN3 7HZ, United Kingdom; Department of Neuroscience, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton BN1 9RR, United Kingdom.

Magnetometry is a powerful tool for fathoming electrons in solids, by which a clear method for discerning relativistic quasiparticles has not yet been established. Adopting the probes of magnetic torque and parallel magnetization for the archetype Weyl semimetal TaAs in strong magnetic field, we observed a quasi-linear field dependent effective transverse magnetization and a non-saturating parallel magnetization when the system enters the quantum limit. Distinct from the saturating magnetic responses for non-relativistic quasiparticles, the non-saturating signals of TaAs in strong field is consistent with our newly developed magnetization calculation for a Weyl fermion system in an arbitrary angle.

Barriers to obtaining immune measures at baseline (i.e., before the trigger) in CFS and post-infective fatigue model cohorts have prevented the study of pre-existing immune dysfunction and subsequent immune changes in response to the trigger. This study presents interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1)-induced persistent fatigue as a model of CFS. IFN-\u03b1, which is used in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, induces a persistent fatigue in some individuals, which does not abate post-treatment, that is, once there is no longer immune activation. This model allows for the assessment of patients before and during exposure to the immune trigger, and afterwards when the original trigger is no longer present. Fifty-five patients undergoing IFN-\u03b1 treatment for chronic HCV were assessed at baseline, during the 6-12 months of IFN-\u03b1 treatment, and at six-months post-treatment. Measures of fatigue, cytokines and kynurenine pathway metabolites were obtained. Fifty-four CFS patients and 57 healthy volunteers completed the same measures at a one-off assessment, which were compared with post-treatment follow-up measures from the HCV patients. Eighteen patients undergoing IFN-\u03b1 treatment (33%) were subsequently defined as having 'persistent fatigue' (the proposed model for CFS), if their levels of fatigue were higher six-months post-treatment than at baseline; the other 67% were considered 'resolved fatigue'. Patients who went on to develop persistent fatigue experienced a greater increase in fatigue symptoms over the first four weeks of IFN-\u03b1, compared with patients who did not (\u0394 Treatment Week (TW)-0 vs. TW4; PF: 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 vs. RF: 4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8, p = 0.046). Moreover, there was a trend towards increased baseline interleukin (IL)-6, and significantly higher baseline IL-10 levels, as well as higher levels of these cytokines in response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment, alongside concurrent increases in fatigue. Levels increased to more than double those of the other patients by Treatment Week (TW)4 (p\u2009=\u2009 0.011 for IL-6 and p\u202f=\u202f0.001 for IL-10). There was no evidence of an association between persistent fatigue and peripheral inflammation six-months post-treatment, nor did we observe peripheral inflammation in the CFS cohort. While there were changes in kynurenine metabolites in response to IFN-\u03b1, there was no association with persistent fatigue. CFS patients had lower levels of the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan and 3-hydroxykynurenine than controls. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind the initial exaggerated response of the immune system in those who go on to experience persistent fatigue even if the immune trigger is no longer present, and the change from acute to chronic fatigue in the absence of continued peripheral immune activation.", "Keywords": ["Chronic fatigue syndrome", "Cytokines", "Fatigue", "Inflammation", "Kynurenine", "Tryptophan"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic", "Female", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interferon-alpha", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, UK.

Tics are typically experienced as avolitional, compulsive, and associated with premonitory urges. They are exacerbated by stress and can be triggered by external stimuli, including social cues like the actions and facial expressions of others. Importantly, emotional social stimuli, with angry facial stimuli potentially the most potent social threat cue, also trigger behavioural reactions in healthy individuals, suggesting that such mechanisms may be particularly sensitive in people with Tourette syndrome. Twenty-one participants with Tourette syndrome and 21 healthy controls underwent functional MRI while viewing faces wearing either neutral or angry expressions to quantify group differences in neural activity associated with processing social information. Simultaneous video recordings of participants during neuroimaging enabled us to model confounding effects of tics on task-related responses to the processing of faces. In both Tourette syndrome and control participants, face stimuli evoked enhanced activation within canonical face perception regions, including the occipital face area and fusiform face area. However, the Tourette syndrome group showed additional responses within the anterior insula to both neutral and angry faces. Functional connectivity during face viewing was then examined in a series of psychophysiological interactions. In participants with Tourette syndrome, the insula showed functional connectivity with a set of cortical regions previously implicated in tic generation: the presupplementary motor area, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, and the putamen. Furthermore, insula functional connectivity with the globus pallidus and thalamus varied in proportion to tic severity, while supplementary motor area connectivity varied in proportion to premonitory sensations, with insula connectivity to these regions increasing to a greater extent in patients with worse symptom severity. In addition, the occipital face area showed increased functional connectivity in Tourette syndrome participants with posterior cortical regions, including primary somatosensory cortex, and occipital face area connectivity with primary somatosensory and primary motor cortices varied in proportion to tic severity. There were no significant psychophysiological interactions in controls. These findings highlight a potential mechanism in Tourette syndrome through which heightened representation within insular cortex of embodied affective social information may impact the reactivity of subcortical motor pathways, supporting programmed motor actions that are causally implicated in tic generation.

The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models, adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors, such as decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol (IA EtOH) procedure in male mice, we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood, two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability, including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) and in intrinsic persistent activity (a mode of neuronal firing that is dependent on Ih). Many of these effects on intrinsic excitability were sustained following abstinence and observed in mice that showed working memory deficits. In addition, we found that resting membrane potential and the Ih-dependent voltage \"sag\" in prelimbic PFC PNs are developmentally regulated during adolescence, suggesting that adolescent alcohol exposure may compromise PFC function by arresting the normal developmental trajectory of PN intrinsic excitability.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence has negative consequences for the function of the developing PFC. Using a mouse model of voluntary binge drinking during adolescence, we found that this behavior leads to working memory deficits and altered drinking behavior in adulthood. In addition, we found that adolescent drinking is associated with specific changes to the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC, reducing the ability of these neurons to generate intrinsic persistent activity, a phenomenon thought to be important for working memory. These findings may help explain why human adolescent binge drinkers show performance deficits on tasks mediated by the PFC.", "Keywords": ["Ih", "adolescence", "alcohol", "prefrontal cortex", "working memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Binge Drinking", "Central Nervous System Depressants", "Disease Models, Animal", "Ethanol", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Pyramidal Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael C", "Last Name": "Salling", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and ms4431@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Mary Jane", "Last Name": "Skelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Avegno", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Regan", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and."}, {"First Name": "Tamara", "Last Name": "Zeric", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Elcoma", "Last Name": "Nichols", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and."}, {"First Name": "Neil L", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Jul04"}, {"PMID": "29884282", "Title": "Interoception and Inflammation in Psychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Despite a historical focus on neurally mediated interoceptive signaling mechanisms, humoral (and even cellular) signals also play an important role in communicating bodily physiological state to the brain.

Stimulus novelty biases decision-making, even when unrelated to choice outcome, acting as if possessing intrinsic reward value to guide decisions toward uncertain options. Heightened novelty seeking is characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, yet how this influences reward-related decision-making is computationally encoded, or is altered by stimulant medication, is currently uncertain. Here we used an established reinforcement-learning task to model effects of novelty on reward-related behaviour during functional MRI in 30 adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 30 age-, sex- and IQ-matched control subjects. Each participant was tested on two separate occasions, once ON and once OFF stimulant medication. OFF medication, patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder showed significantly impaired task performance (P = 0.027), and greater selection of novel options (P = 0.004). Moreover, persistence in selecting novel options predicted impaired task performance (P = 0.025). These behavioural deficits were accompanied by a significantly lower learning rate (P = 0.011) and heightened novelty signalling within the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (family-wise error corrected P < 0.05). Compared to effects in controls, stimulant medication improved attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participants' overall task performance (P = 0.011), increased reward-learning rates (P = 0.046) and enhanced their ability to differentiate optimal from non-optimal novel choices (P = 0.032). It also reduced substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area responses to novelty. Preliminary cross-sectional evidence additionally suggested an association between long-term stimulant treatment and a reduction in the rewarding value of novelty. These data suggest that aberrant substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area novelty processing plays an important role in the suboptimal reward-related decision-making characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Expression profiling revealed robust changes in the MDM transcriptome (3294 genes at P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) following LPS challenge, whereas a more limited subset of genes (499) responded to IFN\u03b1. Contrary to published reports, administered at nontoxic doses, neither monoaminergic antidepressant significantly modulated the transcriptional response to either inflammatory challenge. Each anti-inflammatory drug had a distinct impact on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and on the profile of inducible gene expression-notably on the regulation of enzymes involved in metabolism of tryptophan. Inter alia, the effect of anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody confirmed a predicted autocrine stimulatory loop in human macrophages. The transcriptional changes were predictive of tryptophan availability and kynurenine synthesis, as analyzed by targeted metabolomic studies on cellular supernatants.

Consequently, the literature on psychogenic amnesia is somewhat fragmented and offers little prognostic value for individual patients. In the present study, we reviewed the case records and neuropsychological findings in 53 psychogenic amnesia cases (ratio of 3:1, males:females), in comparison with 21 consecutively recruited neurological memory-disordered patients and 14 healthy control subjects. In particular, we examined the pattern of retrograde amnesia on an assessment of autobiographical memory (the Autobiographical Memory Interview). We found that our patients with psychogenic memory loss fell into four distinct groups, which we categorized as: (i) fugue state; (ii) fugue-to-focal retrograde amnesia; (iii) psychogenic focal retrograde amnesia following a minor neurological episode; and (iv) patients with gaps in their memories. While neurological cases were characterized by relevant neurological symptoms, a history of a past head injury was actually more common in our psychogenic cases (P = 0.012), perhaps reflecting a 'learning episode' predisposing to later psychological amnesia. As anticipated, loss of the sense of personal identity was confined to the psychogenic group. However, clinical depression, family/relationship problems, financial/employment problems, and failure to recognize the family were also statistically more common in that group. The pattern of autobiographical memory loss differed between the psychogenic groups: fugue cases showed a severe and uniform loss of memories for both facts and events across all time periods, whereas the two focal retrograde amnesia groups showed a 'reversed' temporal gradient with relative sparing of recent memories. After 3-6 months, the fugue patients had improved to normal scores for facts and near-normal scores for events. By contrast, the two focal retrograde amnesia groups showed less improvement and continued to show a reversed temporal gradient.

In spinal cord, glycine mediates synaptic inhibition through the activation of heteromeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) composed primarily of \u03b11 and \u03b2 subunits. Inhibitory GlyRs are also found throughout the brain, where GlyR \u03b12 and \u03b13 subunit expression exceeds that of \u03b11, particularly in forebrain structures, and coassembly of these \u03b1 subunits with the \u03b2 subunit appears to occur to a lesser extent than in spinal cord. Here, we analyzed GlyR currents in several regions of the adolescent mouse forebrain (striatum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). Our results show ubiquitous expression of GlyRs that mediate large-amplitude currents in response to exogenously applied glycine in these forebrain structures. Additionally, tonic inward currents were also detected, but only in the striatum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC). These tonic currents were sensitive to both strychnine and picrotoxin, indicating that they are mediated by extrasynaptic homomeric GlyRs. Recordings from mice deficient in the GlyR \u03b13 subunit (Glra3-/-) revealed a lack of tonic GlyR currents in the striatum and the PFC. In Glra2-/Y animals, GlyR tonic currents were preserved; however, the amplitudes of current responses to exogenous glycine were significantly reduced.

Many anesthetics potentiate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR) activation, and these receptors are expressed on multiple subtypes of immune cells, providing a potential mechanistic link. Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing \u03b14-subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR \u03b14-subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra40/0 ) mice. Wild-type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to PBS intranasally 5 days/wk for 3 wk. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (P = not significant; n = 4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (P < 0.05, n = 8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (P < 0.05; n = 4) and increased markers of lung T-cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; P < 0.01, n = 4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4+ cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T-cell receptor as compared with WT CD4+ cells. These data suggest that the GABAAR \u03b14-subunit plays a role in immune cell function during allergic lung sensitization.

In contrast, striatal abnormalities are infrequently detected in voxel-based morphometry (VBM) neuroimaging studies of adults with ADHD. This discrepancy has been suggested to reflect normalisation of striatal morphology with age and prolonged treatment of symptoms. If so, this would indicate that while striatal abnormalities are linked to symptom expression in childhood, they cannot explain the persistence of these symptoms in adulthood. However, this may not be case. Instead, we hypothesized that the lack of evidence for striatal abnormalities in adult ADHD may reflect poor sensitivity of typical (T1-weighted) neuroimaging to detect subcortical differences. To address this, we acquired both magnetisation transfer (MT) saturation maps optimised for subcortical contrast, and conventional T1-weighted images in 30 adults with ADHD and 30 age, IQ, gender and handedness-matched controls. Using VBM of both datasets, we demonstrate volumetric reductions within the left ventral striatum on MT that are not observed on identically pre-processed T1-weighted images from the same participants. Nevertheless, both techniques reported similar sensitivity to cortical abnormalities in the right inferior parietal lobe. Additionally, we show that differences in striatal iron may potentially explain this reduced sensitivity of T1-weighted images in adults. Together, these findings indicate that prior VBM studies reporting no abnormalities in striatal volume in adult ADHD might have been compromised by the methodological insensitivity of T1-weighted VBM to subcortical differences, and that structural abnormalities of the striatum in ADHD do indeed persist into adulthood.", "Keywords": ["ADHD", "Iron", "MT saturation", "Striatum", "T1 weighted MRI", "VBM"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Basal Ganglia", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Iron", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arjun", "Last Name": "Sethi", "Affiliation": "Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK; Psychiatry, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.

Impairments in behavioral flexibility are commonly observed in psychiatric disorders including those of addiction. This study investigates two distinct facets of compulsivity, namely reversal learning and attentional set shifting, implicating orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal regions respectively, across disorders of primary and secondary rewards. Obese subjects with and without binge eating disorder (BED), individuals with compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB), alcohol dependence (AD) and pathological video-gaming (VG) were tested with two computerized tasks: the probabilistic reversal task (trials to criterion and win-stay/lose-shift errors) and the intra/extra-dimensional set shift task (IED). Individuals with AD and pathological VG were slower at reversal learning irrespective of valence, with AD subjects more likely to perseverate after losses. Compared to obese subjects without BED, BED subjects were worse at reversal learning to wins but better at losses highlighting valence effects as a function of binge eating. CSB subjects demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to reward outcomes with faster acquisition and greater perseveration with higher magnitude rewards. We further show an impairment in attentional set shifting in individuals with BED and AD relative to healthy volunteers (HV). This study provides evidence for commonalities and differences in two distinct dimensions of behavioral inflexibility across disorders of compulsivity. We summarize studies on compulsivity subtypes within this same patient population.

In Ziessler et al.'s (2012) experiments participants first learned arbitrary effects of key-pressing responses. In the test phase an imperative stimulus determined the response, but participants withheld the response until a Go-stimulus appeared. Reaction times (RTs) were shorter if the Go-stimulus was compatible with the learned response effect. This is strong evidence that effect representations were activated during response planning. Here, we repeated the experiment using event-related potentials (ERPs), and we found that Go-stimulus locked ERPs depended on the compatibility relationship between the Go-stimulus and the response effect. In general, this supports the interpretation of the behavioral data. More specifically, differences in the ERPs between compatible and incompatible Go-stimuli were found for the early perceptual P1 component and the later frontal P2 component. P1 differences were found only in the second half of the experiment and for long stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) between imperative stimulus and Go-stimulus, i.e., when the effect was fully anticipated and the perceptual system was prepared for the effect-compatible Go-stimulus. P2 amplitudes, likely associated with evaluation and conflict detection, were larger when Go-stimulus and effect were incompatible; presumably, incompatibility increased the difficulty of effect anticipation. Onset of response-locked lateralized readiness potentials (R-LRPs) occurred earlier under incompatible conditions indicating extended motor processing.

We observed an increase in force output during social evaluation that was accompanied by focal reductions in activity within bilateral inferior parietal cortex. Moreover, deactivation of the left inferior parietal cortex predicted both inter- and intra-individual differences in socially-induced change in grip force. Social evaluation also enhanced activation within the posterior superior temporal sulcus, which conveys visual information about others' actions to the inferior parietal cortex. Interestingly, functional connectivity between these two regions was attenuated by social evaluation. Our data suggest that social evaluation can vary force output through the altered engagement of inferior parietal cortex; a region implicated in sensorimotor integration necessary for object manipulation, and a component of the action-observation network which integrates and facilitates performance of observed actions.

Novelty-seeking and cue-conditioning are fundamental processes underlying preference and approach behaviors implicated in disorders of addiction. Here we examine these processes in individuals with compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB), hypothesizing a greater preference for sexual novelty and stimuli conditioned to sexual rewards relative to healthy volunteers. Twenty-two CSB males and forty age-matched male volunteers were tested in two separate behavioral tasks focusing on preferences for novelty and conditioned stimuli. Twenty subjects from each group were also assessed in a third conditioning and extinction task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. CSB was associated with enhanced novelty preference for sexual, as compared to control images, and a generalized preference for cues conditioned to sexual and monetary versus neutral outcomes compared to healthy volunteers. CSB individuals also had greater dorsal cingulate habituation to repeated sexual versus monetary images with the degree of habituation correlating with enhanced preference for sexual novelty. Approach behaviors to sexually conditioned cues dissociable from novelty preference were associated with an early attentional bias to sexual images.

The visual and auditory signals from the same object or event may be integrated and facilitate detection. We explored behavioural and electrophysiological correlates of congruent and incongruent audio-visual depth motion in conditions where auditory level changes, visual expansion, and visual disparity cues were manipulated. In Experiment 1 participants discriminated auditory motion direction whilst viewing looming or receding, 2D or 3D, visual stimuli. Responses were faster and more accurate for congruent than for incongruent audio-visual cues, and the congruency effect (i.e., difference between incongruent and congruent conditions) was larger for visual 3D cues compared to 2D cues. In Experiment 2, event-related potentials (ERPs) were collected during presentation of the 2D and 3D, looming and receding, audio-visual stimuli, while participants detected an infrequent deviant sound. Our main finding was that audio-visual congruity was affected by retinal disparity at an early processing stage (135-160ms) over occipito-parietal scalp. Topographic analyses suggested that similar brain networks were activated for the 2D and 3D congruity effects, but that cortical responses were stronger in the 3D condition.

A subset cortical and subcortical brain regions are implicated in autonomic control of bodily arousal during emotional behaviors. Here, we combined human functional neuroimaging with autonomic monitoring to identify neural mechanisms that support the volitional regulation of heart rate, a process that may be assisted by visual feedback. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 15 healthy adults performed an experimental task in which they were prompted voluntarily to increase or decrease cardiovascular arousal (heart rate) during true, false, or absent visual feedback. Participants achieved appropriate changes in heart rate, without significant modulation of respiratory rate, and were overall not influenced by the presence of visual feedback. Increased activity in right amygdala, striatum and brainstem occurred when participants attempted to increase heart rate. In contrast, activation of ventrolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices occurred when attempting to decrease heart rate. Biofeedback enhanced activity within occipito-temporal cortices, but there was no significant interaction with task conditions. Activity in regions including pregenual anterior cingulate and ventral striatum reflected the magnitude of successful task performance, which was negatively related to subclinical anxiety symptoms.

Cross-sectional data suggest decreased collateral flow in patients with total cavopulmonary connections (TCPCs) compared with those with superior cavopulmonary connections (SCPCs). However, no studies have examined serial changes in collateral flow from SCPCs to TCPCs in the same patients. The aim of this study was to examine differences in collateral flow between patients with SCPCs and those with TCPCs. Collateral flow was quantified by 2 independent measures from 250 single-ventricle studies in 219 different patients (115 SCPC and 135 TCPC studies, 31 patients with both) and 18 controls, during routine studies using through-plane phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Collateral flow was indexed to body surface area, aortic flow, and pulmonary venous flow. Regardless of indexing method, SCPC patients had significantly higher collateral flow than TCPC patients (1.64 \u00b1 0.8 vs 1.03 \u00b1 0.8\u00a0L/min/m(2), p <0.001). In 31 patients who underwent serial examinations, collateral flow as a fraction of aortic flow increased early after TCPC completion. In TCPC patients, indexed collateral flow demonstrated a significant negative correlation with time from TCPC. In conclusion, SCPC and TCPC patients demonstrate substantial collateral flow, with SCPC patients having higher collateral flow than TCPC patients overall. On the basis of the paired subset analysis, collateral flow does not decrease in the short term after TCPC completion and trends toward an increase.

We recruited 11 patients with established PoTS and 23 age-matched normal controls. Group comparison of gray matter volume revealed diminished gray matter volume within the left anterior insula, right middle frontal gyrus and right cingulate gyrus in the PoTS group. We also observed lower white matter volume beneath the precentral gyrus and paracentral lobule, right pre- and post-central gyrus, paracentral lobule and superior frontal gyrus in PoTS patients. Subsequent ROI analyses revealed significant negative correlations between left insula volume and trait anxiety and depression scores.

Modulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) chloride via GABAA receptor activation to achieve relaxation of precontracted ASM represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic option.

Here, we determined whether there is a causal relationship between D2R levels and alcohol intake. To this end, we upregulated D2R expression levels in the nucleus accumbens of the adult mouse, but selectively restricted the upregulation to the indirect striatal output pathway, which endogenously expresses D2Rs. After overexpression was established, mice were tested in two models of free-choice alcohol drinking: the continuous and intermittent access two-bottle choice models.

This tendency is adaptive, aiding identification of potentially valuable novel outcomes. The dopaminergic substantia nigra (SN) is implicated in the drive to explore novel stimuli and situations. However, infection and inflammation inhibit the motivation to seek out novelty. This likely serves to limit exposure to uncertain, potentially detrimental outcomes when metabolic resources are limited. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms through which inflammation constrains novelty seeking are poorly understood. We therefore scanned 16 healthy participants (6 male, mean 27.2\u00b17.3 years), using fMRI, once following experimental inflammation (intramuscular (i.m.) typhoid vaccination) and once after placebo (i.m. saline), with the aim of characterizing effects of inflammation on neural processing of novel and familiar place, and face stimuli. We specifically tested the effects of inflammation on the hypothesized roles of SN and hippocampus in novelty processing. Typhoid vaccination evoked a nearly threefold increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-6) levels 3\u2009h after injection, indicating induction of mild systemic inflammation. Enhanced hippocampal responses to novel (compared with familiar) stimuli were observed following both vaccine and placebo, consistent with intact central novelty detection. However, the normal bilateral reactivity of SN to stimulus novelty was significantly attenuated following inflammation. Correspondingly, inflammation also markedly impaired novelty-related functional coupling between the SN and hippocampus. These data extend previous findings of SN sensitivity to mild inflammation associated with changes in psychomotor responding, and suggest that inflammation-induced blunting of SN responses to hippocampal novelty signals may represent a plausible mechanism through which inflammation impairs motivational responses to novelty.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Cross-Over Studies", "Cytokines", "Double-Blind Method", "Exploratory Behavior", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Oxygen", "Photic Stimulation", "Polysaccharides, Bacterial", "Psychophysics", "Substantia Nigra", "Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "1] Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex Campus, Brighton, UK [2] Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mara", "Last Name": "Cercignani", "Affiliation": "Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex Campus, Brighton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Valerie", "Last Name": "Voon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Hugo D", "Last Name": "Critchley", "Affiliation": "1] Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex Campus, Brighton, UK [2] Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2015Mar"}, {"PMID": "25153083", "Title": "Enhanced attentional bias towards sexually explicit cues in individuals with and without compulsive sexual behaviours.", "Abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviour (CSB) is relatively common and has been associated with significant distress and psychosocial impairments.

In addition to the classic form of synaptic inhibition, another important mechanism that can regulate neuronal excitability is tonic inhibition via sustained activation of receptors by ambient levels of inhibitory neurotransmitter, usually GABA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this occurs in layer II/III pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic region of the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We found that these neurons respond to exogenous GABA and to the \u03b14\u03b4-containing GABAA receptor (GABA(A)R)-selective agonist gaboxadol, consistent with the presence of extrasynaptic GABA(A)R populations. Spontaneous and miniature synaptic currents were blocked by the GABA(A)R antagonist gabazine and had fast decay kinetics, consistent with typical synaptic GABA(A)Rs. Very few layer II/III neurons showed a baseline current shift in response to gabazine, but almost all showed a current shift (15-25 pA) in response to picrotoxin. In addition to being a noncompetitive antagonist at GABA(A)Rs, picrotoxin also blocks homomeric glycine receptors (GlyRs). Application of the GlyR antagonist strychnine caused a modest but consistent shift (\u223c15 pA) in membrane current, without affecting spontaneous synaptic events, consistent with the tonic activation of GlyRs. Further investigation showed that these neurons respond in a concentration-dependent manner to glycine and taurine. Inhibition of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) with sarcosine resulted in an inward current and an increase of the strychnine-sensitive current.

The regulation of postsynaptic receptors by alcohol has been well studied, but the mechanisms underlying the effects of alcohol on the presynaptic terminal are relatively unexplored. To identify a pathway by which alcohol regulates neurotransmitter release, we recently investigated the mechanism by which ethanol induces Vamp2, but not Vamp1, in mouse primary cortical cultures. These two genes encode isoforms of synaptobrevin, a vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein required for synaptic vesicle fusion. We found that alcohol activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to induce Vamp2 expression, while Vamp1 mRNA levels remain unaffected. As the Vamp2 gene encodes a SNARE protein, we then investigated whether ethanol exposure and HSF1 transcriptional activity alter neurotransmitter release using electrophysiology. We found that alcohol increased the frequency of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated miniature IPSCs via HSF1, but had no effect on mEPSCs. Overall, these data indicate that alcohol induces HSF1 transcriptional activity to trigger a specific coordinated adaptation in GABAergic presynaptic terminals. This mechanism could explain some of the changes in synaptic function that occur soon after alcohol exposure, and may underlie some of the more enduring effects of chronic alcohol intake on local circuit function.", "Keywords": ["alcohol/ethanol", "heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)", "soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)", "synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)", "\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Florence P", "Last Name": "Varodayan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University New York City, NY, USA ; Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University New York City, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil L", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University New York City, NY, USA ; Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University New York City, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in integrative neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "24179823", "Title": "Abnormalities in fronto-striatal connectivity within language networks relate to differences in grey-matter heterogeneity in Asperger syndrome.", "Abstract": "Asperger syndrome (AS) is an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterised by qualitative impairment in the development of emotional and social skills with relative preservation of general intellectual abilities, including verbal language.

The earliest difference between congruent and incongruent audiovisual stimuli occurs between 240 and 280 ms after stimulus onset in the left temporal region. Between 340 and 420 ms, semantic congruence modulates responses in central and right frontal areas. Late differences (after 460 ms) occur bilaterally in frontal areas.2) Source localisation (dipole modelling and LORETA) reveals that an extended network encompassing inferior frontal, temporal, parasaggital, and superior parietal sites are simultaneously active between 180 and 420 ms to process auditory\u2013visual action sequences. Early activation (before 120 ms) can be explained by activity in mainly sensory cortices. .

Depressed mood is also a cardiovascular risk factor. To date, research into mechanisms through which inflammation impacts cardiovascular health rarely takes into account central effects on autonomic cardiovascular control, instead emphasizing direct effects of peripheral inflammatory responses on endothelial reactivity and myocardial function. However, brain responses to inflammation engage neural systems for motivational and homeostatic control and are expressed through depressed mood state and changes in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Here we combined an inflammatory challenge, known to evoke an acute reduction in mood, with neuroimaging to identify the functional brain substrates underlying potentially detrimental changes in autonomic cardiovascular control. We first demonstrated that alterations in the balance of low to high frequency (LF/HF) changes in heart rate variability (a measure of baroreflex sensitivity) could account for some of the inflammation-evoked changes in diastolic blood pressure, indicating a central (rather than solely local endothelial) origin. Accompanying alterations in regional brain metabolism (measured using (18)FDG-PET) were analysed to localise central mechanisms of inflammation-induced changes in cardiovascular state: three discrete regions previously implicated in stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity, the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate and pons, strongly mediated the relationship between inflammation and blood pressure. Moreover, activity changes within each region predicted the inflammation-induced shift in LF/HF balance. These data are consistent with a centrally-driven component originating within brain areas supporting stressor evoked blood pressure reactivity. Together our findings highlight mechanisms binding psychological and physiological well-being and their perturbation by peripheral inflammation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autonomic Nervous System", "Baroreflex", "Blood Pressure", "Brain", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cardiovascular System", "Depression", "Double-Blind Method", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Radionuclide Imaging", "Risk", "Stress, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex Campus, Falmer, Brighton BN1 3AR, UK. n.harrison@bsms.ac.uk"}, {"First Name": "Ella", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valerie", "Last Name": "Voon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ken", "Last Name": "Miles", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hugo D", "Last Name": "Critchley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Brain, behavior, and immunity", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "23364597", "Title": "Anesthetics interfere with axon guidance in developing mouse neocortical neurons in vitro via a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor mechanism.", "Abstract": "The finding that exposure to general anesthetics (GAs) in childhood may increase rates of learning disabilities has raised a concern that anesthetics may interfere with brain development.

Both cell types are readily accessible, and were purified for undifferentiated cells only. We identified a set of 28 differentially expressed genes, many of which had cancer and stemness roles. Overexpression of the recently discovered pluripotency gene NR5A2 in malignant EC cells revealed an intriguing indication of how WNT-mediated dysregulation of pluripotency is involved with malignancy. Expression of these 28 genes was further explored within 2 publically available data sets of primary EC tumors and normal testis. At the exon-level, alternative splicing events were detected in ZNF195, DNMT3B, and PMF1, and alternative promoters were detected for ASH2L and ETV5. These events were validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based methods in EC and ES lines, where the alternative splicing event in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B may have functional consequences. In conclusion, we have identified malignancy-specific gene expression differences within a rigorous pluripotent stem cell context. These findings are of particular interest for both GCT and ES cell biology, and, in general, to the concept of CSCs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alternative Splicing", "Carcinoma, Embryonal", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Nuclear Proteins", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptome", "Wnt Signaling Pathway", "DNA Methyltransferase 3B"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sharmini", "Last Name": "Alagaratnam", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Prevention, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne Cathrine", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andreas M", "Last Name": "Hoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anita", "Last Name": "Sveen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harry D", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter W", "Last Name": "Andrews", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ragnhild A", "Last Name": "Lothe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rolf I", "Last Name": "Skotheim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Stem cells and development", "PubDate": "2013Apr01"}]
