[{"PMID": "38883718", "Title": "Novel early-onset Alzheimer-associated genes influence risk through dysregulation of glutamate, immune activation, and intracell signaling pathways.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a highly polygenic disease that presents with relatively earlier onset (\u226470yo; EOAD) in about 5% of cases. Around 90% of these EOAD cases remain unexplained by pathogenic mutations. Using data from EOAD cases and controls, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and trans-ancestry meta-analysis on non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, NCase=6,282, NControl=13,386), African Americans (AA NCase=782, NControl=3,663) and East Asians (NCase=375, NControl=838 CO). We identified eight novel significant loci: six in the ancestry-specific analyses and two in the trans-ancestry analysis. By integrating gene-based analysis, eQTL, pQTL and functional annotations, we nominate four novel genes that are involved in microglia activation, glutamate production, and signaling pathways. These results indicate that EOAD, although sharing many genes with LOAD, harbors unique genes and pathways that could be used to create better prediction models or target identification for this type of AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Cruchaga", "Affiliation": "Washington University, School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Bradley", "Affiliation": "Washington University in St. Louis."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Western", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ciyang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Washington University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Eder", "Last Name": "Lucio Da Fonseca", "Affiliation": "University of Miami."}, {"First Name": "Achal", "Last Name": "Neupane", "Affiliation": "Washington University in St. Louis."}, {"First Name": "Jiji", "Last Name": "Kurup", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "NIcholas", "Last Name": "Ray", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Jean-Francois", "Affiliation": "University of Miami."}, {"First Name": "Priyanka", "Last Name": "Gorijala", "Affiliation": "Washington University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kristy", "Last Name": "Bergmann", "Affiliation": "Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Budde", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eden", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "University of Miami."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "Pericak-Vance", "Affiliation": "University of Miami."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Cuccaro", "Affiliation": "The John P.

We constructed and analyzed a multi-ancestry GWAS dataset in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to test for novel shared and ancestry-specific AD susceptibility loci and evaluate underlying genetic architecture in 37,382 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 6,728 African American, 8,899 Hispanic (HIS), and 3,232 East Asian individuals, performing within-ancestry fixed-effects meta-analysis followed by a cross-ancestry random-effects meta-analysis. We identified 13 loci with cross-ancestry associations including known loci at/near CR1 , BIN1 , TREM2 , CD2AP , PTK2B , CLU , SHARPIN , MS4A6A , PICALM , ABCA7 , APOE and two novel loci not previously reported at 11p12 ( LRRC4C ) and 12q24.13 ( LHX5-AS1 ). Reflecting the power of diverse ancestry in GWAS, we observed the SHARPIN locus using 7.1% the sample size of the original discovering single-ancestry GWAS (n=788,989). We additionally identified three GWS ancestry-specific loci at/near ( PTPRK ( P =2.4\u00d710 -8 ) and GRB14 ( P =1.7\u00d710 -8 ) in HIS), and KIAA0825 ( P =2.9\u00d710 -8 in NHW). Pathway analysis implicated multiple amyloid regulation pathways (strongest with P adjusted =1.6\u00d710 -4 ) and the classical complement pathway ( P adjusted =1.3\u00d710 -3 ). Genes at/near our novel loci have known roles in neuronal development ( LRRC4C, LHX5-AS1 , and PTPRK ) and insulin receptor activity regulation ( GRB14 ).

Sadly, there is still no cure or means of prevention. As in other complex diseases, uncovering genetic causes of AD could identify underlying pathological mechanisms and lead to potential treatments. Rare, autosomal dominant forms of AD occur in middle age as a result of highly penetrant genetic mutations, but the most common form of AD occurs later in life. Large-scale, genome-wide analyses indicate that 70 or more genes or loci contribute to AD. One of the major factors limiting progress is that most genetic data have been obtained from non-Hispanic white individuals in Europe and North America, preventing the development of personalized approaches to AD in individuals of other ethnicities. Fortunately, emerging genetic data from other regions - including Africa, Asia, India and South America - are now providing information on the disease from a broader range of ethnicities. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on AD genetics in populations across the world. We predominantly focus on replicated genetic discoveries but also include studies in ethnic groups where replication might not be feasible. We attempt to identify gaps that need to be addressed to achieve a complete picture of the genetic and molecular factors that drive AD in individuals across the globe.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Middle Aged", "Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Mutation", "Ethnicity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Margaret A", "Last Name": "Pericak-Vance", "Affiliation": "The John P.

Ancestry analysis showed that the difference in risk between African and European populations lies in the ancestral genomic background surrounding the ApoE locus (local ancestry). Identifying the mechanism(s) of this protection could lead to greater insight into the etiology of Alzheimer disease and more personalized therapeutic intervention. Our objective is to follow up the local ancestry finding and identify the genetic variants that drive this risk difference and result in a lower risk for developing Alzheimer disease in African ancestry populations. We performed association analyses using a logistic regression model with the ApoE \u03b54 allele as an interaction term and adjusted for genome-wide ancestry, age, and sex. Discovery analysis included imputed SNP data of 1,850 Alzheimer disease and 4,331 cognitively intact African American individuals. We performed replication analyses on 63 whole genome sequenced Alzheimer disease and 648 cognitively intact Ibadan individuals. Additionally, we reproduced results using whole-genome sequencing of 273 Alzheimer disease and 275 cognitively intact admixed Puerto Rican individuals. A further comparison was done with SNP imputation from an additional 8,463 Alzheimer disease and 11,365 cognitively intact non-Hispanic White individuals. We identified a significant interaction between the ApoE \u03b54 allele and the SNP rs10423769_A allele, (\u03b2 = -0.54,SE = 0.12,p-value = 7.50x10-6) in the discovery data set, and replicated this finding in Ibadan (\u03b2 = -1.32,SE = 0.52,p-value = 1.15x10-2) and Puerto Rican (\u03b2 = -1.27,SE = 0.64,p-value = 4.91x10-2) individuals. The non-Hispanic Whites analyses showed an interaction trending in the \"protective\" direction but failing to pass a 0.05 significance threshold (\u03b2 = -1.51,SE = 0.84,p-value = 7.26x10-2). The presence of the rs10423769_A allele reduces the odds ratio for Alzheimer disease risk from 7.2 for ApoE \u03b54/\u03b54 carriers lacking the A allele to 2.1 for ApoE \u03b54/\u03b54 carriers with at least one A allele. This locus is located approximately 2 mB upstream of the ApoE locus, in a large cluster of pregnancy specific beta-1 glycoproteins on chromosome 19 and lies within a long noncoding RNA, ENSG00000282943. This study identified a new African-ancestry specific locus that reduces the risk effect of ApoE \u03b54 for developing Alzheimer disease. The mechanism of the interaction with ApoE\u03b54 is not known but suggests a novel mechanism for reducing the risk for \u03b54 carriers opening the possibility for potential ancestry-specific therapeutic intervention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Apolipoproteins E", "Genotype", "Humans", "Nigeria", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Farid", "Last Name": "Rajabli", "Affiliation": "John P.

We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/'proxy' AD cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the APOE \u03b54 allele.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

We sought to identify genetic variants for AD through a family-based design using the Puerto Rican (PR) Alzheimer Disease Initiative (PRADI). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and parametric linkage analysis were performed for 100 individuals from 23 multiplex PRADI families. Variants were prioritized by minor allele frequency (<0.01), functional potential [combined annotation dependent depletion score (CADD) >10], and co-segregation with AD. Variants were further ranked using an independent PR case-control WGS dataset (PR10/66). A genome-wide significant linkage peak was found in 9p21 with a heterogeneity logarithm\u00a0of the\u00a0odds\u00a0score (HLOD) >5.1, which overlaps with an AD linkage region from two published independent studies. The region harbors C9orf72, but no expanded repeats were observed in the families. Seven variants prioritized by the PRADI families also displayed evidence for association in the PR10/66 (p < 0.05), including a missense variant in UNC13B.

Even multiplex families with early onset often also have late-onset cases, suggesting that the commonly applied categorization of Alzheimer disease into early- and late-onset forms may not reflect distinct underlying etiology. Nevertheless, this categorization continues to govern today's research and the design of clinical trials. The aim of this review is to evaluate this categorization by providing a comprehensive, critical review of reported clinical, neuropathologic, and genomic characteristics of both onset-based subtypes and explore potential overlap between both categories. The article will lay out the need to comprehensively assess the phenotypic, neuropathologic, and molecular variability in Alzheimer disease and identify factors explaining the observed significant variation in onset age in persons with and without known mutations. The article will critically review ongoing large-scale genomic efforts in Alzheimer disease research (e.g., Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project, Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and their shortcomings to disentangle the delineation of unexplained nonmendelian early-onset from late-onset and mendelian forms of Alzheimer disease.

While they are phenotypically distinct, recent studies suggest that they share a biological pathway, retromer-dependent endosomal trafficking. A retromer is a multimodular protein assembly critical for sorting and trafficking cargo out of the endosome. As a lysosomal storage disease, all 13 of NCL's causative genes affect endolysosomal function, and at least four have been directly linked to retromer. PD has several known causative genes, with one directly linked to retromer and others causing endolysosomal dysfunction. AD has over 25 causative genes/risk factors, with several of them linked to retromer or endosomal trafficking dysfunction. In this article, we summarize the emerging evidence on the association of genes causing NCL with retromer function and endosomal trafficking, review the recent evidence linking NCL genes to AD, and discuss how NCL, AD, and PD converge on a shared molecular pathway. We also discuss this pathway's role in microglia and neurons, cell populations which are critical to proper brain homeostasis and whose dysfunction plays a key role in neurodegeneration.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "NCL genes", "Parkinson's disease", "Vos29)", "Vps26", "endocytic pathway", "endosomal trafficking", "genetic and cell biology findings on Alzheimer's disease", "microglia", "retromer defects", "retromer proteins (Vps35", "retromer viral vectors for AD gene therapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Biological Transport", "Endosomes", "Humans", "Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses", "Parkinson Disease", "Presenilin-1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yasir H", "Last Name": "Qureshi", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Penelope", "Last Name": "Baez", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA cr2101@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular and cellular biology", "PubDate": "2020Sep14"}, {"PMID": "32637632", "Title": "Synonymous variants associated with Alzheimer disease in multiplex families.", "Abstract": "Synonymous variants can lead to disease; nevertheless, the majority of sequencing studies conducted in Alzheimer disease (AD) only assessed coding variation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Min", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain (M.E.A., B.V., R.L., P.L.J., R.M., I.S.-M., C.R.); The Gertrude H.

DNA methylation is also linked to ageing-the strongest Alzheimer's disease risk factor. DNA methylation age can be calculated using age-related CpGs and might reflect biological ageing. We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50. Targeted sequencing of 80 genes associated with neurodegeneration revealed that the triplets and the affected offspring are heterozygous carriers of the risk APOE \u03b54 allele, as well as rare substitutions in APP (p.S198P), NOTCH3 (p.H1235L) and SORL1 (p.W1563C). In addition, we catalogued 52 possibly damaging rare variants detected by NeuroX array in affected individuals. Analysis of family members on a genome-wide DNA methylation chip revealed that the DNA methylation age of the triplets was 6-10 years younger than chronological age, while it was 9 years older in the offspring with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, suggesting accelerated ageing.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "DNA methylation", "ageing", "monozygotic triplets"], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging, Premature", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoproteins E", "DNA", "DNA Methylation", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Jews", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Pedigree", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Triplets"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "First Rehabilitation Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Allison A", "Last Name": "Dilliott", "Affiliation": "Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Roaa", "Last Name": "Khallaf", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Baycrest Health Sciences, and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Hegele", "Affiliation": "Robarts Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Comishen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Baycrest Health Sciences, and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, 60 Leonard Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Tosto", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter St", "Last Name": "George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, 60 Leonard Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Morris", "Last Name": "Freedman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Baycrest Health Sciences, Mt.

To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and A\u03b2 processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P\u2009=\u20091.32\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Immunity", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lipids", "Male", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian W", "Last Name": "Kunkle", "Affiliation": "John P.

The risk conferred by \u03b54, however, differs across populations, with populations of African ancestry showing lower \u03b54 risk compared to those of European or Asian ancestry. The cause of this heterogeneity in risk effect is currently unknown; it may be due to environmental or cultural factors correlated with ancestry, or it may be due to genetic variation local to the ApoE region that differs among populations. Exploring these hypotheses may lead to novel, population-specific therapeutics and risk predictions. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed ApoE genotypes and genome-wide array data in individuals from African American and Puerto Rican populations. A total of 1,766 African American and 220 Puerto Rican individuals with late-onset Alzheimer disease, and 3,730 African American and 169 Puerto Rican cognitively healthy individuals (> 65 years) participated in the study. We first assessed average ancestry across the genome (\"global\" ancestry) and then tested it for interaction with ApoE genotypes. Next, we assessed the ancestral background of ApoE alleles (\"local\" ancestry) and tested if ancestry local to ApoE influenced Alzheimer disease risk while controlling for global ancestry. Measures of global ancestry showed no interaction with ApoE risk (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.49; African American: p-value = 0.65). Conversely, ancestry local to the ApoE region showed an interaction with the ApoE \u03b54 allele in both populations (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.019; African American: p-value = 0.005). ApoE \u03b54 alleles on an African background conferred a lower risk than those with a European ancestral background, regardless of population (Puerto Rican: OR = 1.26 on African background, OR = 4.49 on European; African American: OR = 2.34 on African background, OR = 3.05 on European background). Factors contributing to the lower risk effect in the ApoE gene \u03b54 allele are likely due to ancestry-specific genetic factors near ApoE rather than non-genetic ethnic, cultural, and environmental factors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Black or African American", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Variation", "Genetics, Population", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hispanic or Latino", "Humans", "Male", "Puerto Rico", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Farid", "Last Name": "Rajabli", "Affiliation": "John P.

The causes of this health disparity remain elusive, partially because of the relative limited capacity for biomedical research in the developing countries that comprise Caribbean Latin America. To begin to address this issue, we were awarded a Development Research Award from the US NIH and Fogarty International Center in order to establish the local capacity to integrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into studies of cognitive aging and dementia in Dominican Republic, establish collaborations with Dominican investigators, and conduct a pilot study on the role of cerebrovascular markers in the clinical expression of AD. Ninety older adult participants with and without AD dementia and with and without a strong family history of AD dementia received MRI scans and clinical evaluation. We quantified markers of cerebrovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], presence of infarct, and presence of microbleed) and neurodegeneration (entorhinal cortex volume) and compared them across groups. Patients with AD dementia had smaller entorhinal cortex and greater WMH volumes compared with controls, regardless of family history status. This study provides evidence for the capacity to conduct MRI studies of cognitive aging and dementia in Dominican Republic. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that small vessel cerebrovascular disease represents a core feature of AD dementia, as affected participants had elevated WMH volumes irrespective of

However, there is still a large proportion of heritability that might be explained by rare but functionally important variants. One of the so far identified genes with rare AD causing variants is ADAM10. Using whole-genome sequencing we now identified a single rare nonsynonymous variant (SNV) rs142946965 [p.R215I] in ADAM17 co-segregating with an autosomal-dominant pattern of late-onset AD in one family. Subsequent genotyping and analysis of available whole-exome sequencing data of additional case/control samples from Germany, UK, and USA identified five variant carriers among AD patients only. The mutation inhibits pro-protein cleavage and the formation of the active enzyme, thus leading to loss-of-function of ADAM17 alpha-secretase. Further, we identified a strong negative correlation between ADAM17 and APP gene expression in human brain and present in vitro evidence that ADAM17 negatively controls the expression of APP. As a consequence, p.R215I mutation of ADAM17 leads to elevated A\u00df formation in vitro.

These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Diseases", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Phenotype", "Quantitative Trait, Heritable", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Brainstorm Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Verneri", "Last Name": "Anttila", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. verneri.anttila@gmail.com acorvin@tcd.ie bneale@broadinstitute.org."}, {"First Name": "Brendan", "Last Name": "Bulik-Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hilary K", "Last Name": "Finucane", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raymond K", "Last Name": "Walters", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Bras", "Affiliation": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Laramie", "Last Name": "Duncan", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Escott-Price", "Affiliation": "Cardiff University, Medical Research Council Center for Neuropsychiatric Genetics & Genomics, Institute of Psychology, Medicine & Clinical Neuroscience, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Guido J", "Last Name": "Falcone", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Padhraig", "Last Name": "Gormley", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rainer", "Last Name": "Malik", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nikolaos A", "Last Name": "Patsopoulos", "Affiliation": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Ripke", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhi", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dongmei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phil H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Turley", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Grenier-Boley", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1167 LabEx DISTALZ, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Chouraki", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1167 LabEx DISTALZ, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Yoichiro", "Last Name": "Kamatani", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Statistical Analysis, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Claudine", "Last Name": "Berr", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1061 - Neuropsychiatry: Epidemiological and Clinical Research, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Luc", "Last Name": "Letenneur", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1219, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "Hannequin", "Affiliation": "Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Amouyel", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1167 LabEx DISTALZ, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Boland", "Affiliation": "Centre National de Recherche en G\u00e9nomique Humaine (CNRGH), Institut de biologie Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, CEA, Evry, France."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", "Last Name": "Deleuze", "Affiliation": "Centre National de Recherche en G\u00e9nomique Humaine (CNRGH), Institut de biologie Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, CEA, Evry, France."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuelle", "Last Name": "Duron", "Affiliation": "Department of Gerontology, H\u00f4pital Broca, AH-HP, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "Gertrude H.

trafficking of proteins in an increasing number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degener-ation (FTLD). The retromer complex, which is highly conserved across all eukaryotes, regulates the sorting of transmembrane proteins out of endo-somes to the cell surface or to the trans-Golgi network. Within retromer, cargo selection and binding are performed by a trimer of the Vps26, Vps29 and Vps35 proteins, named the \"Cargo-Selective Complex (CSC)\". Sorting of cargo into tubules for distribution to the trans-Golgi network or the cell sur-face is achieved through the dimeric sorting nexin (SNX) component of retromer and accessory proteins such as the WASH complex which medi-ates the formation of discrete endosomal tubules enabling the sorting of cargo into distinct pathways through production of filamentous actin patch-es. In the present article, we review the molecular structure and function of the retromer and summarize the evidence linking retromer dysfunction to neurodegenerative disease.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Cell biology", "Genomics", "Intracellular trafficking", "Retromer", "Wash complex"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Reitz", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, The Gertrude H.

In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P < 1 \u00d7 10-4) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P < 5 \u00d7 10-8) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 \u00d7 10-10, odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)cases = 0.0059, MAFcontrols = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 \u00d7 10-10, OR = 1.43, MAFcases = 0.011, MAFcontrols = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 \u00d7 10-14, OR = 1.67, MAFcases = 0.0143, MAFcontrols = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease.

We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising common genetic variants associated with AD, evaluated its association with incident AD and assessed its capacity to improve risk prediction over traditional models based on age, sex, education, and APOE\u025b4. In eight prospective cohorts included in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), we derived weighted sum of risk alleles from the 19 top SNPs reported by the IGAP GWAS in participants aged 65 and older without prevalent dementia. Hazard ratios (HR) of incident AD were estimated in Cox models. Improvement in risk prediction was measured by the difference in C-index (\u0394-C), the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI>0). Overall, 19,687 participants at risk were included, of whom 2,782 developed AD. The GRS was associated with a 17% increase in AD risk (pooled HR\u200a=\u200a1.17; 95% CI\u200a= \u200a [1.13-1.21] per standard deviation increase in GRS; p-value\u200a= \u200a2.86\u00d710-16).

Risk prediction after seven years of follow-up showed a small improvement when adding the GRS to age, sex, APOE\u025b4, and education (\u0394-Cindex\u200a= \u200a0.0043 [0.0019-0.0067]).

Here we report that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) downregulates Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin homologous protein 1 (WAVE1 or WASF1) as part of a negative feedback mechanism to limit A\u03b2 production. The AICD binds to the Wasf1 promoter, negatively regulates its transcription and downregulates Wasf1 mRNA and protein expression in Neuro 2a (N2a) cells. WAVE1 interacts and colocalizes with APP in the Golgi apparatus. Experimentally reducing WAVE1 in N2a cells decreased the budding of APP-containing vesicles and reduced cell-surface APP, thereby reducing the production of A\u03b2. WAVE1 downregulation was observed in mouse models of AD. Reduction of Wasf1 gene expression dramatically reduced A\u03b2 levels and restored memory deficits in a mouse model of AD. A decrease in amounts of WASF1 mRNA was also observed in human AD brains, suggesting clinical relevance of the negative feedback circuit involved in homeostatic regulation of A\u03b2 production.",

However, the frequency and risk associated with these mutations vary widely. In addition, mutations in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) genes - the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), granulin (GRN) - have also been found to be associated with clinical AD. Here, we conducted targeted resequencing of the exons in genes encoding APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, and MAPT in 183 individuals from families with four or more affected relatives, presumed to be AD, and living in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. We then performed linkage and family-based association analyses in carrier families, and genotyped 498 similarly aged unrelated controls from the same ethnic background. Twelve potentially pathogenic mutations were found to be associated with disease in 53 individuals in the five genes. The most frequently observed mutation was the p.Gly206Ala variant in PSEN1 present in 30 (57%) of those sequenced. In the combined linkage and association analyses several rare variants were associated with dementia. In Caribbean Hispanics with familial AD, potentially pathogenic variants were present in 29.2%, four were novel mutations, while eight had been previously observed.

In recent years, genes encoding components of the retromer coat complex and members of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (Vps10) family of receptors, which play pleiotropic functions in protein trafficking and intracellular/intercellular signaling in neuronal and non-neuronal cells and are primary cargos of the retromer complex, have been implicated as genetic risk factors for sporadic and autosomal dominant forms of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In addition to their functions in protein trafficking, the members of the Vps10 receptor family (sortilin, SorL1, SorCS1, SorCS2, and SorCS3) modulate neurotrophic signaling pathways. Both sortilin and SorCS2 act as cell surface receptors to mediate acute responses to proneurotrophins. In addition, sortilin can modulate the intracellular response to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by direct control of BDNF levels and regulating anterograde trafficking of Trk receptors to the synapse.

There is a substantial genetic contribution to memory performance through life span. A recent study has implicated RbAp48, which mediates its effect on age-related memory decline by interacting with cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB)1 binding protein and influencing this histone acetylation pathway. To validate these findings, we tested whether genetic variants in RbAp48, CREB1, and CREBBP are associated with memory performance in 3 independent data sets consisting of 2674 cognitively healthy elderly individuals. Genetic variant rs2526690 in the CREBBP gene was significantly associated with episodic memory performance (pmeta\u00a0= 3.7\u00a0\u00d7 10(-4)) in a multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E status.

The development of array technologies has helped to identify rare recessive mutations among long runs of homozygosity (ROHs), in which both parental alleles are identical. Caribbean Hispanics are known to have an elevated risk for AD and tend to have large families with evidence of inbreeding. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the late-onset AD in a Caribbean Hispanic population might be explained in part by the homozygosity of unknown loci that could harbor recessive AD risk haplotypes or pathologic mutations. DESIGN We used genome-wide array data to identify ROHs (&gt;1 megabase) and conducted global burden and locus-specific ROH analyses. SETTING A whole-genome case-control ROH study. PARTICIPANTS A Caribbean Hispanic data set of 547 unrelated cases (48.8% with familial AD) and 542 controls collected from a population known to have a 3-fold higher risk of AD vs non-Hispanics in the same community. Based on a Structure program analysis, our data set consisted of African Hispanic (207 cases and 192 controls) and European Hispanic (329 cases and 326 controls) participants. EXPOSURE Alzheimer disease risk genes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the total and mean lengths of the ROHs per sample. Global burden measurements among autosomal chromosomes were investigated in cases vs controls. Pools of overlapping ROH segments (consensus regions) were identified, and the case to control ratio was calculated for each consensus region. We formulated the tested hypothesis before data collection. RESULTS In total, we identified 17 137 autosomal regions with ROHs. The mean length of the ROH per person was significantly greater in cases vs controls (P\u2009=\u2009.0039), and this association was stronger with familial AD (P\u2009=\u2009.0005). Among the European Hispanics, a consensus region at the EXOC4 locus was significantly associated with AD even after correction for multiple testing (empirical P value 1 [EMP1], .0001; EMP2, .002; 21 AD cases vs 2 controls). Among the African Hispanic subset, the most significant but nominal association was observed for CTNNA3, a well-known AD gene candidate (EMP1, .002; 10 AD cases vs 0 controls). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results show that ROHs could significantly contribute to the etiology of AD. Future studies would require the analysis of larger, relatively inbred data sets that might reveal novel recessive AD genes. The next step is to conduct sequencing of top significant loci in a subset of samples with overlapping ROHs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Caribbean Region", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hispanic or Latino", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mahdi", "Last Name": "Ghani", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Gertrude H.

Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of A\u03b2 precursor protein processing by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase resulting in altered A\u03b2 production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of \u03b2-secretase 1 and A\u03b2 precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an A\u03b2-degrading enzyme.
