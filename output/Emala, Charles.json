The Anesthesia Research Council aimed to address the status of the anesthesiology physician-scientist pipeline, benchmarked against other medical specialties, and to develop strategic recommendations to sustain and expand the number and diversity of anesthesiology physician-scientists. The working group analyzed data from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the National Resident Matching Program to characterize the diversity and number of research-oriented residents from US and international allopathic medical schools entering 11 medical specialties from 2009 to 2019. Two surveys were developed to assess the research culture of anesthesiology departments. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding information awarded to anesthesiology physician-scientists and departments was collected from NIH RePORTER and the Blue Ridge Medical Institute. Anesthesiology ranked eighth to tenth place of 11 medical specialties in the percent of \"research-oriented\" entering residents, defined as those with advanced degrees (Master's or PhDs) in addition to the MD degree or having published at least 3 research publications before residency. Anesthesiology ranked eighth of 11 specialties in the percent of entering residents who were women but ranked fourth of 11 specialties in the percent of entering residents who self-identified as belonging to an underrepresented group in medicine. There has been a 72% increase in both the total NIH funding awarded to anesthesiology departments and the number of NIH K-series mentored training grants (eg, K08 and K23) awarded to anesthesiology physician-scientists between 2015 and 2020. Recommendations for expanding the size and diversity of the anesthesiology physician-scientist pipeline included (1) developing strategies to increase the number of research intensive anesthesiology departments; (2) unifying the diverse programs among academic anesthesiology foundations and societies that seek to grow research in the specialty; (3) adjusting American Society of Anesthesiologists metrics of success to include the number of anesthesiology physician-scientists with extramural research support; (4) increasing the number of mentored awards from Foundation of Anesthesia Education and Research (FAER) and International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS); (5) supporting an organized and concerted effort to inform research-oriented medical students of the diverse research opportunities within anesthesiology should include the specialty being represented at the annual meetings of Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) students and the American Physician Scientist Association, as well as in institutional MSTP programs. The medical specialty of anesthesiology is defined by new discoveries and contributions to perioperative medicine which will only be sustained by a robust pipeline of anesthesiology physician-scientists.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["United States", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Anesthesiology", "Anesthesia", "Physicians", "Awards and Prizes", "Benchmarking"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Vivianne L", "Last Name": "Tawfik", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California."}, {"First Name": "Meghan B", "Last Name": "Lane-Fall", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Paloma", "Last Name": "Toledo", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine, and Pain Management, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia A", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Des Moines, Iowa."}, {"First Name": "Monica S", "Last Name": "Vavilala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Lee A", "Last Name": "Fleisher", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "PubDate": "2023Oct01"}, {"PMID": "37418196", "Title": "Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel Spiro Imidazobenzodiazepines to Identify Improved Inhaled Bronchodilators.", "Abstract": "Novel gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR) ligands structurally related to imidazobenzodiazepine MIDD0301 were synthesized using spiro-amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs).

Thus far, the roles of these ectopic epithelial cells in alveolar regeneration remain controversial. Here, we confirm that the ectopic tuft cells are originated from EBCs in mouse models and COVID-19 lungs. The differentiation of tuft cells from EBCs is promoted by Wnt inhibition while suppressed by Notch inhibition. Although progenitor functions have been suggested in other organs, pulmonary tuft cells don't proliferate or give rise to other cell lineages. Consistent with previous reports, Trp63CreERT2 and KRT5-CreERT2-labeled ectopic EBCs do not exhibit alveolar regeneration potential. Intriguingly, when tamoxifen was administrated post-viral infection, Trp63CreERT2 but not KRT5-CreERT2 labels islands of alveolar epithelial cells that are negative for EBC biomarkers. Furthermore, germline deletion of Trpm5 significantly increases the contribution of Trp63CreERT2-labeled cells to the alveolar epithelium.

Several studies have described the pharmacokinetics of gingerols and shogaols in humans following the oral ingestion of ginger, while little was known about the metabolism of these components in humans, particularly in patients with asthma. In this study, a dietary supplement of 1.0 g of ginger root extract was administered to asthma patients twice daily for 56 days and serum samples were drawn at 0.5-8 h on days 0, 28, and 56. The metabolic profiles of gingerols and shogaols in human plasma and the kinetic changes of gingerols, shogaols, and their metabolites in asthma patients collected on the three different visits were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Ketone reduction was the major metabolic pathway of both gingerols and shogaols. Gingerdiols were identified as the major metabolites of 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols. M11 and M9 were identified as the double-bond reduction and both the double-bond and ketone reduction metabolites of 6-shogaol, respectively. Cysteine conjugation was another major metabolic pathway of 6-shogaol in asthma patients, and two cysteine-conjugated 6-shogaol, M1 and M2, were identified as the major metabolites of 6-shogaol. Furthermore, gingerols, shogaols, and their metabolites were quantitated in the human serum collected at different time points during each of the three visits using a very sensitive high-resolution LC-MS method. The results showed that one-third of 6-gingerol was metabolized to produce its reduction metabolites, 6-gingerdiols, and more than 90% of 6-shogaol was metabolized to its phase I and cysteine-conjugated metabolites, suggesting the importance of considering the contribution of these metabolites to the bioavailability and health beneficial effects of gingerols and shogaols. All gingerols, shogaols, and their metabolites reached their peak concentrations in less than 2 h, and their half-lives (t1/2) were from 0.6 to 2.4 h.

Various GABAAR (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor) activators, including benzodiazepines, relax ASM. The GABAAR is a ligand-operated Cl- channel best known for its role in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Although ASM cells express GABAARs, affording a seemingly logical site of action, the mechanism(s) by which GABAAR ligands relax ASM remains unclear. PI320, a novel imidazobenzodiazepine designed for tissue selectivity, is a promising asthma drug candidate. Here, we show that PI320 alleviates methacholine (MCh)-induced bronchoconstriction in\u00a0vivo and relaxes peripheral airways preconstricted with MCh ex vivo using the forced oscillation technique and precision-cut lung slice experiments, respectively. Surprisingly, the peripheral airway relaxation demonstrated in precision-cut lung slices does not appear to be GABAAR-dependent, as it is not inhibited by the GABAAR antagonist picrotoxin or the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Furthermore, we demonstrate here that PI320 inhibits MCh-induced airway constriction in the absence of external Ca2, suggesting that PI320-mediated relaxation is not mediated by inhibition of Ca2+ influx in ASM. However, PI320 does inhibit MCh-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in peripheral ASM, a key mediator of contraction that is dependent on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ mobilization. Furthermore, PI320 inhibits peripheral airway constriction induced by experimentally increasing the intracellular concentration of inositol triphosphate (IP3). These novel data suggest that PI320 relaxes murine peripheral airways by inhibiting intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in ASM, likely by inhibiting Ca2+ release through IP3Rs (IP3 receptors).", "Keywords": ["GABAA receptor", "IP3 receptor", "asthma", "benzodiazepine", "precision-cut lung slice"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Calcium", "Calcium Signaling", "Flumazenil", "Inositol", "Ligands", "Lung", "Methacholine Chloride", "Mice", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle, Smooth", "Picrotoxin", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jose F", "Last Name": "Perez-Zoghbi", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Dannah Rae", "Last Name": "Sajorda", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Daniel A", "Last Name": "Webb", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and."}, {"First Name": "Leggy A", "Last Name": "Arnold", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York; and."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2022Oct"}, {"PMID": "35246861", "Title": "Comparative pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic study of MIDD0301 and its (S) enantiomer.", "Abstract": "MIDD0301 is being developed as an oral drug to relax airway smooth muscle (ASM) and reduce lung inflammation in asthma.

We developed PI310 with a 6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl chain as used in the long-acting \u03b22-agonist salmeterol and PI320 with a poly(ethylene glycol) chain as used to improve the brain:plasma ratio of naloxegol, a naloxone analogue. Both imidazodiazepines showed affinity toward the GABAAR binding site of clonazepam, with IC50 values of 576 and 242 nM, respectively. Molecular docking analysis, using the available \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32 GABAAR structural data, suggests binding of the diazepine core between the \u03b11+/\u03b32- interface, whereas alkyl substituents are located outside the binding site and thus interact with the protein surface and solvent molecules. The physicochemical properties of these compounds are very different. The solubility of PI310 is low in water. PEGylation of PI320 significantly improves aqueous solubility and cell permeability. Neither compound is toxic in HEK293 cells following exposure at >300 \u03bcM for 18 h. Ex vivo studies using guinea pig tracheal rings showed that PI310 was unable to relax the constricted airway smooth muscle. In contrast, PI320 induced muscle relaxation at organ bath concentrations as low as 5 \u03bcM, with rapid onset (15 min) at 25 \u03bcM. PI320 also reduced airway hyper-responsiveness in vivo in a mouse model of steroid-resistant lung inflammation induced by intratracheal challenge with INF\u03b3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At nebulized doses of 7.2 mg/kg, PI320 and albuterol were equally effective in reducing airway hyper-responsiveness.

Numerous physiological effects of melatonin are mediated via its specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) named the MT1 receptor, which couples to both Gq and Gi proteins, and the MT2 receptor, which couples to Gi. We investigated whether melatonin receptors are expressed on airway smooth muscle; whether they regulate intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), which modulate airway smooth muscle tone; and whether they promote airway smooth muscle cell proliferation. We detected the mRNA and protein expression of the melatonin MT2 but not the MT1 receptor in native human and guinea pig airway smooth muscle and cultured human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Activation of melatonin MT2 receptors with either pharmacological concentrations of melatonin (10-100 \u00b5M) or the nonselective MT1/MT2 agonist ramelteon (10 \u00b5M) significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HASM cells, which was reversed by the G\u03b1i protein inhibitor pertussis toxin or knockdown of the MT2 receptor by its specific siRNA. Although melatonin by itself did not induce an initial [Ca2+]i increase and airway contraction, melatonin significantly potentiated acetylcholine-stimulated [Ca2+]i increases, stress fiber formation through the MT2 receptor in HASM cells, and attenuated the relaxant effect of isoproterenol in guinea pig trachea.

It is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway remodeling, and pathologic bronchoconstriction, and it poses a continuous treatment challenge with very few new therapeutics available. Thus, many asthmatics turn to plant-based complementary products, including ginger, for better symptom control, indicating an unmet need for novel therapies. Previously, we demonstrated that 6-shogaol (6S), the primary bioactive component of ginger, relaxes human airway smooth muscle (hASM) likely by inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the \u03b2-adrenergic (cyclic nucleotide PDEs), and muscarinic (phospholipase C, PLC) receptor pathways. However, oral 6S is extensively metabolized and it is unknown if the resulting metabolites remain bioactive. Here, we screened all the known human metabolites of 6S and several metabolite-based synthetic derivatives to better understand their mechanism of action and structure-function relationships. We demonstrate that several metabolites and metabolite-based synthetic derivatives are able to prevent Gq-coupled stimulation of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) synthesis by inhibiting PLC, similar to the parent compound 6S. We also show that these compounds prevent recontraction of ASM after \u03b2-agonist relaxation likely by inhibiting PDEs. Furthermore, they potentiate isoproterenol-induced relaxation. Importantly, moving beyond cell-based assays, metabolites also retain the functional ability to relax Gq-coupled-contractions in upper (human) and lower (murine) airways. The current study indicates that, although oral ginger may be metabolized rapidly, it retains physiological activity through its metabolites.

We then demonstrated colocalization of OPN3 and G\u03b1s using co-IP and proximity ligation assays in primary human ASM cells, which was further supported by an increase in cAMP in mouse trachea treated with blue light compared with dark controls (23\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6 vs. 14\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6 pmol cAMP/ring, P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Using mice genetically lacking gelsolin, we evaluated the role of gelsolin in the establishment of house dust mite (HDM) antigen-induced allergic lung inflammation. The genetic absence of gelsolin was found to be protective against HDM sensitization, resulting in reduced lung inflammation, inflammatory cytokines, and Muc5AC protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and interstitial macrophages in the BAL were increased after HDM sensitization in wild-type mice but were attenuated in gelsolin-null mice. The observed attenuation of inflammation may be partly due to delayed migration of immune cells, because the reduced eosinophils in the BALs from gelsolin-null mice compared with controls occurred despite similar amounts of the chemoattractant eotaxin. Splenic T cells demonstrated similar proliferation rates, but ex vivo alveolar macrophage migration was delayed in gelsolin-null mice.

Ginger, a natural product that we previously demonstrated acutely relaxes airway smooth muscle (ASM), has long been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties, although a precise mechanistic understanding is lacking. In these studies, we demonstrate that chronic administration of whole ginger extract or 6-shogaol, a bioactive component of ginger, mitigates in vivo house dust mite antigen-mediated lung inflammation in mice. We further show that this decrease in inflammation is associated with reduced in vivo airway responsiveness. Utilizing in vitro studies, we demonstrate that 6-shogaol augments cAMP concentrations in CD4 cells, consistent with phosphodiesterase inhibition, and limits the induction of nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in activated CD4 cells.

However, it is unknown whether BAs also affect airway reactivity. We investigated the acute effects of 13 BAs detected in post-lung-transplant surveillance bronchial washings (BW) on airway contraction. We exposed precision-cut slices from human and mouse lungs to BAs and monitored dynamic changes in the cross-sectional luminal area of peripheral airways using video phase-contrast microscopy. We also used guinea pig tracheal rings in organ baths to study BA effects in proximal airway contraction induced by electrical field stimulation. We found that most secondary BAs at low micromolar concentrations strongly and reversibly relaxed smooth muscle and inhibited peripheral airway constriction induced by acetylcholine but not by noncholinergic bronchoconstrictors. Similarly, secondary BAs strongly inhibited cholinergic constrictions in tracheal rings. In contrast, TC-G 1005, a specific agonist of the BA receptor Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), did not cause airway relaxation, and Tgr5 deletion in knockout mice did not affect BA-induced relaxation, suggesting that this receptor is not involved. BAs inhibited acetylcholine-induced inositol phosphate synthesis in human airway smooth muscle cells overexpressing the muscarinic M3 receptor.

Although pro- and anti-inflammatory adipocytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma in obesity, the mechanistic basis for the relationship between asthma and obesity remains unclear. In obese individuals, the increased amount of adipose tissue results in the release of more long-chain free fatty acids as compared to lean individuals, causing an elevation in plasma long-chain free fatty acid concentrations. Recent findings suggest that the free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1), which is a sensor of medium- and long-chain free fatty acids, is expressed on airway smooth muscle and plays a pivotal role in airway contraction and airway smooth muscle cell proliferation. In contrast, FFAR4, which is a sensor for long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and also expressed on airway smooth muscle, does not contribute to airway contraction and airway smooth muscle cell proliferation. Functional roles for short-chain fatty acid receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3 in the pathogenesis of asthma is still under debate.

We now questioned whether a peptide that corresponds to the PIP2 binding region of gelsolin could modulate ASM signaling and contraction.

Pharmacodynamically, transmembrane currents of ex vivo CD4+ T cells from asthmatic mice were potentiated by MIDD0301 in the presence of GABA. The number of CD4+ T cells observed in the lung of MIDD0301-treated mice were reduced by an oral treatment of 20 mg/kg b.i.d. for 5 days. A half-life of almost 14 h was demonstrated by pharmacokinetic studies (PK) with no adverse CNS effects when treated mice were subjected to sensorimotor studies using the rotarod. PK studies also confirmed very low brain distribution. In conclusion, MIDD0301 represents a safe and improved oral asthma drug candidate that relaxes airway smooth muscle and attenuates inflammation in the lung leading to a reduction of AHR at a dosage lower than earlier reported GABAAR ligands.", "Keywords": ["GABAA receptor", "MIDD0301", "airway hyperresponsiveness", "airway inflammation", "asthma", "imidazobenzodiazepine"], "MeSH terms":

influences airway hyperresponsiveness, which is in part modulated by airway smooth muscle proliferative remodeling. Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) levels are elevated in obese individuals, and long-chain FFAs act as endogenous ligands for the free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1), which couples to both Gq and Gi proteins. We examined whether stimulation of FFAR1 induces airway smooth muscle cell proliferation through classical MEK/ERK and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. The long-chain FFAs (oleic acid and linoleic acid) and a FFAR1 agonist (GW9508) induced human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cell proliferation, which was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor U0126 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 . The long-chain FFAs and GW9508 increased phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, and p70S6K in HASM cells and freshly isolated rat airway smooth muscle. Downregulation of FFAR1 in HASM cells by siRNA significantly attenuated oleic acid-induced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. Oleic acid-induced ERK phosphorylation was blocked by either the G\u03b1i-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin or U0126 and was partially inhibited by either the G\u03b1q-specific inhibitor YM-254890 or the G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling inhibitor gallein. Oleic acid significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP activity, which was attenuated by pertussis toxin. Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by pertussis toxin, the ras inhibitor manumycin A, the Src inhibitor PP1, or LY294002 . Phosphorylation of p70S6K by oleic acid or GW9508 was significantly inhibited by LY294002 , U0126, and the mammalian target of rapamycin\u00a0(mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin.

The cell-penetrating peptide trans-activator of transcription (TAT) is a candidate carrier molecule that could mediate such specificity for brain tumor chemotherapeutics. To test this hypothesis we first performed in vitro studies testing the uptake of TAT by one primary and three potentially metastatic brain cancer cell lines (9L, 4T-1, LLC, SKOV-3). Then we performed in vivo studies in a rat model where TAT was delivered either intra-arterially (IA) or intravenously (IV) to 9L brain tumors. We observed robust uptake of TAT by all tumor cell lines in vitro. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed a rapid uptake of fluorescein-labeled TAT within 5\u00a0min of exposure to the cancer cells. IA injections done under transient cerebral hypoperfusion (TCH) generated a four-fold greater tumor TAT concentration compared to conventional IV injections.

Many anesthetics potentiate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR) activation, and these receptors are expressed on multiple subtypes of immune cells, providing a potential mechanistic link. Like immune cells, airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells also express GABAARs, particularly isoforms containing \u03b14-subunits, and activation of these receptors leads to ASM relaxation. We sought to determine if GABAAR signaling modulates the ASM contractile and inflammatory phenotype of a murine allergic asthma model utilizing GABAAR \u03b14-subunit global knockout (KO; Gabra40/0 ) mice. Wild-type (WT) and Gabra4 KO mice were sensitized with house dust mite (HDM) antigen or exposed to PBS intranasally 5 days/wk for 3 wk. Ex vivo tracheal rings from HDM-sensitized WT and Gabra4 KO mice exhibited similar magnitudes of acetylcholine-induced contractile force and isoproterenol-induced relaxation (P = not significant; n = 4). In contrast, in vivo airway resistance (flexiVent) was significantly increased in Gabra4 KO mice (P < 0.05, n = 8). Moreover, the Gabra4 KO mice demonstrated increased eosinophilic lung infiltration (P < 0.05; n = 4) and increased markers of lung T-cell activation/memory (CD62L low, CD44 high; P < 0.01, n = 4). In vitro, Gabra4 KO CD4+ cells produced increased cytokines and exhibited increased proliferation after stimulation of the T-cell receptor as compared with WT CD4+ cells. These data suggest that the GABAAR \u03b14-subunit plays a role in immune cell function during allergic lung sensitization. Thus GABAAR \u03b14-subunit-specific agonists have the therapeutic potential to treat asthma via two mechanisms: direct ASM relaxation and inhibition of airway inflammation.", "Keywords": ["eosinophil", "flexiVent", "house dust mite antigen", "lymphocyte", "organ bath"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Line", "Disease Models, Animal", "Lung", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Pneumonia", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Th2 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York; gty2102@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Damian L", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Danielsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew B", "Last Name": "Barajas", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dingbang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Neil L", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gregg E", "Last Name": "Homanics", "Affiliation": "Departments of Anesthesiology, Neurobiology, and Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a nonselective cation channel expressed on airway nerve fibers that modulates afferent signals, resulting in cough, and potentially bronchoconstriction. In the present study, the TRPV1 transcript was detected by RT-PCR in primary cultured human ASM cells, and the TRPV1 protein was detected in ASM of human trachea by immunohistochemistry. Proximity ligation assays suggest that TRPV1 is expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of human ASM cells in close association with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-2. In guinea pig tracheal ring organ bath experiments, the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin led to ASM contraction, but this contraction was significantly attenuated by the sodium channel inhibitor bupivacaine (n = 4, P < 0.05) and the neurokinin-2 receptor antagonist GR-159897 (n = 4, P < 0.05), suggesting that this contraction is neutrally mediated. However, pretreatment of guinea pig and human ASM in organ bath experiments with the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited the maintenance phase of an acetylcholine-induced contraction (n = 4, P < 0.01 for both species). Similarly, capsazepine inhibited methacholine-induced contraction of peripheral airways in mouse precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) experiments (n = 4-5, P < 0.05).

However, the cellular mechanisms are not well understood. Gelsolin is a calcium-activated actin-severing and -capping protein found in many cell types, including ASM cells. Gelsolin also binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, making this substrate less available for phospholipase C\u03b2-mediated hydrolysis to inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. We hypothesized that gelsolin plays a critical role in ASM relaxation and mechanistically accounts for relaxation by ligands that transiently increase [Ca2+]i. Isolated tracheal rings from gelsolin knockout (KO) mice showed impaired relaxation to both a \u03b2-agonist and chloroquine, a bitter taste receptor agonist, which relaxes ASM, despite inducing transiently increased [Ca2+]i. A single inhalation of methacholine increased lung resistance to a similar extent in wild-type and gelsolin KO mice, but the subsequent spontaneous relaxation was less in gelsolin KO mice. In ASM cells derived from gelsolin KO mice, serotonin-induced Gq-coupled activation increased both [Ca2+]i and inositol triphosphate synthesis to a greater extent compared to cells from wild-type mice, possibly due to the absence of gelsolin binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Single-cell analysis showed higher filamentous:globular actin ratio at baseline and slower cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics in gelsolin KO cells. Gelsolin KO ASM cells also showed an attenuated decrease in cell stiffness to chloroquine and flufenamic acid.

Novel GABA(A)R-positive allosteric modulators designed for enhanced \u03b14/\u03b16 subunit selectivity were synthesized using iterative computational analyses (CMD-45 and XHe-III-74). Studies using oocyte heterologous expression systems confirmed that CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 led to significantly greater augmentation of currents induced by a 3% maximal effective concentration (EC3) of GABA [EC3]-induced currents in oocytes expressing \u03b14 or \u03b16 subunits (along with \u03b23 and \u03b32) compared with other \u03b1 subunits. CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 also led to greater ex vivo relaxation of contracted wild-type mouse tracheal rings compared with tracheal rings from GABA(A)R \u03b14 subunit (Gabra4) knockout mice. Furthermore, CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 significantly relaxed precontracted human ASM ex vivo, and, at a low concentration, both ligands led to a significant leftward shift in albuterol-mediated ASM relaxation. In vivo, inhaled XHe-III-74 reduced respiratory system resistance in an asthmatic mouse model. Pretreatment of human ASM cells with CMD-45 and XHe-III-74 inhibited histamine-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations in vitro, an effect that was lost when calcium was omitted from the extracellular buffer, suggesting that inhibition of calcium influx due to alterations in plasma membrane potential may play a role in the mechanism of ASM relaxation. Selective targeting of the GABA(A)R \u03b14 subunit with inhaled ligands may be a novel therapeutic pathway to treat bronchoconstriction, while avoiding sedative central nervous system effects, which are largely mediated by \u03b11-3 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs in the brain.", "Keywords": ["CMD-45", "GABAA receptor", "XHe-III-74", "asthma", "flexiVent"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Bronchoconstriction", "Calcium", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Muscle, Smooth", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Trachea", "Xenopus laevis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gene T", "Last Name": "Yocum", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Gallos", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rajwana", "Last Name": "Jahan", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "Michael Rajesh", "Last Name": "Stephen", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "Zdravko", "Last Name": "Varagic", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Molecular Neurosciences, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Roshan", "Last Name": "Puthenkalam", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Molecular Neurosciences, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Margot", "Last Name": "Ernst", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Molecular Neurosciences, Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2016Apr"}, {"PMID": "26342087", "Title": "Novel identification of the free fatty acid receptor FFAR1 that promotes contraction in airway smooth muscle.", "Abstract": "Obesity is one of the major risk factors for asthma. Previous studies have demonstrated that free fatty acid levels are elevated in the plasma of obese individuals. Medium- and long-chain free fatty acids act as endogenous ligands for the free fatty acid receptors FFAR1/GPR40 and FFAR4/GPR120, which couple to Gq proteins. We investigated whether FFAR1 and FFAR4 are expressed on airway smooth muscle and whether they activate Gq-coupled signaling and modulate airway smooth muscle tone. We detected the protein expression of FFAR1 and FFAR4 in freshly dissected native human and guinea pig airway smooth muscle and cultured human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The long-chain free fatty acids (oleic acid and linoleic acid) and GW9508 (FFAR1/FFAR4 dual agonist) dose-dependently stimulated transient intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) increases and inositol phosphate synthesis in HASM cells. Downregulation of FFAR1 or FFAR4 in HASM cells by small interfering RNA led to a significant inhibition of the long-chain free fatty acids-induced transient [Ca(2+)]i increases. Oleic acid, linoleic acid, or GW9508 stimulated stress fiber formation in HASM cells, potentiated acetylcholine-contracted guinea pig tracheal rings, and attenuated the relaxant effect of isoproterenol after an acetylcholine-induced contraction. In contrast, TUG-891 (FFAR4 agonist) did not induce the stress fiber formation or potentiate acetylcholine-induced contraction.

Currently, there are only a few medications available that inhibit mucus production. Previous studies showed that glycyrrhizin, a triterpenoid in Glycyrrhiza uralensis inhibits mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) mRNA and protein expression. Other potential mucus production inhibitory compounds contained within in G.\u2009uralensis have not been fully investigated. The aim of the present study was to determine if the G.\u2009uralensis flavonoid 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone (7,4'-DHF) inhibits MUC5AC gene expression, mucus production, and secretion, and if so, to elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition. 7,4'-Dihydroxyflavone significantly decreased phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated NCI-H292 human airway epithelial cell MUC5AC gene expression and mucus production, at a 28-fold lower concentration than glycyrrhizin (The half maximal inhibitory concentration IC50 value of 1.4\u2009\u03bcM vs 38\u2009\u03bcM, respectively); 7,4'-DHF also inhibited MUC5AC mucus secretion. Inhibition was associated with the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation, and enhanced histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) expression. In a murine model of asthma, 7,4'-DHF-treated mice exhibited a marked reduction in MUC5AC secretion in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with control mice. These findings, together with previous findings linking NF-\u03baB, STAT6, and HDAC2 modulation to the control of MUC5AC expression, demonstrate that 7,4'-DHF is a newly identified component of G.\u2009uralensis that regulates MUC5AC expression and secretion via regulation of NF-\u03baB, STAT6, and HDAC2.", "Keywords": ["Glycyrrhiza uralensis", "MTT", "NCI-H292", "bronchoalveolar lavage", "immunoblot", "ovalbumin"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Cell Line", "Disease Models, Animal", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Flavonoids", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glycyrrhiza uralensis", "Histone Deacetylase 2", "Humans", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mucin 5AC", "Mucus", "NF-kappa B", "STAT6 Transcription Factor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Changda", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Weir", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Busse", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhenwen", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiu-Min", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Phytotherapy research : PTR", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "25747964", "Title": "Hyaluronan mediates airway hyperresponsiveness in oxidative lung injury.", "Abstract": "Chlorine (Cl2) inhalation induces severe oxidative lung injury and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) that lead to asthmalike symptoms.

The initial screen of this compound library identified 4 of 20 compounds that relaxed a tetraethylammonium chloride-induced contraction in guinea pig tracheal rings. The two most effective compounds, compounds 1 and 13, were further studied for their potential to either prevent the initiation of or relax the maintenance phase of an acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction or to potentiate \u03b2-agonist-mediated relaxation. Both relaxed an established ACh-induced contraction in human and guinea pig ex vivo ASM. In contrast, the prevention of an ACh-induced contraction required copretreatment with the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter blocker bumetanide. The combination of compound 13 and bumetanide also potentiated relaxation by the \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol in guinea pig tracheal rings.

A 37.5-fold greater amount of mRNA encoding GAD 67 was detected in human epithelium vs. airway smooth muscle cells. HPLC confirmed that guinea pig airways with intact epithelium have a higher constitutive elution of GABA under basal or KCl-depolarized conditions compared with epithelium-denuded airway rings. Inhibition of GABA transporters significantly suppressed KCl-mediated release of GABA from epithelium-intact airways, but tetrodotoxin was without effect. The presence of intact epithelium had a significant GABAergic-mediated prorelaxant effect on the maintenance of contractile tone. Airway epithelium is a predominant cellular source of endogenous GABA in the airway and contributes significant prorelaxant GABA effects on airway smooth muscle force.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylcholine", "Animals", "Cholinergic Agonists", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "GABA Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "GABA Uptake Inhibitors", "Gene Expression", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "Guinea Pigs", "Humans", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle Relaxation", "Muscle Tonus", "Muscle, Smooth", "Organ Culture Techniques", "RNA, Messenger", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Tetrodotoxin", "Trachea", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Gallos", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 622 W. 168 St., P&S Box 46, New York, NY 10032, USA. gg2125@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Townsend", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Yim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laszlo", "Last Name": "Virag", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dingbang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Many patients report using alternative therapies to self-treat asthma symptoms as adjuncts to short-acting and long-acting \u03b2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). As many as 40% of patients with asthma use herbal therapies to manage asthma symptoms, often without proven efficacy or known mechanisms of action. Therefore, investigations of both the therapeutic and possible detrimental effects of isolated components of herbal treatments on the airway are important. We hypothesized that ginger and its active components induce bronchodilation by modulating intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) in airway smooth muscle (ASM). In isolated human ASM, ginger caused significant and rapid relaxation. Four purified constituents of ginger were subsequently tested for ASM relaxant properties in both guinea pig and human tracheas: [6]-gingerol, [8]-gingerol, and [6]-shogaol induced rapid relaxation of precontracted ASM (100-300 \u03bcM), whereas [10]-gingerol failed to induce relaxation. In human ASM cells, exposure to [6]-gingerol, [8]-gingerol, and [6]-shogaol, but not [10]-gingerol (100 \u03bcM), blunted subsequent Ca(2+) responses to bradykinin (10 \u03bcM) and S-(-)-Bay K 8644 (10 \u03bcM). In A/J mice, the nebulization of [8]-gingerol (100 \u03bcM), 15 minutes before methacholine challenge, significantly attenuated airway resistance, compared with vehicle. Taken together, these novel data show that ginger and its isolated active components, [6]-gingerol, [8]-gingerol, and [6]-shogaol, relax ASM, and [8]-gingerol attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness, in part by altering [Ca(2+)](i) regulation. These purified compounds may provide a therapeutic option alone or in combination with accepted therapeutics, including \u03b2(2)-agonists, in airway diseases such as asthma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bradykinin", "Calcium", "Cells, Cultured", "Cricetinae", "Zingiber officinale", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Male", "Methacholine Chloride", "Muscle Relaxation", "Muscle, Smooth", "Plant Extracts", "Trachea"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Townsend", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, 650 West 168th Street, Black Building 7-713, New York, NY 10032, USA. et2413@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Matthew E", "Last Name": "Siviski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carrie", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bhupinder", "Last Name": "Hoonjan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
