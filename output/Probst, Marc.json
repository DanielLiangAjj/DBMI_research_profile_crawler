Substantial costs are attributed to care of patients with syncope. Current challenges include differentiating syncope from its mimickers, identifying serious underlying conditions that caused the syncope, and wide variations in current management. While validated risk tools exist especially for short-term prognosis, there is inconsistent application, and the current approach does not meet the patient needs/expectations. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning methods including natural language processing can potentially address the current challenges in syncope management. Preliminary evidence from published studies indicates that it is possible to accurately differentiate syncope from its mimickers and predict short-term prognosis/ hospitalization. More recently AI analysis of ECG has shown promise in detection of serious structural and functional cardiac abnormalities which has the potential to improve syncope care. Future AI studies have the potential to address current issues in syncope management. AI can automatically prognosticate risk in real time by accessing traditional and non-traditional data. However, steps to mitigate known problems such generalizability, patient privacy, data protection, and liability will be needed. In the past AI has had limited impact due to underdeveloped analytical methods, lack of computing power, poor access to powerful computing systems, and availability of reliable high-quality data. All impediments except data have been solved. AI will live up to its promise to transform syncope care if the health care system can satisfy AI requirement of large scale, robust, accurate, and reliable data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Venkatesh", "Last Name": "Thiruganasambandamoorthy", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

We conducted a prospective, observational study on a convenience sample of 821 patients who underwent ACS evaluation at a high-volume, urban ED. We determined the diagnostic performance of a novel velocity-based algorithm and compared the performance of 1- and 2-hour algorithms adapted from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) using delta versus velocity. A total of 7 of 332 patients (2.1%) classified as low risk by the velocity-based algorithm experienced a MACE by 30\u00a0days compared with 35 of 221 (13.8%) of patients classified as greater than low risk, yielding a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68.6% to 93.0%) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.9% (95% CI 95.9% to 98.9%).

The NPV of the novel velocity-based algorithm for MACE at 30\u00a0days was borderline, but the substitution of troponin velocity for delta in the framework of the ESC algorithms performed well.

These results are then used to develop evidence-based clinical pathways, clinical decision instruments, and clinical practice guidelines. Despite the validation of these results in subsequent studies, with some demonstrating improved outcomes, their actual use is often limited. This article outlines a research agenda to promote the dissemination and implementation (also known as knowledge translation) of evidence-based interventions for emergency department (ED) imaging, i.e., clinical pathways, clinical decision instruments, and clinical practice guidelines. We convened a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders and held online and telephone discussions over a 6-month period culminating in an in-person meeting at the 2015 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference. We identified the following four overarching research questions: 1) what determinants (barriers and facilitators) influence emergency physicians' use of evidence-based interventions when ordering imaging in the ED; 2) what implementation strategies at the institutional level can improve the use of evidence-based interventions for ED imaging; 3) what interventions at the health care policy level can facilitate the adoption of evidence-based interventions for ED imaging; and 4) how can health information technology, including electronic health records, clinical decision support, and health information exchanges, be used to increase awareness, use, and adherence to evidence-based interventions for ED imaging? Advancing research that addresses these questions will provide valuable information as to how we can use evidence-based interventions to optimize imaging utilization and ultimately improve patient care.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Clinical Decision-Making", "Consensus Development Conferences as Topic", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Emergency Medicine", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "Evidence-Based Emergency Medicine", "Health Services Research", "Humans", "Interprofessional Relations", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Translational Research, Biomedical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marc A", "Last Name": "Probst", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Peter S", "Last Name": "Dayan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Emergency Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ali S", "Last Name": "Raja", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin H", "Last Name": "Slovis", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kabir", "Last Name": "Yadav", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel H", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn, IL."}, {"First Name": "Jason S", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Coreen", "Last Name": "Farris", "Affiliation": "RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA."}, {"First Name": "Charlene I", "Last Name": "Babcock", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, St. John Hospital and Medical Center, Detroit, MI."}, {"First Name": "Richard T", "Last Name": "Griffey", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Thomas E", "Last Name": "Robey", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Waterbury Hospital, Yale University, New Haven, CT."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Fortin", "Affiliation": "Central Michigan University College of Medicine, Mount Pleasant, MI."}, {"First Name": "Jamlik O", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne T", "Last Name": "Chong", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Moira", "Last Name": "Davenport", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel W", "Last Name": "Grigat", "Affiliation": "Alberta Health Services, Emergency Strategic Clinical Network, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Eddy L", "Last Name": "Lang", "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."}], "Journal": "Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine", "PubDate": "2015Dec"}]
