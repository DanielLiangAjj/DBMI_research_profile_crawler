[{"PMID": "38905110", "Title": "Distinct Localization, Transcriptional Profiles, and Functionality in Early Life Tonsil Regulatory T Cells.", "Abstract": "CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key orchestrators of the immune system, fostering the establishment of protective immunity while preventing deleterious responses. Infancy and childhood are crucial periods of rapid immunologic development, but how Tregs mediate immune responses at these earliest timepoints of human life is poorly understood. In this study, we compare blood and tissue (tonsil) Tregs across pediatric and adult subjects to investigate age-related differences in Treg biology. We observed increased FOXP3 expression and proportions of Tregs in tonsil compared with paired blood samples in children. Within tonsil, early life Tregs accumulated in extrafollicular regions with cellular interactions biased toward CD8+ T cells. Tonsil Tregs in both children and adults expressed transcriptional profiles enriched for lineage defining signatures and canonical functionality compared with blood, suggesting tissue as the primary site of Treg activity. Early life tonsil Tregs transcriptional profiles were further defined by pathways associated with activation, proliferation, and polyfunctionality. Observed differences in pediatric tonsil Treg transcriptional signatures were associated with phenotypic differences, high proliferative capacity, and robust production of IL-10 compared with adult Tregs. These results identify tissue as a major driver of Treg identity, provide new insights into developmental differences in Treg biology across the human lifespan, and demonstrate unique functional properties of early life Tregs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shivali", "Last Name": "Verma", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Marissa C", "Last Name": "Bradley", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Pranay", "Last Name": "Dogra", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Daniel P", "Last Name": "Caron", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Maurrasse", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Eli", "Last Name": "Grunstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Waldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Minyoung", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kalpana", "Last Name": "Pethe", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2024Jun21"}, {"PMID": "38848342", "Title": "Human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in diverse tissues exhibit site-specific maturation dynamics across the life span.", "Abstract": "During ontogeny, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells emerge from the thymus and directly seed peripheral tissues for in situ immunity.

Here, we present longitudinal profiling of immune responses during acute disease and following recovery in children who developed MIS-C, relative to children who experienced more typical symptoms of COVID-19. T cells in acute MIS-C exhibited transient signatures of activation, inflammation, and tissue residency which correlated with cardiac disease severity, while T cells in acute COVID-19 upregulated markers of follicular helper T cells for promoting antibody production. The resultant memory immune response in recovery showed increased frequencies of virus-specific memory T cells with pro-inflammatory functions in children with prior MIS-C compared to COVID-19 while both cohorts generated comparable antibody responses.

PASC is highly heterogenous and may be associated with multisystem tissue damage/dysfunction including acute encephalitis, cardiopulmonary syndromes, fibrosis, hepatobiliary damages, gastrointestinal dysregulation, myocardial infarction, neuromuscular syndromes, neuropsychiatric disorders, pulmonary damage, renal failure, stroke, and vascular endothelial dysregulation. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying PASC is essential to guide prevention and treatment. This review addresses potential mechanisms and hypotheses that connect SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term health consequences. Comparisons between PASC and other virus-initiated chronic syndromes such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome will be addressed. Aligning symptoms with other chronic syndromes and identifying potentially regulated common underlining pathways may be necessary for understanding the true nature of PASC. The discussed contributors to PASC symptoms include sequelae from acute SARS-CoV-2 injury to one or more organs, persistent reservoirs of the replicating virus or its remnants in several tissues, re-activation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr and herpes viruses in COVID-19 immune-dysregulated tissue environment, SARS-CoV-2 interactions with host microbiome/virome communities, clotting/coagulation dysregulation, dysfunctional brainstem/vagus nerve signaling, dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction, ongoing activity of primed immune cells, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between pathogen and host proteins.

We found marked loss of type 2 alveolar epithelial (T2AE) cells and increased perialveolar lymphocyte cytotoxicity in all fatal COVID-19 cases, even at early stages before typical patterns of acute lung injury are histologically apparent. In lungs from uninfected organ donors, there was also progressive loss of T2AE cells with increasing age, which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19-mediated lung damage in older individuals. In the fatal COVID-19 cases, macrophage infiltration differed according to the histopathological pattern of lung injury. In cases with acute lung injury, we found accumulation of CD4+ macrophages that expressed distinctly high levels of T cell activation and costimulation genes and strongly correlated with increased extent of alveolar epithelial cell depletion and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.

Acute cardiac dysfunction and resultant cardiogenic shock are common in children with MIS-C. While most children recover rapidly from acute illness, the long-term impact on the myocardium and cardiac function is unknown. Methods In this prospective study, cardiac MRI (CMR) was performed on patients <21 years of age with a history of MIS-C, 6-9 months following hospitalization. Per institutional protocol, patients with any history of LVEF<50%, persistent cardiorespiratory symptoms, or ECG abnormalities underwent clinical CMR. Research CMRs were offered to all others >10 years old. Native T1 and T2 mapping values were compared with 20 children with normal CMR examinations. Results We performed CMRs on 13 subjects at a median age of 13.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 11.9-16.0) and a median time from hospitalization of 8.2 months (IQR 6.8-9.6). Twelve subjects displayed normal ventricular function with a median left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57.2% (IQR 56.1-58.4) and median right ventricular (RV) EF of 53.1% (IQR 52.0-55.7). One subject had low normal EF (52%). There was normal T2 and native T1 as compared to normal controls. There was qualitatively no evidence of edema by T2 weighted imaging. One subject had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at the inferior insertion point and mid-ventricular inferolateral region, with normal EF, no evidence of edema or perfusion defects, and normal T1 and T2 times. When stratifying by a history of abnormal LVEF (LVEF <55%) on echocardiography, there was no difference in or parametric mapping values, though LVEF and LVEDV approached significance (p=0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Conclusions Although many children with MIS-C present acutely with cardiac dysfunction, myocardial recovery is overall excellent with minimal to no evidence of residual cardiac dysfunction or myocardial involvement. LVEF by CMR at 6-9 months among children with history of echocardiographic LV dysfunction is slightly lower, though does not meet statistical significance and is still within normal range. The long-term functional implications of this finding and the cardiac implications of MIS-C more broadly are unclear and warrant further study.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Dilorenzo", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Kanwal M", "Last Name": "Farooqi", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Amee M", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Channing", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jamie K", "Last Name": "Harrington", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Martirosyan", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Usha S", "Last Name": "Krishnan", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Ferris", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Rachel J", "Last Name": "Weller", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Gorelik", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Erika B", "Last Name": "Rosenzweig", "Affiliation": "cuimc:Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Brett R", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2022Jan24"}, {"PMID": "34890254", "Title": "Infant T cells are developmentally adapted for robust lung immune responses through enhanced T cell receptor signaling.", "Abstract": "Infants require coordinated immune responses to prevent succumbing to multiple infectious challenges during early life, particularly in the respiratory tract.

In this study, we define the integrin adhesome expression profile of NK cells from human tonsil, peripheral blood, and those derived from human hematopoietic precursors through stromal cell coculture systems. We report that the site of cell isolation and NK cell developmental stage dictate differences in expression of adhesome associated genes and proteins. Furthermore, we define differences in cortical actin content associated with differential expression of actin regulating proteins, suggesting that differences in adhesome expression are associated with differences in cortical actin homeostasis.

Patients with CGD also suffer from disorders of inflammation and immune dysregulation including colitis and granulomatous lung disease, among others. Additionally, patients with CGD may be at increased risk of systemic inflammatory disorders such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The presentation of HLH often overlaps with symptoms of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis and therefore can be difficult to identify, especially in patients with a primary immune deficiency in which incidence of infection is increased. Thorough evaluation and empiric treatment for bacterial and fungal infections is necessary as HLH in CGD is almost always secondary to infection. Simultaneous treatment of infection with anti-microbials and inflammation with immunosuppression may be needed to blunt the hyperinflammatory response in secondary HLH. Herein, we present a series of X-linked CGD patients who developed HLH secondary to or with concurrent disseminated CGD-related infection. In two patients, CGD was a known diagnosis prior to development of HLH and in the other two CGD was diagnosed as part of the evaluation for HLH. Concurrent infection and HLH were fatal in three; one case was successfully treated, ultimately receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

These critical processes of T cell recruitment to the respiratory tract, their role in disease pathogenesis, and establishment of local protective immunity remain undefined in pediatric VRTI. In this study, we investigated T cell responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) of infants and young children with VRTI, revealing developmental regulation of T cell differentiation and Trm generation in situ. We show a direct concurrence between T cell responses in the URT and LRT, including a preponderance of effector CD8+ T cells that was associated with disease severity. During infant VRTI, there was an accumulation of terminally differentiated effector cells (effector memory RA+ T cells) in the URT and LRT with reduced Trm in the early neonatal period, and decreased effector memory RA+ T cell and increased Trm formation with age during the early years of childhood. Moreover, human infant T cells exhibit increased expression of the transcription factor T-bet compared with adult T cells, suggesting a mechanism for preferential generation of effector over Trm.

Recent studies show that the T cell response in the lung is important for protective responses to respiratory infections, although details on the infant/pediatric respiratory immune response remain sparse. The objectives of the present study were to characterize the local versus systemic immune response in infants and young children with respiratory failure from viral respiratory tract infections and its association to disease severity. Daily airway secretions were sampled from infants and children 4 years of age and younger receiving mechanical ventilation owing to respiratory failure from viral infection or noninfectious causes. Samples were examined for immune cell composition and markers of T cell activation. These parameters were then correlated with clinical disease severity. Innate immune cells and total CD3(+) T cells were present in similar proportions in airway aspirates derived from infected and uninfected groups; however, the CD8:CD4 T cell ratio was markedly increased in the airways of patients with viral infection compared with uninfected patients, and specifically in infected infants with acute lung injury. T cells in the airways were phenotypically and functionally distinct from those in blood with activated/memory phenotypes and increased cytotoxic capacity. We identified a significant increase in airway cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells in infants with lung injury from viral respiratory tract infection that was distinct from the T cell profile in circulation and associated with increasing disease severity. Airway sampling could therefore be diagnostically informative for assessing immune responses and lung damage.", "Keywords": ["immunopathology", "infant immunity", "lung injury", "viral pneumonia"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Lung Injury", "Age Factors", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Differentiation", "Demography", "Female", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Infant", "Interleukin-6", "Lung", "Lymphocyte Count", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Respiratory Tract Infections"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Thyyar M", "Last Name": "Ravindranath", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Kara L", "Last Name": "Bickham", "Affiliation": "2 Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Claire L", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "2 Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Feifan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York; and Departments of."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Levin", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York; and Departments of."}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Baird", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "2 Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology", "PubDate": "2016Jun"}]
