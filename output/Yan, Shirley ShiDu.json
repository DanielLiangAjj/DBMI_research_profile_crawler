[{"PMID": "38146639", "Title": "New cyclophilin D inhibitor rescues mitochondrial and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer disease and plays a crucial role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Strategies to rescue mitochondrial function and cognition remain to be explored. Cyclophilin D (CypD), the peptidylprolyl isomerase F (PPIase), is a key component in opening the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Blocking membrane permeability transition pore opening by inhibiting CypD activity is a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease. However, there is currently no effective CypD inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, with previous candidates demonstrating high toxicity, poor ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, compromised biocompatibility and low selectivity. Here, we report a new class of non-toxic and biocompatible CypD inhibitor, ebselen, using a conventional PPIase assay to screen a library of \u223c2000 FDA-approved drugs with crystallographic analysis of the CypD-ebselen crystal structure (PDB code: 8EJX). More importantly, we assessed the effects of genetic and pharmacological blockade of CypD on Alzheimer's disease mitochondrial and glycolytic bioenergetics in Alzheimer's disease-derived mitochondrial cybrid cells, an ex vivo human sporadic Alzheimer's disease mitochondrial model, and on synaptic function, inflammatory response and learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Inhibition of CypD by ebselen protects against sporadic Alzheimer's disease- and amyloid-\u03b2-induced mitochondrial and glycolytic perturbation, synaptic and cognitive dysfunction, together with suppressing neuroinflammation in the brain of Alzheimer's disease mouse models, which is linked to CypD-related membrane permeability transition pore formation. Thus, CypD inhibitors have the potential to slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, by boosting mitochondrial bioenergetics and improving synaptic and cognitive function.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "CypD inhibitor", "amyloid beta", "high-throughput screening", "mitochondrial respiratory and glycolytic function"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase F", "Animals", "Mitochondria", "Mice", "Humans", "Cognition", "Azoles", "Cyclophilins", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Male", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Organoselenium Compounds", "Isoindoles"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sourav", "Last Name": "Samanta", "Affiliation": "Division of Surgical Science of Department of Surgery, Columbia University in New York, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Firoz", "Last Name": "Akhter", "Affiliation": "Division of Surgical Science of Department of Surgery, Columbia University in New York, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anuradha", "Last Name": "Roy", "Affiliation": "High Throughput Screening Laboratory, Del M.

We recently found that neurons in the primary visual cortex of an AD mouse model expressing human amyloid protein precursor with the Swedish and Indiana mutations (hAPP mutations) exhibit aberrant c-Fos expression and altered synaptic structures at a pre-amyloid plaque stage. However, it is unclear whether aberrant c-Fos expression and synaptic pathology vary across the broader visual network and to what extent c-Fos abnormality in the cortex is inherited through functional connectivity. Using both sexes of 4-6-month AD model mice with hAPP mutations (J20[PDGF-APPSw, Ind]), we found that cortical regions of the visual network show aberrant c-Fos expression and impaired experience-dependent modulation while subcortical regions do not. Interestingly, the average network-wide functional connectivity strength of a brain region in wild type (WT) mice significantly predicts its aberrant c-Fos expression, which in turn correlates with impaired experience-dependent modulation in the AD model. Using in vivo two-photon and ex vivo imaging of presynaptic termini, we observed a subtle yet selective weakening of excitatory cortical synapses in the visual cortex. Intriguingly, the change in the size distribution of cortical boutons in the AD model is downscaled relative to those in WT mice, suggesting that synaptic weakening may reflect an adaptation to aberrant activity.

Here, we investigate the effect of PITRM1 in an advanced age AD mouse model (up to 19-24\u00a0months) to address the fundamental unexplored question of whether restoration/gain of PITRM1 function protects against mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction associated with A\u03b2 accumulation and whether this protection is maintained even at later ages featuring profound amyloid pathology and synaptic failure. Using newly developed aged PITRM1/A\u03b2-producing AD mice, we first uncovered reduction in PITRM1 expression in AD-affected cortex of AD mice at 19-24\u00a0months of age. Increasing neuronal PITRM1 activity/expression re-established mitochondrial respiration, suppressed reactive oxygen species, improved synaptic function, and reduced loss of synapses even at advanced ages (up to 19-24\u00a0months). Notably, loss of PITRM1 proteolytic activity resulted in A\u03b2 accumulation and failure to rescue mitochondrial and synaptic function, suggesting that PITRM1 activity is required for the degradation and clearance of mitochondrial A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 deposition. These data indicate that augmenting PITRM1 function results in persistent life-long protection against A\u03b2 toxicity in an AD mouse model.

Here, we comprehensively investigate age-related accumulation of AGEs and dicarbonyls, including methylglyoxal (MG), glyoxal (GO), and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), and the effects of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) on cerebral AGEs accumulation, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress in the aging human and mouse brain. We demonstrate that AGEs, including arginine and lysine derived N(6)-carboxymethyl lysine (CML), N\u03b5-(1-Carboxyethyl)-l-lysine (CEL), and methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone-1 (MG-H1), were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus with advanced age in mice.

A\u03b2 formation arises from aberrant cleavage of amyloid pre-cursor protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase. To investigate whether RAGE modulates \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase activity potentiating A\u03b2 formation, we generated mAPP mice with genetic deletion of RAGE (mAPP/RO). These mice displayed reduced cerebral amyloid pathology, inhibited aberrant APP-A\u03b2 metabolism by reducing \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases activity, and attenuated impairment of learning and memory compared with mAPP mice. Similarly, RAGE signal transduction deficient mAPP mice (mAPP/DN-RAGE) exhibited the reduction in A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 production and decreased \u03b2-and \u03b3-secretase activity compared with mAPP mice.

The underlying pathogenic mechanisms and effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that decreased PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) expression is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Restoring neuronal PINK1 function strikingly reduces amyloid-\u03b2 levels, amyloid-associated pathology, oxidative stress, as well as mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction. In contrast, PINK1-deficient mAPP mice augmented cerebral amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation, mitochondrial abnormalities, impairments in learning and memory, as well as synaptic plasticity at an earlier age than mAPP mice. Notably, gene therapy-mediated PINK1 overexpression promotes the clearance of damaged mitochondria by augmenting autophagy signalling via activation of autophagy receptors (OPTN and NDP52), thereby alleviating amyloid-\u03b2-induced loss of synapses and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease mice. Loss of PINK1 activity or blockade of PINK1-mediated signalling (OPTN or NDP52) fails to reverse amyloid-\u03b2-induced detrimental effects. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which PINK1-dependent signalling promotes the rescue of amyloid pathology and amyloid-\u03b2-mediated mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions in a manner requiring activation of autophagy receptor OPTN or NDP52.

Compared to non-AD control cybrids, AD cybrid cells showed synaptic loss which was evidenced by a significant reduction in expression of two synaptic marker proteins: synaptophysin (presynaptic marker) and postsynaptic density protein-95, and neuronal proteins (MAP-2 and NeuN) upon neuronal differentiation. In parallel, AD-mediated synaptic deficits correlate to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as well as activation of p38 MAP kinase. Notably, inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by pharmacological specific p38 inhibitor significantly increased synaptic density, improved mitochondrial function, and reduced oxidative stress. These results suggest that activation of p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway contributes to AD-mediated impairment in neurogenesis, possibly by inhibiting the neuronal differentiation.

Our recent study demonstrated that oxidative stress could further impair mitochondrial function. In the present study, we adopted a transgenic mouse model of AD (mAPP, overexpressing A\u03b2PP/A\u03b2 in neurons) and performed redox measurements using in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging with methoxycarbamyl-proxyl (MCP) as a redox-sensitive probe for studying oxidative stress in an early stage of pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model. Through assessing oxidative stress, mitochondrial function and cognitive behaviors of mAPP mice at the age of 8-9 months, we found that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction appeared in the early onset of AD. Increased ROS levels were associated with defects of mitochondrial and cognitive dysfunction.

However, whether and how NR2B and CypD work together in mediating synaptic injury after ischemia remains elusive. Using an ex vivo ischemia model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in hippocampal slices, we identified a NR2B-dependent mechanism for CypD translocation onto the mitochondrial inner membrane. CypD depletion (CypD null mice) prevented OGD-induced impairment in synaptic transmission recovery. Overexpression of neuronal CypD mice (CypD+) exacerbated OGD-induced loss of synaptic transmission.

The treatment of antioxidant EUK134 to suppress mitochondrial oxidative stress rescued CypD-mediated synaptic dysfunction following OGD in CypD+ slices. Furthermore, OGD provoked the interaction of CypD with P53, which was enhanced in slices overexpressing CypD but was diminished in CypD-null slices. Inhibition of p53 using a specific inhibitor of p53 (pifithrin-\u03bc) attenuated the CypD/p53 interaction following OGD, along with a restored synaptic transmission in both non-Tg and CypD+ hippocampal slices.

Using a cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell model in which mitochondria from MCI or age-matched non-MCI subjects were incorporated into a human neuronal cell line depleted of endogenous mitochondrial DNA, we evaluated the mitochondrial dynamics and functions, as well as the role of oxidative stress in the resultant cybrid lines. We demonstrated that increased expression levels of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) are markedly induced by oxidative stress in MCI-derived mitochondria along with aberrant mitochondrial functions. Inhibition of oxidative stress rescues MCI-impaired mitochondrial fusion/fission balance as shown by the suppression of Mfn2 expression, attenuation of abnormal mitochondrial morphology and distribution, and improvement in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, blockade of MCI-related stress-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling not only attenuates aberrant mitochondrial morphology and function but also restores mitochondrial fission and fusion balance, in particular inhibition of overexpressed Mfn2. Our results provide new insights into the role of the oxidative stress-ERK-Mfn2 signal axis in MCI-related mitochondrial abnormalities, indicating that the MCI phase may be targetable for the development of new therapeutic approaches that improve mitochondrial function in age-related neurodegeneration.", "Keywords": ["Cybrid cells", "ERK", "Free radicals", "Mfn2", "Mild cognitive impairment", "Mitochondrial fission", "Mitochondrial fusion", "Oxidative stress"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cells, Cultured", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Enzyme Activation", "Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases", "Female", "Flavonoids", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Neurons", "Oxidative Stress", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xueqi", "Last Name": "Gan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA; State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Cheng Du 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Long", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shengbin", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA; State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Cheng Du 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Changjia", "Last Name": "Zhong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA."}, {"First Name": "Honglian", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guangyue", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA; State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Cheng Du 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Haiyang", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Cheng Du 610041, China."}, {"First Name": "Russell", "Last Name": "Howard Swerdlow", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Xi Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shirley ShiDu", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.

Two-dimensional (2D) quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods were applied to 40 compounds with known IC50 values. These formed a training set and were followed by a trial set of 20 designed compounds. A correlation analysis was carried out comparing the statistics of the measured IC50 with predicted values for both sets. Selectivity-determining descriptors were interpreted graphically in terms of principle component analyses. These descriptors can be very useful for predicting activity enhancement for lead compounds.

In this study, a series of novel AChE inhibitors were designed and their inhibitory activity was evaluated with 2D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies using a training set of 20 known compounds for which IC\u2085\u2080 values had previously been determined. The QSAR model was calculated based on seven unique descriptors. Model validation was determined by predicting IC\u2085\u2080 values for a test set of 20 independent compounds with measured IC\u2085\u2080 values. A correlation analysis was carried out comparing the statistics of the measured IC\u2085\u2080 values with predicted ones. These selectivity-determining descriptors were interpreted graphically in terms of principal component analyses (PCA). A 3D pharmacophore model was also created based on the activity of the training set. In addition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) descriptors were also determined to evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties. Finally, molecular docking of these novel molecules into the AChE binding domain indicated that three molecules (6c, 7c, and 7h) should have significantly higher affinities and solvation energies than the known standard drug donepezil. The docking studies of 2H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidines (6a-6j) and 5H-thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidines (7a-7j) with human AChE have demonstrated that these ligands bind to the dual sites of the enzyme. Simple and ecofriendly syntheses and diastereomeric crystallizations of 2H-thiazolo [3,2-a]pyrimidines and 5H-thiazolo[3,2-a] pyrimidines are described. The solid-state structures for the HBr salts of compounds 6a, 6e, 7a, and 7i have been determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, and X-ray powder patterns were measured for the bulk solid remaining after solvent was removed from solutions containing 6a and 7a.

Cyclophilin D (CypD), an integral part of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), is involved in amyloid beta (A\u03b2)-instigated mitochondrial dysfunction. Blockade of CypD prevents A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial malfunction and the consequent cognitive impairments. Here, we showed the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by antioxidants probucol or superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase blocks A\u03b2-mediated inactivation of protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP regulatory-element-binding (CREB) signal transduction pathway and loss of synapse, suggesting the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on neuronal PKA/CREB activity. Notably, neurons lacking CypD significantly attenuate A\u03b2-induced ROS. Consequently, CypD-deficient neurons are resistant to A\u03b2-disrupted PKA/CREB signaling by increased PKA activity, phosphorylation of PKA catalytic subunit (PKA C), and CREB. In parallel, lack of CypD protects neurons from A\u03b2-induced loss of synapses and synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, compared to the mAPP mice, CypD-deficient mAPP mice reveal less inactivation of PKA-CREB activity and increased synaptic density, attenuate abnormalities in dendritic spine maturation, and improve spontaneous synaptic activity. These findings provide new insights into a mechanism in the crosstalk between the CypD-dependent mitochondrial oxidative stress and signaling cascade, leading to synaptic injury, functioning through the PKA/CREB signal transduction pathway.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid beta", "Mitochondrial permeability transition", "Oxidative stress", "PKA/CREB signaling", "Synaptic alteration"], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Antioxidants", "Catalase", "Cells, Cultured", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase F", "Cyclophilins", "Immunoblotting", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mitochondria", "Neurons", "Oxidative Stress", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Probucol", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Signal Transduction", "Superoxide Dismutase", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heng", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lan", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoping", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Physicians & Surgeons College of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Physicians & Surgeons College of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Physicians & Surgeons College of Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John Xi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 1003, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shirley ShiDu", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Higuchi Bioscience Center, School of Pharmacy, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.

Abnormal mitochondrial motility and mitochondrial dysfunction within axons are critical for amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced synaptic stress and the loss of synapses relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms controlling axonal mitochondrial function and transport alterations in AD remain elusive. Here, we report an unexplored role of cyclophilin D (CypD)-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in A\u03b2-impaired axonal mitochondrial trafficking. Depletion of CypD significantly protects axonal mitochondrial motility and dynamics from A\u03b2 toxicity as shown by increased axonal mitochondrial density and distribution and improved bidirectional transport of axonal mitochondria. Notably, blockade of mPTP by genetic deletion of CypD suppresses A\u03b2-mediated activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, reverses axonal mitochondrial abnormalities, improves synaptic function, and attenuates loss of synapse, suggesting a role of CypD-dependent signaling in A\u03b2-induced alterations in axonal mitochondrial trafficking. The potential mechanisms of the protective effects of lacking CypD on A\u03b2-induced abnormal mitochondrial transport in axon are increased axonal calcium buffer capability, diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS), and suppressing downstream signal transduction P38 activation.
