However, mammalian cells can bypass CDK4/6 for Rb inactivation. Here we show a non-canonical pathway for Rb inactivation and its interplay with external signals. We find that the non-phosphorylated Rb protein in quiescent cells is intrinsically unstable, offering an alternative mechanism for initiating E2F activity. Nevertheless, this pathway incompletely induces Rb-protein loss, resulting in minimal E2F activity. To trigger cell proliferation, upregulation of mitogenic signaling is required for stabilizing c-Myc, thereby augmenting E2F activity. Concurrently, stress signaling promotes Cip/Kip levels, competitively regulating cell proliferation with mitogenic signaling. In cancer, driver mutations elevate c-Myc levels, facilitating adaptation to CDK4/6 inhibitors.

CD8+ T-cell exclusion from the tumor parenchyma is associated with poor response to immunotherapy, and yet the biology that underpins this distinct pattern remains unclear. Here we show that the vascular destabilizing factor angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) causes compromised vascular integrity in the tumor periphery, leading to impaired T-cell infiltration to the tumor core. The spatial regulation of ANGPT2 in whole tumor cross-sections was analyzed in conjunction with T-cell distribution, vascular integrity, and response to immunotherapy in syngeneic murine melanoma models. T-cell exclusion was associated with ANGPT2 upregulation and elevated vascular leakage at the periphery of human and murine melanomas. Both pharmacologic and genetic blockade of ANGPT2 promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor core, exerting antitumor effects. Importantly, the reversal of T-cell exclusion following ANGPT2 blockade not only enhanced response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in immunogenic, therapy-responsive mouse melanomas, but it also rendered nonresponsive tumors susceptible to immunotherapy. Therapeutic response after ANGPT2 blockade, driven by improved CD8+ T-cell infiltration to the tumor core, coincided with spatial TIE2 signaling activation and increased vascular integrity at the tumor periphery where endothelial expression of adhesion molecules was reduced.

This process is tightly regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the retinoblastoma protein (Rb).

Our data show that CDK4/6 activation induces Rb inactivation and thereby E2F activation, driving a gradual increase in CDK2 activity. We found that rapid CDK4/6 inhibition can reverse cell-cycle entry until CDK2 activity reaches to high levels. This suggests that high CDK2 activity is required to initiate CDK2-Rb positive feedback and CDK4/6-indpendent cell-cycle progression. Since CDK2 activation also facilitates initiation of DNA replication, the timing of CDK2-Rb positive feedback is coupled with the G1/S transition. Our experiments, which acutely increased CDK2 activity by cyclin E1 overexpression, indicate that cells commit to the cell cycle before triggering DNA replication. Together, our data suggest that CDK4/6 inactivates Rb to begin E2F and CDK2 activation, and high CDK2 activity is necessary and sufficient to generate a bistable switch for Rb phosphorylation before DNA replication.

To start, cells first activate the kinase cyclin D-CDK4/6, which leads to eventual inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein Rb. Hours later, cells inactivate APC/CCDH1 and cross the final commitment point. However, many cells with genetically deleted cyclin Ds, which activate and confer specificity to CDK4/6, can compensate and proliferate. Despite its importance in cancer, how this entry mechanism operates remains poorly characterized, and whether cells use this path under normal conditions remains unknown. Here, using single-cell microscopy, we demonstrate that cells with acutely inhibited CDK4/6 enter the cell cycle with a slowed and fluctuating cyclin E-CDK2 activity increase. Surprisingly, with low CDK4/6 activity, the order of APC/CCDH1 and Rb inactivation is reversed in both cell lines and wild-type mice. Finally, we show that as a consequence of this signaling inversion, Rb inactivation replaces APC/CCDH1 inactivation as the point of no return. Together, we elucidate the molecular steps that enable cell-cycle entry without CDK4/6 activity.

By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, including the one from SARS-CoV-2, we are able to quickly identify compounds with broad or narrow spectra of activity. We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by performing a curated compound screen along with structure-activity profiling of a series of small molecules to identify compounds with antiviral activity. Throughout these studies, we observed concordance between data emerging from this assay and from live virus assays. By democratizing the testing of 3CL inhibitors to enable screening in the majority of laboratories rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure, we hope to expedite the search for coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitors, to address the current epidemic and future ones that will inevitably arise.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel J", "Last Name": "Resnick", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sho", "Last Name": "Iketani", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seo Jung", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arie", "Last Name": "Zask", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hengrui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sungsoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Schuyler", "Last Name": "Melore", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manoj S", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaoxing", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas E S", "Last Name": "Tay", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomislav", "Last Name": "Rovis", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hee Won", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent R", "Last Name": "Stockwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "David D", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Chavez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2020Aug29"}, {"PMID": "32255427", "Title": "Stress-mediated exit to quiescence restricted by increasing persistence in CDK4/6 activation.", "Abstract": "Mammalian cells typically start the cell-cycle entry program by activating cyclin-dependent protein kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6). CDK4/6 activity is clinically relevant as mutations, deletions, and amplifications that increase CDK4/6 activity contribute to the progression of many cancers. However, when CDK4/6 is activated relative to CDK2 remained incompletely understood. Here, we developed a reporter system to simultaneously monitor CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities in single cells and found that CDK4/6 activity increases rapidly before CDK2 activity gradually increases, and that CDK4/6 activity can be active after mitosis or inactive for variable time periods. Markedly, stress signals in G1 can rapidly inactivate CDK4/6 to return cells to quiescence but with reduced probability as cells approach S phase. Together, our study reveals a regulation of G1 length by temporary inactivation of CDK4/6 activity after mitosis, and a progressively increasing persistence in CDK4/6 activity that restricts cells from returning to quiescence as cells approach S phase.", "Keywords": ["CDK4/6", "cell biology", "cell cycle", "cell signaling", "human", "restriction point"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Cell Line", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6", "G1 Phase", "Genes, Reporter", "Humans", "Mitosis", "S Phase", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Stress, Physiological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hee Won", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven D", "Last Name": "Cappell", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ariel", "Last Name": "Jaimovich", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chad", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mingyu", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Leighton H", "Last Name": "Daigh", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lindsey R", "Last Name": "Pack", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yilin", "Last Name": "Fan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sergi", "Last Name": "Regot", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, United States."}, {"First Name": "Markus", "Last Name": "Covert", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2020Apr07"}, {"PMID": "31543423", "Title": "Transient Hysteresis in CDK4/6 Activity Underlies Passage of the Restriction Point in G1.", "Abstract": "Cells escape the need for mitogens at a restriction point several hours before entering S phase. The restriction point has been proposed to result from CDK4/6 initiating partial Rb phosphorylation to trigger a bistable switch whereby cyclin E-CDK2 and Rb mutually reinforce each other to induce Rb hyperphosphorylation. Here, using single-cell analysis, we unexpectedly found that cyclin E/A-CDK activity can only maintain Rb hyperphosphorylation starting at the onset of S phase and that CDK4/6 activity, but not cyclin E/A-CDK activity, is required to hyperphosphorylate Rb throughout G1 phase. Mitogen removal in G1 results in a gradual loss of CDK4/6 activity with a high likelihood of cells sustaining Rb hyperphosphorylation until S phase, at which point cyclin E/A-CDK activity takes over. Thus, it is\u00a0short-term memory, or transient hysteresis, in CDK4/6 activity following mitogen removal that sustains Rb hyperphosphorylation, demonstrating a probabilistic rather than an irreversible molecular mechanism underlying the restriction point.", "Keywords": ["CDK", "E2F", "bistability", "cell cycle", "cyclin", "hysteresis", "restriction point", "retinoblastoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Epithelial Cells", "Fibroblasts", "G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Mitogens", "Models, Biological", "Phosphorylation", "Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Time Factors", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mingyu", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 318 Campus Drive, Clark Building W200, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chad", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 318 Campus Drive, Clark Building W200, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hee Won", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 318 Campus Drive, Clark Building W200, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marielle S", "Last Name": "K\u00f6berlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 318 Campus Drive, Clark Building W200, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven D", "Last Name": "Cappell", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 318 Campus Drive, Clark Building W200, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 318 Campus Drive, Clark Building W200, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.
