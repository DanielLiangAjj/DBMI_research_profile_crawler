[{"PMID": "37030375", "Title": "SBBGR technology for reducing waste sludge production during plastic recycling process: Assessment of potential increase in sludge hazardousness.", "Abstract": "Sludge production in the wastewater treatment sector is consistently increasing and represents a critical environmental and economic issue. This study evaluated an unconventional approach for treating wastewater generated from the cleaning of non-hazardous plastic solid waste during the plastic recycling process. The proposed scheme was based on sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor (SBBGR) technology, which was compared with the activated sludge-based treatment currently in operation. These treatment technologies were compared regarding sludge quality, specific sludge production, and effluent quality to highlight whether the reduced sludge production shown by SBBGR corresponded to an increase in the concentration of hazardous compounds in the sludge. The SBBGR technology showed remarkable removal efficiencies (TSS, VSS, and NH3\u00a0>\u00a099\u00a0%; COD >90\u00a0%; TN and TP\u00a0>\u00a080\u00a0%) and a sludge production six-fold lower than the conventional plant (in terms of kgTSS/kg CODremoved). Biomass from the SBBGR did not show a significant accumulation of organic micropollutants (i.e., long-chain hydrocarbons, chlorinated pesticides and chlorobenzenes, PCB, PCDD/F, PAH, chlorinated and brominated aliphatic compounds, and aromatic solvents), whereas a certain accumulation of heavy metals was observed. Furthermore, an initial attempt to compare the operating costs of the two treatment approaches revealed that the SBBGR technology would provide 38\u00a0% savings.", "Keywords": ["Heavy metals", "LDPE", "Micropollutants", "Sludge quality"], "MeSH terms": ["Sewage", "Waste Disposal, Fluid", "Plastics", "Bioreactors", "Filtration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Valerio Guido", "Last Name": "Altieri", "Affiliation": "Water Research Institute, C.N.R, Viale F.

Weed management plays a fundamental role in their sustainable management. The aim of this work was to characterize and assess the plant diversity associated with different weed control practices, in a homogeneous olive-dominated landscape in the South-East of Italy. Sixty-five vegetation plots were sampled in orchards treated with different weed control practices: mowing, tillage, and use of chemical herbicides. The multi-response permutation procedure was used to test the hypothesis of no difference among the treatments. The relationships between plots were visualized by means of non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the relationships between weed control practices and life forms, chorotypes, and diversity indexes. The results showed that the three weed control practices determined slightly different plant communities. Chemically weeded orchards showed an impoverished floristic composition and the lowest diversity, whereas mowing and tillage yielded similar values. These latter two treatments differed for the percentages of hemicryptophytes and therophytes. Moreover, different from other studies, we did not find plant species of particular concern for biodiversity conservation. We hypothesize that this result is due to the monotonous structure of the agro-landscape we investigated, where natural elements are almost lacking. From this point of view, a correct management of agro-districts should consider both the agronomic practices at the level of the individual olive groves and the structure of the agro-landscape.", "Keywords": ["Mediterranean", "biodiversity", "chemical herbicides", "mowing", "olive groves", "tillage", "weeds"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Massimo", "Last Name": "Terzi", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources, National Research Council, Via Amendola 165/A, 70126 Bari, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Emanuele", "Last Name": "Barca", "Affiliation": "Water Research Institute, National Research Council, Via F.

The proposed treatment was also compared with the conventional treatment, which was based on primary and secondary treatments, using the activated sludge process, performed by Recuperi Pugliesi, a leading company in the plastic recycling industry located in Bari, Italy. The company produces low-density polyethylene (LDPE) regenerated granules from PSW used in agricultural and floricultural greenhouse activities and industrial packaging after a washing stage in the aqueous phase. The latter generates large volumes of wastewater, the conventional treatment of which is characterised by large quantities of sludge and the associated disposal problems. Under steady-state conditions, the SBBGR provided impressive removal efficiencies regarding the main gross parameters (over 90% for COD and TKN, over 99% for BOD5, TSS, VSS and NH3, and over 80% for TN) with a statistically better effluent quality than that of the conventional treatment. The SBBGR effluent quality was modelled in terms of washing water characteristics by using generalized additive models (GAMs). The SBBGR treatment was characterised by a specific sludge production five times lower than that of the conventional treatment (0.21\u00a0kg TSS vs. 1.0\u00a0kg TSS per m3 of wastewater treated).

These facts reveal an important and significant unmet need for approved therapies for these debilitating and often fatal disorders. To fill this need, it is critical for clinicians and drug developers to work closely with regulatory agencies. In the United States, mitochondrial disease patients and clinicians, the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, and pharmaceutical industry members have engaged with the Food and Drug Administration to educate each other about these complex and heterogeneous diseases and about regulatory requirements to obtain approvals for novel therapies. Clinical development of therapies for rare diseases has been facilitated by the 1983 US Orphan Drug Act (ODA) and similar legislation in Japan and the European Union. Further legislation and regulatory guidance have expanded and refined regulatory flexibility. While regulatory and financial incentives of the ODA have augmented involvement of pharmaceutical companies, clinicians, with patient advocacy groups and industry, need to conduct natural history studies, develop clinical outcome measures, and identify potential supportive surrogate endpoints predictive of clinical benefit, which together are critical foundations for clinical trials. Thus, the regulatory environment for novel therapeutic development is conducive and offers flexibility for mitochondrial diseases. Nevertheless, flexibility does not mean lower standards, as well-controlled rigorous clinical trials of high quality are still required to establish the efficacy of potential therapies and to obtain regulatory agency approvals for their commercial use.

To better define the phenotypic spectrum and course of COQ8A disease, we review the clinical presentation and evolution in 47 reported cases. Individuals with COQ8A mutation display great clinical variability and unpredictable responses to CoQ10 supplementation. Onset is typically during infancy or childhood with ataxic features associated with developmental delay or regression. When disease onset is later in life, first symptoms can include: incoordination, epilepsy, tremor, and deterioration of writing. The natural history is characterized by a progression to a multisystem brain disease dominated by ataxia, with disease severity inversely correlated with age at onset. Six previously reported cases share with ours, a clinical phenotype characterized by slowly progressive or static writing difficulties, focal dystonia, and speech disorder, with only minimal ataxia. The combination of writing difficulty, dystonia and ataxia is a distinctive constellation that is reminiscent of a previously described clinical entity called Dystonia Ataxia Syndrome (DYTCA) and is an important clinical indicator of COQ8A mutations, even when ataxia is mild or absent.", "Keywords": ["COQ8A", "CoQ(10) deficiency", "Dystonia-ataxia syndrome", "Handwriting deterioration"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Ataxia", "Child", "Disease Progression", "Dystonic Disorders", "Female", "Handwriting", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Muscle Weakness", "Ubiquinone", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Serena", "Last Name": "Galosi", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Emanuele", "Last Name": "Barca", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and H.

Hepatic metabolic reprogramming in response to infection begins within hours of infection, suggesting a mechanism closely linked to pathogen recognition. Following injection with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, a mimic of viral infection, a robust hepatic innate immune response could be seen involving the TNF\u03b1 pathway at 2\u00a0h. Repeated doses led to the adoption of Warburg-like metabolism in the liver as determined by in vivo metabolic imaging, expression analyses, and metabolomics. Hepatic macrophages, Kupffer cells, were able to induce Warburg-like metabolism in hepatocytes in vitro via TNF\u03b1. Eliminating macrophages in vivo or blocking TNF\u03b1 in vitro or in vivo resulted in abrogation of the metabolic phenotype, establishing an immune-metabolic axis in hepatic metabolic reprogramming. Overall, we suggest that macrophages, as early sensors of pathogens, instruct hepatocytes via TNF\u03b1 to undergo metabolic reprogramming to cope with challenges to homeostasis initiated by infection.

In heavily modified rivers, though, the response of aquatic invertebrates to mitigation measures and habitat mosaic changes is scarcely documented. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to explore the benthic community of leveed rivers in the agricultural lowlands of Northern Italy. The relevance of in-stream substrate microhabitat for the benthic community was assessed, together with the impact of mitigation measures. We proposed a straightforward approach to quantify similarity of microhabitat mosaic between sites testing its statistical significance based on Bayesian statistics. We hypothesised that changes of microhabitat mosaic would reflect the level of implementation of mitigation measures and benthic invertebrates would respond accordingly. Alpha, beta diversity and benthic metrics used to classify ecological status/potential were considered and their variation tested against different levels of measure implementation. Lastly, ecological potential classification was paralleled to both the level of measure implementation and habitat attributes. The microhabitats found at sites where measures were fully implemented differed from those observed elsewhere and they clearly mirrored morphological alteration and mitigation measures. Moreover, alongside morphological alteration, microhabitat diversity and mosaic were the main factors for benthic community structure. While benthic beta diversity strictly reflected microhabitat diversity, alpha diversity and ecological status metrics copied the mosaic gradient. Microhabitat attributes and most benthic metrics showed significant changes following measure implementation and they were accompanied by a gradual shift in ecological potential classes. We demonstrated the importance of in-stream substrate microhabitats as a bridge between mitigation measures and the benthic community. Particularly when ecological classification is under focus, microhabitat mosaic should be evaluated for achieving a better understanding of biological responses.

Up to date, no systematic studies have been developed in order to assess the incidence of lipomas in large cohorts of mitochondrial patients.The aim of this study is to analyze the incidence and characteristics of lipomas among an Italian cohort of patients with mitochondrial diseases. A retrospective, database-based study (Nation-wide Italian Collaborative Network of Mitochondrial Diseases) of patients with lipomas was performed. A total of 22 (1.7%) patients with lipomas have been identified among the 1,300 mitochondrial patients, enrolled in the Italian database. In about 18% multiple systemic lipomatosis (MSL) was the only clinical manifestation; 54% of patients showed a classical MERRF syndrome. Myopathy, alone or in association with other symptoms, was found in 27% of patients. Lactate was elevated in all the 12 patients in which was measured. Muscle biopsy was available in 18/22 patients: in all of them mitochondrial abnormalities were present. Eighty six percent had mutations in mtDNA coding for tRNA lysine. In most of patients, lipomas were localized along the cervical-cranial-thoracic region. In 68% of the patients were distributed symmetrically. Only two patients had lipomas in a single anatomical site (1 in right arm and 1 in gluteus maximum). MSL is often overlooked by clinicians in patients with mitochondrial diseases where the clinical picture could be dominated by a severe multi-systemic involvement.

Liver and kidney lipidomics, and urine metabolomics analyses, did not show CoQ metabolites. To further demonstrate that sulfides metabolism defects cause oxidative stress in CoQ deficiency, we show that silencing of sulfide quinone oxido-reductase (SQOR) in wild-type HeLa cells leads to similar increases of reactive oxygen species (ROS) observed in HeLa cells depleted of the CoQ biosynthesis regulatory protein COQ8A. While CoQ10 supplementation of COQ8A depleted cells decreases ROS and increases SQOR protein levels, knock-down of SQOR prevents CoQ10 antioxidant effects. We conclude that kidney failure in CoQ deficiency-associated NS is caused by oxidative stress mediated by impaired sulfides oxidation and propose that CoQ supplementation does not significantly increase the kidney pool of CoQ bound to the respiratory supercomplexes, but rather enhances the free pool of CoQ, which stabilizes SQOR protein levels rescuing oxidative stress.", "Keywords": ["CoQ deficiency", "Coenzyme Q(10)", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative stress", "Sulfides"], "MeSH terms": ["Alkyl and Aryl Transferases", "Animals", "Antioxidants", "Ataxia", "Disease Models, Animal", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Hydrogen Sulfide", "Kidney", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Muscle Weakness", "Nephrotic Syndrome", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Oxidative Stress", "Oxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Ubiquinone"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giulio", "Last Name": "Kleiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Emanuele", "Last Name": "Barca", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marcello", "Last Name": "Ziosi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Emmanuele", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yimeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Agustin", "Last Name": "Hidalgo-Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Granada, Granada, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Changhong", "Last Name": "Qiao", "Affiliation": "Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Saba", "Last Name": "Tadesse", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Estela", "Last Name": "Area-Gomez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Luis C", "Last Name": "Lopez", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Granada, Granada, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Catarina M", "Last Name": "Quinzii", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.

We recently described an LS case caused by a pathogenic mutation in USMG5, encoding a small supernumerary subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. This protein is integral for ATP synthase dimerization, and patient fibroblasts revealed an almost total loss of ATP synthase dimers. Here, we utilize in situ cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) in a clinical case-control study of mitochondrial disease to directly study mitochondria within cultured fibroblasts from a patient with LS and a healthy human control subject. Through tomographic analysis of patient and control mitochondria, we find that loss of ATP synthase dimerization due to the pathogenic mutation causes profound disturbances of mitochondrial crista ultrastructure.

Mutations in several different structural CV subunits cause Leigh syndrome; however, dimerization defects have not been associated with human disease. We report four Leigh syndrome subjects from three unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish families harboring a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.87\u2009+\u20091G>C) in a novel CV subunit disease gene, USMG5. The Ashkenazi population allele frequency is 0.57%. This mutation produces two USMG5 transcripts, wild-type and lacking exon 3. Fibroblasts from two Leigh syndrome probands had reduced wild-type USMG5 mRNA expression and undetectable protein. The mutation did not alter monomeric CV expression, but reduced both CV dimer expression and ATP synthesis rate. Rescue with wild-type USMG5 cDNA in proband fibroblasts restored USMG5 protein, increased CV dimerization and enhanced ATP production rate.

Increased cardiac oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been observed during sepsis, but the mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities have not been determined. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation could be responsible for sepsis-induced oxidative stress and cardiomyopathy. Treatment of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes with low concentrations of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Elevated mitochondrial superoxide was accompanied by depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, an indication of mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial calcium overload. NOX2 inhibition decreased LPS-induced superoxide and prevented mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic ablation of NOX2 did not have LPS-induced superoxide or mitochondrial dysfunction. LPS decreased contractility and calcium transient amplitude in isolated cardiomyocytes, and these abnormalities were prevented by inhibition of NOX2. LPS decreased systolic function in mice, measured by echocardiography. NOX2 inhibition was cardioprotective in 2 mouse models of sepsis, preserving systolic function after LPS injection or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). These data show that inhibition of NOX2 decreases oxidative stress, preserves intracellular calcium handling and mitochondrial function, and alleviates sepsis-induced systolic dysfunction in vivo.

Our previous preclinical studies showed that statin treatment in rats involves the reduction of skeletal muscle ClC-1 chloride channel expression and related chloride conductance (gCl). An increase of the activity of protein kinase C theta (PKC theta) isoform, able to inactivate ClC-1, may contribute to destabilize sarcolemma excitability. These effects can be detrimental for muscle function leading to drug-induced myopathy. Our goal is to study the causes of statin-induced muscle side effects in patients at the aim to identify biological markers useful to prevent and counteract statin-induced muscle damage. We examined 10 patients, who experienced myalgia and hyper-CK-emia after starting statin therapy compared to 9 non-myopathic subjects not using lipid-lowering drugs. Western Blot (WB) analysis showed a 40% reduction of ClC-1 protein and increased expression of phosphorylated PKC in muscle biopsies of statin-treated patients with respect to untreated subjects, independently from their age and statin type. Real-time PCR analysis showed that despite reduction of the protein, the ClC-1 mRNA was not significantly changed, suggesting post-transcriptional modification. The mRNA expression of a series of genes was also evaluated. MuRF-1 was increased in accord with muscle atrophy, MEF-2, calcineurin (CN) and GLUT-4 transporter were reduced, suggesting altered transcription, alteration of glucose homeostasis and energy deficit. Accordingly, the phosphorylated form of AMPK, measured by WB, was increased, suggesting cytoprotective process activation. In parallel, mRNA expression of Notch-1, involved in muscle cell proliferation, was highly expressed in statin-treated patients, indicating active regeneration. Also, PGC-1-alpha and isocitrate-dehydrogenase increased expression together with increased activity of mitochondrial citrate-synthase, measured by spectrophotometric assay, suggests mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus, the reduction of ClC-1 protein and consequent sarcolemma hyperexcitability together with energy deficiency appear to be among the most important alterations to be associated with statin-related risk of myopathy in humans. Thus, it may be important to avoid statin treatment in pathologies characterized by energy deficit and chloride channel malfunction.

In patients with mitochondrial disease, clinical data were marked by frequent infections and immunodeficiency, prompting us to explore the consequences of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction in T\u00a0cells. Since cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a critical regulator of OXPHOS, we created a mouse model with isolated dysfunction in T\u00a0cells by targeting a gene, COX10, that produces mitochondrial disease in humans. COX dysfunction resulted in increased apoptosis following activation in\u00a0vitro and immunodeficiency in\u00a0vivo.

This paper presents a methodology to characterise and classify the regime of a temporary river in Southern Italy based on hydrological indicators (HIs) computed with long-term daily flow records. By using a principal component analysis (PCA), a set of non-redundant indices were identified describing the main characteristics of the hydrological regime in the study area. The indicators identified were the annual maximum 30- and 90-day mean (DH4 and DH5), the number of zero flow days (DL6), flow permanence (MF) and the 6-month seasonal predictability of dry periods (SD6). A methodology was also tested to estimate selected HIs in ungauged river reaches. Watershed characteristics such as catchment area, gauging station elevation, mean watershed slope, mean annual rainfall, land use, soil hydraulic conductivity and available water content were derived for each site. Selected indicators were then linked to the catchment characteristics using a regression analysis. Finally, MF and SD6 were used to classify the river reaches on the basis of their degree of intermittency.

We also assessed mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities, oxidative stress, mitochondrial mass, and levels of enzymes involved in CoQ biosynthesis. Our studies revealed CoQ10 deficiency in MSA cerebellum, which was associated with impaired CoQ biosynthesis and increased oxidative stress in the absence of COQ2 mutations. The levels of CoQ10 in the cerebella of ET and PD patients were comparable or higher than in controls. These findings suggest that CoQ10 deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of MSA.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) led to a rapid expansion of diagnostic capabilities in such disorders and facilitated a better understanding of disease pathogenesis, although functional characterization remains a bottleneck to the interpretation of potential pathological variants. We report a 2-year-old boy of Afro-Caribbean ancestry, who presented with neuromuscular symptoms without significant abnormalities on routine diagnostic evaluation. WES revealed compound heterozygous missense variants of uncertain significance in mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2), which encodes the TCA enzyme ACO2. Pathogenic variants in ACO2 have been described in a handful of families as the cause of infantile cerebellar-retinal degeneration syndrome. Using biochemical and cellular assays in patient fibroblasts, we found that ACO2 expression was quantitatively normal, but ACO2 enzyme activity was <20% of that observed in control cells. We also observed a deficiency in cellular respiration and, for the first time, demonstrate evidence of mitochondrial DNA depletion and altered expression of some TCA components and electron transport chain subunits. The observed cellular defects were completely restored with ACO2 gene rescue. Our findings demonstrate the pathogenicity of two VUS in ACO2, provide novel mechanistic insights to TCA disturbances in ACO2 deficiency, and implicate mitochondrial DNA depletion in the pathogenesis of this recently described disorder.", "Keywords": ["Mitochondrial aconitase deficiency", "Neurodegenerative disease", "TCA cycle", "Whole exome sequencing", "mtDNA depletion"], "MeSH terms": ["Aconitate Hydratase", "Child, Preschool", "Citric Acid Cycle", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Exome", "Gene Expression Regulation", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Mutation, Missense", "Neuromuscular Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roa", "Last Name": "Sadat", "Affiliation": "USDA/ARS/Children's Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emanuele", "Last Name": "Barca", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Messina, Messina, Italy; Houston Merritt Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruchi", "Last Name": "Masand", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Taraka R", "Last Name": "Donti", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Naini", "Affiliation": "Houston Merritt Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darryl C", "Last Name": "De Vivo", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "DiMauro", "Affiliation": "Houston Merritt Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil A", "Last Name": "Hanchard", "Affiliation": "USDA/ARS/Children's Nutrition Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brett H", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.

The molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that physiologic levels of saturated fat could increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. We investigated the effect of saturated fat on mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis in isolated ventricular myocytes. The saturated fatty acid palmitate causes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocytes. Palmitate, but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, causes an increase in both total cellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS. Palmitate depolarizes the mitochondrial inner membrane and causes mitochondrial calcium overload by increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak. Inhibitors of PKC or NOX2 prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and the increase in ROS, demonstrating that PKC-NOX2 activation is also required for amplification of palmitate induced-ROS. Cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic deletion of NOX2 do not have palmitate-induced ROS or mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that palmitate induces mitochondrial ROS that is amplified by NOX2, causing greater mitochondrial ROS generation and partial depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

CoQ10 deficiency has been identified in fibroblasts and muscle of AOA1 patients carrying the common W279X mutation, and aprataxin has been localized to mitochondria in neuroblastoma cells, where it enhances preservation of mitochondrial function. In this study, we show that aprataxin deficiency impairs mitochondrial function, independent of its role in mitochondrial DNA repair. The bioenergetics defect in AOA1-mutant fibroblasts and APTX-depleted Hela cells is caused by decreased expression of SDHA and genes encoding CoQ biosynthetic enzymes, in association with reductions of APE1, NRF1 and NRF2. The biochemical and molecular abnormalities in APTX-depleted cells are recapitulated by knockdown of APE1 in Hela cells and are rescued by overexpression of NRF1/2. Importantly, pharmacological upregulation of NRF1 alone by 5-aminoimidazone-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide does not rescue the phenotype, which, in contrast, is reversed by the upregulation of NRF2 by rosiglitazone. Accordingly, we propose that the lack of aprataxin causes reduction of the pathway APE1/NRF1/NRF2 and their target genes. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of APTX in transcription regulation of mitochondrial function and the pathogenesis of AOA1 via a novel pathomechanistic pathway, which may be relevant to other

In this disease, autosomal recessive TYMP mutations cause severe reductions of thymidine phosphorylase activity; marked elevations of the pyrimidine nucleosides thymidine and deoxyuridine in plasma and tissues, and somatic multiple deletions, depletion and site-specific point mutations of mitochondrial DNA. Thymidine phosphorylase and uridine phosphorylase double knockout mice recapitulated several features of these patients including thymidine phosphorylase activity deficiency, elevated thymidine and deoxyuridine in tissues, mitochondrial DNA depletion, respiratory chain defects and white matter changes. However, in contrast to patients with this disease, mutant mice showed mitochondrial alterations only in the brain. To test the hypothesis that elevated levels of nucleotides cause unbalanced deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools and, in turn, pathogenic mitochondrial DNA instability, we have stressed double knockout mice with exogenous thymidine and deoxyuridine, and assessed clinical, neuroradiological, histological, molecular, and biochemical consequences. Mutant mice treated with exogenous thymidine and deoxyuridine showed reduced survival, body weight, and muscle strength, relative to untreated animals. Moreover, in treated mutants, leukoencephalopathy, a hallmark of the disease, was enhanced and the small intestine showed a reduction of smooth muscle cells and increased fibrosis. Levels of mitochondrial DNA were depleted not only in the brain but also in the small intestine, and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate imbalance was observed in the brain. The relative proportion, rather than the absolute amount of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, was critical for mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Thus, our results demonstrate that stress of exogenous pyrimidine nucleosides enhances the mitochondrial phenotype of our knockout mice. Our mouse studies provide insights into the pathogenic role of thymidine and deoxyuridine imbalance in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy and an excellent model to study new therapeutic approaches.", "Keywords": ["MNGIE", "animal model", "deoxynucleotide", "deoxyuridine", "mitochondrial DNA", "thymidine"], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Body Weight", "Brain", "Deoxyribonucleosides", "Disease Models, Animal", "Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathies", "Motor Activity", "Muscle Strength", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal", "Ophthalmoplegia", "Psychomotor Disorders", "Succinate Dehydrogenase", "Thymidine", "Thymidine Phosphorylase", "Uridine Phosphorylase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Garcia-Diaz", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Centre, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caterina", "Last Name": "Garone", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emanuele", "Last Name": "Barca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hamed", "Last Name": "Mojahed", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Purification", "Last Name": "Gutierrez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Pizzorno", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kurenai", "Last Name": "Tanji", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fernando", "Last Name": "Arias-Mendoza", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Caterina M", "Last Name": "Quinzii", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Hirano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2014May"}, {"PMID": "23916420", "Title": "Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD): correlations between respiratory muscles CT and MRI features and pulmonary function.", "Abstract": "Late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare muscle disorder often characterized, along the disease course, by severe respiratory failure. We describe herein respiratory muscles and lung abnormalities in LOPD patients using MR imaging and CT examinations correlated to pulmonary function tests. Ten LOPD patients were studied: 6 with a limb-girdle muscle weakness, 1 with myalgias, 2 with exertional dyspnoea and 1 with isolated hyperckemia. Respiratory function was measured using forced vital capacity (FVC) in both upright and supine positions, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and peak cough flow (PCF) tests. The involvement (atrophy) of diaphragms, abdominal respiratory muscles and intercostal muscles was ranked by CT and MRI examinations using appropriate scales. Height of lungs and band-like atelectasis presence were also recorded. Seven out of 10 patients showed a functional diaphragmatic weakness (FVC drop percentage >25%). In 8 out of 10 patients, involvement of both diaphragms and of other respiratory muscles was seen. The mean height of lungs in patients was significantly reduced when compared to a control group. Marked elevation of the diaphragms (lung height < 15 cm) was also seen in 6 patients. Multiple unilateral or bilateral band-like atelectasis were found in 4 patients. Statistically significant correlations were found between diaphragm atrophy grading, evaluated by MRI and CT, and FVC in supine position, FVC drop percentage passing from upright to supine position, PCF and MIP. Our data showed that diaphragm atrophy, often associated to reduced lung height and band-like atelectasis, can be considered the CT-MRI hallmark of respiratory insufficiency in LOPD patients. Early recognition of respiratory muscles involvement, using imaging data, could allow an early start of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in LOPD.", "Keywords": ["Computed tomography", "LOPD", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Pompe disease", "Pulmonary function", "Respiratory muscles"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Aged", "Biopsy", "Child", "Female", "Glycogen Storage Disease Type II", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Respiratory Muscles", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Gaeta", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences and of Morphologic and Functional Images, University of Messina, AOU \"Policlinico G.
