Over the last 10\u2009years, bone has emerged as an endocrine organ with diverse physiological functions. The two key molecules in this context are fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), secreted by osteocytes, and osteocalcin, a hormone produced by osteoblasts. FGF23 affects mineral homeostasis through its actions on the kidneys, and osteocalcin has beneficial effects in improving glucose homeostasis, muscle function, brain development, cognition, and male fertility. In addition, another osteoblast-derived hormone, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) has emerged into the researchers' field of vision. In this review, we mainly focus on LCN2's role in appetite regulation and glucose metabolism and also briefly introduce its effects in other pathophysiological conditions, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, sarcopenic obesity, and cancer-induced cachexia.", "Keywords": ["Lipocalin-2", "MC4R", "appetite", "energy metabolism", "\u03b2-cell"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Male", "Animals", "Mice", "Lipocalin-2", "Osteocalcin", "Bone and Bones", "Hormones", "Minerals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuying", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, and Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianmin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, and Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kousteni", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of diabetes", "PubDate": "2024Mar"}, {"PMID": "37267505", "Title": "Haplodeficiency of the 9p21 tumor suppressor locus causes myeloid disorders driven by the bone marrow microenvironment.", "Abstract": "The chromosome 9p21 locus comprises several tumor suppressor genes including MTAP, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B, and its homo- or heterozygous deletion is associated with reduced survival in multiple cancer types.

However, how osteogenesis is prevented in CAR cells to maintain spaces available for HSCs and hematopoiesis remains unclear. In this issue of Genes & Development, Seike and colleagues (pp. 359-372) report that the transcription factor early B-cell factor (Ebf3) is preferentially expressed by CAR/LepR+ cells and inhibits CAR cell differentiation into osteoblasts while at the same time maintaining self-renewal of CAR/LepR+ cells. Using conditional knockout and retroviral systems, the investigators show that loss of Ebf3 in CAR cells impairs HSC numbers and leads to osteosclerosis.

Osteoporosis.", "Abstract": "We have previously reported that premenopausal women with idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) have profound microarchitectural deficiencies and heterogeneous bone remodeling. Those with the lowest bone formation rate have higher baseline serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and less robust response to teriparatide. Because IGF-1 stimulates bone formation and is critical for teriparatide action on osteoblasts, these findings suggest a state of IGF-1 resistance in some IOP women. To further investigate the hypothesis that osteoblast and IGF-1-related mechanisms mediate differential responsiveness to teriparatide in IOP, we studied circulating osteoblast progenitor (COP) cells and their IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression. In premenopausal women with IOP, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained at baseline (n\u2009=\u200925) and over 24 months of teriparatide treatment (n\u2009=\u200911). Flow cytometry was used to identify and quantify COPs (non-hematopoetic lineage cells expressing osteocalcin and RUNX2) and to quantify IGF-1R expression levels. At baseline, both the percent of PBMCs that were COPs (%COP) and COP cell-surface IGF-1R expression correlated directly with several histomorphometric indices of bone formation in tetracycline-labeled transiliac biopsies. In treated subjects, both %COP and IGF-1R expression increased promptly after teriparatide, returning toward baseline by 18 months. Although neither baseline %COP nor increase in %COP after 3 months predicted the bone mineral density (BMD) response to teriparatide, the percent increase in IGF-1R expression on COPs at 3 months correlated directly with the BMD response to teriparatide. Additionally, lower IGF-1R expression after teriparatide was associated with higher body fat, suggesting links between teriparatide resistance, body composition, and the GH/IGF-1 axis. In conclusion, these assays may be useful to characterize bone remodeling noninvasively and may serve to predict early response to teriparatide and possibly other bone formation-stimulating medications. These new tools may also have utility in the mechanistic investigation of teriparatide resistance in premenopausal IOP and perhaps in other populations. \u00a9 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "Keywords": ["BONE HISTOMORPHOMETRY", "DXA", "IGF-1", "OSTEOBLASTS", "PREMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipose Tissue", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Biopsy", "Body Composition", "Bone Density", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Osteoblasts", "Osteogenesis", "Osteoporosis", "Premenopause", "Receptor, IGF Type 1", "Stem Cells", "Teriparatide", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adi", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kousteni", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brygida", "Last Name": "Bisikirska", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jayesh G", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "J Sanil", "Last Name": "Manavalan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert R", "Last Name": "Recker", "Affiliation": "Creighton University, Omaha, NE, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Lappe", "Affiliation": "Creighton University, Omaha, NE, USA."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Dempster", "Affiliation": "Helen Hayes Hospital, West Haverstraw, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Helen Hayes Hospital, West Haverstraw, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald J", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariana", "Last Name": "Bucovsky", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mafo", "Last Name": "Kamanda-Kosseh", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Stubby", "Affiliation": "Creighton University, Omaha, NE, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Shane", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research", "PubDate": "2017Jun"}, {"PMID": "27959858", "Title": "Regulation of Glucose Handling by the Skeleton: Insights From Mouse and Human Studies.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Glucose", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Mice", "Skeleton"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jian-Min", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Disease, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-tong University School of Medicine, and Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Disease, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Disease, Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Clifford J", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "Tufts University School of Medicine, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, ME."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Ducy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kousteni", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY gk2172@cumc.columbia.edu sk2836@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Gerard", "Last Name": "Karsenty", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, NY gk2172@cumc.columbia.edu sk2836@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Diabetes", "PubDate": "2016Nov"}, {"PMID": "27283956", "Title": "Abnormal Bone Acquisition With Early-Life HIV Infection: Role of Immune Activation and Senescent Osteogenic Precursors.", "Abstract": "Chronic immune activation associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may have negative consequences on bone acquisition in individuals infected with HIV early in life.

The LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), initially proposed to be a co-receptor for Wnt proteins, in fact favors bone formation by suppressing gut-serotonin synthesis. This function of Lrp5 occurring in the gut is independent of \u03b2-catenin activation in osteoblasts. However, it is unknown whether Lrp5 can act directly in osteoblast to influence other functions that require \u03b2-catenin signaling, particularly, the deregulation of hematopoiesis and leukemogenic properties of \u03b2-catenin activation in osteoblasts, that lead to development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using mice with gain-of-function (GOF) Lrp5 alleles (Lrp5(A214V)) that recapitulate the human high bone mass (HBM) phenotype, as well as patients with the T253I HBM Lrp5 mutation, we show here that Lrp5 GOF mutations in both humans and mice do not activate \u03b2-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. Consistent with a lack of \u03b2-catenin activation in their osteoblasts, Lrp5(A214V) mice have normal trilinear hematopoiesis. In contrast to leukemic mice with constitutive activation of \u03b2-catenin in osteoblasts (Ctnnb1(CAosb)), accumulation of early myeloid progenitors, a characteristic of AML, myeloid-blasts in blood, and segmented neutrophils or dysplastic megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, are not observed in Lrp5(A214V) mice. Likewise, peripheral blood count analysis in HBM patients showed normal hematopoiesis, normal percentage of myeloid cells, and lack of anemia. We conclude that Lrp5 GOF mutations do not activate \u03b2-catenin signaling in osteoblasts. As a result, myeloid lineage differentiation is normal in HBM patients and mice.

We hypothesized that osteoblasts, components of the niche involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, influence the fate of leukemic blasts. We show that osteoblast numbers decrease by 55% in myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Further, genetic depletion of osteoblasts in mouse models of acute leukemia increased circulating blasts and tumor engraftment in the marrow and spleen leading to higher tumor burden and shorter survival. Myelopoiesis increased and was coupled with a reduction in B lymphopoiesis and compromised erythropoiesis, suggesting that hematopoietic lineage/progression was altered. Treatment of mice with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia with a pharmacologic inhibitor of the synthesis of duodenal serotonin, a hormone suppressing osteoblast numbers, inhibited loss of osteoblasts. Maintenance of the osteoblast pool restored normal marrow function, reduced tumor burden, and prolonged survival. Leukemia prevention was attributable to maintenance of osteoblast numbers because inhibition of serotonin receptors alone in leukemic blasts did not affect leukemia progression. These results suggest that osteoblasts play a fundamental role in propagating leukemia in the marrow and may be a therapeutic target to induce hostility of the niche to leukemia blasts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Count", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Progression", "Hematopoiesis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Leukemia", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Osteoblasts", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Pyrimidines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Krevvata", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Barbara C", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Manavalan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Marta", "Last Name": "Galan-Diez", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Aruna", "Last Name": "Kode", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Brya Grace", "Last Name": "Matthews", "Affiliation": "Department of Reconstructive Sciences, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT;"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Chiyuan A", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Naomi", "Last Name": "Galili", "Affiliation": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes Center and."}, {"First Name": "Thomas L", "Last Name": "Nickolas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Dempster", "Affiliation": "Regional Bone Center, Helen Hayes Hospital, West Haverstraw, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Dougall", "Affiliation": "Amgen Inc., Seattle, WA;"}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Teruya-Feldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Aris N", "Last Name": "Economides", "Affiliation": "Bone and Cartilage Biology Group, Genome Engineering Technologies Group, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tarrytown, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Ivo", "Last Name": "Kalajzic", "Affiliation": "Department of Reconstructive Sciences, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT;"}, {"First Name": "Azra", "Last Name": "Raza", "Affiliation": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes Center and."}, {"First Name": "Ellin", "Last Name": "Berman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, and."}, {"First Name": "Govind", "Last Name": "Bhagat", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kousteni", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY;"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2014Oct30"}, {"PMID": "24429522", "Title": "Leukaemogenesis induced by an activating \u03b2-catenin mutation in osteoblasts.", "Abstract": "Cells of the osteoblast lineage affect the homing and the number of long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells, haematopoietic stem cell mobilization and lineage determination and B cell lymphopoiesis. Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice. However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of \u03b2-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated \u03b2-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased \u03b2-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anemia", "Animals", "Base Sequence", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Nucleus", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Chromosome Aberrations", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Jagged-1 Protein", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Ligands", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mutation", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Myeloid Cells", "Osteoblasts", "Receptors, Notch", "Serrate-Jagged Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Microenvironment", "beta Catenin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aruna", "Last Name": "Kode", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Manavalan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ioanna", "Last Name": "Mosialou", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Govind", "Last Name": "Bhagat", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chozha V", "Last Name": "Rathinam", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Na", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Khiabanian", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics and Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics and Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vundavalli V", "Last Name": "Murty", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Institute for Cancer Genetics Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Brum", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC, Dr. Molewaterplein 50, NL-3015 GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Naomi", "Last Name": "Galili", "Affiliation": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes Center, Columbia University New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine Hematology & Oncology Columbia University New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Teruya-Feldstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Azra", "Last Name": "Raza", "Affiliation": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes Center, Columbia University New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raul", "Last Name": "Rabadan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics and Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellin", "Last Name": "Berman", "Affiliation": "Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kousteni", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA [2] Department of Physiology & Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2014Feb13"}]
