Methods: Fifteen ophthalmologists were recruited to each examine 20 randomly selected OCT reports and evaluate the likelihood of glaucoma for each report on a scale of 0-100. Eye movements were collected using a Pupil Labs Core eye-tracker. Fixation heat maps were generated using fixation data. Results: A model trained with traditional saliency mapping resulted in a correlation coefficient (CC) value of 0.208, a Normalized Scanpath Saliency (NSS) value of 0.8172, a Kullback-Leibler (KLD) value of 2.573, and a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.169. Conclusions: The TranSalNet model was able to predict fixations within certain regions of the OCT report with reasonable accuracy, but more data is needed to improve model accuracy. Future steps include increasing data collection, improving quality of data, and modifying the model architecture.", "Keywords": ["Deep learning", "optical coherence tomography", "saliency prediction"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mingyang", "Last Name": "Zang", "Affiliation": "Columbia University New York NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Pooja", "Last Name": "Mukund", "Affiliation": "Columbia University New York NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Britney", "Last Name": "Forsyth", "Affiliation": "Columbia University New York NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Laine", "Affiliation": "Columbia University New York NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaveri A", "Last Name": "Thakoor", "Affiliation": "Columbia University New York NY 10027 USA."}], "Journal": "IEEE open journal of engineering in medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "37841006", "Title": "Extracting decision-making features from the unstructured eye movements of clinicians on glaucoma OCT reports and developing AI models to classify expertise.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the eye movement patterns of ophthalmologists with varying expertise levels during the assessment of optical coherence tomography (OCT) reports for glaucoma detection. Objectives included evaluating eye gaze metrics and patterns as a function of ophthalmic education, deriving novel features from eye-tracking, and developing binary classification models for disease detection and expertise differentiation. Thirteen ophthalmology residents, fellows, and clinicians specializing in glaucoma participated in the study. Junior residents had less than 1\u2009year of experience, while senior residents had 2-3\u2009years of experience. The expert group consisted of fellows and faculty with over 3 to 30+ years of experience. Each participant was presented with a set of 20 Topcon OCT reports (10 healthy and 10 glaucomatous) and was asked to determine the presence or absence of glaucoma and rate their confidence of diagnosis. The eye movements of each participant were recorded as they diagnosed the reports using a Pupil Labs Core eye tracker. Expert ophthalmologists exhibited more refined and focused eye fixations, particularly on specific regions of the OCT reports, such as the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) probability map and circumpapillary RNFL b-scan. The binary classification models developed using the derived features demonstrated high accuracy up to 94.0% in differentiating between expert and novice clinicians. The derived features and trained binary classification models hold promise for improving the accuracy of glaucoma detection and distinguishing between expert and novice ophthalmologists. These findings have implications for enhancing ophthalmic education and for the development of effective diagnostic tools.", "Keywords": ["eye-tracking", "fixations", "glaucoma", "neural networks", "optical coherence tomography", "unsupervised clustering"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Akerman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sanmati", "Last Name": "Choudhary", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "Edward S.

Recent work suggests that the OCT probability (p-) maps, also known as deviation maps, can play a key role in an OCT-based method. However, artifacts seen on the p-maps of healthy control eyes can resemble patterns of damage due to glaucoma. We document in section 2 that these glaucoma-like artifacts are relatively common and are probably due to normal anatomical variations in healthy eyes. We also introduce a simple anatomical artifact model based upon known anatomical variations to help distinguish these artifacts from actual glaucomatous damage. In section 3, we apply this model to an OCT-based method for detecting glaucoma that starts with an examination of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) p-map. While this method requires a judgment by the clinician, sections 4 and 5 describe automated methods that do not. In section 4, the simple model helps explain the relatively poor performance of commonly employed summary statistics, including circumpapillary RNFL thickness. In section 5, the model helps account for the success of an AI deep learning model, which in turn validates our focus on the RNFL p-map. Finally, in section 6 we consider the implications of OCT-based methods for the clinic, research, screening, and the development of AI models.", "Keywords": ["Glaucoma", "OCT", "Optical coherence tomography", "Retinal ganglion cell layer", "Retinal nerve fiber layer"], "MeSH terms": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Nerve Fibers", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald C", "Last Name": "Hood", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA; Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA, 10032.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has become a prime technique for AMD diagnosis, specifically for late-stage neovascular (NV) AMD. Such technologies generate massive amounts of data, challenging to parse by experts alone, transforming artificial intelligence into a valuable partner. We describe a deep learning (DL) approach which achieves multi-class detection of non-AMD vs. non-neovascular (NNV) AMD vs. NV AMD from a combination of OCTA, OCT structure, 2D b-scan flow images, and high definition (HD) 5-line b-scan cubes; DL also detects ocular biomarkers indicative of AMD risk. Multimodal data were used as input to 2D-3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Both for CNNs and experts, choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy were found to be important biomarkers for AMD. CNNs predict biomarkers with accuracy up to 90.2% (positive-predictive-value up to 75.8%). Just as experts rely on multimodal data to diagnose AMD, CNNs also performed best when trained on multiple inputs combined. Detection of AMD and its biomarkers from OCTA data via CNNs has tremendous potential to expedite screening of early and late-stage AMD patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Choroidal Neovascularization", "Deep Learning", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Expert Testimony", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Predictive Value of Tests", "ROC Curve", "Risk", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kaveri A", "Last Name": "Thakoor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA. k.thakoor@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jiaang", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darius", "Last Name": "Bordbar", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

Problematic, however, is that pupil changes can be due to non-cognitive factors, for example luminance changes in the environment, accommodation and movement. In this paper we consider how by modeling the response of the pupil in real-world environments we can capture the non-cognitive related changes and remove these to extract a residual signal which is a better index of cognition and performance. Specifically, we utilize sequence measures such as fixation position, duration, saccades, and blink-related information as inputs to a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model for predicting subsequent pupil diameter. We build and evaluate the model for a task where subjects are watching educational videos and subsequently asked questions based on the content. Compared to commonly-used models for this task, the RNN had the lowest errors rates in predicting subsequent pupil dilation given sequence data. Most importantly was how the model output related to subjects' cognitive performance as assessed by a post-viewing test. Consistent with our hypothesis that the model captures non-cognitive pupil dynamics, we found (1) the model's root-mean square error was less for lower performing subjects than for those having better performance on the post-viewing test, (2) the residuals of the RNN (LSTM) model had the highest correlation with subject post-viewing test scores and (3) the residuals had the highest discriminability (assessed via area under the ROC curve, AUC) for classifying high and low test performers, compared to the true pupil size or the RNN model predictions. This suggests that deep learning sequence models may be good for separating components of pupil responses that are linked to luminance and accommodation from those that are linked to cognition and arousal.", "Keywords": ["eye tracking", "pupil diameter", "pupil response", "recurrent neural network", "video viewing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sharath", "Last Name": "Koorathota", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kaveri", "Last Name": "Thakoor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Linbi", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yaoli", "Last Name": "Mao", "Affiliation": "Department of Cognitive Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Adelman", "Affiliation": "Fovea Inc., New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Sajda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "32818101", "Title": "An Automated Method for Assessing Topographical Structure-Function Agreement in Abnormal Glaucomatous Regions.", "Abstract": "To develop an automated/objective method for topographically comparing abnormal regions on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field (VF) tests of eyes with early glaucoma.", "Keywords": ["function", "glaucoma", "optical coherence tomography", "perimetry", "structure", "visual fields"], "MeSH terms": ["Glaucoma", "Humans", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emmanouil", "Last Name": "Tsamis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikhil K", "Last Name": "Bommakanti", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaveri A", "Last Name": "Thakoor", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carlos Gustavo", "Last Name": "De Moraes", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald C", "Last Name": "Hood", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Translational vision science & technology", "PubDate": "2020Mar"}]
