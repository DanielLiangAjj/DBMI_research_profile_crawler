[{"PMID": "36198697", "Title": "Benthic animal-borne sensors and citizen science combine to validate ocean modelling.", "Abstract": "Developments in animal electronic tagging and tracking have transformed the field of movement ecology, but interest is also growing in the contributions of tagged animals to oceanography. Animal-borne sensors can address data gaps, improve ocean model skill and support model validation, but previous studies in this area have focused almost exclusively on satellite-telemetered seabirds and seals. Here, for the first time, we develop the use of benthic species as animal oceanographers by combining archival (depth and temperature) data from animal-borne tags, passive acoustic telemetry and citizen-science mark-recapture records from 2016-17 for the Critically Endangered flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) in Scotland. By comparing temperature observations to predictions from the West Scotland Coastal Ocean Modelling System, we quantify model skill and empirically validate an independent model update. The results from bottom-temperature and temperature-depth profile validation (5,324 observations) fill a key data gap in Scotland. For predictions in 2016, we identified a consistent warm bias (mean\u2009=\u20090.53\u00a0\u00b0C) but a subsequent model update reduced bias by an estimated 109% and improved model skill. This study uniquely demonstrates the use of benthic animal-borne sensors and citizen-science data for ocean model validation, broadening the range of animal oceanographers in aquatic environments.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Citizen Science", "Oceanography", "Oceans and Seas", "Seals, Earless", "Temperature"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Lavender", "Affiliation": "Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK. el72@st-andrews.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Dmitry", "Last Name": "Aleynik", "Affiliation": "Scottish Association for Marine Science, Oban, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jane", "Last Name": "Dodd", "Affiliation": "NatureScot, Oban, UK."}, {"First Name": "Janine", "Last Name": "Illian", "Affiliation": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "James", "Affiliation": "Scottish Oceans Institute, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sophie", "Last Name": "Smout", "Affiliation": "Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Thorburn", "Affiliation": "Scottish Oceans Institute, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2022Oct05"}, {"PMID": "34841273", "Title": "SpineRacks and SpinalJ for efficient analysis of neurons in a 3D reference atlas of the mouse spinal cord.", "Abstract": "Spatial analysis of spinal neurons is currently limited by a lack of tools for efficient preparation and imaging of the whole spinal cord (SC) and the absence of a 3D reference atlas.

That these divergent responses can be activated in the same cell raises the question of how the BMP-dependent signaling apparatus is manipulated to produce chemotropic and transcriptional signals. RNA interference and site-directed mutagenesis were used to explore functional and structural BMP receptor requirements for BMP7-evoked chemotropic activity. We show that specific type II BMP receptor subunits, ActRIIA and BMPR2, are required for BMP7-induced growth cone collapse in developing spinal neurons and for chemotaxis of monocytes. Reintroduction of wild-type ActRIIA into monocytic cells lacking endogenous ActRIIA restores BMP7-evoked chemotaxis, whereas expression of an ActRIIA K76A receptor variant fails to rescue. BMP7-evoked Smad-dependent signaling is unaffected by either ActRIIA knockdown or expression of the ActRIIA K76A variant. In contrast, BMP7-evoked PI3K-dependent signaling is significantly disturbed in the presence of ActRIIA K76A. These results support a model for selective engagement of chemotropic BMPs with type II BMP receptors, through specific residues, that results in strict regulation of PI3K-dependent signal transduction.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.", "Keywords": ["ActRIIA", "BMP7", "Chemotaxis", "Growth cone collapse", "PI3K"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeanette C", "Last Name": "Perron", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA perronj@stjohns.edu."}, {"First Name": "Alcina A", "Last Name": "Rodrigues", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nirupama", "Last Name": "Surubholta", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jane", "Last Name": "Dodd", "Affiliation": "Departments of Physiology & Cellular Biophysics and Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Biology open", "PubDate": "2019Jul16"}]
