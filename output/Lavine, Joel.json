[{"PMID": "37623872", "Title": "Multi-Modality, Multi-Dimensional Characterization of Pediatric Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.", "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a multifaceted disease that progresses through multiple phases; it involves metabolic as well as structural changes. These alterations can be measured directly or indirectly through blood, non-invasive imaging, and/or tissue analyses. While some studies have evaluated the correlations between two sets of measurements (e.g., histopathology with cross-sectional imaging or blood biomarkers), the interrelationships, if any, among histopathology, clinical blood profiles, cross-sectional imaging, and metabolomics in a pediatric cohort remain unknown. We created a multiparametric clinical MRI-histopathologic NMR network map of pediatric NAFLD through multimodal correlation networks, in order to gain insight into how these different sets of measurements are related. We found that leptin and other blood markers were correlated with many other measurements; however, upon filtering out the blood biomarkers, the network was decomposed into three independent hubs centered around histopathological features, each with associated MRI and plasma metabolites. These multi-modality maps could serve as a framework for characterizing disease status and progression and could potentially guide medical interventions.", "Keywords": ["biological networks", "magnetic resonance imaging", "metabolomics", "multimodal correlation network", "systems analysis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Neema", "Last Name": "Jamshidi", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiological Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alborz", "Last Name": "Feizi", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claude B", "Last Name": "Sirlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel E", "Last Name": "Lavine", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Kuo", "Affiliation": "Medical AI Laboratory Program, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "Journal": "Metabolites", "PubDate": "2023Aug08"}, {"PMID": "36528237", "Title": "Defining the serum proteomic signature of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.", "Abstract": "Despite recent progress, non-invasive tests for the diagnostic assessment and monitoring of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain an unmet need.

Here, we identified that increased expression of the Notch ligand Jagged1 (JAG1) tracked with Notch activation and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS) in human liver biopsy specimens and mouse NASH models. The increase in Jag1 was mediated by hepatocyte Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in pericentral hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-specific Jag1 overexpression exacerbated fibrosis in mice fed a high-fat diet or a NASH-provoking diet rich in palmitate, cholesterol, and sucrose and reversed the protection afforded by hepatocyte-specific TLR4 deletion, whereas hepatocyte-specific Jag1 knockout mice were protected from NASH-induced liver fibrosis. To test therapeutic potential of this biology, we designed a Jag1-directed antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and a hepatocyte-specific N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-modified siRNA, both of which reduced NASH diet-induced liver fibrosis in mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that increased hepatocyte Jagged1 is the proximal hit for Notch-induced liver fibrosis in mice and suggest translational potential of Jagged1 inhibitors in patients with NASH.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Jagged-1 Protein", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Junjie", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Changyu", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaobo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "KyeongJin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Bartolome", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paola", "Last Name": "Dongiovanni", "Affiliation": "General Medicine and Metabolic Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan 20122, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Katherine P", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Valenti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano, Milan 20122, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Carrer", "Affiliation": "Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Carlsbad, CA 92010, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thorsten", "Last Name": "Sadowski", "Affiliation": "Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt 65926, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel E", "Last Name": "Lavine", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. up2104@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2021Jun23"}, {"PMID": "32882372", "Title": "rs641738C>T near MBOAT7 is associated with liver fat, ALT and fibrosis in NAFLD: A meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "A common genetic variant near MBOAT7 (rs641738C>T) has been previously associated with hepatic fat and advanced histology in NAFLD; however, these findings have not been consistently replicated in the literature.

Here, we report that hepatocyte Notch activity tracks with disease severity and treatment response in patients with NASH and is similarly increased in a mouse model of diet-induced NASH and liver fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function mouse models showed attenuated NASH-associated liver fibrosis, demonstrating causality to obesity-induced liver pathology. Conversely, forced activation of hepatocyte Notch induced fibrosis in both chow- and NASH diet-fed mice by increasing Sox9-dependent Osteopontin (Opn) expression and secretion from hepatocytes, which activate resident hepatic stellate cells. In a cross-sectional study, we found that OPN explains the positive correlation between liver Notch activity and fibrosis stage in patients. Further, we developed a Notch inhibitor [Nicastrin antisense oligonucleotide (Ncst ASO)] that reduced fibrosis in NASH diet-fed mice. In summary, these studies demonstrate the pathological role and therapeutic accessibility of the maladaptive hepatocyte Notch response in NASH-associated liver fibrosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

"Title": "Hepatic Nuclear Receptor Expression Associates with Features of Histology in Pediatric Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.", "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children and adults. This study examined the relationship between hepatic nuclear receptor (NR) expression and histologic features of NAFLD. Drugs targeting a variety of NRs for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are in clinical trials. Liver messenger RNA was isolated from 40 children (10-19 years) undergoing end-of-treatment biopsy in the Treatment of NAFLD in Children (TONIC) trial. High-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction assayed NR messenger RNA. Cluster analysis was used to group 36 NRs, and NR levels were related to histologic measures of specific NAFLD features. Cluster analysis determined five groupings of NRs. Significant (P < 0.05) differential expressions of specific NRs associated with histologic measures include farnesoid X receptor alpha and retinoic acid receptor (RAR\u03b2 and RAR\u03b2) for steatosis; estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3 (PPAR\u03b33) for hepatocellular ballooning; ER and PPAR\u03b32 for lobular inflammation; PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b31/\u03b32, ER\u03b1, constitutive androstane receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1, RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b21, retinoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, thyroid hormone receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2, and nuclear receptor related-1 for fibrosis; and ER\u03b1 and RAR\u03b2/\u03b21/\u03b1 for diagnosis of NASH. Conclusion: Differential expression of specific NRs correlates with histologic severity of specific NAFLD features. These NRs are pleiotropic transactivators regulating basal metabolic functions and inflammatory responses. Derangement of activity of these receptors in NAFLD provides a rationale for exploiting their ability with receptor-specific ligands to ameliorate NASH and its consequences.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erin E", "Last Name": "Elbel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics Columbia University New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Joel E", "Last Name": "Lavine", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics Columbia University New York NY."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Downes", "Affiliation": "Gene Expression Laboratory The Salk Institute La Jolla CA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Van Natta", "Affiliation": "Bloomberg School of Public Health Johns Hopkins University Baltimore MD."}, {"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Gene Expression Laboratory The Salk Institute La Jolla CA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey B", "Last Name": "Schwimmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics University of California,San Diego San Diego CA."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Behling", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics University of California,San Diego San Diego CA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Brunt", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology Washington University St. Louis MO."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Tonascia", "Affiliation": "Bloomberg School of Public Health Johns Hopkins University Baltimore MD."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Gene Expression Laboratory The Salk Institute La Jolla CA."}], "Journal": "Hepatology communications", "PubDate": "2018Oct"}, {"PMID": "30026388", "Title": "Exome sequencing of an adolescent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease identifies a clinically actionable case of Wilson disease.", "Abstract": "Diagnostic whole-exome sequencing has proven highly successful in a range of rare diseases, particularly early-onset genetic conditions. In more common conditions, however, exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes remains the exception. Here we describe a patient initially diagnosed with a common, complex liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who was determined to have Wilson disease (WD) upon research-related exome sequencing. The patient presented as a 14.5-yr-old adolescent with chronically elevated aminotransferases, normal ceruloplasmin, and histologic examination consistent with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. He was enrolled in a large longitudinal study of patients with NAFLD and was found to have WD by exome sequencing performed 4 yr later. This new diagnosis, confirmed clinically by 24 h urine copper quantification, led to a change in the therapy from lifestyle counseling to directed treatment with d-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent. In this case, the likelihood of making the correct diagnosis and thereby choosing the appropriate treatment was increased by exome sequencing and careful interpretation. This example illustrates the utility of exome sequencing diagnostically in more common conditions not currently considered as targets for genome-wide evaluation and adds to a growing body of evidence that patients diagnosed with more common conditions often in fact have rarer genetically determined syndromes that have escaped clinical detection.", "Keywords": ["increased urinary copper concentration"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Chelating Agents", "Copper", "Copper-Transporting ATPases", "Diagnostic Errors", "Exome", "Hepatolenticular Degeneration", "Humans", "Liver", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Penicillamine", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Wattacheril", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick R", "Last Name": "Shea", "Affiliation": "Institute of Genomic Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saeed", "Last Name": "Mohammad", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Ann and Robert Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cynthia", "Last Name": "Behling", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 90293, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vimla", "Last Name": "Aggarwal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Institute of Genomic Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura A", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine P", "Last Name": "Yates", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joy", "Last Name": "Ito", "Affiliation": "Ann and Robert Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Fishbein", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Ann and Robert Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Stong", "Affiliation": "Institute of Genomic Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel E", "Last Name": "Lavine", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Children's Hospital of New York, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "Institute of Genomic Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Cold Spring Harbor molecular case studies", "PubDate": "2018Oct"}, {"PMID": "29903531", "Title": "Pediatric Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in New York City: An Autopsy Study.", "Abstract": "To assess the prevalence and severity of nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) in children in a diverse population sample in New York City.", "Keywords": ["hepatic transaminases", "nonalcoholic steatohepatitis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Autopsy", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Liver", "Male", "New York City", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Prevalence", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Danielle M", "Last Name": "Fernandes", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Vivek", "Last Name": "Pantangi", "Affiliation": "CHCLC-RiverStone Clinic, Springfield, OR."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Azam", "Affiliation": "St. George's University Hospital, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Marcela", "Last Name": "Salomao", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ."}, {"First Name": "Alina C", "Last Name": "Iuga", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jay H", "Last Name": "Lefkowitch", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Farmington, CT."}, {"First Name": "Raffaella", "Last Name": "Morotti", "Affiliation": "Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT."}, {"First Name": "Joel E", "Last Name": "Lavine", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ali A", "Last Name": "Mencin", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.

The majority of NAFLD subjects do not have NASH and do not carry a significant risk for liver-related adverse outcomes (cirrhosis and mortality). Globally, the prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25%. In Asia, a gradient of high to low prevalence rates is noted from urban to rural areas. Given the prevalence of NAFLD, the clinical and economic burden of NAFLD and NASH can be substantial. With increasing recognition of NASH as an important liver disease, the diagnosis of NASH still requires a liver biopsy that is suboptimal. Although liver biopsy is the most accurate modality to diagnose and stage the severity of NASH, this method suffers from being invasive, costly, associated with potential complications, and plagued with interobserver variability of individual pathological features. A number of noninvasive modalities to diagnose NASH and stage liver fibrosis are being developed. These modalities include predictive models (NAFLD fibrosis score) and serum biomarkers such as enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF). Other tests are based on radiological techniques, such as transient elastography (TE) or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), which are used to estimate liver stiffness as a potential surrogate of hepatic fibrosis. Although a dynamic field of research, most of these diagnostic modalities have area under the curve ranging between 0.76 and 0.90%, with MRE having the best predictive performance. In summary, developing safe and easily accessible noninvasive modalities to accurately diagnose and monitor NASH and associated fibrosis is of utmost importance in clinical practice and clinical research. These tests are not only important to risk stratify subjects at the greatest risk for progressive liver disease, but also to serve as appropriate surrogate endpoints for therapeutic clinical trials of NASH.

Other than lifestyle modification through diet and exercise, there are currently no other approved treatments for NASH/NAFLD. Although weight loss can be effective, it is difficult to achieve and sustain. In contrast, bariatric surgery can improve metabolic conditions associated with NAFLD, and has been shown to improve liver histology. To have approved regimens for the treatment of NASH/NAFLD, several issues must be addressed. First, all stakeholders must agree on the most appropriate clinical trial endpoints for NASH. Currently, resolution of NASH (without worsening fibrosis) or reduction of fibrosis stage (without worsening NASH) are the accepted endpoints by the regulatory authorities. It is important to recognize the prognostic implication of histologic features of NASH. In this context, although histologic NASH has been associated with advanced fibrosis, it is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality. In contrast, there are significant data to suggest that fibrosis stage is the only robust and independent predictor of liver-related mortality. In addition to the primary endpoints, several important secondary endpoints, including noninvasive biomarkers, long-term outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes must be considered.

As the most common chronic liver disease in children and adults, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been identified as a source of significant interindividual variation in hepatic drug metabolism. Compared with adults, children present age-related differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of fatty liver disease severity on the activity of a variety of CYP enzymes in children and adolescents. Healthy and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pediatric subjects aged 12-21 years inclusive received an oral cocktail of four probe drugs: caffeine (CYP1A2, 100 mg), omeprazole (CYP2C19, 20 mg), losartan (CYP2C9, 25 mg), and midazolam (CYP3A4, 2 mg). Venous blood and urine were collected before administration and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. Concentrations of the parent drugs and CYP-specific metabolites were quantified in plasma and urine using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. In plasma, the decreased metabolic area under the curve (AUC) ratio, defined as the metabolite AUC to parent AUC, of omeprazole indicated significant decreases of CYP2C19 (P = 0.002) enzymatic activities in NASH adolescents, while the urine analyses did not show significant differences and were highly variable. A comparison between the present in vivo pediatric studies and a previous ex vivo study in adults indicates distinct differences in the activities of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.

However, data in children are limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of MRE for the detection of fibrosis and advanced fibrosis in children with NAFLD and to assess agreement between manual and novel automated reading methods. We performed a prospective, multicenter study of two-dimensional (2D) MRE in children with NAFLD. MR elastograms were analyzed manually at two reading centers, and using a new automated technique. Analysis using each approach was done independently. Correlations were determined between MRE analysis methods and fibrosis stage. Thresholds for classifying the presence of fibrosis and of advanced fibrosis were computed and cross-validated. In 90 children with a mean age of 13.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 years, median hepatic stiffness was 2.35 kPa. Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly correlated with each other (r\u2009=\u20090.83). All three analyses were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.53; center 2, \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.55; and automated analysis, \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.52; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Overall cross-validated accuracy for detecting any fibrosis was 72.2% for all methods (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.8%-81.1%). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis was 88.9% (95% CI, 80.5%-94.5%) for center 1, 90.0% (95% CI, 81.9%-95.3%) for center 2, and 86.7% (95% CI, 77.9%-92.9%) for automated
