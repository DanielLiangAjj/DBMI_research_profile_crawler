We also compared which of the currently available tests (3D-CAM, CAM-ICU, and NuDESC) is the best to use in PACU. This was a post hoc secondary analysis of data from the Alpha Max study which involved 200 patients aged over 60 years, scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia lasting more than 2 h. These patients were assessed for delirium at 30 min following arrival in the PACU, if they were adequately arousable (Richmond Agitation Sedation Score \u2265 -2). All tests for delirium diagnosis (3D-CAM, CAM-ICU, and NuDESC) and the sub-domains assessed were compared to understand temporal recovery of neurocognitive domains. These data were also analysed to determine the best predictor of PACU delirium. We found the incidence of PACU delirium was 35% (3D-CAM). Individual cognitive domains were affected differently. Few individuals had vigilance deficits (6.5%, n = 10 CAM-ICU) or disorganized thinking (19% CAM-ICU, 27.5% 3D-CAM), in contrast attention deficits were common (72%, n = 144) and most of these patients (89.5%, n = 129) were not sedated (RASS \u2265 -2). CAM-ICU (27%) and NuDESC (52.8%) detected fewer cases of PACU delirium compared to 3D-CAM. In conclusion, return of neurocognitive function is a stepwise process; Vigilance and Disorganized Thinking are the earliest cognitive functions to return to baseline and lingering deficits in these domains could indicate an abnormal cognitive recovery. Attention deficits are relatively common at 30 min in the PACU even in individuals who appear to be awake.

Mbnl2 KO mice exhibited delayed recovery following sevoflurane, delayed emergence and recovery from zolpidem, and enhanced sleep time at baseline that was modulated by flumazenil. A significantly higher proportion of Mbnl2 KO mice also loss their righting reflex [loss of righting reflex (LORR)] from a standard diazepam dose. We further examined whether MBNL2 depletion affects total GABAA-R mRNA subunit levels and validated RNA-sequencing data of mis-spliced Gabrg2, whose isoform ratios are known to regulate GABA sensitivity and associated behaviors. While no other GABAA-R subunit mRNA levels tested were altered in Mbnl2 KO mouse prefrontal cortex, Gabrg2S/L mRNA ratio levels were significantly altered. Taken together, our findings indicate that loss of MBNL2 function affects GABAergic function in a mouse model of myotonic dystrophy (DM1).", "Keywords": ["GABA", "Mbnl2", "Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1", "anesthesia", "benzodiazepine", "hypersomnia"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Diazepam", "Disease Models, Animal", "Flumazenil", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myotonic Dystrophy", "RNA", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Sevoflurane", "Zolpidem", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kamyra S", "Last Name": "Edokpolor", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322."}, {"First Name": "Anwesha", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322."}, {"First Name": "Zachary T", "Last Name": "McEachin", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322."}, {"First Name": "Jingsheng", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Kosti", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322."}, {"First Name": "Juan D", "Last Name": "Arboleda", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Neurogenetics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Eric T", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Neurogenetics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610."}, {"First Name": "Gary J", "Last Name": "Bassell", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322 gary.bassell@emory.edu."}], "Journal": "eNeuro", "PubDate": "2022Sep-Oct"}, {"PMID": "36049381", "Title": "The absence of dominant alpha-oscillatory EEG activity during emergence from delta-dominant anesthesia predicts neurocognitive impairment- results from a prospective observational trial.", "Abstract": "Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are common complications after surgery under general anesthesia.

Besides its use in evaluating hypnotic states, neurophysiologic reactions to noxious stimulation can also be observed in the EEG. Recognising and understanding these responses could help optimise intraoperative analgesic management. This review describes three types of changes in the EEG induced by noxious stimulation when the patient is under general anaesthesia: (1) beta arousal, (2) (paradoxical) delta arousal, and (3) alpha dropout. Beta arousal is an increase in EEG power in the beta-frequency band (12-25 Hz) in response to noxious stimulation, especially at lower doses of anaesthesia drugs in the absence of opioids. It is usually indicative of a cortical depolarisation and increased cortical activity. At higher concentrations of anaesthetic drug, and with insufficient opioids, delta arousal (increased power in the delta band [0.5-4 Hz]) and alpha dropout (decreased alpha power [8-12 Hz]) are associated with noxious stimuli. The mechanisms of delta arousal are not well understood, but the midbrain reticular formation seems to play a role. Alpha dropout may indicate a return of thalamocortical communication, from an idling mode to an operational mode.

It can occur while delivering high-dose anesthesia. Current research suggests an association between BSUPP and the occurrence of postoperative delirium in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and beyond. We investigated burst micro-architecture to further understand how age influences the neurophysiology of this pharmacologically-induced state. We analyzed a subset of EEG recordings (n = 102) taken from a larger data set previously published. We selected the initial burst that followed a visually identified \"silent second,\" i.e., at least 1 s of iso-electricity of the EEG during propofol induction. We derived the (normalized) power spectral density [(n)PSD], the alpha band power, the maximum amplitude, the maximum slope of the EEG as well as the permutation entropy (PeEn) for the first 1.5 s of the initial burst of each patient. In the old patients >65 years, we observed significantly lower (p < 0.001) EEG power in the 1-15 Hz range. In general, their EEG contained a significantly higher amount of faster oscillations (>15 Hz). Alpha band power (p < 0.001), EEG amplitude (p = 0.001), and maximum EEG slope (p = 0.045) all significantly decreased with age, whereas PeEn increased (p = 0.008). Hence, we can describe an age-related change in features during EEG burst suppression. Sub-group analysis revealed no change in results based on pre-medication. These EEG changes add knowledge to the impact of age on cortical synaptic activity. In addition to a reduction in EEG amplitude, age-associated burst features can complicate the identification of excessive anesthetic administration in patients under general anesthesia. Knowledge of these neurophysiologic changes may not only improve anesthesia care through improved detection of burst suppression but might also provide insight into changes in neuronal network organization in patients at risk for age-related neurocognitive problems.", "Keywords": ["burst suppression", "elderly", "electroencephalography (EEG)", "general anesthesia", "monitoring"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Kratzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Obert", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gerhard", "Last Name": "Schneider", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Kreuzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, School of Medicine, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in systems neuroscience", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33291462", "Title": "Sleep/Wake Behavior and EEG Signatures of the TgF344-AD Rat Model at the Prodromal Stage.", "Abstract": "Transgenic modification of the two most common genes (APPsw, PS1\u0394E9) related to familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) in rats has produced a rodent model that develops pathognomonic signs of AD without genetic tau-protein modification.

We discovered that AD rats had more sleep-wake transitions and an increased probability of shorter REM and NREM bouts. AD rats also expressed a more uniform distribution of the relative spectral power. Through analysis of information content in the EEG using entropy of difference, AD animals demonstrated less EEG information during WAKE, but more information during NREM. This seems to indicate a limited range of changes in EEG activity that could be caused by an AD-induced change in inhibitory network function as reflected by increased GABAAR-\u03b22 expression but no increase in GAD-67 in AD animals.

Our results showed that the rank order of the emergence latency after intraperitoneal propofol, PRO, exposure was forelimb movement\u2009<\u2009sigh\u2009<\u2009blink\u2009<\u2009mastication\u2009<\u2009neck extension\u2009<\u2009RORR, while after inhaled isoflurane, ISO, anesthesia the sequence was changed as sigh\u2009<\u2009blink\u2009<\u2009mastication\u2009<\u2009forelimb movement\u2009<\u2009neck extension\u2009<\u2009RORR in both male and female rats. Moreover, the latency to emergence after PRO in female rats was significantly higher than male rats, although following ISO there was no difference between the sexes (P\u2009<\u20090.001; P\u2009>\u20090.05, respectively). Open-field testing revealed no difference in PRO and ISO spontaneous locomotor activity due to drug administration (P\u2009>\u20090.05). These two anesthetics presented different emergence sequences. Although clinical data suggests that females arouse faster than males from anesthesia with propofol, our intraperitoneal technique in a rodent model had the opposite effect. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated increased absorption of injected propofol for the female rats in our study, emphasizing the role of sexual dimorphism in drug distribution in rodents. Despite these pharmacokinetic differences, the pharmacodynamic effects of the drugs were remarkably consistent among both sexes through emergence.", "Keywords": ["Emergence", "Isoflurane", "Propofol", "Rat", "Sex-differences"], "MeSH terms": ["Anesthesia", "Anesthetics, General", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Female", "Humans", "Injections, Intraperitoneal", "Isoflurane", "Male", "Movement", "Propofol", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Sex Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mohammed Taghi", "Last Name": "Mansouri", "Affiliation": "Neuroanesthesia Laboratory, Atlanta VA Medical Center/Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Fidler", "Affiliation": "Neuroanesthesia Laboratory, Atlanta VA Medical Center/Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qing Cheng", "Last Name": "Meng", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roderic G", "Last Name": "Eckenhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Neuroanesthesia Laboratory, Atlanta VA Medical Center/Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Once assumed to be a purely passive process, spontaneously occurring as residual levels of anesthetics dwindle below a critical value, emergence from general anesthesia has been reconsidered as an active and controllable process. Emergence is driven by mechanisms that can be distinct from entry to the anesthetized state. In this narrative review, we focus on the burgeoning scientific understanding of anesthetic emergence, summarizing current knowledge of the neurotransmitter, neuromodulators, and neuronal groups that prime the brain as it prepares for its journey back from oblivion.
