Stasimon/Tmem41b has also been linked to the function of sensory-motor circuits and the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy. However, the early embryonic lethality of constitutive knockout in mice has hindered the analysis of spatial and temporal requirements of Stasimon/Tmem41b in vivo. To address this, we developed a novel mouse line harboring a conditional knockout allele of the Stasimon/Tmem41b gene in which exon 4 has been flanked by loxP sites (Stas/Tmem41bCKO). Cre-mediated recombination of Stas/Tmem41bCKO generates a functionally null allele (Stas/Tmem41b\u03944) resulting in loss of protein expression and embryonic lethality in the homozygous mouse mutant. Here, using a ubiquitously expressed, tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase in the homozygous Stas/Tmem41bCKO mice, we demonstrate that postnatal depletion of Stasimon/Tmem41b rapidly arrests weight gain in adult mice and causes motor dysfunction and death approximately three weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, we show that depletion of Stasimon/Tmem41b severely affects cell proliferation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

SMA is a consequence of low levels of SMN protein and small molecules that can increase SMN expression are of considerable interest as potential therapeutics. Previous studies have shown that both 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) and trichostatin A (TSA) increase SMN expression in dermal fibroblasts derived from SMA patients. AR42 is a 4PBA-tethered TSA derivative that is a very potent histone deacetylase inhibitor. SMA patient fibroblasts were treated with either AR42, AR19 (a related analogue), 4PBA, TSA or vehicle for 5\u00a0days and then immunostained for SMN localization. AR42 as well as 4PBA and TSA increased the number of SMN-positive nuclear gems in a dose-dependent manner while AR19 did not show marked changes in gem numbers. While gem number was increased in AR42-treated SMA fibroblasts, there were no significant changes in FL-SMN mRNA or SMN protein. The neuroprotective effect of this compound was then assessed in SMN\u03947 SMA (SMN2+/+;SMN\u03947+/+;mSmn-/-) mice. Oral administration of AR42 prior to disease onset increased the average lifespan of SMN\u03947 SMA mice by\u2009~\u200927% (20.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0days for AR42-treated mice vs. 15.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u00a0days for vehicle-treated mice).

AR42 treatment inhibited histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in treated spinal cord although it did not affect SMN protein expression in these mice. AKT and GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation were both significantly increased in SMN\u03947 SMA mouse spinal cords.

Currently approved SMA treatments aim to restore SMN, but the potential for SMN expression beyond physiological levels is a unique feature of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-SMN gene therapy. Here, we show that long-term AAV9-mediated SMN overexpression in mouse models induces dose-dependent, late-onset motor dysfunction associated with loss of proprioceptive synapses and neurodegeneration.

In SMA patients with one or two copies of the Survival Motor Neuron 2 (SMN2) gene there are a number of SMN missense mutations that result in milder-than-predicted SMA phenotypes. These mild SMN missense mutation alleles are often assumed to have partial function. However, it is important to consider the contribution of FL-SMN as these missense alleles never occur in the absence of SMN2. We propose that these patients contain a partially functional oligomeric SMN complex consisting of FL-SMN from SMN2 and mutant SMN protein produced from the missense allele. Here we show that mild SMN missense mutations SMND44V, SMNT74I or SMNQ282A alone do not rescue mice lacking wild-type FL-SMN. Thus, missense mutations are not functional in the absence of FL-SMN. In contrast, when the same mild SMN missense mutations are expressed in a mouse containing two SMN2 copies, functional SMN complexes are formed with the small amount of wild-type FL-SMN produced by SMN2 and the SMA phenotype is completely rescued.

Since higher copy numbers of the nearly identical SMN2 gene reduce disease severity, to date most efforts to develop a therapy for SMA have focused on enhancing SMN expression. Identification of alternative therapeutic approaches has partly been hindered by limited knowledge of potential targets and the lack of cell-based screening assays that serve as readouts of SMN function. Here, we established a cell system in which proliferation of cultured mouse fibroblasts is dependent on functional SMN produced from the SMN2 gene. To do so, we introduced the entire human SMN2 gene into NIH3T3 cell lines in which regulated knockdown of endogenous mouse Smn severely decreases cell proliferation. We found that low SMN2 copy number has modest effects on the cell proliferation phenotype induced by Smn depletion, while high SMN2 copy number is strongly protective. Additionally, cell proliferation correlates with the level of SMN activity in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein assembly. Following miniaturization into a high-throughput format, our cell-based phenotypic assay accurately measures the beneficial effects of both pharmacological and genetic treatments leading to SMN upregulation. This cell model provides a novel platform for phenotypic screening of modifiers of SMN2 gene expression and function that act through multiple mechanisms, and a powerful new tool for studies of SMN biology and SMA therapeutic development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Proliferation", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Gene Order", "Mice", "NIH 3T3 Cells", "Phenotype", "Protein Transport", "RNA Interference", "Survival of Motor Neuron 2 Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Darrick K", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Motor Neuron Biology and Disease, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Tisdale", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jorge", "Last Name": "Espinoza-Derout", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luciano", "Last Name": "Saieva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Lotti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Livio", "Last Name": "Pellizzoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23727836", "Title": "The DcpS inhibitor RG3039 improves motor function in SMA mice.", "Abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, retention of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene and insufficient expression of full-length survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Quinazolines increase SMN2 promoter activity and inhibit the ribonucleic acid scavenger enzyme DcpS. The quinazoline derivative RG3039 has advanced to early phase clinical trials. In preparation for efficacy studies in SMA patients, we investigated the effects of RG3039 in severe SMA mice. Here, we show that RG3039 distributed to central nervous system tissues where it robustly inhibited DcpS enzyme activity, but minimally activated SMN expression or the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Nonetheless, treated SMA mice showed a dose-dependent increase in survival, weight and motor function. This was associated with improved motor neuron somal and neuromuscular junction synaptic innervation and function and increased muscle size. RG3039 also enhanced survival of conditional SMA mice in which SMN had been genetically restored to motor neurons. As this systemically delivered drug may have therapeutic benefits that extend beyond motor neurons, it could act additively with SMN-restoring therapies delivered directly to the central nervous system such as antisense oligonucleotides or gene therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Central Nervous System", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical", "Endoribonucleases", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Motor Neurons", "Muscles", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Neuromuscular Junction", "Quinazolines", "Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear", "Survival of Motor Neuron 1 Protein", "Survival of Motor Neuron 2 Protein", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James P", "Last Name": "Van Meerbeke", "Affiliation": "These authors contributed equally to this study."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "Gibbs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Heather L", "Last Name": "Plasterer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wenyan", "Last Name": "Miao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhihua", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ming-Yi", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Agnieszka A", "Last Name": "Rucki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claribel D", "Last Name": "Wee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bing", "Last Name": "Xia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shefali", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Jacques", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Darrick K", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Livio", "Last Name": "Pellizzoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Rusche", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chien-Ping", "Last Name": "Ko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charlotte J", "Last Name": "Sumner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2013Oct15"}]
