[{"PMID": "38817323", "Title": "Whole-genome sequencing uncovers two loci for coronary artery calcification and identifies ARSE as a regulator of vascular calcification.", "Abstract": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a measure of atherosclerosis and a well-established predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD) events. Here we describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CAC in 22,400 participants from multiple ancestral groups. We confirmed associations with four known loci and identified two additional loci associated with CAC (ARSE and MMP16), with evidence of significant associations in replication analyses for both novel loci. Functional assays of ARSE and MMP16 in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) demonstrate that ARSE is a promoter of VSMC calcification and VSMC phenotype switching from a contractile to a calcifying or osteogenic phenotype. Furthermore, we show that the association of variants near ARSE with reduced CAC is likely explained by reduced ARSE expression with the G allele of enhancer variant rs5982944. Our study highlights ARSE as an important contributor to atherosclerotic vascular calcification, and a potential drug target for vascular calcific disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [],

To identify new genetic determinants, we performed exome-sequence analyses for adult body mass index (BMI) in up to 587,027 individuals. We identified rare loss-of-function variants in two genes (BSN and APBA1) with effects substantially larger than those of well-established obesity genes such as MC4R. In contrast to most other obesity-related genes, rare variants in BSN and APBA1 were not associated with normal variation in childhood adiposity. Furthermore, BSN protein-truncating variants (PTVs) magnified the influence of common genetic variants associated with BMI, with a common variant polygenic score exhibiting an effect twice as large in BSN PTV carriers than in noncarriers. Finally, we explored the plasma proteomic signatures of BSN PTV carriers as well as the functional consequences of BSN deletion in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hypothalamic neurons. Collectively, our findings implicate degenerative processes in synaptic function in the etiology of adult-onset obesity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Adaptor Proteins, Signal

Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% not of European ancestry), including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores5 in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adipocytes", "Chromatin", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Disease Progression", "Endothelial Cells", "Enteroendocrine Cells", "Epigenomics", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Islets of Langerhans", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Peripheral Arterial Disease", "Single-Cell Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ken", "Last Name": "Suzuki", "Affiliation": "Centre for Genetics and Genomics Versus Arthritis, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}, {"First Name": "Konstantinos", "Last Name": "Hatzikotoulas", "Affiliation": "Institute of Translational Genomics, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany. konstantinos.hatzikotoulas@helmholtz-munich.de."}, {"First Name": "Lorraine", "Last Name": "Southam", "Affiliation": "Institute of Translational Genomics, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Henry J", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Center for Precision Health Research, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xianyong", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Kim M", "Last Name": "Lorenz", "Affiliation": "Corporal Michael J.

Here we describe whole genome sequence (WGS) data from 4806 individuals recruited from the healthcare delivery systems of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, combined with WGS from 927 individuals from isolated South Asian populations. We characterize population structure in South Asia and describe a genotyping array (SARGAM) and imputation reference panel that are optimized for South Asian genomes. We find evidence for high rates of reproductive isolation, endogamy and consanguinity that vary across the subcontinent and that lead to levels of rare homozygotes that reach 100 times that seen in outbred populations. Founder effects increase the power to associate functional variants with disease processes and make South Asia a uniquely powerful place for population-scale genetic studies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Asian People", "Bangladesh", "Founder Effect", "Homozygote", "India", "Pakistan", "South Asian People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey D", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA. jeffwall.genetics@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "J Fah", "Last Name": "Sathirapongsasuti", "Affiliation": "MedGenome Inc., Foster City, CA, 94404, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ravi", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "MedGenome Labs Pvt.

and complications.", "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes. To characterise the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% non-European ancestry), including 428,452 T2D cases. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P<5\u00d710-8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals characterised by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial, and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned genetic risk scores (GRS) in an additional 137,559 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 10,159 T2D cases, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned GRS are more strongly associated with coronary artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy than an overall T2D GRS across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating multi-ancestry GWAS with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity driving the development and progression of T2D, which may offer a route to optimise global access to genetically-informed diabetes care.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ken", "Last Name": "Suzuki", "Affiliation": "Centre

"Elevated body mass index (BMI) is heritable and associated with many health conditions that impact morbidity and mortality. The study of the genetic association of BMI across a broad range of common disease conditions offers the opportunity to extend current knowledge regarding the breadth and depth of adiposity-related diseases. We identify 906 (364 novel) and 41 (6 novel) genome-wide significant loci for BMI among participants of European (N~1.1 million) and African (N~100,000) ancestry, respectively. Using a BMI genetic risk score including 2446 variants, 316 diagnoses are associated in the Million Veteran Program, with 96.5% showing increased risk. A co-morbidity network analysis reveals seven disease communities containing multiple interconnected diseases associated with BMI as well as extensive connections across communities. Mendelian randomization analysis confirms numerous phenotypes across a breadth of organ systems, including conditions of the circulatory (heart failure, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation), genitourinary (chronic renal failure), respiratory (respiratory failure, asthma), musculoskeletal and dermatologic systems that are deeply interconnected within and across the disease communities. This work shows that the complex genetic architecture of BMI associates with a broad range of major health conditions, supporting the need for comprehensive approaches to prevent and treat obesity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Body Mass Index", "Phenomics", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Obesity", "Genomics", "Mendelian Randomization Analysis", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "School of Public Health and Emergency Management, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer E", "Last Name": "Huffman", "Affiliation": "Center for Population Genomics, Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yunfeng", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "\u00cdtalo", "Last Name": "Do Valle", "Affiliation": "Network Science Institute and Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Themistocles L", "Last Name": "Assimes", "Affiliation": "VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sridharan", "Last Name": "Raghavan", "Affiliation": "VA Eastern Colorado Healthcare System, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin F", "Last Name": "Voight", "Affiliation": "Corporal Michael J.

Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4\u2009million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show\u00a0that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90\u2009kb, covering about 21% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel2) account for 40% (45%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20% (14-24%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Body

Here, in cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses of 110,182 patients who have had a stroke (five ancestries, 33% non-European) and 1,503,898 control individuals, we identify association signals for stroke and its subtypes at 89 (61 new) independent loci: 60 in primary inverse-variance-weighted analyses and 29 in secondary meta-regression and multitrait analyses. On the basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 89,084 additional cases of stroke (30% non-European) and 1,013,843 control individuals, 87% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60% of the secondary stroke risk loci were replicated (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Effect sizes were highly correlated across ancestries. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping, in silico mutagenesis analysis3, and transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses revealed putative causal genes (such as SH3PXD2A and FURIN) and variants (such as at GRK5 and NOS3). Using a three-pronged approach4, we provide genetic evidence for putative drug effects, highlighting F11, KLKB1, PROC, GP1BA, LAMC2 and VCAM1 as possible targets, with drugs already under investigation for stroke for F11 and PROC. A polygenic score integrating cross-ancestry and ancestry-specific stroke GWASs with vascular-risk factor GWASs (integrative polygenic scores) strongly predicted ischaemic stroke in populations of European, East Asian and African ancestry5. Stroke genetic risk scores were predictive of ischaemic stroke independent of clinical risk factors in 52,600 clinical-trial participants with cardiometabolic disease. Our results provide insights to inform biology, reveal potential drug targets and derive genetic risk prediction tools across ancestries.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Brain Ischemia",

Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence. We highlight two of the prioritized genes, CREBRF and RRBP1, which show convergent evidence across functional datasets supporting their roles in lipid biology.", "Keywords": ["complex traits", "fine-mapping", "functional genomics", "lipid biology", "post-GWAS", "regulatory mechanism", "variant prioritization"], "MeSH terms": ["Chromatin", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genomics", "Humans", "Lipids", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shweta", "Last Name": "Ramdas", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Judd", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah E", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kanoni", "Affiliation": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Yuxuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, 801 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA 02118, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ida", "Last Name": "Surakka", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Wenz", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shoa L", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "VA Palo Alto Health Care Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA;

We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis. This study highlights the value of diverse populations in further characterizing the genetic architecture of CAD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Coronary Artery Disease", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Tcheandjieu", "Affiliation": "VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA. catherine.tcheandjieu@gladstone.ucsf.edu."}, {"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Austin T", "Last Name": "Hilliard", "Affiliation": "VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shoa L", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valerio", "Last Name": "Napolioni", "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences and Veterinary Medicine, University of Camerino, Camerino, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Shining", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyung Min", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huaying", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Center for Genetic Epidemiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yingchang", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Noah L", "Last Name": "Tsao", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sridharan", "Last Name": "Raghavan", "Affiliation": "Medicine Service, VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System, Aurora, CO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Satoshi", "Last Name": "Koyama", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Cardiovascular Genomics and Informatics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Bryan R", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marijana", "Last Name": "Vujkovic", "Affiliation": "Corporal Michael J.

Multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis identified 237 loci attaining stringent genome-wide significance (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9), which were delineated to 338 distinct association signals. Fine-mapping of these signals was enhanced by the increased sample size and expanded population diversity of the multi-ancestry meta-analysis, which localized 54.4% of T2D associations to a single variant with >50% posterior probability. This improved fine-mapping enabled systematic assessment of candidate causal genes and molecular mechanisms through which T2D associations are mediated, laying the foundations for functional investigations. Multi-ancestry genetic risk scores enhanced transferability of T2D prediction across diverse populations. Our study provides a step toward more effective clinical translation of T2D GWAS to improve global health for all, irrespective of genetic background.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Diabetes

The loci are enriched for regulatory features, including DNA methylation and gene expression in relevant tissues, and highlight CHMP4B, PDHB, LRIG1 and other genes linked to adiposity and glucose metabolism. A polygenic risk score based on South Asian-derived summary statistics shows ~4-fold higher risk for T2D between the top and bottom quartile. Our results provide further insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying T2D, and highlight the opportunities for discovery from joint analysis of data from across ancestral populations.",

"Analyzing human knockouts to validate GPR151 as a therapeutic target for reduction of body mass index.", "Abstract": "Novel drug targets for sustained reduction in body mass index (BMI) are needed to curb the epidemic of obesity, which affects 650 million individuals worldwide and is a causal driver of cardiovascular and metabolic disease and mortality. Previous studies reported that the Arg95Ter nonsense variant of GPR151, an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, is associated with reduced BMI and reduced risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Here, we further investigate GPR151 with the Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR), which is one of the largest exome biobanks of human homozygous loss-of-function carriers (knockouts) in the world. Among PGR participants, we identify eleven GPR151 putative loss-of-function (plof) variants, three of which are present at homozygosity (Arg95Ter, Tyr99Ter, and Phe175LeufsTer7), with a cumulative allele frequency of 2.2%. We confirm these alleles in vitro as loss-of-function. We test if GPR151 plof is associated with BMI, T2D, or other metabolic traits and find that GPR151 deficiency in complete human knockouts is not associated with clinically significant differences in these traits. Relative to Gpr151+/+ mice, Gpr151-/- animals exhibit no difference in body weight on normal chow and higher body weight on a high-fat diet. Together, our findings indicate that GPR151 antagonism is not a compelling therapeutic approach to treatment of obesity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Body Mass Index", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Exome", "Gene Frequency", "Humans", "Mice", "Obesity", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Allan", "Last Name": "Gurtan", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Dominy", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shareef", "Last Name": "Khalid", "Affiliation": "Center for Non-Communicable Diseases, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Linh", "Last Name": "Vong", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shari", "Last Name": "Caplan", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Treeve", "Last Name": "Currie", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "Richards", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lindsey", "Last Name": "Lamarche", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Denning", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Diana", "Last Name": "Shpektor", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Anastasia", "Last Name": "Gurinovich", "Affiliation": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Asif", "Last Name": "Rasheed", "Affiliation": "Center for Non-Communicable Diseases, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Shahid", "Last Name": "Hameed", "Affiliation": "Punjab Institute of Cardiology, Lahore, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Subhan", "Last Name": "Saeed", "Affiliation": "Center for Non-Communicable Diseases, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Imran", "Last Name": "Saleem", "Affiliation": "Punjab Institute of Cardiology, Lahore, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Anjum", "Last Name": "Jalal", "Affiliation": "Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Shahid", "Last Name": "Abbas", "Affiliation": "Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Raffat", "Last Name": "Sultana", "Affiliation": "Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Syed Zahed", "Last Name": "Rasheed", "Affiliation": "Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Fazal-Ur-Rehman", "Last Name": "Memon", "Affiliation": "Red Crescent Institute of Cardiology, Hyderabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Nabi", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, COMSATS University Islamabad, Islamabad, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad", "Last Name": "Ishaq", "Affiliation": "Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Amit V", "Last Name": "Khera", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Danesh", "Affiliation": "BHF Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge University & Health Data Research UK, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Frossard", "Affiliation": "Center for Non-Communicable Diseases, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Danish", "Last Name": "Saleheen", "Affiliation": "Center for Non-Communicable Diseases, Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "34887591", "Title": "The power of genetic diversity in genome-wide association studies of lipids.", "Abstract": "Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of cardiovascular disease with varied prevalence worldwide owing to different dietary patterns and medication use1. Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide3. Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS4-23 have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65\u2009million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately\u2009295,000 individuals from 7\u2009ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable26 application of polygenic scores in clinical practice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Genetic Predisposition to

"Abstract": "Hundreds of thousands of genetic variants have been reported to cause severe monogenic diseases, but the probability that a variant carrier develops the disease (termed penetrance) is unknown for virtually all of them. Additionally, the clinical utility of common polygenetic variation remains uncertain. Using exome sequencing from 77,184 adult individuals (38,618 multi-ancestral individuals from a type 2 diabetes case-control study and 38,566 participants from the UK Biobank, for whom genotype array data were also available), we apply clinical standard-of-care gene variant curation for eight monogenic metabolic conditions. Rare variants causing monogenic diabetes and dyslipidemias display effect sizes significantly larger than the top 1% of the corresponding polygenic scores. Nevertheless, penetrance estimates for monogenic variant carriers average 60% or lower for most conditions. We assess epidemiologic and genetic factors contributing to risk prediction in monogenic variant carriers, demonstrating that inclusion of polygenic variation significantly improves biomarker estimation for two monogenic dyslipidemias.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Biological Variation, Population", "Biomarkers", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dyslipidemias", "Exome", "Genetic

dysfunction, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. We perform genetic analysis on serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) using data on 437,438 UK Biobank participants. Replication in 315,572 individuals from European descent from the Million Veteran Program, Rotterdam Study and Lifeline study confirms 517 liver enzyme SNPs. Genetic risk score analysis using the identified SNPs is strongly associated with serum activity of liver enzymes in two independent European descent studies (The Airwave Health Monitoring study and the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966). Gene-set enrichment analysis using the identified SNPs highlights involvement in liver development and function, lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and vascular formation. Mendelian randomization analysis shows association of liver enzyme variants with coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. Genetic risk score for elevated serum activity of liver enzymes is associated with higher fat percentage of body, trunk, and liver and body mass index. Our study highlights the role of molecular pathways regulated by the liver in metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Alanine Transaminase", "Alkaline Phosphatase", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Databases, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipid Metabolism", "Liver", "Male", "Mendelian Randomization Analysis", "Metabolic Diseases", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "White People", "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Raha", "Last Name": "Pazoki", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, London, UK. raha.pazoki@brunel.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Marijana", "Last Name": "Vujkovic", "Affiliation": "Corporal Michael J.

Impaired efferocytosis drives the formation of clinically dangerous necrotic atherosclerotic plaques, the underlying etiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). An intron of the gene encoding PHACTR1 contains rs9349379 (A>G), a common variant associated with CAD. As PHACTR1 is an actin-binding protein, we reasoned that if the rs9349379 risk allele G causes lower PHACTR1 expression in macrophages, it might link the risk allele to CAD via impaired efferocytosis. We show here that rs9349379-G/G was associated with lower levels of PHACTR1 and impaired efferocytosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages and human atherosclerotic lesional macrophages compared with rs9349379-A/A. Silencing PHACTR1 in human and mouse macrophages compromised AC engulfment, and Western diet-fed Ldlr-/- mice in which hematopoietic Phactr1 was genetically targeted showed impaired lesional efferocytosis, increased plaque necrosis, and thinner fibrous caps - all signs of vulnerable plaques in humans. Mechanistically, PHACTR1 prevented dephosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which was necessary for AC engulfment. In summary, rs9349379-G lowered PHACTR1, which, by lowering phospho-MLC, compromised efferocytosis. Thus, rs9349379-G may contribute to CAD risk, at least in part, by impairing atherosclerotic lesional macrophage efferocytosis.", "Keywords": ["Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Cell Biology",

While preclinical studies in model organisms have raised some on-target toxicity concerns5-8, the biological consequences of LRRK2 inhibition have not been well characterized in humans. Here, we systematically analyze pLoF variants in LRRK2 observed across 141,456 individuals sequenced in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)9, 49,960 exome-sequenced individuals from the UK Biobank and over 4 million participants in the 23andMe genotyped dataset. After stringent variant curation, we identify 1,455 individuals with high-confidence pLoF variants in LRRK2. Experimental validation of three variants, combined with previous work10, confirmed reduced protein levels in 82.5% of our cohort. We show that heterozygous pLoF variants in LRRK2 reduce LRRK2 protein levels but that these are not strongly associated with any specific phenotype or disease state.

association study of peripheral artery disease in the Million Veteran Program.", "Abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, the extent to which genetic factors increase risk for PAD is largely unknown. Using electronic health record data, we performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing ~32 million DNA sequence variants with PAD (31,307 cases and 211,753 controls) across veterans of European, African and Hispanic ancestry. The results were replicated in an independent sample of 5,117 PAD cases and 389,291 controls from the UK Biobank. We identified 19 PAD loci, 18 of which have not been previously reported. Eleven of the 19 loci were associated with disease in three vascular beds (coronary, cerebral, peripheral), including LDLR, LPL and LPA, suggesting that therapeutic modulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the lipoprotein lipase pathway or circulating lipoprotein(a) may be efficacious for multiple atherosclerotic disease phenotypes. Conversely, four of the variants appeared to be specific for PAD, including F5 p.R506Q, highlighting the pathogenic role of thrombosis in the peripheral vascular bed and providing genetic support for Factor Xa inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for PAD.

diabetes and 24,440\u00a0controls.", "Abstract": "Protein-coding genetic variants that strongly affect disease risk can yield relevant clues to disease pathogenesis. Here we report exome-sequencing analyses of 20,791\u00a0individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 24,440\u00a0non-diabetic control participants from 5\u00a0ancestries. We identify gene-level associations of rare variants (with minor allele frequencies of less than 0.5%) in 4\u00a0genes at exome-wide significance, including a series of more than 30\u00a0SLC30A8 alleles that conveys protection against T2D, and in 12\u00a0gene sets, including those corresponding to T2D drug targets (P\u00a0=\u00a06.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3) and candidate genes from knockout mice (P\u00a0=\u00a05.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-3). Within our study, the strongest T2D gene-level signals for rare variants explain at most 25% of the heritability of the strongest common single-variant signals, and the gene-level effect sizes of the rare variants that we observed in established T2D drug targets will require 75,000-185,000\u00a0sequenced cases to achieve exome-wide significance. We propose a method to interpret these modest rare-variant associations and to incorporate these associations into future target or gene prioritization efforts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

Disease.", "Abstract": "Background Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is a genetic disorder caused by rare protein-truncating variants (PTV) in the gene encoding APOB (apolipoprotein B), the major protein component of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles. Whether heterozygous APOB deficiency is associated with decreased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) is uncertain. We combined family-based and large scale gene-sequencing to characterize the association of rare PTVs in APOB with circulating LDL-C (LDL cholesterol), triglycerides, and risk for CHD. Methods We sequenced the APOB gene in 29 Japanese hypobetalipoproteinemia families, as well as 57\u2009973 individuals derived from 12 CHD case-control studies-18\u2009442 with early-onset CHD and 39\u2009531 controls. We defined PTVs as variants that lead to a premature stop, disrupt canonical splice-sites, or lead to insertions/deletions that shift reading frame. We tested the association of rare APOB PTV carrier status with blood lipid levels and CHD. Results Among 29 familial hypobetalipoproteinemia families, 8 families harbored APOB PTVs. Carrying 1 APOB PTV was associated with 55 mg/dL lower LDL-C ( P=3\u00d710-5) and 53% lower triglyceride level ( P=2\u00d710-4). Among 12 case-control studies, an APOB PTV was present in 0.038% of CHD cases as compared to 0.092% of controls. APOB PTV carrier status was associated with a 43 mg/dL lower LDL-C ( P=2\u00d710-7), a 30% decrease in triglycerides ( P=5\u00d710-4), and a 72% lower risk for CHD (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.64; P=0.002). Conclusions Rare PTV mutations in APOB which are associated with lower LDL-C and reduced triglycerides also confer protection against CHD.", "Keywords": ["cholesterol", "genetics", "human", "hypobetalipoproteinemia", "triglycerides"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Apolipoproteins B", "Case-Control Studies", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Coronary Disease", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Japan", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gina M", "Last Name": "Peloso", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, MA (G.M.P.)."}, {"First Name": "Akihiro", "Last Name": "Nomura", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular and Internal Medicine, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa, Japan (A.

Intact lipid profiling by DIHRMS was performed on 5662 serum samples from healthy participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS). We developed a novel semi-targeted peak-picking algorithm to detect mass-to-charge ratios in positive and negative ionization modes. We analyzed lipid partial correlations, assessed the association of lipid principal components with established CHD risk factors and genetic variants, and examined differences between lipids for a common genetic polymorphism. The DIHRMS method provided information on 360 lipids (including fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterol lipids), with a median coefficient of variation of 11.6% (range: 5.4-51.9). The lipids were highly correlated and exhibited a range of associations with clinical chemistry biomarkers and lifestyle factors. This platform can provide many novel insights into the effects of physiology and lifestyle on lipid metabolism, genetic determinants of lipids, and the relationship between individual lipids and CHD risk factors.", "Keywords": ["coronary heart disease", "genetics", "lipidomics", "mass spectrometry", "protocol"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Coronary Disease", "Female", "Genetic Variation",

Pathway/gene set enrichment analyses identified lipid particle, adiponectin, abnormal white adipose tissue physiology and bone development and morphology as important contributors to fat distribution, while cross-trait associations highlight cardiometabolic traits.

modifiable risk factor for many diseases, including cancer, common respiratory disorders and cardiovascular diseases. Fourteen genetic loci have previously been associated with smoking behaviour-related traits. We tested up to 235,116 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the exome-array for association with smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, pack-years, and smoking cessation in a fixed effects meta-analysis of up to 61 studies (up to\u00a0346,813 participants). In a subset of 112,811 participants, a further one million SNVs were also genotyped and tested for association with the four smoking behaviour traits. SNV-trait associations with P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8 in either analysis were taken forward for replication in up to 275,596 independent participants from UK Biobank. Lastly, a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication studies was performed. Sixteen SNVs were associated with at least one of the smoking behaviour traits (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) in the discovery samples. Ten novel SNVs, including rs12616219 near TMEM182, were followed-up and five of them (rs462779 in REV3L, rs12780116 in CNNM2, rs1190736 in GPR101, rs11539157 in PJA1, and rs12616219 near TMEM182) replicated at a Bonferroni significance threshold (P\u2009<\u20094.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3) with consistent direction of effect. A further 35 SNVs were associated with smoking behaviour traits in the discovery plus replication meta-analysis (up to 622,409 participants) including a rare SNV, rs150493199, in CCDC141 and two low-frequency SNVs in CEP350 and HDGFRP2. Functional follow-up implied that decreased expression of REV3L may lower the probability of smoking initiation. The novel loci will facilitate understanding the genetic aetiology of smoking behaviour and may lead to the identification of potential drug targets for smoking prevention and/or cessation.",

genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), a measure of body fat distribution, associates with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We conducted an exome-wide association study of coding variation in UK Biobank (405,569 individuals) to identify variants that lower WHRadjBMI and protect against type 2 diabetes. We identified four variants in the gene ACVR1C (encoding the activin receptor-like kinase 7 receptor expressed on adipocytes and pancreatic \u03b2-cells), which independently associated with reduced WHRadjBMI: Asn150His (-0.09 SD, P = 3.4 \u00d7 10-17), Ile195Thr (-0.15 SD, P = 1.0 \u00d7 10-9), Ile482Val (-0.019 SD, P = 1.6 \u00d7 10-5), and rs72927479 (-0.035 SD, P = 2.6 \u00d7 10-12). Carriers of these variants exhibited reduced percent abdominal fat in DEXA imaging. Pooling across all four variants, a 0.2 SD decrease in WHRadjBMI through ACVR1C was associated with a 30% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.63, 0.77; P = 5.6 \u00d7 10-13). In an analysis of exome sequences from 55,516 individuals, carriers of predicted damaging variants in ACVR1C were at 54% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27, 0.81; P = 0.006). These findings indicate that variants predicted to lead to loss of ACVR1C gene function influence body fat distribution and protect from type 2 diabetes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Activin Receptors, Type I", "Algorithms", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Exome", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Connor A", "Last Name": "Emdin", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Amit V", "Last Name": "Khera", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Krishna", "Last Name": "Aragam", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Haas", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Chaffin", "Affiliation": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA."}, {"First Name": "Derek", "Last Name": "Klarin", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Pradeep", "Last Name": "Natarajan", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Bick", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Seyedeh M", "Last Name": "Zekavat", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Akihiro", "Last Name": "Nomura", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Diego", "Last Name": "Ardissino", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy."}, {"First Name": "James G", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS."}, {"First Name": "Heribert", "Last Name": "Schunkert", "Affiliation": "Deutsches Herzzentrum M\u00fcnchen, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, and Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung, M\u00fcnchen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "McPherson", "Affiliation": "University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hugh", "Last Name": "Watkins", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Elosua", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Genetics, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Bown", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Leicester, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Nilesh J", "Last Name": "Samani", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, Leicester, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Usman", "Last Name": "Baber", "Affiliation": "The Zena and Michael A.

We make two important observations. First, only five of these signals are driven by low-frequency variants: even for these, effect sizes are modest (odds ratio \u22641.29). Second, when we used large-scale genome-wide association data to fine-map the associated variants in their regional context, accounting for the global enrichment of complex trait associations in coding sequence, compelling evidence for coding variant causality was obtained for only 16 signals. At 13 others, the associated coding variants clearly represent 'false leads' with potential to generate erroneous mechanistic inference. Coding variant associations offer a direct route to biological insight for complex diseases and identification of validated therapeutic targets; however, appropriate mechanistic inference requires careful specification of their causal contribution to disease predisposition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Chromosome Mapping", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Genetic

association study of 520,000 subjects identifies 32 loci associated with stroke and stroke subtypes.", "Abstract": "Stroke has multiple etiologies, but the underlying genes and pathways are largely unknown. We conducted a multiancestry genome-wide-association meta-analysis in 521,612 individuals (67,162 cases and 454,450 controls) and discovered 22 new stroke risk loci, bringing the total to 32. We further found shared genetic variation with related vascular traits, including blood pressure, cardiac traits, and venous thromboembolism, at individual loci (n\u2009=\u200918), and\u00a0using genetic risk scores and linkage-disequilibrium-score regression. Several loci exhibited distinct association and pleiotropy patterns for etiological stroke subtypes. Eleven new susceptibility loci indicate mechanisms not previously implicated in stroke pathophysiology, with prioritization of risk variants and genes accomplished through bioinformatics analyses using extensive functional datasets. Stroke risk loci were significantly enriched in drug targets for antithrombotic therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "INDEL Mutation", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rainer", "Last Name": "Malik", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ganesh", "Last Name": "Chauhan", "Affiliation": "Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Traylor", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1219 Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, University of Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Muralidharan", "Last Name": "Sargurupremraj", "Affiliation": "Stroke Research Group, Division of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Yukinori", "Last Name": "Okada", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Statistical Analysis, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Aniket", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Stroke Research Group, Division of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Loes", "Last Name": "Rutten-Jacobs", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1219 Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, University of Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Katrin", "Last Name": "Giese", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sander W", "Last Name": "van der Laan", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Center Utrecht, University of Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Solveig", "Last Name": "Gretarsdottir", "Affiliation": "deCODE genetics/AMGEN Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Christopher D", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, MGH, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Chong", "Affiliation": "Population Health Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hieab H H", "Last Name": "Adams", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Tetsuro", "Last Name": "Ago", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Almgren", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Malm\u00f6, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Amouyel", "Affiliation": "INSERM, Institut Pasteur de Lille, LabEx DISTALZ-UMR1167, Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging-Related Diseases, Universit\u00e9 Lille, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Hakan", "Last Name": "Ay", "Affiliation": "J.

"Protein-altering variants associated with body mass index implicate pathways that control energy intake and expenditure in obesity.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >250 loci for body mass index (BMI), implicating pathways related to neuronal biology. Most GWAS loci represent clusters of common, noncoding variants from which pinpointing causal genes remains challenging. Here we combined data from 718,734 individuals to discover rare and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%) coding variants associated with BMI. We identified 14 coding variants in 13 genes, of which 8 variants were in genes (ZBTB7B, ACHE, RAPGEF3, RAB21, ZFHX3, ENTPD6, ZFR2 and ZNF169) newly implicated in human obesity, 2 variants were in genes (MC4R and KSR2) previously observed\u00a0to be mutated in extreme obesity and 2 variants were in GIPR. The effect sizes of rare variants are ~10 times larger than those of common variants, with the largest effect observed in carriers of an MC4R mutation introducing a stop codon (p.Tyr35Ter, MAF = 0.01%), who weighed ~7 kg more than non-carriers. Pathway analyses based on the variants associated with BMI\u00a0confirm enrichment of neuronal genes and provide new evidence for adipocyte and energy expenditure biology, widening the potential of genetically supported therapeutic targets in obesity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Body Mass Index", "Drosophila", "Energy Intake", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Gene

basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) to high resolution, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia catalogued variation from whole-genome sequencing of 2,657 European individuals and exome sequencing of 12,940 individuals of multiple ancestries. Over 27M SNPs, indels, and structural variants were identified, including 99% of low-frequency (minor allele frequency [MAF] 0.1-5%) non-coding variants in the whole-genome sequenced individuals and 99.7% of low-frequency coding variants in the whole-exome sequenced individuals. Each variant was tested for association with T2D in the sequenced individuals, and, to increase power, most were tested in larger numbers of individuals (>80% of low-frequency coding variants in ~82\u2009K Europeans via the exome chip, and ~90% of low-frequency non-coding variants in ~44\u2009K Europeans via genotype imputation). The variants, genotypes, and association statistics from these analyses provide the largest reference to date of human genetic information relevant to T2D, for use in activities such as T2D-focused genotype imputation, functional characterization of variants or genes, and other novel analyses to detect associations between sequence variation and T2D.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Diabetes

>300,000 individuals.", "Abstract": "We screened variants on an exome-focused genotyping array in >300,000 participants (replication in >280,000 participants) and identified 444 independent variants in 250 loci significantly associated with total cholesterol (TC), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and/or triglycerides (TG). At two loci (JAK2 and A1CF), experimental analysis in mice showed lipid changes consistent with the human data. We also found that: (i) beta-thalassemia trait carriers displayed lower TC and were protected from coronary artery disease (CAD); (ii) excluding the CETP locus, there was not a predictable relationship between plasma HDL-C and risk for age-related macular degeneration; (iii) only some mechanisms of lowering LDL-C appeared to increase risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D); and (iv) TG-lowering alleles involved in hepatic production of TG-rich lipoproteins (TM6SF2 and PNPLA3) tracked with higher liver fat, higher risk for T2D, and lower risk for CAD, whereas TG-lowering alleles involved in peripheral lipolysis (LPL and ANGPTL4) had no effect on liver fat but decreased risks for both T2D and CAD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Coronary Artery Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",

genetic studies on intermediate biomarkers and CHD can provide a reliable approach to help assess causal pathways in coronary heart disease. Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies are a powerful tool to assess causal relevance of a range of pathways. These analyses use genetic variants as proxies for soluble biomarkers in association studies of disease risk. MR studies can provide unbiased estimates of causal effects and avoid distortions due to confounding factors arising later in life, because genetic variants are fixed at conception. MR studies have provided evidence pointing towards the likelihood of a causal relevance of a range of pathways in CHD, including LDL-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), and interleukin-6 receptor. On the other hand, MR studies have refuted the causal relevance of a number of biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, uric acid, LpPLA2 activity, and homocysteine. Carefully conducted MR studies should overcome the limitations that are inherent to other observational studies (e.g., residual confounding and reverse causality) to help assess causal relevance of a range of pathways in CHD.", "Keywords": ["Mendelian Randomization", "cardiovascular disease", "causal inference", "coronary heart disease", "novel therapies", "risk factors"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jung-Jin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Asif", "Last Name": "Rasheed", "Affiliation": "Center for Non-Communicable Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan."}, {"First Name": "Danish", "Last Name": "Saleheen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, USA."}], "Journal": "Current genetic medicine reports", "PubDate": "2016Dec"}, {"PMID": "29030403", "Title": "New Blood Pressure-Associated Loci Identified in Meta-Analyses of 475\u2009000 Individuals.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have recently identified >400 loci that harbor DNA sequence variants that influence blood pressure (BP).

SLC22A1 in Acylcarnitine Transport.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified a signal at the SLC22A1 locus for serum acylcarnitines, intermediate metabolites of mitochondrial oxidation whose plasma levels associate with metabolic diseases. Here, we refined the association signal, performed conditional analyses, and examined the linkage structure to find coding variants of SLC22A1 that mediate independent association signals at the locus. We also employed allele-specific expression analysis to find potential regulatory variants of SLC22A1 and demonstrated the effect of one variant on the splicing of SLC22A1. SLC22A1 encodes a hepatic plasma membrane transporter whose role in acylcarnitine physiology has not been described. By targeted metabolomics and isotope tracing experiments in loss- and gain-of-function cell and mouse models of Slc22a1, we uncovered a role of SLC22A1 in the efflux of acylcarnitines from the liver to the circulation. We further validated the impacts of human variants on SLC22A1-mediated acylcarnitine efflux in\u00a0vitro, explaining their\u00a0association with serum acylcarnitine levels. Our findings provide the detailed molecular mechanisms of the GWAS association for serum acylcarnitines at the SLC22A1 locus by functionally validating the impact of SLC22A1 and its variants on acylcarnitine transport.", "Keywords": ["SLC22A1", "acylcarnitines", "allelic imbalance", "fine mapping", "genomics", "metabolite GWAS", "metabolomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Alternative Splicing", "Animals", "Biological Transport", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Carnitine", "Cells, Cultured", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Liver", "Male", "Metabolic Diseases", "Metabolomics", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Organic Cation Transporter 1", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Tissue Distribution"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hye In", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Johannes", "Last Name": "Raffler", "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg 85764, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Wenyun", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jung-Jin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deepti", "Last Name": "Abbey", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danish", "Last Name": "Saleheen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Rabinowitz", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas J", "Last Name": "Hand", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Rader", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 18 HbA1c-associated genetic variants. These variants proved to be classifiable by their likely biological action as erythrocytic (also associated with erythrocyte traits) or glycemic (associated with other glucose-related traits). In this study, we tested the hypotheses that, in a very large scale GWAS, we would identify more genetic variants associated with HbA1c and that HbA1c variants implicated in erythrocytic biology would affect the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c. We therefore expanded the number of HbA1c-associated loci and tested the effect of genetic risk-scores comprised of erythrocytic or glycemic variants on incident diabetes prediction and on prevalent diabetes screening performance. Throughout this multiancestry study, we kept a focus on interancestry differences in HbA1c genetics performance that might influence race-ancestry differences in health outcomes.", "Keywords": [],

coronary heart disease.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the shared genetic etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we conducted a genome-wide, multi-ancestry study of genetic variation for both diseases in up to 265,678 subjects for T2D and 260,365 subjects for CHD. We identify 16 previously unreported loci for T2D and 1 locus for CHD, including a new T2D association at a missense variant in HLA-DRB5 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). We show that genetically mediated increase in T2D risk also confers higher CHD risk. Joint T2D-CHD analysis identified eight variants-two of which are coding-where T2D and CHD associations appear to colocalize, including a new joint T2D-CHD association at the CCDC92 locus that also replicated for T2D. The variants associated with both outcomes implicate new pathways as well as targets of existing drugs, including icosapent ethyl and adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Although 58 genomic regions have been associated with CAD thus far, most of the heritability is unexplained, indicating that additional susceptibility loci await identification. An efficient discovery strategy may be larger-scale evaluation of promising associations suggested by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, we genotyped 56,309 participants using a targeted gene array derived from earlier GWAS results and performed meta-analysis of results with 194,427 participants previously genotyped, totaling 88,192 CAD cases and 162,544 controls. We identified 25 new SNP-CAD associations (P < 5 \u00d7 10-8, in fixed-effects meta-analysis) from 15 genomic regions, including SNPs in or near genes involved in cellular adhesion, leukocyte migration and atherosclerosis (PECAM1, rs1867624), coagulation and inflammation (PROCR, rs867186 (p.Ser219Gly)) and vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation (LMOD1, rs2820315). Correlation of these regions with cell-type-specific gene expression and plasma protein levels sheds light on potential disease mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Arteries",

Loss-of-function mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such 'human knockouts' can provide insight into gene function. Consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high. Here we sequence the protein-coding regions of 10,503 adult participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), designed to understand the determinants of cardiometabolic diseases in individuals from South Asia. We identified individuals carrying homozygous predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) mutations, and performed phenotypic analysis involving more than 200 biochemical and disease traits. We enumerated 49,138 rare (<1% minor allele frequency) pLoF mutations. These pLoF mutations are estimated to knock out 1,317 genes, each in at least one participant. Homozygosity for pLoF mutations at PLA2G7 was associated with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; at TREH, with lower concentrations of apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions; at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations; and at SLC9A3R1, with mediators of calcium and phosphate signalling. Heterozygous deficiency of APOC3 has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease; we identified APOC3 homozygous pLoF carriers in our cohort. We recruited these human knockouts and challenged them with an oral fat load. Compared with family members lacking the mutation, individuals with APOC3 knocked out displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides. Overall, these observations provide a roadmap for a 'human knockout project', a systematic effort to understand the phenotypic consequences of complete disruption of genes in humans.", "Keywords": [],

"Abstract": "Large artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAS) shows substantial heritability not explained by previous genome-wide association studies. Here, we explore the role of coding variation in LAS by analyzing variants on the HumanExome BeadChip in a total of 3,127 cases and 9,778 controls from Europe, Australia, and South Asia. We report on a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant in serpin family A member 1 (SERPINA1) encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin [AAT; p.V213A; P = 5.99E-9, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22] and confirm histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) as a major risk gene for LAS with an association in the 3'-UTR (rs2023938; P = 7.76E-7, OR = 1.28). Using quantitative microscale thermophoresis, we show that M1 (A213) exhibits an almost twofold lower dissociation constant with its primary target human neutrophil elastase (NE) in lipoprotein-containing plasma, but not in lipid-free plasma. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry further revealed a significant difference in the global flexibility of the two variants. The observed stronger interaction with lipoproteins in plasma and reduced global flexibility of the Val-213 variant most likely improve its local availability and reduce the extent of proteolytic inactivation by other proteases in atherosclerotic plaques. Our results indicate that the interplay between AAT, NE, and lipoprotein particles is modulated by the gate region around position 213 in AAT, far away from the unaltered reactive center loop (357-360). Collectively, our findings point to a functionally relevant balance between lipoproteins, proteases, and AAT in atherosclerosis.", "Keywords": ["antitrypsin", "genetics", "ischemic stroke", "large

Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2\u2009centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2\u2009centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ADAMTS Proteins", "Adult", "Alleles", "Body Height", "Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic

risk.", "Abstract": "Elevated blood pressure is the leading heritable risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide. We report genetic association of blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, pulse pressure) among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry with independent replication in other cohorts, and robust validation of 107 independent loci. We also identify new independent variants at 11 previously reported blood pressure loci. In combination with results from a range of in silico functional analyses and wet bench experiments, our findings highlight new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation enriched for genes expressed in vascular tissues and identify potential therapeutic targets for hypertension. Results from genetic risk score models raise the possibility of a precision medicine approach through early lifestyle intervention to offset the impact of blood pressure-raising genetic variants on future cardiovascular disease risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Female", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide

lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), has not reduced risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes in recent randomized trials. We aimed to test whether Lp-PLA2 enzyme activity is causally relevant to coronary heart disease. Methods In 72,657 patients with coronary heart disease and 110,218 controls in 23 epidemiological studies, we genotyped five functional variants: four rare loss-of-function mutations (c.109+2T\u2009>\u2009C (rs142974898), Arg82His (rs144983904), Val279Phe (rs76863441), Gln287Ter (rs140020965)) and one common modest-impact variant (Val379Ala (rs1051931)) in PLA2G7, the gene encoding Lp-PLA2. We supplemented de-novo genotyping with information on a further 45,823 coronary heart disease patients and 88,680 controls in publicly available databases and other previous studies. We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials to compare effects of darapladib treatment on soluble Lp-PLA2 activity, conventional cardiovascular risk factors, and coronary heart disease risk with corresponding effects of Lp-PLA2-lowering alleles. Results Lp-PLA2 activity was decreased by 64% ( p\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910-25) with carriage of any of the four loss-of-function variants, by 45% ( p\u2009<\u200910-300) for every allele inherited at Val279Phe, and by 2.7% ( p\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910-12) for every allele inherited at Val379Ala. Darapladib 160\u2009mg once-daily reduced Lp-PLA2 activity by 65% ( p\u2009<\u200910-300). Causal risk ratios for coronary heart disease per 65% lower Lp-PLA2 activity were: 0.95 (0.88-1.03) with Val279Phe; 0.92 (0.74-1.16) with carriage of any loss-of-function variant; 1.01 (0.68-1.51) with Val379Ala; and 0.95 (0.89-1.02) with darapladib treatment. Conclusions In a large-scale human genetic study, none of a series of Lp-PLA2-lowering alleles was related to coronary heart disease risk, suggesting that Lp-PLA2 is unlikely to be a causal risk

We applied the Mendelian randomization framework to evaluate the causal hypothesis that elevated SBP increases risk for type 2 diabetes. We used 28 genetic variants associated with SBP and evaluated their impact on type 2 diabetes using a European-centric meta-analysis comprising 37,293 case and 125,686 control subjects. We found that elevation of SBP levels by 1 mmHg due to our genetic score was associated with a 2% increase in risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, P = 9.05 \u00d7 10-5). To limit confounding, we constructed a second score based on 13 variants exclusively associated with SBP and found a similar increase in type 2 diabetes risk per 1 mmHg of genetic elevation in SBP (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, P = 1.48 \u00d7 10-3). Sensitivity analyses using multiple, alternative causal inference measures and simulation studies demonstrated consistent association, suggesting robustness of our primary observation. In line with previous reports from observational studies, we found that genetically elevated SBP was associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes.

However, there is limited knowledge on specific causal genes and pathways. To better understand the genetics of blood pressure, we genotyped 242,296 rare, low-frequency and common genetic variants in up to 192,763 individuals and used \u223c155,063 samples for independent replication. We identified 30 new blood pressure- or hypertension-associated genetic regions in the general population, including 3 rare missense variants in RBM47, COL21A1 and RRAS with larger effects (>1.5 mm Hg/allele) than common variants. Multiple rare nonsense and missense variant associations were found in A2ML1, and a low-frequency nonsense variant in ENPEP was identified. Our data extend the spectrum of allelic variation underlying blood pressure traits and hypertension, provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hypertension and indicate new targets for clinical intervention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Blood Pressure", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Hypertension"],

functional interpretation of DNA sequence changes. Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) DNA sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human 'knockout' variants in protein-coding genes.",

studies have implicated GALNT2, encoding GalNAc-T2, as a regulator of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) metabolism, but the\u00a0mechanisms relating GALNT2 to HDL-C remain unclear. We investigated the impact of homozygous GALNT2 deficiency on HDL-C in humans and mammalian models. We identified two humans homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in GALNT2 who demonstrated low HDL-C. We also found that GALNT2 loss of function in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates decreased HDL-C. O-glycoproteomics studies of a human GALNT2-deficient subject validated ANGPTL3 and ApoC-III as GalNAc-T2 targets. Additional glycoproteomics in rodents identified targets influencing HDL-C, including phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). GALNT2 deficiency reduced plasma PLTP activity in humans and rodents, and in mice this was rescued by reconstitution of hepatic Galnt2. We also found that GALNT2 GWAS SNPs associated with reduced HDL-C also correlate with lower hepatic GALNT2 expression.

Genome-wide association studies have identified scores of common variants associated with type 2 diabetes, but in aggregate, these explain only a fraction of the heritability of this disease. Here, to test the hypothesis that lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies. Comprehensive enumeration of sequence variation is necessary to identify functional alleles that provide important clues to disease pathophysiology, but large-scale sequencing does not support the idea that lower-frequency variants have a major role in predisposition to type 2 diabetes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Europe",

coronary heart disease.", "Abstract": "Regulatory authorities have indicated that new drugs to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) should not be associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Human genetics may be able to guide development of antidiabetic therapies by predicting cardiovascular and other health endpoints. We therefore investigated the association of variants in six genes that encode drug targets for obesity or T2D with a range of metabolic traits in up to 11,806 individuals by targeted exome sequencing and follow-up in 39,979 individuals by targeted genotyping, with additional in silico follow-up in consortia. We used these data to first compare associations of variants in genes encoding drug targets with the effects of pharmacological manipulation of those targets in clinical trials. We then tested the association of those variants with disease outcomes, including coronary heart disease, to predict cardiovascular safety of these agents. A low-frequency missense variant (Ala316Thr; rs10305492) in the gene encoding glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R), the target of GLP1R agonists, was associated with lower fasting glucose and T2D risk, consistent with GLP1R agonist therapies. The minor allele was also associated with protection against heart disease, thus providing evidence that GLP1R agonists are not likely to be associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Our results provide an encouraging signal that these agents may be associated with benefit, a question currently being addressed in randomized controlled trials. Genetic variants associated with metabolic traits and multiple disease outcomes can be used to validate therapeutic targets at an early stage in the drug development process.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Coronary Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4", "Genotype", "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor", "Humans", "Obesity", "Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C", "Receptors, Somatostatin", "Sodium-Glucose Transporter 1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Scott", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK. dawn.m.waterworth@gsk.com robert.scott@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk nick.wareham@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Daniel F", "Last Name": "Freitag", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Strangeways Research Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB1 8RN, UK.

In humans, high amounts of HDL-C in plasma are associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Mice that have depleted Scarb1 (SR-BI knockout mice) have markedly elevated HDL-C levels but, paradoxically, increased atherosclerosis. The impact of SR-BI on HDL metabolism and CHD risk in humans remains unclear. Through targeted sequencing of coding regions of lipid-modifying genes in 328 individuals with extremely high plasma HDL-C levels, we identified a homozygote for a loss-of-function variant, in which leucine replaces proline 376 (P376L), in SCARB1, the gene encoding SR-BI. The P376L variant impairs posttranslational processing of SR-BI and abrogates selective HDL cholesterol uptake in transfected cells, in hepatocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from the homozygous subject, and in mice.

mechanisms.", "Abstract": "To gain insight into potential regulatory mechanisms through which the effects of variants at four established type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility loci (CDKAL1, CDKN2A-B, IGF2BP2 and KCNQ1) are mediated, we undertook transancestral fine-mapping in 22 086 cases and 42 539 controls of East Asian, European, South Asian, African American and Mexican American descent. Through high-density imputation and conditional analyses, we identified seven distinct association signals at these four loci, each with allelic effects on T2D susceptibility that were homogenous across ancestry groups. By leveraging differences in the structure of linkage disequilibrium between diverse populations, and increased sample size, we localised the variants most likely to drive each distinct association signal. We demonstrated that integration of these genetic fine-mapping data with genomic annotation can highlight potential causal regulatory elements in T2D-relevant tissues. These analyses provide insight into the mechanisms through which T2D association signals are mediated, and suggest future routes to understanding the biology of specific disease susceptibility loci.",

\u2248 58 coronary artery disease (CAD) loci that suggest the existence of previously unsuspected new biology relevant to atherosclerosis. However, these studies only identify genomic loci associated with CAD, and many questions remain even after a genomic locus is definitively implicated, including the nature of the causal variant(s) and the causal gene(s), as well as the directionality of effect. There are several tools that can be used for investigation of the functional genomics of these loci, and progress has been made on a limited number of novel CAD loci. New biology regarding atherosclerosis and CAD will be learned through the functional genomics of these loci, and the hope is that at least some of these new pathways relevant to CAD pathogenesis will yield new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of CAD.", "Keywords": ["atherosclerosis", "coronary artery disease", "functional", "genome-wide", "genomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Markers", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Prognosis", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sylvia T", "Last Name": "Nurnberg", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Department of Medicine (S.T.N., R.C.B., D.J.R.), Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine (H.Z., M.P.R., D.J.R.), Department of Genetics (N.J.H., D.J.R.), and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (D.S.), Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia."}, {"First Name": "Hanrui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Department of Medicine (S.T.N., R.C.B., D.J.R.), Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine (H.Z., M.P.R., D.J.R.), Department of Genetics (N.J.H., D.J.R.), and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (D.S.), Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas J", "Last Name": "Hand", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Department of Medicine (S.T.N., R.C.B., D.J.R.), Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine (H.Z., M.P.R., D.J.R.), Department of Genetics (N.J.H., D.J.R.), and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (D.S.), Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia."}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Bauer", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Department of Medicine (S.T.N., R.C.B., D.J.R.), Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine (H.Z., M.P.R., D.J.R.), Department of Genetics (N.J.H., D.J.R.), and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (D.S.), Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia."}, {"First Name": "Danish", "Last Name": "Saleheen", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Department of Medicine (S.T.N., R.C.B., D.J.R.), Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine (H.Z., M.P.R., D.J.R.), Department of Genetics (N.J.H., D.J.R.), and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (D.S.), Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia."}, {"First Name": "Muredach P", "Last Name": "Reilly", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Department of Medicine (S.T.N., R.C.B., D.J.R.), Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine (H.Z., M.P.R., D.J.R.), Department of Genetics (N.J.H., D.J.R.), and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (D.S.), Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. mpr2144@cumc.columbia.edu rader@upenn.edu."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Rader", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Department of Medicine (S.T.N., R.C.B., D.J.R.), Penn Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine (H.Z., M.P.R., D.J.R.), Department of Genetics (N.J.H., D.J.R.), and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (D.S.), Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. mpr2144@cumc.columbia.edu rader@upenn.edu."}], "Journal": "Circulation research", "PubDate": "2016Feb19"}, {"PMID": "26821629", "Title": "Causal Assessment of Serum Urate Levels in Cardiometabolic Diseases Through a Mendelian Randomization Study.", "Abstract": "Although epidemiological studies have reported positive associations between circulating urate levels and cardiometabolic diseases, causality remains uncertain.", "Keywords": ["genetic", "pleiotropy", "single nucleotide polymorphism"], "MeSH terms": ["Coronary Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Global Health", "Humans", "Mendelian Randomization Analysis", "Morbidity", "Odds Ratio", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Prognosis", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Uric Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tanya", "Last Name": "Keenan", "Affiliation": "Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS for T2D in the Japanese population. Combined data from discovery and subsequent validation analyses (23,399 T2D cases and 31,722 controls) identify 7 new loci with genome-wide significance (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)), rs1116357 near CCDC85A, rs147538848 in FAM60A, rs1575972 near DMRTA1, rs9309245 near ASB3, rs67156297 near ATP8B2, rs7107784 near MIR4686 and rs67839313 near INAFM2. Of these, the association of 4 loci with T2D is replicated in multi-ethnic populations other than Japanese (up to 65,936 T2Ds and 158,030 controls, P<0.007).

Mouse studies have revealed that ACSL1 channels acyl-CoAs to \u03b2-oxidation, thereby reducing glucose utilization, and is required for diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis. The role of ACSL1 in humans is unknown. We therefore examined common variants in the human ACSL1 locus by genetic association studies for fasting glucose, diabetes status, and preclinical atherosclerosis by using the MAGIC and DIAGRAM consortia; followed by analyses in participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, the Penn-T2D consortium, and a meta-analysis of subclinical atherosclerosis in African Americans; and finally, expression quantitative trait locus analysis and identification of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS). The results show that three SNPs in ACSL1 (rs7681334, rs735949, and rs4862423) are associated with fasting glucose or diabetes status in these large (>200,000 subjects) data sets. Furthermore, rs4862423 is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and coincides with a DHS highly accessible in human heart. SNP rs735949 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs745805, significantly associated with ACSL1 levels in skin, suggesting tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms. This study provides evidence in humans of ACSL1 SNPs associated with fasting glucose, diabetes, and subclinical atherosclerosis and suggests links among these traits and acyl-CoA synthesis.",

We find genetic variants at 12 new loci to be associated with blood pressure (P = 3.9 \u00d7 10(-11) to 5.0 \u00d7 10(-21)). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 new loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7 and TBX2) function. The new and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.04 to 8.6 \u00d7 10(-6)).

comprehensive 1,000 Genomes-based genome-wide association meta-analysis of coronary artery disease.", "Abstract": "Existing knowledge of genetic variants affecting risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is largely based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of common SNPs. Leveraging phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, we report a GWAS meta-analysis of \u223c185,000 CAD cases and controls, interrogating 6.7 million common (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05) and 2.7 million low-frequency (0.005 < MAF < 0.05) variants. In addition to confirming most known CAD-associated loci, we identified ten new loci (eight additive and two recessive) that contain candidate causal genes newly implicating biological processes in vessel walls. We observed intralocus allelic heterogeneity but little evidence of low-frequency variants with larger effects and no evidence of synthetic association. Our analysis provides a comprehensive survey of the fine genetic architecture of CAD, showing that genetic susceptibility to this common disease is largely determined by common SNPs of small effect size.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Coronary Artery Disease", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Majid", "Last Name": "Nikpay",

Coronary heart disease (CHD), with myocardial infarction (MI) as its main manifestation, is a major cause of death in the country. However, there is limited reliable evidence about its determinants in this population. The Bangladesh Risk of Acute Vascular Events (BRAVE) study is an epidemiological bioresource established to examine environmental, genetic, lifestyle and biochemical determinants of CHD among the Bangladeshi population. By early 2015, the ongoing BRAVE study had recruited over 5000 confirmed first-ever MI cases, and over 5000 controls \"frequency-matched\" by age and sex. For each participant, information has been recorded on demographic factors, lifestyle, socioeconomic, clinical, and anthropometric characteristics. A 12-lead electrocardiogram has been recorded. Biological samples have been collected and stored, including extracted DNA, plasma, serum and whole blood. Additionally, for the 3000 cases and 3000 controls initially recruited, genotyping has been done using the CardioMetabochip+ and the Exome+ arrays. The mean age (standard deviation) of MI cases is 53 (10) years, with 88 % of cases being male and 46 % aged 50 years or younger. The median interval between reported onset of symptoms and hospital admission is 5 h. Initial analyses indicate that Bangladeshis are genetically distinct from major non-South Asian ethnicities, as well as distinct from other South Asian ethnicities. The BRAVE study is well-placed to serve as a powerful resource to investigate current and future hypotheses relating to environmental, biochemical and genetic causes of CHD in an important but under-studied South Asian population.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Asian People", "Bangladesh", "Case-Control Studies", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Coronary Disease", "Female",

To understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci account for \u223c2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function, glutamate

fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well-established predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall adiposity. To increase our understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated with related waist and hip circumference measures (P\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-8)). In total, 20 of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis, transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adipocytes", "Adipogenesis", "Adipose Tissue", "Age Factors", "Body Fat Distribution", "Body Mass Index", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Europe", "Female",

When MI occurs early in life, genetic inheritance is a major component to risk. Previously, rare mutations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) genes have been shown to contribute to MI risk in individual families, whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with MI risk in the population. Here we evaluate how rare mutations contribute to early-onset MI risk in the population. We sequenced the protein-coding regions of 9,793 genomes from patients with MI at an early age (\u226450 years in males and \u226460 years in females) along with MI-free controls. We identified two genes in which rare coding-sequence mutations were more frequent in MI cases versus controls at exome-wide significance. At low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 4.2-fold increased risk for MI; carriers of null alleles at LDLR were at even higher risk (13-fold difference). Approximately 2% of early MI cases harbour a rare, damaging mutation in LDLR; this estimate is similar to one made more than 40 years ago using an analysis of total cholesterol. Among controls, about 1 in 217 carried an LDLR coding-sequence mutation and had plasma LDL cholesterol > 190\u00a0mg\u00a0dl(-1). At apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 2.2-fold increased risk for MI. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein C-III (refs 18, 19). Combined, these observations suggest that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes to MI risk.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Age of Onset", "Alleles", "Apolipoprotein A-V", "Apolipoproteins A", "Case-Control Studies", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Exome", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetics, Population", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Myocardial Infarction", "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (U.S.)", "Receptors, LDL", "Triglycerides", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "1] Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.

loci associated with habitual coffee consumption.", "Abstract": "Coffee, a major dietary source of caffeine, is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world and has received considerable attention regarding health risks and benefits. We conducted a genome-wide (GW) meta-analysis of predominately regular-type coffee consumption (cups per day) among up to 91,462 coffee consumers of European ancestry with top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) followed-up in ~30\u2009062 and 7964 coffee consumers of European and African-American ancestry, respectively. Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW significance (log10Bayes factor (BF)>5.64) with per-allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups per day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P<5 \u00d7 10(-8)).Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

adult human height.", "Abstract": "Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated \u223c2,000, \u223c3,700 and \u223c9,500 SNPs explained \u223c21%, \u223c24% and \u223c29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/\u03b2-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Body Height", "Genetic Variation", "Genetics, Population", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "Genetics of Complex Traits, University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tonu", "Last Name": "Esko", "Affiliation": "1] Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.

However, IS has considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. Where clinical covariates explain a large fraction of disease risk, covariate informed designs can increase power to detect associations. As prevalence rates in IS are markedly affected by age, and younger onset cases may have higher genetic predisposition, we investigated whether an age-at-onset informed approach could detect novel associations with IS and its subtypes; cardioembolic (CE), large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and small vessel disease (SVD) in 6,778 cases of European ancestry and 12,095 ancestry-matched controls. Regression analysis to identify SNP associations was performed on posterior liabilities after conditioning on age-at-onset and affection status. We sought further evidence of an association with LAA in 1,881 cases and 50,817 controls, and examined mRNA expression levels of the nearby genes in atherosclerotic carotid artery plaques. Secondly, we performed permutation analyses to evaluate the extent to which age-at-onset informed analysis improves significance for novel loci. We identified a novel association with an MMP12 locus in LAA (rs660599; p\u200a=\u200a2.5\u00d710\u207b\u2077), with independent replication in a second population (p\u200a=\u200a0.0048, OR(95% CI)\u200a=\u200a1.18(1.05-1.32); meta-analysis p\u200a=\u200a2.6\u00d710\u207b\u2078). The nearby gene, MMP12, was significantly overexpressed in carotid plaques compared to atherosclerosis-free control arteries (p\u200a=\u200a1.2\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2075; fold change\u200a=\u200a335.6). Permutation analyses demonstrated improved significance for associations when accounting for age-at-onset in all four stroke phenotypes (p<0.001).

"Abstract": "Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol are heritable, modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined 188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Asian People", "Black People", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Lipids", "Triglycerides", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cristen J", "Last Name": "Willer", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ellen M", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sebanti", "Last Name": "Sengupta", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gina M", "Last Name": "Peloso", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Gustafsson", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Stavroula", "Last Name": "Kanoni", "Affiliation": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, CB10 1SA, Hinxton, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Ganna", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin L", "Last Name": "Buchkovich", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA."}, {"First Name": "Samia", "Last Name": "Mora", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 900 Commonwealth Ave., Boston MA 02215, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacques S", "Last Name": "Beckmann", "Affiliation": "Service of Medical Genetics, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Bragg-Gresham", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hsing-Yi", "Last Name": "Chang", "Affiliation": "Division of Preventive Medicine and Health Services Research, Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Ay\u015fe", "Last Name": "Demirkan", "Affiliation": "Genetic Epidemiology Unit, Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Heleen M", "Last Name": "Den Hertog", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA."}, {"First Name": "Louise A", "Last Name": "Donnelly", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School.

However, it is unclear whether this association reflects causal processes. We used 185 common variants recently mapped for plasma lipids (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8) for each) to examine the role of triglycerides in risk for CAD. First, we highlight loci associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, and we show that the direction and magnitude of the associations with both traits are factors in determining CAD risk. Second, we consider loci with only a strong association with triglycerides and show that these loci are also associated with CAD. Finally, in a model accounting for effects on LDL-C and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the strength of a polymorphism's effect on triglyceride levels is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on CAD risk. These results suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins causally influence risk for CAD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biological Transport", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Humans", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "1] Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

is associated with cancer and several age-associated diseases. We report here a genome-wide meta-analysis of 37,684 individuals with replication of selected variants in an additional 10,739 individuals. We identified seven loci, including five new loci, associated with mean LTL (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)). Five of the loci contain candidate genes (TERC, TERT, NAF1, OBFC1 and RTEL1) that are known to be involved in telomere biology. Lead SNPs at two loci (TERC and TERT) associate with several cancers and other diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, a genetic risk score analysis combining lead variants at all 7 loci in 22,233 coronary artery disease cases and 64,762 controls showed an association of the alleles associated with shorter LTL with increased risk of coronary artery disease (21% (95% confidence interval, 5-35%) per standard deviation in LTL, P = 0.014).

"We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a multistage meta-analysis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Punjabi Sikhs from India. Our discovery GWAS in 1,616 individuals (842 case subjects) was followed by in silico replication of the top 513 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 10\u207b\u00b3) in Punjabi Sikhs (n = 2,819; 801 case subjects). We further replicated 66 SNPs (P < 10\u207b\u2074) through genotyping in a Punjabi Sikh sample (n = 2,894; 1,711 case subjects). On combined meta-analysis in Sikh populations (n = 7,329; 3,354 case subjects), we identified a novel locus in association with T2D at 13q12 represented by a directly genotyped intronic SNP (rs9552911, P = 1.82 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078) in the SGCG gene. Next, we undertook in silico replication (stage 2b) of the top 513 signals (P < 10\u207b\u00b3) in 29,157 non-Sikh South Asians (10,971 case subjects) and de novo genotyping of up to 31 top signals (P < 10\u207b\u2074) in 10,817 South Asians (5,157 case subjects) (stage 3b). In combined South Asian meta-analysis, we observed six suggestive associations (P < 10\u207b\u2075 to < 10\u207b\u2077), including SNPs at HMG1L1/CTCFL, PLXNA4, SCAP, and chr5p11. Further evaluation of 31 top SNPs in 33,707 East Asians (16,746 case subjects) (stage 3c) and 47,117 Europeans (8,130 case subjects) (stage 3d), and joint meta-analysis of 128,127 individuals (44,358 case subjects) from 27 multiethnic studies, did not reveal any additional loci nor was there any evidence of replication for the new variant.
