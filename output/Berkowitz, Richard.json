HTX-011 is a dual-acting local anesthetic containing bupivacaine and low-dose meloxicam in an extended-release polymer. In a prior randomized controlled trial (RCT), HTX-011 reduced pain and opioid use through 72\u2009hours after TKA compared with bupivacaine hydrochloride. This open-label study (NCT03974932) evaluated the efficacy and safety of HTX-011 combined with an MMA regimen in patients undergoing TKA under spinal anesthesia. All patients received intraoperative HTX-011 (400\u2009mg bupivacaine/12\u2009mg meloxicam) in combination with an MMA regimen consisting of preoperative acetaminophen, celecoxib, and pregabalin and postoperative acetaminophen and celecoxib until discharge. Opioid rescue was allowed upon patient request for additional pain control. Pain scores, opioid consumption, discharge readiness, and adverse events were recorded. Fifty-one patients were treated. Compared with the prior RCT, HTX-011 with this MMA regimen further lowered pain scores and reduced opioid use. Mean patient-reported pain scores remained in the mild range, and 82% of patients or more did not experience severe pain at any individual time point through 72\u2009hours after surgery. Mean total opioid consumption was low over 72\u2009hours: 24.8 morphine milligram equivalents (1-2 tablets of oxycodone 10\u2009mg/day). Approximately 60% of patients were ready for discharge by 12\u2009hours, and 39% were discharged without an opioid prescription and did not call back for pain management. The treatment regimen was well tolerated, and no added risk was observed with the addition of MMA.

Current management of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a subsequent affected pregnancy involves antenatal administration of intravenous immune globulin and prednisone to the pregnant woman to prevent the development of severe fetal thrombocytopenia and secondary intracranial hemorrhage in utero. That therapy has proven to be highly effective but is associated with maternal side effects and is expensive. This commentary describes 4 advances that could substantially change the current approach to detecting and managing fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in the near future. The first would be an introduction of a program to screen all antepartum patients in this country for pregnancies at risk of developing fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Strategies to implement this complex process have been described. A second advance is testing of cell-free fetal DNA obtained from maternal blood to noninvasively determine the fetal human platelet antigen 1 genotype. A third, in preliminary development, is creation of a prophylactic product that would be the platelet equivalent of Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM). Finally, a fourth major potential advance is the development of neonatal Fc receptor inhibitors to replace the current medical therapy administered to pregnant women with an affected fetus. Neonatal Fc receptor recycles plasma immunoglobulin G to increase its half-life and is the means by which immunoglobulin G crosses the placenta from the maternal to the fetal circulation. Blocking the neonatal Fc receptor is an ideal way to prevent maternal immunoglobulin G antibody from causing fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a fetus at risk of developing that disorder. The pertinent pathophysiology and rationale for each of these developments will be presented in addition to our thoughts relating to steps that must be taken and difficulties that each approach would face for them to be successfully implemented.", "Keywords": ["FNAIT", "FcRn", "HPA-1ab", "IVIG", "NAITgam", "intracranial hemorrhage", "platelet", "thrombocytopenia"], "MeSH terms": ["Antigens, Human Platelet", "Cell-Free Nucleic Acids", "Drug Development", "Female", "Genotype", "Glucocorticoids", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class I", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunoglobulins, Intravenous", "Immunologic Factors", "Integrin beta3", "Maternal-Fetal Exchange", "Noninvasive Prenatal Testing", "Prednisone", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Receptors, Fc", "Risk Assessment", "Thrombocytopenia, Neonatal Alloimmune"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James B", "Last Name": "Bussel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.

The exam contains two question types: traditional multiple-choice evaluating knowledge and Script Concordance Theory (SCT) evaluating judgment. Reliability was measured through McDonald's Total Omega and Cronbach's Alpha. Pearson's correlations between knowledge and judgment were measured. Results \u2003From February 2014 through September 2018, 4,330 different individuals took the exam. A total of 4,057 records were suitable for reliability analysis: 2,105 (52%) physicians, 1,756 (43%) nurses, and 196 (5%) certified nurse midwives (CNMs). As a measure of test reliability, total Omega was 0.80 for obstetric providers and 0.77 for nurses.

Our understanding of risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis is hampered by a lack of uniform clinical case definition; neither histologic nor laboratory findings have been identified unique to this condition. Amniotic fluid embolism is often overdiagnosed in critically ill peripartum women, particularly when an element of coagulopathy is involved. Previously proposed case definitions for amniotic fluid embolism are nonspecific, and when viewed through the eyes of individuals with experience in critical care obstetrics, would include women with a number of medical conditions much more common than amniotic fluid embolism. We convened a working group under the auspices of a committee of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the Amniotic Fluid Embolism Foundation whose task was to develop uniform diagnostic criteria for the research reporting of amniotic fluid embolism. These criteria rely on the presence of the classic triad of hemodynamic and respiratory compromise accompanied by strictly defined disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. It is anticipated that limiting research reports involving amniotic fluid embolism to women who meet these criteria will enhance the validity of published data and assist in the identification of risk factors, effective treatments, and possibly useful biomarkers for this condition.

Noninvasive prenatal screening of cell-free DNA has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 21 superior to all previous screening approaches with slightly lower performance for other common aneuploidies. These tests have rapidly captured an increasing market share, with substantial reductions in the number of chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis performed suggesting that physicians and patients regard such screening approaches as an equivalent replacement for diagnostic testing. Simultaneously, many clinical programs have noted significant decreases in patient counseling. In 2012 the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development funded a blinded comparison of karyotype with the emerging technology of array comparative genomic hybridization showing that in patients with a normal karyotype, 2.5% had a clinically relevant microdeletion or duplication identified. In pregnancies with an ultrasound-detected structural anomaly, 6% had an incremental finding, and of those with a normal scan, 1.6% had a copy number variant. For patients of any age with a normal ultrasound and karyotype, the chance of a pathogenic copy number variant is greater than 1%, similar to the age-related risk of aneuploidy in the fetus of a 38 year old. This risk is 4-fold higher than the risk of trisomy 21 in a woman younger than 30 years and 5- to 10-fold higher than the present accepted risk of a diagnostic procedure. Based on this, we contend that every patient, regardless of her age, be educated about these risks and offered the opportunity to have a diagnostic procedure with array comparative genomic hybridization performed.", "Keywords": ["array comparative genomic hybridization", "cell-free fetal DNA", "chorionic villus sampling", "fetal chromosome abnormalities", "maternal serum combined screening", "next-generation sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Chromosome Aberrations", "Chromosome Disorders", "Comparative Genomic Hybridization", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Karyotype", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark I", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Comprehensive Genetics PLLC and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York, NY; Mt Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY.

Obstetrics is at a crossroads, which requires consideration of new ways of providing genetic counseling. Currently a two-tiered process is used. Specific tests such as first- or second-trimester screening for aneuploidy are offered to virtually all women by a clinician who provides counseling and who may offer additional tests to patients in particular ethnic groups and those with unique obstetric or family histories. Frequently only this latter group and those who \"screen positive\" on the universally offered tests are sent to a genetic counselor. This approach worked well when screening focused on a relatively small number of diagnoses, but that is no longer the case. We argue that obstetricians, who were able to maintain mastery over the content of counseling when aneuploidies and karyotype analysis were the essential diagnoses and diagnostic tools available, are rarely able to offer the same level of expertise regarding the chromosomal, genomic, and genetic diseases now diagnosable and the newest available diagnostic methodologies.

This program could serve as a template for future education and credentialing programs that include partnerships with academic leaders, national professional organizations, and industry.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Humans", "Nuchal Translucency Measurement", "Pregnancy", "Quality Assurance, Health Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mary E", "Last Name": "D'Alton", "Affiliation": "Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, and Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia; the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Emeritus Reproductive Epidemiology, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom; the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Washington, DC;San Francisco Perinatal Associates, San Francisco, and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California; and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and the Perinatal Quality Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"First Name": "Karin M", "Last Name": "Fuchs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alfred", "Last Name": "Abuhammad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Beryl", "Last Name": "Benacerraf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Berkowitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Howard", "Last Name": "Cuckle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Depp", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "O'Keeffe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence D", "Last Name": "Platt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean Lea", "Last Name": "Spitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Toland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Wapner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Nuchal Translucency Quality Review Program", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Obstetrics and gynecology", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "24412747", "Title": "Reply: To PMID 24113255.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cardiotocography", "Credentialing", "Female", "Humans", "Obstetrics", "Pregnancy"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Richard L", "Last Name": "Berkowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Medical Center, 622 West 168th St., PH 16-66, New York, NY 10032.

Under such circumstances, it would be difficult to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of FHR monitoring even if this technique had immense intrinsic value, since there has never been a standard hypothesis to test dealing with interpretation and management of these abnormal patterns. We present an algorithm for the management of category II FHR patterns that reflects a synthesis of available evidence and current scientific thought.

The rate of severe maternal morbidity, a more prevalent problem, is also rising. Rise in maternal age, in rates of obesity, and in cesarean deliveries as well as more pregnant women with chronic medical conditions all contribute to maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States. We believe it is the responsibility of maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) subspecialists to lead a national effort to decrease maternal mortality and morbidity. In doing so, we hope to reestablish the vital role of MFM subspecialists to take the lead in the performance and coordination of care in complicated obstetrical cases.
