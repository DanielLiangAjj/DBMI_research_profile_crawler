[{"PMID": "36814846", "Title": "Design of an ultrafast pulsed ponderomotive phase plate for cryo-electron tomography.", "Abstract": "Ponderomotive phase plates have shown that temporally consistent phase contrast is possible within electron microscopes via high-fluence static laser modes resonating in Fabry-Perot cavities. Here, we explore using pulsed laser beams as an alternative method of generating high fluences. We find through forward-stepping finite element models that picosecond or shorter interactions are required for meaningful fluences and phase shifts, with higher pulse energies and smaller beam waists leading to predicted higher fluences. An additional model based on quasi-classical assumptions is used to discover the shape of the phase plate by incorporating the oscillatory nature of the electric field. From these results, we find the transient nature of the laser pulses removes the influence of Kapitza-Dirac diffraction patterns that appear in the static resonator cases. We conclude by predicting that a total laser pulse energy of 8.7\u00a0\u03bcJ is enough to induce the required \u03c0/2 phase shift for Zernike-like phase microscopy.", "Keywords": ["cryo-EM", "cryo-ET", "laser phase plate", "phase contrast imaging", "phase shift", "pump-probe near-field electron microscopy", "ultrafast electron microscopy", "ultrafast fluence", "visual proteomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Electron Microscope Tomography", "Light", "Microscopy, Phase-Contrast", "Lasers", "Electricity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel X", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Mortimer B.

Filament cores are made of two identical protofilaments comprising residues 306-378 of tau protein, which adopt a combined cross-\u03b2/\u03b2-helix structure and define the seed for tau aggregation. Paired helical and straight filaments differ in their inter-protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs.

Here, we detail MAS NMR experiments and sample labeling schemes designed specifically to probe such higher order amyloid structure, and we have applied them to the fibrils formed by an eleven-residue segment of the amyloidogenic protein transthyretin (TTR(105-115)). These experiments have allowed us to define unambiguously not only the arrangement of the peptide \u03b2-strands into \u03b2-sheets but also the \u03b2-sheet interfaces within each protofilament, and in addition to identify the nature of the protofilament-to-protofilament contacts that lead to the formation of the complete fibril. Our efforts have resulted in 111 quantitative distance and torsion angle restraints (10 per residue) that describe the various levels of structure organization. The experiments benefited extensively from the use of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which in some cases allowed us to shorten the data acquisition time from days to hours and to improve significantly the signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra.
