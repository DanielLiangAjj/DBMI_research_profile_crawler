Here, we developed the modular safeEXO platform, a prototype sEV delivery vehicle that is mostly devoid of endogenous RNA and can efficaciously deliver RNA and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to their intended intracellular targets manifested by downstream biologic activity. We also successfully engineered producer cells to produce safeEXO vehicles that contain endogenous Cas9 (safeEXO-CAS) to effectively deliver efficient ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated CRISPR genome editing machinery to organs or diseased cells in vitro and in vivo. We confirmed that safeEXO-CAS sEVs could co-deliver ssDNA, sgRNA and siRNA, and efficaciously mediate gene insertion in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated the potential to target safeEXO-CAS sEVs by engineering sEVs to express a tissue-specific moiety, integrin alpha-6 (safeEXO-CAS-ITGA6), which increased their uptake to lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. We tested the ability of safeEXO-CAS-ITGA6 loaded with EMX1 sgRNAs to induce lung-targeted editing in mice, which demonstrated significant gene editing in the lungs with no signs of morbidity or detectable changes in immune cell populations. Our results demonstrate that our modular safeEXO platform represents a targetable, safe, and efficacious vehicle to deliver nucleic acid-based therapeutics that successfully reach their intracellular targets. Furthermore, safeEXO producer cells can be genetically manipulated to produce safeEXO vehicles containing CRISPR machinery for more efficient RNP-mediated genome editing. This platform has the potential to improve current therapies and increase the landscape of treatment for various human diseases using RNAi and CRISPR approaches.", "Keywords": ["CRISPR", "Cas", "Delivery", "Genome Editing", "sEVs"], "MeSH terms": ["Gene Editing", "Extracellular Vesicles", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Ribonucleoproteins", "RNA, Small Interfering", "RNA, Guide, CRISPR-Cas Systems"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sunil", "Last Name": "Dubey", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Immunology Laboratory, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Immunology Laboratory, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuxiao Jarvan", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Immunology Laboratory, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Austin", "Last Name": "Talis", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Immunology Laboratory, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrei", "Last Name": "Molotkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alessandra", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Akiva", "Last Name": "Mintz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Momen-Heravi", "Affiliation": "Cancer Biology and Immunology Laboratory, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Theranostics", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38555449", "Title": "Focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening is safe and feasible with moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy for brainstem diffuse midline glioma.", "Abstract": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a pediatric tumor with dismal prognosis.

Here, through in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we found that Pip4k2c loss conferred LM but had no impact on lung metastasis or primary tumor growth. Pip4k2c-deficient cells were hypersensitized to insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and exploited the insulin-rich liver milieu for organ-specific metastasis. We observed concordant changes in PIP4K2C expression and distinct metabolic changes in 3,511 patient melanomas, including primary tumors, LMs and lung metastases. We found that systemic PI3K inhibition exacerbated LM burden in mice injected with Pip4k2c-deficient cancer cells through host-mediated increase in hepatic insulin levels; however, this circuit could be broken by concurrent administration of an SGLT2 inhibitor or feeding of a ketogenic diet.

Cocaine (0.2\u2009mg/kg/injection) and 1.0\u2009g food pellets were available under a multiple\u00a0fixed-interval (FI) 3-min schedule of reinforcement. In contrast to what has been observed in male monkeys, baseline D2/D3R availability was positively correlated with rates of cocaine self-administration only during the first week of exposure; DAT availability did not correlate with cocaine self-administration. D2/D3R availability decreased ~20% following cumulative intakes of 100 and 1000\u2009mg/kg cocaine; DAT availability did not significantly change. These reductions in D2/D3R availability did not recover over 9 months of time-off from cocaine. To determine if these reductions were reversible, three monkeys were implanted with osmotic pumps that delivered raclopride for 30 days.\u00a0We found that chronic treatment with the D2/D3R antagonist raclopride increased D2/D3R availability in the ventral striatum but not in the other regions when compared to baseline levels. Over 13 months of self-administration, tolerance did not develop to the rate-decreasing effects of self-administered cocaine on food-reinforced responding, but number of injections and cocaine intake significantly increased over the 13 months.

Increasing scientific evidence indicates that MT-stabilizing agents protect against the deleterious effects of neurodegeneration in treating AD. To quantify these protective benefits, we developed the first brain-penetrant PET radiopharmaceutical, [11C]MPC-6827, for in vivo quantification of MTs in rodent and nonhuman primate models of AD. Mechanistic insights revealed from recently reported studies confirm the radiopharmaceutical's high selectivity for destabilized MTs. To further translate it to clinical settings, its metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic parameters must be determined. Here, we report in vivo plasma and brain metabolism studies establishing the radiopharmaceutical-binding constants of [11C]MPC-6827. Binding constants were extrapolated from autoradiography experiments; pretreatment with a nonradioactive MPC-6827 decreased the brain uptake >70%.

Understanding the contribution of cellular and molecular components within the bone marrow niche for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells is crucial for the success of therapeutic applications. So far, the roles of crucial mechanisms within the bone marrow niche have been explored in transgenic animals in which genetic modifications are ubiquitously introduced in the whole body. The lack of precise tools to explore genetic alterations exclusively within the bone marrow prevents our determination of whether the observed outcomes result from confounding effects from other organs. Here, we developed a new method - 'whole bone subcutaneous transplantation'- to study the bone marrow niche in transgenic animals precisely. Using immunolabeling of CD45.1 (donor) vs. CD45.2 (recipient) hematopoeitic stem cells, we demonstrated that hematopoeitic stem cells from the host animals colonize the subcutaneously transplanted femurs after transplantation, while the hematopoietic stem cells from the donor disappear. Strikinlgy, the bone marrow niche of these subcutaneously transplanted femurs remain from the donor mice, enabling us to study specifically cells of the bone marrow niche using this model. We also showed that genetic ablation of peri-arteriolar cells specifically in donor femurs reduced the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in these bones. This supports the use of this strategy as a model, in combination with genetic tools, to evaluate how bone\u00a0marrow niche specific modifications may impact non-modified hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, this approach can be utilized for genetic manipulation in vivo of specific cell types only within the bone marrow. The combination of whole bone subcutaneous transplantation with rodent transgenic models will facilitate a more precise, complex and comprehensive understanding of existing problems in the study of the hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow niche.", "Keywords": ["Bone", "Cre/loxp system", "Femur", "Mouse model", "Niche", "Stem cells", "Transplantation"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Bone Marrow", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Bone and Bones"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caroline C", "Last Name": "Picoli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Patr\u00edcia Rocha", "Last Name": "Martins", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Xiao Lin Casey", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Medical Sciences Center, Rm 4385, 1300 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thamires", "Last Name": "Righi", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Medical Sciences Center, Rm 4385, 1300 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pedro P G", "Last Name": "Guimar\u00e3es", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Mauro C X", "Last Name": "Pinto", "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Goi\u00e1s, Goi\u00e2nia, GO, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Jaime H", "Last Name": "Amorim", "Affiliation": "Center of Biological Sciences and Health, Federal University of West Bahia, Barreiras, BA, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Vasco A C", "Last Name": "Azevedo", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Ecology and Evolution, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Silma Regina", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, MA, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Alexandre", "Last Name": "Kanashiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Medical Sciences Center, Rm 4385, 1300 University Avenue, Madison, WI, 53706, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabio Cardoso", "Last Name": "Cruz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Rodrigo R", "Last Name": "Resende", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Akiva", "Last Name": "Mintz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Frenette", "Affiliation": "Gottesman Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Research, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Birbrair", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. birbrair@wisc.edu."}], "Journal": "Stem cell reviews and reports", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "36411624", "Title": "[18F]KS1, a novel ascorbate-based ligand images ROS in tumor models of rodents and nonhuman primates.", "Abstract": "Over production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by altered redox regulation of signaling pathways is common in many types of cancers.

Our preliminary evaluations demonstrated that KS1 do not generate ROS in tumor cells at tracer-level concentrations and tumor-killing properties at pharmacologic doses. [18F]KS1 uptake was low in HNSCC pretreated with ROS blockers, and high with ROS inducers. Tumors in high ROS-expressing SCC-61 took up significantly more [18F]KS1 than rSCC-61 (low-ROS expressing HNSCC); high uptake in doxorubicin-treated rats compared to saline-treated controls. Rodent biodistribution and PET imaging of [18F]KS1 in healthy rhesus monkeys demonstrated its favorable safety, pharmacokinetic properties with excellent washout profile, within 3.0\u00a0h of radiotracer administration.

FAP-targeted molecular radiotherapy has shown efficacy in both preclinical and clinical models and has immunomodulatory effects. Here, we studied if combined immunotherapy and radiotherapy could increase antitumor efficacy in murine models of lung cancer and melanoma and interrogated the mechanisms by which these treatments attenuate tumor growth. Using LLC1 and B16F10 murine models of lung cancer and melanoma, respectively, we tested the efficacy of 177Lu-FAPI-04 alone and in combination with immunotherapy. Alone, 177Lu-FAPI-04 significantly reduced tumor growth in both models. In animals with melanoma, combined therapy resulted in tumor regression while lung tumor growth was attenuated, but tumors did not regress. Combined therapy significantly increased caspase-3 and decreased Ki67 compared with immunotherapy alone. Flow cytometry demonstrated that tumor-associated macrophages responded in a tumor-dependent manner which was distinct in animals treated with both therapies compared with either therapy alone. These data demonstrate that 177Lu-FAPI-04 is an effective anticancer therapy for melanoma and lung cancer which mediates effects at least partially through induction of apoptosis and modulation of the immune response.

Schwann cell-specific depletion also induced a boost in the immune surveillance by increasing tumor-infiltrating anti-tumor lymphocytes, while reducing immune-suppressor cells. In humans, a retrospective in silico analysis of tumor biopsies revealed that increased expression of Schwann cell-related genes within melanoma was associated with improved survival.

The effects of blood donation-induced iron deficiency on red cell transfusion quality or donor cognition are unknown. In this double-blind, randomized trial, adult iron-deficient blood donors (n\u00a0= 79; ferritin\u00a0< 15 \u03bcg/L and zinc protoporphyrin >60 \u03bcMol/mol heme) who met donation qualifications were enrolled. A first standard blood donation was followed by the gold-standard measure for red cell storage quality: a 51-chromium posttransfusion red cell recovery study. Donors were then randomized to intravenous iron repletion (1 g low-molecular-weight iron dextran) or placebo. A second donation \u223c5 months later was followed by another recovery study. Primary outcome was the within-subject change in posttransfusion recovery. The primary outcome measure of an ancillary study reported here was the National Institutes of Health Toolbox-derived uncorrected standard Cognition Fluid Composite Score. Overall, 983\u00a0donors were screened; 110 were iron-deficient, and of these, 39 were randomized to iron repletion and 40 to placebo. Red cell storage quality was unchanged by iron repletion: mean change in posttransfusion recovery was 1.6% (95% confidence interval\u00a0-0.5 to 3.8) and\u00a0-0.4% (-2.0 to 1.2) with and without iron, respectively.

However, there is a lack of single agent with both antiangiogenic and cytotoxic activities for clinical application. AG-488 aka FLAG-003 is a novel ligand with established antiangiogenetic properties via activation of receptor thymidine kinase (RTK) and anti-tubulin properties in tumor cells. AG-488 is also reported to reduce tumor volume and prolong survival in preclinical animal models of glioblastoma multiforme, breast cancer and is in clinical stage. Higher expression of RTKs and tubulins is reported in various cancers. This study reveals the development of [11C]AG-488, a high affinity dual target inhibitor binding to RTK and anti-tubulin activities. We rationale that antiangiogenic RTK and anti-tubulin activity of [11C]AG-488 may enhance the tumor to tissue ratio, assisting in cancer drug development. [11C]AG-488 was synthesized in 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0% radiochemical yield by radiomethylating the corresponding phenolate using [11C]CH3I.

Despite electronic cigarettes' (E-cigs) appeal as substitutes for traditional combustible cigarettes (C-cigs), brain nicotine accumulation (BNA) from E-cigs has not been compared with that from C-cigs using a within-subjects design. BNA was directly assessed with 16 adult dual users (10 females) of E-cigs (e-liquid pH 9.4) and C-cigs, using 11C-nicotine and positron emission tomography (PET). Participants went through two 15-min head scanning sessions during which they inhaled a single puff of E-cig vapor or C-cig smoke containing 11C-nicotine in a randomized order. A full-body scan was also conducted at each session to measure total absorbed dose of 11C-nicotine. Mean maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under curve of BNA were 22.1% and 22.7% lower, respectively, following E-cig compared with C-cig inhalation. Meanwhile, T1/2 was 2.7 times longer following inhalation of E-cig vapor relative to C-cig smoke (all ps\u2009<\u20090.005). Whole-body imaging indicated greater nicotine retention in the respiratory tract from vapor versus smoke inhalation (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Following vapor inhalation, nicotine retention in the respiratory tract was correlated with Cmax values of BNA (rs\u2009=\u2009-0.59, p\u2009<\u20090.02). Our results confirm that E-cigs with alkaline pH e-liquid can deliver nicotine rapidly to the brain, albeit less efficiently than C-cigs partly due to greater airway retention of nicotine.

We used multiple assays, including in vitro T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, and in vivo viral clearance and CD8 receptor occupancy, to demonstrate that REGN5054 has minimal impact on T-cell activity. Preclinical immuno-PET studies demonstrated that 89Zr-DFO-REGN5054 specifically detected CD8+ T cells in lymphoid tissues of CD8-genetically humanized immunocompetent mice (VelociT mice) and discerned therapy-induced changes in CD8+ TILs in two models of response to a CD20xCD3 T-cell activating bispecific antibody (REGN1979, odronextamab).

A key reason for this high mortality is that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly restricts systemically delivered therapeutics to brain tumors. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with microbubbles is a methodology being used in clinical trials to noninvasively permeabilize the BBB for systemic therapeutic delivery to GBM. Topotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat ovarian and small cell lung cancer. Studies have suggested that topotecan can cross the BBB and can be used to treat brain metastases. However, pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that topotecan peak concentration in the brain extracellular fluid after systemic injection was ten times lower than in the blood, suggesting less than optimal BBB penetration by topotecan. We hypothesize that HIFU with microbubbles treatment can open the BBB and significantly increase topotecan concentration in the brain. We radiolabeled topotecan with 11C and acquired static and dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans to quantify [11C] topotecan uptake in the brains of normal mice and mice after HIFU treatment. We found that HIFU treatments significantly increased [11C] topotecan brain uptake.

Furthermore, we found a decrease in [11C] topotecan brain clearance, confirming the potential of HIFU to aid in the delivery of topotecan through the BBB.

Methods: A \"design, measure, analyze, improve, and control\" quality improvement methodology requiring novel technology was used to try to improve PET/CT injection quality. Teams were educated on the importance of quality injections. Baseline infiltration rates were measured, center-specific associative factors were analyzed, team meetings were held, improvement plans were established and executed, and rates remeasured. To ensure that injection-quality gains were retained, real-time feedback and ongoing monitoring were used. Sustainability was assessed. Results: Seven centers and 56 technologists provided data on 5,541 injections. The centers' aggregated baseline infiltration rate was 6.2% (range, 2%-16%). On the basis of their specific associative factors, 4 centers developed improvement plans and reduced their aggregated infiltration rate from 8.9% to 4.6% (P < 0.0001). Ongoing injection monitoring showed sustainability. Significant variation was found in center- and technologist-level infiltration rates (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0020, respectively). Conclusion: A quality improvement approach with new technology can help centers measure infiltration rates, determine associative factors, implement interventions, and improve and sustain injection quality. Because PET/CT images help guide patient management, the monitoring and improvement of radiotracer injection quality are important.", "Keywords": ["FDG", "PET/CT", "extravasation", "infiltration", "quality improvement"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Injections", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Quality Control", "Radiation Dosage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Terence Z", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Duke University, Durham, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Thad", "Last Name": "Benefield", "Affiliation": "University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Shane", "Last Name": "Masters", "Affiliation": "Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Winston Salem, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Jackson W", "Last Name": "Kiser", "Affiliation": "Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Crowley", "Affiliation": "Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Dustin", "Last Name": "Osborne", "Affiliation": "Radiology/Molecular Imaging and Translational Research, University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, Tennessee."}, {"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Mawlawi", "Affiliation": "Department of Imaging Physics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Barnwell", "Affiliation": "Wake Radiology, Raleigh, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Pawan", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA Health, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Akiva", "Last Name": "Mintz", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kelley A", "Last Name": "Ryan", "Affiliation": "Lucerno Dynamics, LLC, Cary, North Carolina; and."}, {"First Name": "Steven R", "Last Name": "Perrin", "Affiliation": "Lucerno Dynamics, LLC, Cary, North Carolina; and."}, {"First Name": "Ronald K", "Last Name": "Lattanze", "Affiliation": "Lucerno Dynamics, LLC, Cary, North Carolina; and."}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Townsend", "Affiliation": "A*STAR-NUS Clinical Imaging Research Centre, Singapore dnrdwt@gmail.com."}], "Journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine technology", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "31147872", "Title": "Pericytes in Glioblastomas: Multifaceted Role Within Tumor Microenvironments and Potential for Therapeutic Interventions.", "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal disease that often results in a poor prognosis. Unlike most solid tumors, GBM is characterized by diffuse infiltrating margins, extensive angiogenesis, hypoxia, necrosis, and clonal heterogeneity. Recurrent disease is an unavoidable consequence for many patients as standard treatment options such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have proven to be insufficient in causing long-term survival benefits. Systemic delivery of promising drugs is hindered due to the blood-brain barrier and non-uniform perfusion within GBM tissue. In recent years, many investigations have highlighted the role of GBM stem cells (GSCs) and their microenvironment in the initiation and maintenance of tumor tissue. Preclinical and early clinical studies to target GSCs and microenvironmental components are currently underway. Of these strategies, immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and redirected cytotoxic T cells have shown promising results in early investigations. But, GBM microenvironment is heterogenous and recent investigations have shown cell populations within this microenvironment to be plastic. These studies underline the importance of identifying the role of and targeting multiple cell populations within the GBM microenvironment which could have a synergistic effect when combined with novel therapies. Pericytes are multipotent perivascular cells that play a vital role within the GBM microenvironment by assisting in tumor initiation, survival, and progression. Due to their role in regulating the blood-brain barrier permeability, promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth, clearing extracellular matrix for infiltrating GBM cells and in helping GBM cells evade immune surveillance, pericytes could be ideal therapeutic targets for stymieing or exploiting their role within the GBM microenvironment. This chapter will introduce hallmarks of GBM and elaborate on the contributions of pericytes to these hallmarks by examining recent findings. In addition, the chapter also highlights the therapeutic value of targeting pericytes, while discussing conventional and novel GBM therapies and obstacles to their efficacy.", "Keywords": ["GBM", "Glioblastoma", "Microenvironment", "Pericytes"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Pericytes", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anirudh", "Last Name": "Sattiraju", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Akiva", "Last Name": "Mintz", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. am4754@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31101996", "Title": "Initial biological evaluations of 18F-KS1, a novel ascorbate derivative to image oxidative stress in cancer.", "Abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stress damages many cellular components such as fatty acids, DNA, and proteins. This damage is implicated in many disease pathologies including cancer and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Antioxidants like ascorbate (vitamin C, ascorbic acid) have been shown to protect against the deleterious effects of oxidative stress in patients with cancer. In contrast, other data indicate potential tumor-promoting activity of antioxidants, demonstrating a potential temporal benefit of ROS. However, quantifying real-time tumor ROS is currently not feasible, since there is no way to directly probe global tumor ROS. In order to study this ROS-induced damage and design novel therapeutics to prevent its sequelae, the quantitative nature of positron emission tomography (PET) can be harnessed to measure in vivo concentrations of ROS. Therefore, our goal is to develop a novel translational ascorbate-based probe to image ROS in cancer in vivo using noninvasive PET imaging of tumor tissue.

The aims of this study were to support the role of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) as a prognostic marker for brain tumor patients in multi-center clinical trials. Seventeen participants from four sites had analyzable 3D MRSI datasets acquired on Philips, GE or Siemens scanners at either 1.5T or 3T. MRSI data were analyzed using LCModel to quantify metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), and lactate (Lac). Receiver operating characteristic curves for NAA/Cho, Cho/Cr, lactate/Cr, and lactate/NAA were constructed for overall survival at 1-year (OS-1) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS-6). The OS-1 for the 17 evaluable patients was 59% (10/17). Receiver operating characteristic analyses found the NAA/Cho in tumor (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.00) and in peritumoral regions (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00) were predictive for survival at 1 year. PFS-6 was 65% (11/17). Neither NAA/Cho nor Cho/Cr was effective in predicting 6-month progression free survival. Lac/Cr in tumor was a significant negative predictor of PFS-6, indicating that higher lactate/Cr levels are associated with poorer outcome. (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.54 to 1.00). In conclusion, despite the small sample size in the setting of a multi-center trial comprising different vendors, field strengths, and varying levels of expertise at data acquisition, MRS markers NAA/Cho, Lac/Cr and Lac/NAA predicted overall survival at 1 year and 6-month progression free survival.

Validated radiotracers reported so far for MTs are [11C]paclitaxel, [18F]fluoropaclitaxel, and [11C]docetaxel; however, they are well-characterized substrates of efflux transporters and consequently have poor uptake into the brain due to minimal blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. PET imaging of MT expression requires radiolabeled BBB penetrating MT ligands, and it may offer a direct and more sensitive approach for early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and treatment effects in brain diseases and assessing the clinical potential of targeted therapeutics and treatments. We have identified N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-5-dimethylfuro[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (HD-800) as a high affinity and selective colchicine site tubuline inhibitor amenable to radiolabel with C-11, a positron emitting isotope. HD-800 and desmethyl-HD-800 were synthesized in one step with 75% and 80% yields respectively from commercial synthons. The radiosynthesis of [11C]HD-800 was achieved in 45 \u00b1 5% yield at EOS. Ex vivo biodistribution binding data of [11C]HD-800 indicate that the radioligand penetrated the BBB and it was retained in brain with 75% specific binding. Apart from the brain, specific binding was observed in muscle (55%), heart (50%), lungs (43%), blood (37%), and pancreas (30%). MicroPET imaging in mice showed excellent binding in brain that was blocked by preadministration of unlabeled HD-800 and a colchicine site binding MT ligand MPC-6827.

Apart from arising de novo, GBMs also occur due to progression of slower growing grade III astrocytomas. GBM is characterized by extensive hypoxia, angiogenesis, proliferation and invasion. Standard treatment options such as surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy have increased median patient survival to 14.6\u00a0months in adults but recurrent disease arising from treatment resistant cancer cells often results in patient mortality. These treatment resistant cancer cells have been found to exhibit stem cell like properties. Strategies to identify or target these Glioblastoma Stem Cells (GSC) have proven to be unsuccessful so far. Studies on cancer stem cells (CSC) within GBM and other cancers have highlighted the importance of paracrine signaling networks within their microenvironment on the growth and maintenance of CSCs. The study of GSCs and their communication with various cell populations within their microenvironment is therefore not only important to understand the biology of GBMs but also to predict response to therapies and to identify novel targets which could stymy support to treatment resistant cancer cells and prevent disease recurrence.

First, the acute effects of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 0.01-0.56 mg/kg, i.v.) on cognitive performance, FR responding, and body temperature were determined. Next, THC (1.0-2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered daily after FR 10 sessions for 12 weeks, during which the residual effects of THC (i.e., 22 hours after administration) on cognition were examined and the acute effects of THC were redetermined. In a subgroup of monkeys, dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was assessed after 4 weeks of chronic THC exposure and compared with drug-naive controls using positron emission tomography and [11C]-raclopride (N = 4/group). Acute THC pretreatments dose-dependently decreased FR responding and body temperature, and impairment to cognitive performance was task specific. During chronic treatment, THC produced persistent residual impairment only to working memory; tolerance differentially developed to acute cognitive impairments. There was recovery from residual cognitive impairments to working memory within 2 weeks of abstinence. Compared with controls, D2/D3 receptor availability was not altered during chronic THC treatment.

Our results indicate that platelet respiratory capacity positively correlates to measures of glucose metabolism in multiple brain regions. Altogether, the results of this study provide early evidence that blood-based bioenergetic profiling is related to brain mitochondrial metabolism.

IL13RA2 is a tumor-restricted receptor found to be present in several aggressive malignancies, including in the vast majority of high-grade gliomas and malignant melanoma. This receptor has been successfully targeted for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes using modified IL-13 ligand and more recently using a specific peptide, Pep-1L. In the current work, we establish the in vitro and in vivo tumor binding properties of radiolabeled Pep-1L, designed for tumor imaging. We radiolabeled Pep-1L with Copper-64 and demonstrated specific cell uptake in the IL13RA2-over expressing G48 glioblastoma cell line having abundant IL13RA2 expression. [64Cu]Pep-1L binding was blocked by unlabeled ligand, demonstrating specificity. To demonstrate in vivo tumor uptake, we intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice and demonstrated that [64Cu]Pep-1L specifically bound tumors at 24 hours, which was significantly blocked (3-fold) by pre-injecting unlabeled peptide. To further demonstrate specificity of Pep-1L towards IL13RA2 in vivo, we exploited an IL13RA2-inducible melanoma tumor model that does not express receptor at baseline but expresses abundant receptor after treatment with doxycycline. We injected [64Cu]Pep-1L into mice bearing IL13RA2-inducible melanoma tumors and performed in vivo PET/CT and post-necropsy biodistribution studies and found that tumors that were induced to express IL13RA2 receptor by doxycycline pretreatment bound radiolabeled Pep-1L 3-4 fold greater than uninduced tumors, demonstrating receptor specificity.

Despite the relatively leaky nature of GBM blood vessels, effective delivery of antitumor therapeutics has been a major challenge due to the complications caused by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the highly torturous nature of newly formed tumor vasculature (blood tumor barrier-BTB). External beam radiotherapy was previously shown to be an effective means of permeabilizing central nervous system (CNS) barriers. By using targeted short-ranged radionuclides, we show for the first time that our targeted actinium-225-labeled \u03b1v\u03b23-specific liposomes (225Ac-IA-TLs) caused catastrophic double stranded DNA breaks and significantly enhanced the permeability of BBB and BTB in mice bearing orthotopic GBMs. Histologic studies revealed characteristic \u03b1-particle induced double strand breaks within tumors but was not significantly present in normal brain regions away from the tumor where BBB permeability was observed. These findings indicate that the enhanced vascular permeability in these distal regions did not result from direct \u03b1-particle-induced DNA damage. On the basis of these results, in addition to their direct antitumor effects, 225Ac-IA-TLs can potentially be used to enhance the permeability of BBB and BTB for effective delivery of systemically administered antitumor therapeutics.

In this work, we evaluated the potential of Pep-1L, a novel IL13RA2 targeted peptide, as a platform to deliver targeted lethal therapies to GBM. To demonstrate GBM-specificity, we radiolabeled Pep-1L with Copper-64 and performed in vitro cell binding studies, which demonstrated specific binding that was blocked by unlabeled Pep-1L. Furthermore, we demonstrated real-time GBM localization of [64Cu]Pep-1L to orthotopic GBMs using small animal PET imaging.

Compared with traditional ablative HIFU, nondestructive pulsed HIFU (pHIFU) is present in the majority of novel applications recently developed for enhancing the delivery of drugs and genes. Previous studies have demonstrated the capability of pHIFU to change tissue local permeability for enhanced drug delivery in both mouse tumors and mouse muscle. Further study based on bulk tissues in large animals and clinical HIFU system revealed correlation between therapeutic effect and thermal parameters, which was absent in the previous mouse studies. In this study, we further investigated the relation between the therapeutic effect of pHIFU and thermal parameters in bulky normal muscle tissues based on a rabbit model and a preclinical HIFU system. Correlation between therapeutic effect and thermal parameters was confirmed in our study on the same bulk tissues although different HIFU systems were used. Following the study in bulky normal muscle tissues, we further created bulky tumor model with VX2 tumors implanted on both hind limbs of rabbits and investigated the feasibility to enhance tumor permeability in bulky VX2 tumors in a rabbit model using pHIFU technique.

Standard treatment options such as radiation and chemotherapy have proven to be only marginally effective in treating GBM because of its invasive nature. Therefore, extensive efforts have been put forth to develop tumor-tropic stem cells as viable therapeutic vehicles with potential to treat even the most invasive tumor cells that are harbored within areas of normal brain. To this end, we discovered a newly described NG2-expressing cell that we isolated from a distinct pericyte subtype found abundantly in cultures derived from peripheral muscle. In this work, we show the translational significance of these peripherally derived neural-like stem cells (NLSC) and their potential to migrate toward tumors and act as therapeutic carriers. We demonstrate that these NLSCs exhibit in vitro and in vivo GBM tropism. Furthermore, NLSCs did not promote angiogenesis or transform into tumor-associated stromal cells, which are concerns raised when using other common stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells and induced neural stem cells, as therapeutic carriers. We also demonstrate the potential of NLSCs to express a prototype therapeutic, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and kill GBM cells in vitro. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of our newly characterized NLSC against GBM.

Analysis of FGFR1-4 and brachyury expression in human lung tumor tissue and cell lines found that only expression of FGFR1 was positively correlated with brachyury expression. Specific knockdown of FGFR1 by siRNA suppressed brachyury expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (upregulation of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and downregulation of Snail and fibronectin), whereas forced overexpression of FGFR1 induced brachyury expression and promoted EMT in lung cancer cells. Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/FGFR1 signaling promoted phosphorylated MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, upregulated brachyury expression, and increased cell growth and invasion. In addition, human lung cancer cells with higher brachyury expression were more sensitive to inhibitors targeting FGFR1/MAPK pathway.

To guide interpretation of these quantitative data, we evaluated the repeatability of 18F-FLT PET as part of a multicenter trial involving patients with high-grade glioma. Methods:18F-FLT PET was performed on 10 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma at 5 different institutions within the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium trial ABTC1101. Data were acquired according to a double baseline protocol in which PET examinations were repeated within 2 d of each other with no intervening treatment. On each of the 2 imaging days, dedicated brain PET was performed at 2 time points, 1 and 3 h after 18F-FLT administration. Tumor SUVs and related parameters were measured at a central laboratory using various volumes of interest: isocontour at 30% of the maximum pixel (SUVmean_30%), gradient-based segmentation (SUVmean_gradient), the maximum pixel (SUVmax), and a 1-mL sphere at the region of highest uptake (SUVpeak). Repeatability coefficients (RCs) were calculated from the relative differences between corresponding SUV measurements obtained on the 2 d. Results: RCs for tumor SUVs were 22.5% (SUVmean_30%), 23.8% (SUVmean_gradient), 23.2% (SUVmax), and 18.5% (SUVpeak) at 1 h after injection. Corresponding data at 3 h were 22.4%, 25.0%, 27.3%, and 23.6%. Normalizing the tumor SUV data with reference to a background region improved repeatability, and the most stable parameter was the tumor-to-background ratio derived using SUVpeak (RC, 16.5%). Conclusion: SUV quantification of 18F-FLT uptake in glioma had an RC in the range of 18%-24% when imaging began 1 h after 18F-FLT administration.

This communication describes the evaluation of (225)Ac-DOTA-c(RGDyK) in both biodistribution and Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) studies. Initially, La-DOTA-c(RGDyK) was prepared as a non-radioactive surrogate to evaluate methodologies that would contribute to an optimized radiochemical synthetic strategy and estimate the radioactive conjugate's affinity for \u03b1v\u03b23, using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy studies revealed the IC50 and Ki of La-DOTA-c(RGDyK) to be 33 \u00b1 13 nM and 26 \u00b1 11 nM, respectively, and suggest that the complexation of the La(3+) ion to the conjugate did not significantly alter integrin binding. Furthermore, use of this surrogate allowed optimization of radiochemical synthesis strategies to prepare (225)Ac-DOTA-c(RGDyK) with high radiochemical purity and specific activity similar to other (225)Ac-based radiopharmaceuticals. This radiopharmaceutical was highly stable in vitro. In vivo biodistribution studies confirmed the radiotracer's ability to target \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin with specificity; specificity was detected in tumor-bearing animals using Cerenkov luminescence imaging. Furthermore, tumor growth control was achieved using non-toxic doses of the radiopharmaceutical in U87mg tumor-bearing nude mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the CLI of \u03b1v\u03b23 (+) tumors in live animals using the daughter products derived from (225)Ac decay in situ.

Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of a broad range of brain disorders. Current strategies for BBB opening are invasive, not specific, and lack precise control over the site and timing of BBB opening, which may limit their clinical translation. In the present report, we describe a novel approach based on a combination of stem cell delivery, heat-inducible gene expression and mild heating with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) under MRI guidance to remotely permeabilize BBB. The permeabilization of the BBB will be controlled with, and limited to where selected pro-inflammatory factors will be secreted secondary to HIFU activation, which is in the vicinity of the engineered stem cells and consequently both the primary and secondary disease foci.

However, the mechanism associated with brachyury-regulated cell growth is poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a regulator of brachyury expression in normal tissue, may also play an important role in chordoma pathophysiology. Using a panel of chordoma cell lines, we explored the role of FGF signaling and brachyury in cell growth and survival. Western blots showed that all chordoma cell lines expressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), FGFR3, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), whereas no cell lines expressed FGFR1 and FGFR4. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that chordoma cells produced FGF2. Neutralization of FGF2 inhibited MEK/ERK phosphorylation, decreased brachyury expression and induced apoptosis while reducing cell growth. Activation of the FGFR/MEK/ERK/brachyury pathway by FGF2-initiated phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2)-\u03b1 (Tyr196) prevented apoptosis while promoting cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immunofluorescence staining showed that FGF2 promoted the translocation of phosphorylated ERK to the nucleus and increased brachyury expression. The selective inhibition of FGFR, MEK and ERK phosphorylation by PD173074, PD0325901 and PD184352, respectively, decreased brachyury expression, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell growth and EMT. Moreover, knockdown of brachyury by small hairpin RNA reduced FGF2 secretion, inhibited FGFR/MEK/ERK phosphorylation and blocked the effects of FGF2 on cell growth, apoptosis and EMT.

Understanding the biological mechanisms responsible is essential to sustaining and improving their quality of life. Compared with young mice, aged mice take longer to recover from muscle injury; their tissue fibrosis is more extensive, and regenerated myofibers are smaller. Strong evidence indicates that cells called pericytes, embedded in the basement membrane of capillaries, contribute to the satellite-cell pool and muscle growth. In addition to their role in skeletal muscle repair, after tissue damage, they detach from capillaries and migrate to the interstitial space to participate in fibrosis formation. Here we distinguish two bona fide pericyte subtypes in the skeletal muscle interstitium, type-1 (Nestin-GFP(-)/NG2-DsRed(+)) and type-2 (Nestin-GFP(+)/NG2-DsRed(+)), and characterize their heretofore unknown specific roles in the aging environment. Our in vitro results show that type-1 and type-2 pericytes are either fibrogenic or myogenic, respectively. Transplantation studies in young animals indicate that type-2 pericytes are myogenic, while type-1 pericytes remain in the interstitial space. In older mice, however, the muscular regenerative capacity of type-2 pericytes is limited, and type-1 pericytes produce collagen, contributing to fibrous tissue deposition.

This approach revealed them in nonhuman primates and aging rodents throughout the lifespan.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult Stem Cells", "Animals", "Antigens", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cells, Cultured", "Genetic Markers", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Intermediate Filament Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nestin", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neuroglia", "Proteoglycans", "Stem Cell Transplantation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Birbrair", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine-Gerontology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC 27157, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhong-Min", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mar\u00eda Laura", "Last Name": "Messi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Grigori N", "Last Name": "Enikolopov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Akiva", "Last Name": "Mintz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Osvaldo", "Last Name": "Delbono", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Experimental cell research", "PubDate": "2013Jan01"}]
