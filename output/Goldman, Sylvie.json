[{"PMID": "37973254", "Title": "Improving autism identification and support for individuals assigned female at birth: clinical suggestions and research priorities.", "Abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the higher prevalence of autism in individuals who are assigned male than assigned female at birth results from both biological factors and identification biases. Autistic individuals who are assigned female at birth (AFAB) and those who are gender diverse experience health disparities and clinical inequity, including late or missed diagnosis and inadequate support. In this Viewpoint, an international panel of clinicians, scientists, and community members with lived experiences of autism reviewed the challenges in identifying autism in individuals who are AFAB and proposed clinical and research directions to promote the health, development, and wellbeing of autistic AFAB individuals. The recognition challenges stem from the interplay between cognitive differences and nuanced or different presentations of autism in some AFAB individuals; expectancy, gender-related, and autism-related biases held by clinicians; and social determinants. We recommend that professional development for clinicians be supported by health-care systems, professional societies, and governing bodies to improve equitable access to assessment and earlier identification of autism in AFAB individuals. Autistic AFAB individuals should receive tailored support in education, identity development, health care, and social and professional sense of belonging.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Infant, Newborn", "Humans", "Male", "Female", "Autistic Disorder", "Gender Identity", "Research", "Interpersonal Relations", "Prevalence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meng-Chuan", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "Child and Youth Mental Health Collaborative at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, ON, Canada; Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Anouck", "Last Name": "Amestoy", "Affiliation": "Centre for Autism Spectrum Disorders, Aquitaine Institute for Cognitive and Integrative Neurosciences, Charles Perrens Hospital, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Somer", "Last Name": "Bishop", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heather M", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Education, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Mor\u00e9nike", "Last Name": "Giwa Onaiwu", "Affiliation": "Autistic Women & Nonbinary Network, Lincoln, NE, USA; Rice University Center for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, School of Humanities, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alycia", "Last Name": "Halladay", "Affiliation": "Autism Science Foundation, Scarsdale, NY, USA; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clare", "Last Name": "Harrop", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences and TEACCH Autism Program, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Hotez", "Affiliation": "David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marisela", "Last Name": "Huerta", "Affiliation": "Felicity House, New York, NY, USA; Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health, Villanova, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dylan", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Auxiliary Enterprises, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine Wu", "Last Name": "Nordahl", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and MIND Institute, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison B", "Last Name": "Ratto", "Affiliation": "Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders, Division of Neuropsychology, Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Celine", "Last Name": "Saulnier", "Affiliation": "Neurodevelopmental Assessment and Consulting Services, Decatur, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paige M", "Last Name": "Siper", "Affiliation": "Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment, Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin", "Last Name": "Sohl", "Affiliation": "ECHO Autism Communities, Department of Child Health, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lonnie", "Last Name": "Zwaigenbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sylvie", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.

Classic Rett Syndrome presents in early childhood with a period of developmental regression, loss of purposeful hand skills along with hand stereotypies, gait abnormalities, and loss of acquired speech. Atypical RTT is diagnosed when a child shows some but not all the phenotypes of classic RTT, along with additional supporting criteria. Over 95% of classic RTT cases are attributed to pathogenic variants in Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2), though additional genes have been implicated in other RTT cases, particularly those with the atypical RTT clinical picture. Other genetic etiologies have emerged with similar clinical characteristics to RTT Syndrome. Our team has characterized HNRNPH2-related neurodevelopmental disorder (HNRNPH2-RNDD) in 33 individuals associated with de novo pathogenic missense variants in the X-linked HNRNPH2 gene, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, autistic-like features, and motor abnormalities. We sought to further characterize RTT clinical features in this group of individuals by using caregiver report. Twenty-six caregivers completed electronic surveys, with only 3 individuals having previously received an atypical RTT diagnosis, and no individuals with a typical RTT diagnosis. Caregivers reported a high number of behaviors and/or phenotypes consistent with RTT, including the major criteria of the syndrome, such as regression of developmental skills and abnormal gait. Based on the survey results, 12 individuals could meet the diagnostic clinical criteria for atypical RTT Syndrome. In summary, individuals with HNRNPH2-RNDD exhibit clinical characteristics that overlap with those of RTT, and therefore, HNRNPH2-RNDD, should be considered on the differential diagnosis list with this clinical picture.", "Keywords": ["HNRNPH2", "HNRNPH2-related neurodevelopmental disorder (HNRNPH2-RNDD)", "Rett Syndrome", "Rett-like phenotypes", "neurodevelopmental disorder", "neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD)"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Rett Syndrome", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Intellectual Disability", "Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group F-H"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph Nicho", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sylvie", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Division of Child Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melissa T", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer M", "Last Name": "Bain", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Division of Child Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes", "PubDate": "2023May26"}, {"PMID": "37036706", "Title": "Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants With and Without Exposure to Asymptomatic or Mild Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Infection During Pregnancy.", "Abstract": "Associations between prenatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes have substantial public health relevance.

We analyzed videos of 15 probands (PB) and 12 typically developing (TD) siblings, engaged in a preferred-pace walking task, using pose estimation software to track points of interest on their bodies over time. Analyzing the extracted information revealed that PB children had significantly less whole-body gait synchrony and poorer balance compared to their TD siblings.

The shift to telehealth assessments has challenged clinicians to reconsider approaches and assumptions that underlie the diagnostic assessment process, and to adopt new ways of individualizing standard assessments according to family and child needs. Mandates for physical distancing have uncovered deficiencies in diagnostic practices for suspected autism and have illuminated biases that have posed obstacles preventing children and families from receiving the services that they truly need. This Commentary outlines several considerations for improving diagnostic practices as we move forward from the current pandemic and continue to strive to build an adaptable, sustainable, equitable, and family-centered system of care. LAY SUMMARY: Physical distancing and the abrupt end to in-person services for many children on the autism spectrum has forced clinicians to examine the existing challenges with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment and consider things they want to keep and things that should be changed in the years ahead. New approaches such as telehealth both alleviated and exacerbated existing disparities, and brought into stark focus the importance of equitable and timely access to family-centered care. This commentary suggests ways of improving clinical practices related to ASD assessment to continue along this path.", "Keywords": ["assessment", "autism", "challenges", "children", "diagnosis", "disparities", "pandemic"], "MeSH terms": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "COVID-19", "Child", "Humans", "Pandemics", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lonnie", "Last Name": "Zwaigenbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Somer", "Last Name": "Bishop", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy L", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Ibanez", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alycia", "Last Name": "Halladay", "Affiliation": "Autism Science Foundation, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sylvie", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, G.H.

We also sought to identify provider and patient/parent limitations of the TH experience. One hundred fourteen clinicians completed the online survey. The majority of child neurologists transitioned within 3 weeks of the pandemic onset and found it inappropriate to evaluate a child under 1 year of age via TH. We identified specific disorders considered inappropriate for initial evaluation via TH, including neuromuscular disease, neuropathy, weakness, autoimmune disease and autism spectrum disorders. Patient and parent technical and economic issues are significant limitations of TH.

These stigmatizing motor behaviors represent one manifestation of the third core criterion for an Autistic Disorder (AD) diagnosis, and are becoming viewed as potential early markers of autism. Moreover, motor stereotypies might be a tangible expression of the underlying neurobiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder. In this study, we videoscored stereotypies recorded during semi-structured play sessions from school age children with AD. We examined the effect of severity and persistence over time of stereotypies on brain volumetric changes. Our findings confirmed that the brain volume of school age children with AD is, on average, larger than that of age-matched typically developing children. However, we have failed to detect any sign of volumetric differences in brain regions thought to be particularly linked to the pathophysiology of stereotypies. This negative finding may suggest that, at least with respect to motor stereotypies, functional rather than structural alterations might be the underpinning of these disruptive motor manifestations of autism.", "Keywords": ["Autistic Disorder", "Motor stereotypies", "Structural imaging", "Videotape scoring", "Volumetric brain analysis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sylvie", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Saul R.

So far, it has been challenging to distinguish among these different possibilities, not only because of lack of objective and quantitative means to assess stereotypies, but in our opinion also because of the underappreciated diversity of their clinical presentations. Herein, we illustrate the broad spectrum of stereotypies and demonstrate the usefulness of video-assisted clinical observations of children with autism. The clips presented were extracted from play sessions of 129 children with autism disorder. We conclude that compared to widely used questionnaires and interviews, systematic video observations provide a unique means to classify and score precisely the clinical features of stereotypies. We believe this approach will prove useful to both clinicians and researchers as it offers the level of detail from retrievable images necessary to begin to assess effects of age and treatments on stereotypies, and to embark on the type of investigations required to unravel the physiological basis of motor behaviors in autism.", "Keywords": ["autism", "classification", "motor stereotypies", "variability", "video"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sylvie", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Saul R.
