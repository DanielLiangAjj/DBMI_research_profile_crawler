[{"PMID": "38889126", "Title": "Psychosocial experiences are associated with human brain mitochondrial biology.", "Abstract": "Psychosocial experiences affect brain health and aging trajectories, but the molecular pathways underlying these associations remain unclear. Normal brain function relies on energy transformation by mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Two main lines of evidence position mitochondria both as targets and drivers of psychosocial experiences. On the one hand, chronic stress exposure and mood states may alter multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology; on the other hand, functional variations in mitochondrial OxPhos capacity may alter social behavior, stress reactivity, and mood. But are psychosocial exposures and subjective experiences linked to mitochondrial biology in the human brain? By combining longitudinal antemortem assessments of psychosocial factors with postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) proteomics in older adults, we find that higher well-being is linked to greater abundance of the mitochondrial OxPhos machinery, whereas higher negative mood is linked to lower OxPhos protein content. Combined, positive and negative psychosocial factors explained 18 to 25% of the variance in the abundance of OxPhos complex I, the primary biochemical entry point that energizes brain mitochondria. Moreover, interrogating mitochondrial psychobiological associations in specific neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed strong cell-type-specific associations for positive psychosocial experiences and mitochondria in glia but opposite associations in neurons. As a result, these \"mind-mitochondria\" associations were masked in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting the likely underestimation of true psychobiological effect sizes in bulk brain tissues. Thus, self-reported psychosocial experiences are linked to human brain mitochondrial phenotypes.", "Keywords": ["mitochondria", "proteome", "psychosocial factors", "single cell RNA-seq", "transcriptome"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mitochondria", "Male", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Female", "Brain", "Aged", "Stress, Psychological", "Middle Aged", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Neurons", "Proteomics", "Affect"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Trumpff", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Anna S", "Last Name": "Monzel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "Sandi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne CH-1015, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Vilas", "Last Name": "Menon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Ulrich", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Masashi", "Last Name": "Fujita", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Vladislav A", "Last Name": "Petyuk", "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354."}, {"First Name": "Cheyenne", "Last Name": "Hurst", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Duc M", "Last Name": "Duong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas T", "Last Name": "Seyfried", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Aliza P", "Last Name": "Wingo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Human Genetics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Thomas S", "Last Name": "Wingo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Human Genetics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30329."}, {"First Name": "Yanling", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612."}, {"First Name": "Madhav", "Last Name": "Thambisetty", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Section, Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, Baltimore, MD 21224."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Ferrucci", "Affiliation": "Longitudinal Studies Section, Translational Gerontology Branch, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Picard", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2024Jul02"}, {"PMID": "38659958", "Title": "Psychobiological regulation of plasma and saliva GDF15 dynamics in health and mitochondrial diseases.", "Abstract": "GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15) is a marker of cellular energetic stress linked to physical-mental illness, aging, and mortality.

Here, we examine the natural dynamics and psychobiological regulation of plasma and saliva GDF15 in four human studies representing 4,749 samples from 188 individuals. We show that GDF15 protein is detectable in saliva (8% of plasma concentration), likely produced by salivary glands secretory duct cells. Using a brief laboratory socio-evaluative stressor paradigm, we find that psychosocial stress increases plasma (+3.5-5.9%) and saliva GDF15 (+43%) with distinct kinetics, within minutes. Moreover, saliva GDF15 exhibits a robust awakening response, declining by ~40-89% within 30-45 minutes from its peak level at the time of waking up. Clinically, individuals with genetic mitochondrial OxPhos diseases show elevated baseline plasma and saliva GDF15, and post-stress GDF15 levels in both biofluids correlate with multi-system disease severity, exercise intolerance, and the subjective experience of fatigue. Taken together, our data establish that saliva GDF15 is dynamic, sensitive to psychological states, a clinically relevant endocrine marker of mitochondrial diseases.

diseases suffer from multisystemic symptoms that vary in severity from day-to-day and week-to-week, but the underlying causes of symptomatic fluctuations are not understood. Based upon observations that: i) patients and their families frequently report that stressful life events either trigger exacerbations of existing symptoms or the onset of new symptoms, ii) psychological states and stress hormones influence mitochondrial energy production capacity, and iii) epidemiological reports document a robust connection between traumatic/stressful life events and various neurologic disorders, we hypothesized that mitochondrial disease symptom severity may vary according to participant's mood. To investigate this we administered the Stress, Health and Emotion Survey (SHES) in 70 adults (majority white (84%) cisgender women (83%), ages 18-74) with self-reported mitochondrial diseases (MELAS, 18%; CPEO, 17%; Complex I deficiency, 13%). Participants rated the severity of each of their symptom(s) over the past year on either good or bad days. On days marked by more stress, sadness and other negative emotions, some but not all symptoms were reported to be worse, including fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, and fine motor coordination. By contrast, on days marked by happiness and calmness, participants reported these and other symptoms to be better, or less severe. Other symptoms including diminished sweating, hearing problems, and dystonia were in general unrelated to mood. Thus, some individuals living with mitochondrial diseases, at times perceive a connection between their mood and symptom severity. These preliminary associative results constitute an initial step towards developing more comprehensive models of the factors that influence the clinical course of mitochondrial diseases.", "Keywords": ["3243A>G", "clinical survey", "disease severity", "emotion", "family", "mitochondrial disease", "mood", "patient care", "stress"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Junker", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Behavioral Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kris", "Last Name": "Englestad", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, H.

Commonly referred to as cell-free mtDNA (cf-mtDNA), the field is currently without a comprehensive classification system that acknowledges the various biological forms of mtDNA and whole mitochondria existing outside the cell. This absence of classification hampers the creation of precise and consistent quantification methods across different laboratories, which is crucial for unraveling the molecular and biological characteristics of mtDNA. In this article, we integrate recent findings to propose a classification for different types of Extracellular mtDNA [ex-mtDNA]. The major biologically distinct types include: Naked mtDNA [N-mtDNA], mtDNA within non-mitochondrial Membranes [M-mtDNA], Extracellular mitochondria [exM-mtDNA], and mtDNA within Mitochondria enclosed in a Membrane [MM-mtDNA]. We outline the challenges associated with accurately quantifying these ex-mtDNA types, suggest potential physiological roles for each ex-mtDNA type, and explore how this classification could establish a foundation for future research endeavors and further analysis and definitions for ex-mtDNA. By proposing this classification of circulating mtDNA forms, we draw a parallel with the clinically recognized forms of cholesterol, such as HDL and LDL, to illustrate potential future significance in a similar manner. While not directly analogous, these mtDNA forms may one day be as biologically relevant in clinical interpretation as cholesterol fractions are currently. We also discuss how advancing methodologies to reliably quantify distinct ex-mtDNA forms could significantly enhance their utility as health or disease biomarkers, and how their application may offer innovative therapeutic approaches.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Biomarker", "Classification", "Extracellular mitochondria (ex-mito)", "Extracellular mitochondrial DNA (ex-mtDNA)", "Health", "Identification methods", "Stress", "Therapeutic agent"], "MeSH terms": ["DNA, Mitochondrial", "Mitochondria", "Cholesterol"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andr\u00e9s", "Last Name": "Caicedo", "Affiliation": "Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, Colegio de Ciencias de la Salud, Escuela de Medicina, Quito, Ecuador; Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, Instituto de Investigaciones en Biomedicina iBioMed, Quito, Ecuador; Mito-Act Research Consortium, Quito, Ecuador; Sistemas M\u00e9dicos SIME, Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, Quito, Ecuador.

The adrenal cortex is organized in three functionally specialized zones (glomerulosa, fasciculata, and reticularis) that produce different classes of steroid hormones in response to various stimuli, including psychosocial stress. Given that the functions and morphology of mitochondria are dynamically related and respond to stress, we applied transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine potential differences in mitochondrial morphology under basal and chronic psychosocial stress conditions. We used the chronic subordinate colony housing (CSC) paradigm, a murine model of chronic psychosocial stress. Our findings quantitatively define how mitochondrial morphology differs among each of the three adrenal cortex zones under basal conditions, and show that chronic psychosocial stress mainly affected mitochondria in the zona glomerulosa, shifting their morphology towards the more typical glucocorticoid-producing zona fasciculata mitochondrial phenotype. Analysis of adrenocortical lipid droplets that provide cholesterol for steroidogenesis showed that chronic psychosocial stress altered lipid droplet diameter, without affecting droplet number or inter-organellar mitochondria-lipid droplet interactions. Together, our findings support the hypothesis that each adrenal cortex layer is characterized by morphologically distinct mitochondria and that this adrenal zone-specific mitochondrial morphology is sensitive to environmental stimuli, including chronic psychosocial stressors.

Here we examined the association between multiple features of mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and stress-related behaviors in male mice with diverse behavioral phenotypes. Miniaturized assays of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content were deployed on 571 samples across 17 brain areas, defining specific patterns of mito-behavior associations. By applying multi-slice network analysis to our brain-wide mitochondrial dataset, we identified three large-scale networks of brain areas with shared mitochondrial signatures.

However, the chronic activation of energy-dependent allostatic responses results in allostatic load, a dysregulated state that predicts functional decline, accelerates aging, and increases mortality in humans. The energetic cost and cellular basis for the damaging effects of allostatic load have not been defined. Here, by longitudinally profiling three unrelated primary human fibroblast lines across their lifespan, we find that chronic glucocorticoid exposure increases cellular energy expenditure by \u223c60%, along with a metabolic shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This state of stress-induced hypermetabolism is linked to mtDNA instability, non-linearly affects age-related cytokines secretion, and accelerates cellular aging based on DNA methylation clocks, telomere shortening rate, and reduced lifespan. Pharmacologically normalizing OxPhos activity while further increasing energy expenditure exacerbates the accelerated aging phenotype, pointing to total energy expenditure as a potential driver of aging dynamics.

Here we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (n=389), post-mitotic brain tissue (n=798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures WGS design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging 5. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived SURF1-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors.

By integrating data from 17 cohorts of patients with mitochondrial diseases (n\u2009=\u2009690) we find evidence that these disorders increase resting energy expenditure, a state termed hypermetabolism. We examine this phenomenon longitudinally in patient-derived fibroblasts from multiple donors. Genetically or pharmacologically disrupting OxPhos approximately doubles cellular energy expenditure. This cell-autonomous\u00a0state of hypermetabolism occurs despite near-normal OxPhos coupling efficiency, excluding uncoupling as a general mechanism. Instead, hypermetabolism is associated with mitochondrial DNA instability, activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), and increased extracellular secretion of age-related cytokines and metabokines including GDF15. In parallel, OxPhos defects accelerate telomere erosion and epigenetic aging per cell division, consistent with evidence that excess energy expenditure accelerates biological aging. To explore potential mechanisms for these effects, we generate a longitudinal RNASeq and DNA methylation resource dataset, which reveals conserved, energetically demanding, genome-wide recalibrations. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to understand how OxPhos defects influence the energetic cost of living, and the link between hypermetabolism and aging in cells and patients with

The energetic model of allostatic load (EMAL) emphasizes the energetic cost of allostasis and allostatic load, where the \"load\" is the additional energetic burden required to support allostasis and stress-induced energy needs. Living organisms have a limited capacity to consume energy. Overconsumption of energy by allostatic brain-body processes leads to hypermetabolism, defined as excess energy expenditure above the organism's optimum. In turn, hypermetabolism accelerates physiological decline in cells, laboratory animals, and humans, and may drive biological aging. Therefore, we propose that the transition from adaptive allostasis to maladaptive allostatic states, allostatic load, and allostatic overload arises when the added energetic cost of stress competes with longevity-promoting growth, maintenance, and repair. Mechanistically, the energetic restriction of growth, maintenance and repair processes leads to the progressive wear-and-tear of molecular and organ systems. The proposed model makes testable predictions around the physiological, cellular, and sub-cellular energetic mechanisms that transduce chronic stress into disease risk and mortality.

However, the dynamics of cf-mtDNA has not been defined, and whether it can be measured non-invasively like other neuroendocrine markers in saliva has not been examined. Here we report cf-mtDNA in human saliva and establish its natural within-person dynamic behavior across multiple weeks. In a small proof-of-principle cohort of healthy adults, we first develop an approach to rapidly quantify salivary cf-mtDNA without DNA isolation, and demonstrate the existence of salivary cf-mtDNA. We then deploy this approach to perform an intensive repeated-measures analysis of two healthy men studied at 4 daily timepoints over 53-60 consecutive days (n\u00a0=\u00a0212-220 observations each) with parallel measures of steroid hormones, self-reported daily mood, and health-related behaviors. Salivary cf-mtDNA exhibited a robust awakening response reaching up to two orders of magnitude 30-45\u00a0min after awakening, varied from day-to-day, and moderately correlated with the cortisol awakening response. In exploratory analyses, no consistent association with self-reported daily mood/health-related behaviors were found, although this requires further examination in future studies. Dynamic variation in cf-mtDNA was inversely related with salivary interleukin 6 (IL-6), inconsistent with a pro-inflammatory effect of salivary cf-mtDNA.

In addition, we examined the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau protein-as a marker of postmortem tau burden-and global metabolism in both a human population study and in C. elegans, using the same p-tau transgenic strain. From the human population study, plasma and CSF-derived metabolic features associated with p-tau levels were related to drug, amino acid, fatty acid, and mitochondrial metabolism pathways. A total of five metabolites overlapped between plasma and C. elegans, and four between CSF and C. elegans. DDT exacerbated the inhibitory effect of p-tau protein on growth and basal respiration. In the presence of p-tau protein, DDT induced more curling and was associated with reduced levels of amino acids but increased levels of uric acid and adenosylselenohomocysteine.

Here, using quantitative proteomics across three independent cohorts we systematically characterized the co-regulation patterns of mitochondrial RC proteins in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Whereas the abundance of RC protein subunits that physically assemble into stable complexes were correlated, indicating their co-regulation, RC assembly factors exhibited modest co-regulation. Within complex I, nuclear DNA-encoded subunits exhibited >2.5-times higher co-regulation than mitochondrial (mt)DNA-encoded subunits.

In this review we summarize the recent advances in understanding of structural biology, function, and regulation of these systems, highlighting the previously undescribed role of PAPs in providing a common architectural scaffold across diverse families of transporters. Despite being built from a limited number of basic structural domains, these complexes present a staggering variety of architectures.

In a first cohort, whole blood from 20 healthy women and men was stimulated with increasing concentrations of the immune agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Four inhibitors of mitochondrial respiratory chain Complexes I, III, IV, and V were used (LPS + Mito-Inhibitors) to acutely perturb mitochondrial function, GC sensitivity was quantified using the GC-mimetic dexamethasone (DEX) (LPS + DEX), and the resultant cytokine signatures mapped with a 20-cytokine array. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration caused large inter-individual differences in LPS-stimulated IL-6 reactivity (Cohen's d = 0.72) and TNF-\u03b1 (d = 1.55) but only minor alteration in EC50-based LPS sensitivity (d = 0.21). Specifically, inhibiting mitochondrial Complex IV potentiated LPS-induced IL-6 levels by 13%, but inhibited TNF-\u03b1 induction by 72%, indicating mitochondrial regulation of the IL-6/TNF-\u03b1 ratio. As expected, DEX treatment suppressed multiple LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, .TNF-\u03b1) by >85% and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by 80%. Inhibiting Complex I potentiated DEX suppression of IL-6 by a further 12% (d = 0.73), indicating partial mitochondrial modulation of glucocorticoid sensitivity. Finally, to examine if intrinsic mitochondrial respiratory capacity may explain a portion of immune reactivity differences across individuals, we measured biochemical respiratory chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial DNA copy number in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a second cohort of 44 healthy individuals in parallel with LPS-stimulated IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 response.

Greying is of profound psychological and commercial relevance in increasingly ageing populations. In addition, the onset and perpetuation of defective melanin production in the human anagen hair follicle pigmentary unit (HFPU) provides a superb model for interrogating the molecular mechanisms of ageing in a complex human mini-organ, and greying-associated defects in bulge melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) represent an intriguing system of neural crest-derived stem cell senescence. Here, we emphasize that human greying invariably begins with the gradual decline in melanogenesis, including reduced tyrosinase activity, defective melanosome transfer and apoptosis of HFPU melanocytes, and is thus a primary event of the anagen hair bulb, not the bulge. Eventually, the bulge MSC pool becomes depleted as well, at which stage greying becomes largely irreversible. There is still no universally accepted model of human hair greying, and the extent of genetic contributions to greying remains unclear. However, oxidative damage likely is a crucial driver of greying via its disruption of HFPU melanocyte survival, MSC maintenance, and of the enzymatic apparatus of melanogenesis itself. While neuroendocrine factors [e.g. alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), \u00df-endorphin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)], and micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) are well-known regulators of human hair follicle melanocytes and melanogenesis, how exactly these and other factors [e.g. thyroid hormones, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), P-cadherin, peripheral clock activity] modulate greying requires more detailed study.

We initially optimized human plasma digestion and extraction conditions for maximal recovery of these DNAs using a magnetic bead-based isolation method. However, when we incorporated this method onto a high-throughput platform, initial experiments found that DNA isolated from identical human plasma samples displayed plate edge effects resulting in low ccf-mtDNA reproducibility, whereas ccf-nDNA was less affected.

Lifespan extension of per mutants depends on mitochondrial uncoupling in the intestine. Moreover, upregulated uncoupling protein UCP4C in intestinal stem cells and enteroblasts is sufficient to extend lifespan and preserve proliferative homeostasis in the gut with age. Consistent with inducing a metabolic state that prevents overproliferation, mitochondrial uncoupling drugs also extend lifespan and inhibit intestinal stem cell overproliferation due to aging or even tumorigenesis.

We here pinpoint a methodological problem of the earlier rapid filtration experiments, and we suggest that the true overall dissociation rate of C12E8 is indeed much faster than previously thought.

Here we culture primary human fibroblasts across the cellular lifespan (~6\u00a0months) and use four different DNAm clocks to show that age-related DNAm signatures are conserved and accelerated in vitro. The Skin & Blood clock shows the best linear correlation with chronological time (r\u00a0=\u00a00.90), including during replicative senescence. Although similar in nature, the rate of epigenetic aging is approximately 62x times faster in cultured cells than in the human body. Consistent with in vivo data, cells aged under hyperglycemic conditions exhibit an approximately three years elevation in baseline DNAm age. Moreover, candidate gene-based analyses further corroborate the conserved but accelerated biological aging process in cultured fibroblasts. Fibroblasts mirror the established DNAm topology of the age-related ELOVL2 gene in human blood and the rapid hypermethylation of its promoter cg16867657, which correlates with a linear decrease in ELOVL2 mRNA levels across the lifespan. Using generalized additive modeling on twelve timepoints across the lifespan, we also show how single CpGs exhibit loci-specific, linear and nonlinear trajectories that reach rates up to -47% (hypomethylation) to +23% (hypermethylation) per month.

This subjective state must be distinguished from the objective state of disease. The experience of health and illness (or poor health) can occur both in the absence and presence of objective disease. Given that the subjective experience of health, as well as the finding of objective disease in the community, follow a Pareto distribution, the following questions arise: What are the processes that allow the emergence of four observable states-(1) subjective health in the absence of objective disease, (2) subjective health in the presence of objective disease, (3) illness in the absence of objective disease, and (4) illness in the presence of objective disease? If we consider each individual as a unique biological system, these four health states must emerge from physiological network structures and personal behaviors. The underlying physiological mechanisms primarily arise from the dynamics of external environmental and internal patho/physiological stimuli, which activate regulatory systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system. Together with other systems, they enable feedback interactions between all of the person's system domains and impact on his system's entropy. These interactions affect individual behaviors, emotional, and cognitive responses, as well as molecular, cellular, and organ system level functions. This paper explores the hypothesis that health is an emergent state that arises from hierarchical network interactions between a person's external environment and internal physiology. As a result, the concept of health synthesizes available qualitative and quantitative evidence of interdependencies and constraints that indicate its top-down and bottom-up causative mechanisms. Thus, to provide effective care, we must use strategies that combine person-centeredness with the scientific approaches that address the molecular network physiology, which together underpin health and disease. Moreover, we propose that good health can also be promoted by strengthening resilience and self-efficacy at the personal and social level, and via cohesion at the population level. Understanding health as a state that is both individualized and that emerges from multi-scale interdependencies between microlevel physiological mechanisms of health and disease and macrolevel societal domains may provide the basis for a new public discourse for health service and health system redesign.", "Keywords": ["complex adaptive nature of health", "disease networks", "emergence", "health", "health system redesign", "physiology of health", "psychoneuroimmunology", "top-down and bottom-up causation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joachim P", "Last Name": "Sturmberg", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health and Medicine, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Picard", "Affiliation": "Division of Behavioral Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Neurology, The H.

At the blood-brain barrier (BBB), these proteins are particularly important for the maintenance of brain homeostasis, but also regulate the distribution of therapeutic drugs. Absolute quantification (AQUA) is achieved by using stable isotope labeled surrogate peptides specific to the target protein and analyzing the digested proteins in a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode to achieve a high specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility. The main objective in this work was to develop and validate an UHPLC-MS/MS method for quantification of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins Bcrp and P-gp and Na+/K\u2009+\u2009ATPase pump at the BBB. Three isoforms of the \u03b1-subunit from this pump (Atp1a 1, 2 and 3) were quantified to evaluate the presence of non-endothelial cells in the BBB using one common and three isoform-specific peptides; while Bcrp ad P-gp were quantified using 2 and 3 peptides, respectively, to improve the confidence on their quantification. The protein digestion was optimized, and the analytical method was comprehensively validated according to the American Food and Drug Administration Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance published in 2018. Linearity across four magnitude orders (0.125 to 510\u2009pmol\u00b7mL-1) sub-pmol\u00b7mL-1 LOD and LOQ, accuracy and precision (deviation < 15% and CV\u2009<\u200915%) were proven for most of the peptides by analyzing calibration curves and four levels of quality controls in both a pure solution and a complex matrix of digested yeast proteins, to mimic the matrix effect. In addition, digestion performance and stability of the peptides was shown using standard peptides spiked in a yeast digest or mouse kidney plasma membrane proteins as a study case. The validated method was used to characterize mouse kidney plasma membrane proteins, mouse brain cortical vessels and rat brain cortical microvessels. Most of the results agree with previously reported values, although some differences are seen due to different sample treatment, heterogeneity of the sample or peptide used. Importantly, the use of three peptides allowed the quantification of P-gp in mouse kidney plasma membrane proteins which was below the limit of quantification of the previously NTTGALTTR peptide.

Median OS was 22.1 (statins) versus 22.2 (control) months (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81-1.39, p\u2009=\u20090.69), 20.4 (ACEI) versus 22.6 (control) months (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.96-1.62, p\u2009=\u20090.10), and 21.7 (sartans) versus 22.3 (control) months (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.21, p\u2009=\u20090.38). None of the comparisons showed a signal for different PFS or OS when analyses were controlled for MGMT promoter methylation or treatment group (TMZ/RT\u00a0\u2192\u00a0TMZ vs. RT\u2009+\u2009CIL\u2009+\u2009TMZ\u00a0\u2192\u00a0TMZ\u2009+\u2009CIL). This secondary analysis of two large glioblastoma trials thus was unable to detect evidence for an association of the use of statins, ACEI or sartans with outcome in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

Thus, the unpredictability in transgenerational inheritance of mtDNA may cause the emergence of pathogenic mitochondrial and cellular phenotypes in offspring. Studies of the role of mitochondrial metabolism in cancer have a long and rich history, but recent evidence strongly suggests that changes in mitochondrial genotype and phenotype play a significant role in the initiation, progression and treatment of cancer.

Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs), a highly aggressive tumor subtype, have a particularly poor prognosis. Multiple reports demonstrate that altered content of the multicopy mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in primary breast tumors correlates with poor prognosis. We earlier reported that mtDNA copy number reduction in breast cancer cell lines induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated with metastasis. However, it is unknown whether the breast tumor subtypes (TNBC, Luminal and HER2+) differ in the nature and amount of mitochondrial defects and if mitochondrial defects can be used as a marker to identify tumors at risk for metastasis. By analyzing human primary tumors, cell lines and the TCGA dataset, we demonstrate a high degree of variability in mitochondrial defects among the tumor subtypes and TNBCs, in particular, exhibit higher frequency of mitochondrial defects, including reduced mtDNA content, mtDNA sequence imbalance (mtRNR1:ND4), impaired mitochondrial respiration and metabolic switch to glycolysis which is associated with tumorigenicity. We identified that genes involved in maintenance of mitochondrial structural and functional integrity are differentially expressed in TNBCs compared to non-TNBC tumors. Furthermore, we identified a subset of TNBC tumors that contain lower expression of epithelial splicing regulatory protein (ESRP)-1, typical of metastasizing cells.

To explore the relationship between these changes and cell mechanics, we then measured cellular mechanical properties using atomic force microscopy and found that cell stiffness correlated with gene expression data for known determinants of cell mechanics, \u03b3-actin, \u03b1-actinin and filamin A.

ANT1-deficient animals are insulin-hypersensitive, glucose-tolerant, and resistant to high fat diet (HFD)-induced toxicity. In ANT1-deficient skeletal muscle, mitochondrial gene expression is induced in association with the hyperproliferation of mitochondria. The ANT1-deficient muscle mitochondria produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are partially uncoupled. Hence, the muscle respiration under nonphosphorylating conditions is increased. Muscle transcriptome analysis revealed the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, down-regulation of diabetes-related genes, and increased expression of the genes encoding the myokines FGF21 and GDF15. However, FGF21 was not elevated in serum, and FGF21 and UCP1 mRNAs were not induced in liver or brown adipose tissue (BAT).

A possible cause of ASD is the genetic variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence, which has yet to be thoroughly investigated in large genomic studies of ASD. Here we evaluated mtDNA variation, including the mixture of different mtDNA molecules in the same individual (i.e., heteroplasmy), using whole-exome sequencing data from mother-proband-sibling trios from simplex families (n = 903) where only one child is affected by ASD. We found that heteroplasmic mutations in autistic probands were enriched at non-polymorphic mtDNA sites (P = 0.0015), which were more likely to confer deleterious effects than heteroplasmies at polymorphic mtDNA sites. Accordingly, we observed a ~1.5-fold enrichment of nonsynonymous mutations (P = 0.0028) as well as a ~2.2-fold enrichment of predicted pathogenic mutations (P = 0.0016) in autistic probands compared to their non-autistic siblings. Both nonsynonymous and predicted pathogenic mutations private to probands conferred increased risk of ASD (Odds Ratio, OR[95% CI] = 1.87[1.14-3.11] and 2.55[1.26-5.51], respectively), and their influence on ASD was most pronounced in families with probands showing diminished IQ and/or impaired social behavior compared to their non-autistic siblings. We also showed that the genetic transmission pattern of mtDNA heteroplasmies with high pathogenic potential differed between mother-autistic proband pairs and mother-sibling pairs, implicating developmental and possibly in utero contributions.

However, the subcellular determinants of this integrated, multisystemic stress response have not been defined. Central to stress adaptation is cellular energetics, involving mitochondrial energy production and oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesized that abnormal mitochondrial functions would differentially modulate the organism's multisystemic response to psychological stress. By mutating or deleting mitochondrial genes encoded in the mtDNA [NADH dehydrogenase 6 (ND6) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)] or nuclear DNA [adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)], we selectively impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain function, energy exchange, and mitochondrial redox balance in mice. The resulting impact on physiological reactivity and recovery from restraint stress were then characterized. We show that mitochondrial dysfunctions altered the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic adrenal-medullary activation and catecholamine levels, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, circulating metabolites, and hippocampal gene expression responses to stress. Each mitochondrial defect generated a distinct whole-body stress-response signature. These results demonstrate the role of mitochondrial energetics and redox balance as modulators of key pathophysiological perturbations previously linked to disease.

In Gram-negative bacteria, active e\ufb04ux is carried out by tripartite e\ufb04ux pumps that form a macromolecular assembly spanning both membranes of the cellular wall. At the outer membrane level, a well-conserved outer membrane factor (OMF) protein acts as an exit duct, but its sequence varies greatly among different species. The OMFs share a similar tri-dimensional structure that includes a beta-barrel pore domain that stabilizes the channel within the membrane. In addition, OMFs are often subjected to different N-terminal post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as an acylation with a lipid. The role of additional N-terminal anchors is all the more intriguing since it is not always required among the OMFs family. Understanding this optional PTM could open new research lines in the field of antibiotics resistance. In Escherichia coli, it has been shown that CusC is modified with a tri-acylated lipid, whereas TolC does not show any modification. In the case of OprM from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the N-terminal modification remains a matter of debate, therefore, we used several approaches to investigate this issue.

Based on an understanding of the human organism as a system of interconnected complex adaptive systems, we seek to examine the relationship between health, complexity, variability, and entropy production, as it might be useful to help understand aging, and improve care for patients. We observe the trajectory of life is characterized by the growth, plateauing and subsequent loss of adaptive function of organ systems, associated with loss of functioning and coordination of systems. Understanding development and aging requires the examination of interdependence among these organ systems. Increasing evidence suggests network interconnectedness and complexity can be captured/measured/associated with the degree and complexity of healthy biologic rhythm variability (e.g., heart and respiratory rate variability). We review physiological mechanisms linking the omics, arousal/stress systems, immune function, and mitochondrial bioenergetics; highlighting their interdependence in normal physiological function and aging. We argue that aging, known to be characterized by a loss of variability, is manifested at multiple scales, within functional units at the small scale, and reflected by diagnostic features at the larger scale. While still controversial and under investigation, it appears conceivable that the integrity of whole body complexity may be, at least partially, reflected in the degree and variability of intrinsic biologic rhythms, which we believe are related to overall system complexity that may be a defining feature of health and it's loss through aging.

Mitochondrial function, mitophagy and mitochondrial morphology are interconnected aspects of mitochondrial biology, and may coordinately be altered with aging. However, mitochondrial morphology has remained challenging to characterize in muscle, and whether sarcopenia is associated with abnormal mitochondrial morphology remains unknown. Therefore, we assessed the morphology of SubSarcolemmal (SS) and InterMyoFibrillar (IMF) mitochondria in skeletal muscle of young (8-12wk-old) and old (88-96wk-old) mice using a quantitative 2-dimensional transmission electron microscopy approach. We show that sarcopenia is associated with larger and less circular SS mitochondria. Likewise, aged IMF mitochondria were longer and more branched, suggesting increased fusion and/or decreased fission. Accordingly, although no difference in the content of proteins regulating mitochondrial dynamics (Mfn1, Mfn2, Opa1 and Drp1) was observed, a mitochondrial fusion index (Mfn2-to-Drp1 ratio) was significantly increased in aged muscles.

Notably, in response to metabolic perturbations, mitochondria fuse, divide, and interact with neighboring organelles to remodel their shape and functional properties-a process collectively known as mitochondrial dynamics. Using a quantitative electron microscopy approach, here we show that diaphragm contractile inactivity induced by 6 h of MV in mice leads to fragmentation of intermyofibrillar (IMF) but not subsarcolemmal (SS) mitochondria. Furthermore, physical interactions between adjacent organellar membranes were less abundant in IMF mitochondria during MV. The profusion proteins Mfn2 and OPA1 were unchanged, whereas abundance and activation status of the profission protein Drp1 were increased in the diaphragm following MV. Overall, our results suggest that mitochondrial morphological abnormalities characterized by excessive fission-fragmentation represent early events during MV, which could potentially contribute to the rapid onset of mitochondrial dysfunction, maladaptive signaling, and associated contractile dysfunction of the diaphragm.", "Keywords": ["electron microscopy", "intermyofibrillar mitochondria", "mitochondrial dynamics", "mitochondrial fragmentation", "subsarcolemmal mitochondria", "ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Diaphragm", "Dynamins", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondria, Muscle", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Muscle Contraction", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Atrophy", "Respiration, Artificial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Picard", "Affiliation": "Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;"}, {"First Name": "Ilan", "Last Name": "Azuelos", "Affiliation": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Critical Care and Respiratory Divisions, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada;"}, {"First Name": "Boris", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Department of Critical Care Medicine and Anesthesiology, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM U-1046), Montpellier University, Montpellier, France;"}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Giordano", "Affiliation": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada;"}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Matecki", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine and Anesthesiology, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM U-1046), Montpellier University, Montpellier, France;"}, {"First Name": "Sabah", "Last Name": "Hussain", "Affiliation": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Critical Care and Respiratory Divisions, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada;"}, {"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "EM Research Services, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom;"}, {"First Name": "Tong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada;"}, {"First Name": "Feng", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada;"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Benedetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada;"}, {"First Name": "Benoit J", "Last Name": "Gentil", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology/Neurosurgery and Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Burelle", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Basil J", "Last Name": "Petrof", "Affiliation": "Meakins-Christie Laboratories, McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Critical Care and Respiratory Divisions, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; basil.petrof@mcgill.ca."}], "Journal": "Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "PubDate": "2015May01"}, {"PMID": "25762461", "Title": "Two cilengitide regimens in combination with standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and unmethylated MGMT gene promoter: results of the open-label, controlled, randomized phase II CORE study.", "Abstract": "Survival outcomes for patients with glioblastoma remain poor, particularly for patients with unmethylated O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter.

However, physical structures that enhance or enable interactions between mitochondria have not been defined. Here we report that adjacent mitochondria exhibit coordination of inner mitochondrial membrane cristae at inter-mitochondrial junctions (IMJs). These electron-dense structures are conserved across species, resistant to genetic disruption of cristae organization, dynamically modulated by mitochondrial bioenergetics, independent of known inter-mitochondrial tethering proteins mitofusins and rapidly induced by the stable rapprochement of organelles via inducible synthetic linker technology. At the associated junctions, the cristae of adjacent mitochondria form parallel arrays perpendicular to the IMJ, consistent with a role in electrochemical coupling. These IMJs and associated cristae arrays may provide the structural basis to enhance the propagation of intracellular bioenergetic and apoptotic waves through mitochondrial networks within cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Diptera", "Electrons", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Heart", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Membranes", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Myocardium", "Pectinidae", "Tissue Distribution"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Picard", "Affiliation": "Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meagan J", "Last Name": "McManus", "Affiliation": "Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gy\u00f6rgy", "Last Name": "Csord\u00e1s", "Affiliation": "MitoCare Center, Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA."}, {"First Name": "P\u00e9ter", "Last Name": "V\u00e1rnai", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Semmelweis University, P.O.

It has become a major public concern, urging the need to discover new strategies to combat them. Among the different ways used by bacteria to resist antibiotics, the active efflux is one of the main mechanisms. In Gram-negative bacteria the efflux pumps are comprised of three components forming a long edifice crossing the complete cell wall from the inside to the outside of the cell.

To determine the basis of these abrupt phenotypic changes, we generated somatic cell cybrids harboring increasing levels of the 3243G mutant and analyzed the associated cellular phenotypes and nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mtDNA transcriptional profiles by RNA sequencing. Small increases in mutant mtDNAs caused relatively modest defects in oxidative capacity but resulted in sharp transitions in cellular phenotype and gene expression. Cybrids harboring 20-30% 3243G mtDNAs had reduced mtDNA mRNA levels, rounded mitochondria, and small cell size. Cybrids with 50-90% 3243G mtDNAs manifest induction of glycolytic genes, mitochondrial elongation, increased mtDNA mRNA levels, and alterations in expression of signal transduction, epigenomic regulatory, and neurodegenerative disease-associated genes. Finally, cybrids with 100% 3243G experienced reduced mtDNA transcripts, rounded mitochondria, and concomitant changes in nuclear gene expression. Thus, striking phase changes occurred in nDNA and mtDNA gene expression in response to the modest changes of the mtDNA 3243G mutant levels.

We present a methodology leading to the reconstitution of efflux pumps from the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a biomimetic environment that allows for an accurate investigation of their activity of transport. Three prerequisites are fulfilled: compartmentation in a lipidic environment, use of a relevant index for transport, and generation of a proton gradient. The membrane protein transporter is reconstituted into liposomes together with bacteriorhodopsin, a light-activated proton pump that generates a proton gradient that is robust as well as reversible and tunable. The activity of the protein is deduced from the pH variations occurring within the liposome, using pyranin, a pH-dependent fluorescent probe. We describe a step-by-step procedure where membrane protein purification, liposome formation, protein reconstitution, and transport analysis are addressed.

In view of the aging of our society, understanding the underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia is a major health-care imperative. Evidence obtained from human and rodent studies demonstrates that skeletal muscle denervation/reinnervation cycles occur with aging, and that progressive failure of myofiber reinnervation is a major cause of the accelerating phase of sarcopenia in advanced age. However, the mechanisms responsible for the loss of myofiber innervation with aging remain unknown. The two major strategies that counteract sarcopenia, that is, caloric restriction and endurance training, are well known to protect neuromuscular junction (NMJ) integrity, albeit through undefined mechanisms. Interestingly, both of these interventions better preserve PGC-1\u03b1 expression with aging, a transcriptional coactivator which has recently been shown to regulate key proteins involved in maintaining NMJ integrity. We therefore propose that the aging-related decline in PGC-1\u03b1 may be a central mechanism promoting instability of the NMJ and consequently, aging-related alterations of myofiber innervation in sarcopenia. Similarly, the promotion of PGC-1\u03b1 expression by both caloric restriction and exercise training may be fundamental to their protective benefits for aging muscle by better preserving NMJ integrity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gilles", "Last Name": "Gouspillou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Picard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Godin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Burelle", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Russell T", "Last Name": "Hepple", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care, McGill University Health Centre, 687 Pine Ave West, Montreal, QC H3A 1A1, Canada. russell.hepple@mcgill.ca."}], "Journal": "Longevity & healthspan", "PubDate": "2013Aug01"}, {"PMID": "24442484", "Title": "Cilengitide treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients does not alter patterns of progression.", "Abstract": "The integrin antagonist cilengitide has been explored as an adjunct with anti-angiogenic properties to standard of care temozolomide chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT \u2192 TMZ) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

Using a standardized approach, we analyzed patterns of progression on MRI in 21 patients enrolled onto a phase 2 trial of cilengitide added to TMZ/RT \u2192 TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Thirty patients from the experimental treatment arm of the EORTC/NCIC pivotal TMZ trial served as a reference. MRIcro software was used to map location and extent of initial preoperative and recurrent tumors on MRI of both groups into the same stereotaxic space which were then analyzed using an automated tool of image analysis. Clinical and outcome data of the cilengitide-treated patients were similar to those of the EORTC/NCIC trial except for a higher proportion of patients with a methylated O(6)-methylguanyl-DNA-methyltransferase gene promoter. Analysis of recurrence pattern revealed neither a difference in the size of the recurrent tumor nor in the distance of the recurrences from the preoperative tumor location between groups. Overall frequencies of distant recurrences were 20 % in the reference group and 19 % (4/21 patients) in the cilengitide group.

In cultured cells, metabolic perturbations similar to those incurred during exercise influence mitochondrial fusion and fission processes, but it is unknown whether exercise acutely alters mitochondrial morphology and/or membrane interactions in vivo. To study this question, we subjected mice to a 3-h voluntarily exercise intervention following their normal physical activity patterns, and quantified mitochondrial morphology and membrane interactions in the soleus using a quantitative electron microscopy approach. A single exercise bout effectively decreased blood glucose (P < 0.05) and intramyocellular lipid content (P < 0.01), indicating increased muscle metabolic demand. The number of mitochondria spanning Z-lines and proportion of electron-dense contact sites (EDCS) between adjacent mitochondrial membranes were increased immediately after exercise among both subsarcolemmal (+116%, P < 0.05) and intermyofibrillar mitochondria (+191%, P < 0.001), indicating increased physical interactions. Mitochondrial morphology, and abundance of the mitochondrial pro-fusion proteins Mfn2 and OPA1 were unchanged.

Here, using electron microscopy (EM), we provide evidence of interacting membranes from adjacent mitochondria in intact mouse skeletal muscle.
