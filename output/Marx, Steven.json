This cardiac response depends on \u03b2-adrenergic-initiated reversal of the small RGK G protein Rad-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) acting through the Cav\u03b2 subunit. Here, we investigate how Rad couples phosphorylation to augmented Ca2+ influx and increased cardiac contraction. We show that reversal required phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 within Rad's polybasic, hydrophobic C-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 in Rad's N-terminal domain (NTD) alone was ineffective. Phosphorylation of Ser272 and Ser300 or the addition of 4 Asp residues to the CTD reduced Rad's association with the negatively charged, cytoplasmic plasmalemmal surface and with CaV\u03b2, even in the absence of CaV\u03b1, measured here by FRET. Addition of a posttranslationally prenylated CAAX motif to Rad's C-terminus, which constitutively tethers Rad to the membrane, prevented the physiological and biochemical effects of both phosphorylation and Asp substitution. Thus, dissociation of Rad from the sarcolemma, and consequently from CaV\u03b2, is sufficient for sympathetic upregulation of Ca2+ currents.", "Keywords": ["Calcium channels", "Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Excitation contraction coupling"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adrenergic Agents", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arianne", "Last Name": "Papa", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Pedro J", "Last Name": "Del Rivero Morfin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Sergey I", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Guoxia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Bohnen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Vivian", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Moshe", "Last Name": "Katz", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Suraj", "Last Name": "Subramaniam", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Joel A", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Weiss", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Nathan", "Last Name": "Dascal", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Karlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2024Jan16"}, {"PMID": "37790372", "Title": "A Genetically Encoded Actuator Selectively Boosts L-type Calcium Channels in Diverse Physiological Settings.", "Abstract": "L-type Ca 2+ channels (Ca V 1.2/1.3) convey influx of calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) that orchestrate a bevy of biological responses including muscle contraction and gene transcription. Deficits in Ca V 1 function play a vital role in cardiac and neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet conventional pharmacological approaches to upregulate Ca V 1 are limited, as excessive Ca 2+ influx leads to cytotoxicity. Here, we develop a genetically encoded enhancer of Ca V 1.2/1.3 channels (GeeC) to manipulate Ca 2+ entry in distinct physiological settings. Specifically, we functionalized a nanobody that targets the Ca V macromolecular complex by attaching a minimal effector domain from a Ca V enhancer-leucine rich repeat containing protein 10 (Lrrc10). In cardiomyocytes, GeeC evoked a 3-fold increase in L-type current amplitude. In neurons, GeeC augmented excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling. In all, GeeC represents a powerful strategy to boost Ca V 1.2/1.3 function in distinct physiological settings and, in so doing, lays the groundwork to illuminate new insights on neuronal and cardiac physiology and disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pedro J", "Last Name": "Del Rivero Morfin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Diego Scala", "Last Name": "Chavez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Srinidhi", "Last Name": "Jayaraman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Audrey L", "Last Name": "Kochiss", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "X Shawn", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anjali M", "Last Name": "Rajadhyaksha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Sep23"}, {"PMID": "37329414", "Title": "Real-World Effectiveness of 8-Week Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Treatment-Na\u00efve, Compensated Cirrhotic HCV Patients.", "Abstract": "The EXPEDITION-8 clinical trial has demonstrated that treatment-na\u00efve patients with compensated cirrhosis (TN/CC) of HCV genotypes 1-6 can achieve a 98% intent-to-treat sustained virologic response rate 12\u00a0weeks post-treatment with an 8-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) regimen.

Genome-wide mapping of myocardial DNA methylation in 36 patients with HF at LVAD implantation, 8 patients at LVAD explantation, and 7 nonfailing (NF) donors using a high-density bead array platform identified 2,079 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and 261 DMPs in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). LVAD support resulted in normalization of 3.2% of HF-associated DMPs. Methylation-expression correlation analysis yielded several protein-coding genes that are hypomethylated and upregulated (HTRA1, FBXO16, EFCAB13, and AKAP13) or hypermethylated and downregulated (TBX3) in HF. A potentially novel cardiac-specific super-enhancer long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) (LINC00881) is hypermethylated and downregulated in human HF. LINC00881 is an upstream regulator of sarcomere and calcium channel gene expression including MYH6, CACNA1C, and RYR2. LINC00881 knockdown reduces peak calcium amplitude in the beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These data suggest that HF-associated changes in myocardial DNA methylation within coding and noncoding genomes are minimally reversible with mechanical unloading.

In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Disruption of NaV1.5 inactivation results in a small persistent Na influx known as late Na current (I Na,L), which has emerged as a common pathogenic mechanism in both congenital and acquired cardiac arrhythmogenic syndromes. Here, using low-noise multi-channel recordings in heterologous systems, LQTS3 patient-derived iPSCs cardiomyocytes, and mouse ventricular myocytes, we demonstrate that the intracellular fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHF1-4) tune pathogenic I Na,L in an isoform-specific manner. This scheme suggests a complex orchestration of I Na,L in cardiomyocytes that may contribute to variable disease expressivity of NaV1.5 channelopathies. We further leverage these observations to engineer a peptide-inhibitor of I Na,L with a higher efficacy as compared to a well-established small-molecule inhibitor.

We confirmed the association between increased CaV1.2 expression and CAVD in surgically removed aortic valves from patients. We extended our studies with a transgenic mouse model that mimics increased CaV1.2 expression within aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs). In young mice maintained on normal chow, we observed dystrophic valve lesions that mimic changes found in presymptomatic CAVD and showed activation of chondrogenic and osteogenic transcriptional regulators within these valve lesions. Chronic administration of verapamil, a CaV1.2 antagonist used clinically, slowed the progression of lesion development in vivo. Exploiting VIC cultures, we demonstrated that increased Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 drives signaling programs that lead to myofibroblast activation of VICs and upregulation of genes associated with aortic valve calcification.

Agonists of the sympathetic nervous system bind to adrenergic receptors in cardiomyocytes, which, via cascading signal transduction pathways and protein kinase A (PKA), increase the heart rate (chronotropy), the strength of myocardial contraction (inotropy), and the rate of myocardial relaxation (lusitropy). These effects correlate with increased intracellular concentration of calcium, which is required for the augmentation of cardiomyocyte contraction. Despite extensive investigations, the molecular mechanisms underlying sympathetic nervous system regulation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes have remained elusive over the last 40 years. Recent studies have uncovered the mechanisms underlying this fundamental biologic process, namely that PKA phosphorylates a calcium channel inhibitor, Rad, thereby releasing inhibition and increasing calcium influx. Here, we describe an updated model for how signals from adrenergic agonists are transduced to stimulate calcium influx and contractility in the heart.", "Keywords": ["calcium channel", "excitation-contraction coupling", "heart", "phosphorylation", "sympathetic nervous system"], "MeSH terms": ["Adrenergic Agents", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Humans", "Myocardial Contraction", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arianne", "Last Name": "Papa", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; email: sm460@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; email: sm460@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Annual review of physiology", "PubDate": "2022Feb10"}, {"PMID": "34710060", "Title": "Attenuating persistent sodium current-induced atrial myopathy and fibrillation by preventing mitochondrial oxidative stress.", "Abstract": "Mechanistically driven therapies for atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, are urgently needed, the development of which requires improved understanding of the cellular signaling pathways that facilitate the structural and electrophysiological remodeling that occurs in the atria. Similar to humans, increased persistent Na+ current leads to the development of an atrial myopathy and spontaneous and long-lasting episodes of AF in mice. How increased persistent Na+ current causes both structural and electrophysiological remodeling in the atria is unknown. We crossbred mice expressing human F1759A-NaV1.5 channels with mice expressing human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT). Increased expression of mCAT attenuated mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the structural remodeling that was induced by persistent F1759A-Na+ current. Despite the heterogeneously prolonged atrial action potential, which was unaffected by the reduction in ROS, the incidences of spontaneous AF, pacing-induced after-depolarizations, and AF were substantially reduced. Expression of mCAT markedly reduced persistent Na+ current-induced ryanodine receptor oxidation and dysfunction. In summary, increased persistent Na+ current in atrial cardiomyocytes, which is observed in patients with AF, induced atrial enlargement, fibrosis, mitochondrial dysmorphology, early after-depolarizations, and AF, all of which can be attenuated by resolving mitochondrial oxidative stress.", "Keywords": ["Arrhythmias", "Cardiology", "Cardiovascular disease", "Sodium channels"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Cardiomegaly", "Cardiomyopathies", "Catalase", "Crosses, Genetic", "Female", "Heart Atria", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mitochondria, Heart", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Uma Mahesh R", "Last Name": "Avula", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Haikel", "Last Name": "Dridi", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Steven R", "Last Name": "Reiken", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amar D", "Last Name": "Desai", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Parsons", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Haajra", "Last Name": "Baksh", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Elaine", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Parmanand", "Last Name": "Dasrat", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Ruiping", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Yejun", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sison", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "W Jonathan", "Last Name": "Lederer", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Humberto C", "Last Name": "Joca", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Christopher W", "Last Name": "Ward", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Maura", "Last Name": "Greiser", "Affiliation": "Center for Biomedical Engineering and Technology and Department of Physiology and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics and Clyde & Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2021Oct28"}, {"PMID": "34704194", "Title": "Epidemiology and Clinical Characteristics of Individuals with Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States, 2017-2019.", "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common bloodborne chronic infection in the US.

Here, we identify the role of calmodulin and the NaV1.5 interactome in regulating late Na+ current in cardiomyocytes. We created transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of human NaV1.5 channels with alanine substitutions for the IQ motif (IQ/AA). The mutations rendered the channels incapable of binding calmodulin to the C-terminus. The IQ/AA transgenic mice exhibited normal ventricular repolarization without arrhythmias and an absence of increased late Na+ current. In comparison, transgenic mice expressing a lidocaine-resistant (F1759A) human NaV1.5 demonstrated increased late Na+ current and prolonged repolarization in cardiomyocytes, with spontaneous arrhythmias. To determine regulatory factors that prevent late Na+ current for the IQ/AA mutant channel, we considered fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), which are within the NaV1.5 proteomic subdomain shown by proximity labeling in transgenic mice expressing NaV1.5 conjugated to ascorbate peroxidase. We found that FGF13 diminished late current of the IQ/AA but not F1759A mutant cardiomyocytes, suggesting that endogenous FHFs may serve to prevent late Na+ current in mouse cardiomyocytes. Leveraging endogenous mechanisms may furnish an alternative avenue for developing novel pharmacology that selectively blunts late Na+ current.", "Keywords": ["Arrhythmias", "Calmodulin", "Cardiology", "Sodium channels"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Calcium Signaling", "Calmodulin", "Female", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Protein Binding", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Roybal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, and."}, {"First Name": "Nourdine", "Last Name": "Chakouri", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Weinberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Sergey I", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jessica A", "Last Name": "Hennessey", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Uma Mahesh R", "Last Name": "Avula", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Johanna", "Last Name": "Diaz", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chaojian", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2020Oct02"}, {"PMID": "32754824", "Title": "Real-World Clinical Practice Use of 8-Week Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir in Treatment-Na\u00efve Patients with Compensated Cirrhosis.", "Abstract": "More than 70 million people are estimated to be infected with hepatitis\u00a0C virus globally.

However, this augmentation persists in transgenic murine hearts expressing mutant CaV1.2 \u03b11C and \u03b2 subunits that can no longer be phosphorylated by protein kinase A-an essential downstream mediator of \u03b2-adrenergic signalling-suggesting that non-channel factors are also required. Here we identify the mechanism by which \u03b2-adrenergic agonists stimulate voltage-gated calcium channels. We express \u03b11C or \u03b22B subunits conjugated to ascorbate peroxidase5 in mouse hearts, and use multiplexed quantitative proteomics6,7 to track hundreds of proteins in the proximity of CaV1.2. We observe that the calcium-channel inhibitor Rad8,9, a monomeric G protein, is enriched in the CaV1.2 microenvironment but is depleted during \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A of specific serine residues on Rad decreases its affinity for \u03b2 subunits and relieves constitutive inhibition of CaV1.2, observed as an increase in channel open probability. Expression of Rad or its homologue Rem in HEK293T cells also imparts stimulation of CaV1.3 and CaV2.2 by protein kinase A, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that confers adrenergic modulation upon voltage-gated calcium channels.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Cellular Microenvironment", "Cyclic AMP", "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Myocardium", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Domains", "Protein Subunits", "Proteomics", "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta", "Signal Transduction", "ras Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Guoxia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arianne", "Last Name": "Papa", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander N", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergey I", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Roybal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessica A", "Last Name": "Hennessey", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Kushnir", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katerina", "Last Name": "Dangas", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven P", "Last Name": "Gygi", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manu", "Last Name": "Ben-Johny", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marian", "Last Name": "Kalocsay", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

After opening, VGSCs rapidly enter a non-conducting, inactivated state. Impaired inactivation causes persistent inward current and underlies cardiac arrhythmias. VGSC auxiliary proteins calmodulin (CaM) and fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) bind to the channel's C-terminal domain (CTD) and limit pathogenic persistent currents. The structural details and mechanisms mediating these effects are not clear. Building on recently published cryo-EM structures, we show that CaM and FHF limit persistent currents in the cardiac NaV1.5 VGSC by stabilizing an interaction between the channel's CTD and III-IV linker region. Perturbation of this intramolecular interaction increases persistent current and shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. Interestingly, the NaV1.5 residues involved in the interaction are sites mutated in the arrhythmogenic long QT3 syndrome (LQT3). Along with electrophysiological investigations of this interaction, we present structural models that suggest how CaM and FHF stabilize the interaction and thereby limit the persistent current. The critical residues at the interaction site are conserved among VGSC isoforms, and subtle substitutions provide an explanation for differences in inactivation among the isoforms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Binding Sites", "Calcium", "Calmodulin", "Cell Line", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mutation", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Protein Binding", "Protein Isoforms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aravind R", "Last Name": "Gade", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "PubDate": "2020Feb03"}, {"PMID": "31556978", "Title": "Ticagrelor with or without Aspirin in High-Risk Patients after PCI.", "Abstract": "Monotherapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor after a minimum period of dual antiplatelet therapy is an emerging approach to reduce the risk of bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aspirin", "Coronary Disease", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Myocardial Infarction", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Ticagrelor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roxana", "Last Name": "Mehran", "Affiliation": "From the Zena and Michael A.

Recently, we created a mouse model with spontaneous and sustained AF caused by a mutation in the NaV1.5 channel (F1759A) that enhances persistent Na+ current, thereby enabling the investigation of molecular mechanisms that cause AF and the identification of novel treatment strategies. The mice have regional heterogeneity of action potential duration of the atria similar to observations in patients with AF. In these mice, we found that the initiation and persistence of the rotational reentrant AF arrhythmias, known as spiral waves or rotors, were dependent upon action potential duration heterogeneity. The centers of the rotors were localized to regions of greatest heterogeneity of the action potential duration. Pharmacologically attenuating the action potential duration heterogeneity reduced both spontaneous and pacing-induced AF. Computer-based simulations also demonstrated that the action potential duration heterogeneity is sufficient to generate rotors that manifest as AF. Taken together, these findings suggest that action potential duration heterogeneity in mice and humans is one mechanism by which AF is initiated and that reducing action potential duration heterogeneity can lessen the burden of AF.", "Keywords": ["Arrhythmias", "Cardiology", "Cell Biology", "Ion channels", "Mouse models"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Animals", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Computer Simulation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electrophysiology", "Female", "Heart Atria", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Uma Mahesh R", "Last Name": "Avula", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergey", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergey", "Last Name": "Mironov", "Affiliation": "Center for Arrhythmia Research, Division of Cardiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Bayne", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Roybal", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anirudh", "Last Name": "Gorti", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivek", "Last Name": "Iyer", "Affiliation": "Marin General Hospital, Greenbrae, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Waase", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deepak", "Last Name": "Saluja", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward J", "Last Name": "Ciaccio", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hasan", "Last Name": "Garan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew R", "Last Name": "Marks", "Affiliation": "The Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elaine Y", "Last Name": "Wan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2019Apr25"}, {"PMID": "30943764", "Title": "Secretoneurin to the Rescue?: Maybe or Maybe Not.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["Editorials", "biomarkers", "calcium", "coronary artery disease", "diagnosis", "heart failure"], "MeSH terms": ["Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Calcium", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Humans", "Neuropeptides", "Secretogranin II"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Morrow", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (J.P.M., S.O.M.), Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (J.P.M., S.O.M.), Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Circulation.

Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of mutant \u03b11C subunits lacking capacity to bind CaV\u03b2 can traffic to the sarcolemma in adult cardiomyocytes in vivo and sustain normal excitation-contraction coupling. However, these \u03b2-less Ca2+ channels cannot be stimulated by \u03b2-adrenergic pathway agonists, and thus adrenergic augmentation of contractility is markedly impaired in isolated cardiomyocytes and in hearts. Similarly, viral-mediated expression of a \u03b2-subunit-sequestering peptide sharply curtailed \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation of WT Ca2+ channels, identifying an approach to specifically modulate \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of cardiac contractility. Our data demonstrate that \u03b2 subunits are required for \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of CaV1.2 channels and positive inotropy in the heart, but are dispensable for CaV1.2 trafficking to the adult cardiomyocyte cell surface, and for basal function and excitation-contraction coupling.", "Keywords": ["Calcium", "Calcium channels", "Cardiology", "Excitation contraction coupling", "Muscle Biology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Guinea Pigs", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Protein Transport", "Sarcolemma"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Katchman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Jared", "Last Name": "Kushner", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Kushnir", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Sergey I", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Bi-Xing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Zunaira", "Last Name": "Shuja", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, and."}, {"First Name": "Prakash", "Last Name": "Subramanyam", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, and."}, {"First Name": "Guoxia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Arianne", "Last Name": "Papa", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, and."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Roybal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey S", "Last Name": "Pitt", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Henry M", "Last Name": "Colecraft", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, and."}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2019Feb01"}, {"PMID": "30280640", "Title": "Transcatheter Mitral-Valve Repair in Patients with Heart Failure.", "Abstract": "Among patients with heart failure who have mitral regurgitation due to left ventricular dysfunction, the prognosis is poor.

However, recent results using knock-in mice indicate that several long-standing \"facts\" about CaV1.2 regulation derived from heterologous expression studies are not replicated in native heart, emphasizing the critical need for mechanistic studies in the context of actual cardiomyocytes. In this review, we discuss the use of the use of knockin and knockout mice as well as new tools, including doxycycline-induced expression of informative \u03b11C mutants within cardiomyocytes to probe adrenergic regulation of CaV1.2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium Channels", "Humans", "Ion Channel Gating", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myocardium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Morrow", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine; College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA. sm460@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Current molecular pharmacology", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "25667410", "Title": "Positions of the cytoplasmic end of BK \u03b1 S0 helix relative to S1-S6 and of \u03b21 TM1 and TM2 relative to S0-S6.", "Abstract": "The large-conductance, voltage- and Ca(2+)-gated K(+) (BK) channel consists of four \u03b1 subunits, which form a voltage- and Ca(2+)-gated channel, and up to four modulatory \u03b2 subunits. The \u03b21 subunit is expressed in smooth muscle, where it slows BK channel kinetics and shifts the conductance-voltage (G-V) curve to the left at [Ca(2+)] > 2 \u00b5M. In addition to the six transmembrane (TM) helices, S1-S6, conserved in all voltage-dependent K(+) channels, BK \u03b1 has a unique seventh TM helix, S0, which may contribute to the unusual rightward shift in the G-V curve of BK \u03b1 in the absence of \u03b21 and to a leftward shift in its presence. Such a role is supported by the close proximity of S0 to S3 and S4 in the voltage-sensing domain. Furthermore, on the extracellular side of the membrane, one of the two TM helices of \u03b21, TM2, is adjacent to S0. We have now analyzed induced disulfide bond formation between substituted Cys residues on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. There, in contrast, S0 is closest to the S2-S3 loop, from which position it is displaced on the addition of \u03b21. The cytoplasmic ends of \u03b21 TM1 and TM2 are adjacent and are located between the S2-S3 loop of one \u03b1 subunit and S1 of a neighboring \u03b1 subunit and are not adjacent to S0; i.e., S0 and TM2 have different trajectories through the membrane. In the absence of \u03b21, 70% of disulfide bonding of W43C (S0) and L175C (S2-S3) has no effect on V50 for activation, implying that the cytoplasmic end of S0 and the S2-S3 loop move in concert, if at all, during activation.

The association of CaV1.2 with a supramolecular complex impacts trafficking, localization, turnover, and, most importantly, multifaceted regulation of its function in the heart. Several studies hint at an important role for the C terminus of the \u03b11C subunit as a hub for multidimensional regulation of CaV1.2 channel trafficking and function. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for the four-residue PDZ binding motif at the C terminus of \u03b11C in interacting with scaffold proteins containing PDZ domains, in the subcellular localization of CaV1.2 in neurons, and in the efficient signaling to cAMP-response element-binding protein in neurons. However, the role of the \u03b11C PDZ ligand domain in the heart is not known. To determine whether the \u03b11C PDZ motif is critical for CaV1.2 trafficking and function in cardiomyocytes, we generated transgenic mice with inducible expression of an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged dihydropyridine-resistant \u03b11C with the PDZ motif deleted (\u0394PDZ). These mice were crossed with \u03b1-myosin heavy chain reverse transcriptional transactivator transgenic mice, and the double-transgenic mice were fed doxycycline.

The \u0394PDZ Ca(2+) channels were appropriately regulated by isoproterenol and forskolin.

Based on endogenous disulfide formation between engineered cysteines (Cys), we found that in \u03b22 and \u03b23, as in \u03b21 and \u03b24, TM1 is closest to \u03b1S1 and \u03b1S2 and TM2 is closest to \u03b1S0. Mouse \u03b23 (m\u03b23) has seven Cys in its loop, one of which is free, and this Cys readily forms disulfides with Cys substituted in the extracellular flanks of each of \u03b1S0-\u03b1S6. We identified by elimination m\u03b23-loop Cys152 as the only free Cys. We inferred the disulfide-bonding pattern of the other six Cys. Using directed proteolysis and fragment sizing, we determined this pattern first among the four loop Cys in \u03b21. These are conserved in \u03b22-\u03b24, which have four additional Cys (eight in total), except that m\u03b23 has one fewer. In \u03b21, disulfides form between Cys at aligned positions 1 and 8 and between Cys at aligned positions 5 and 6. In m\u03b23, the free Cys is at position 7; position 2 lacks a Cys present in all other \u03b22-\u03b24; and the disulfide pattern is 1-8, 3-4, and 5-6. Presumably, Cys 2 cross-links to Cys 7 in all other \u03b22-\u03b24. Cross-linking of m\u03b23 Cys152 to Cys substituted in the flanks of \u03b1S0-S5 attenuated the protection against iberiotoxin (IbTX); cross-linking of Cys152 to K296C in the \u03b1S6 flank and close to the pore enhanced protection against IbTX. In no case was N-type inactivation by the N-terminal tail of m\u03b23 perturbed. Although the m\u03b23 loop can move, its position with Cys152 near \u03b1K296, in which it blocks IbTX binding, is likely favored.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Cysteine", "Disulfides", "Electrophysiology", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel beta Subunits", "Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels", "Mice", "Models, Animal", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Peptides", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Protein Subunits"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roland S", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guoxia", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sergey I", "Last Name": "Zakharov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neelesh", "Last Name": "Chudasama", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Howard", "Last Name": "Motoike", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Karlin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven O", "Last Name": "Marx", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of general physiology", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}]
