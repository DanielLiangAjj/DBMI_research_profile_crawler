We demonstrated a correlation between removing PD-1 from the synapse by anti-PD-1 antibodies and the extent of T cell activation. Interestingly, a short version of the anti-PD-1 antibody, F(ab') 2 , failed to remove PD-1 from the synapse and activate T cells.

Immunotherapy techniques bolster the immune cells' ability to target malignant cancer cells and have brought immense improvements in the field of cancer treatments. One important inhibitory protein in T cells, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), has become an invaluable target for cancer immunotherapy. While anti-PD-1 antibody therapy is extremely successful in some patients, in others it fails or even causes further complications, including cancer hyper-progression and immune-related adverse events. Along with countless translational studies of the PD-1 signaling pathway, there are currently close to 5,000 clinical trials for antibodies against PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, around 80% of which investigate combinations with other therapies. Nevertheless, more work is needed to better understand the PD-1 signaling pathway and to facilitate new and improved evidence-based combination strategies. In this work, we consolidate recent discoveries of PD-1 signaling mediators and their therapeutic potential in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents. We focus on the phosphatases SHP2 and PTPN2; the kinases ITK, VRK2, GSK-3, and CDK4/6; and the signaling adaptor protein PAG. We discuss their biology both in cancer cells and T cells, with a focus on their role in relation to PD-1 to determine their potential in therapeutic combinations. The literature discussed here was obtained from a search of the published literature and ClinicalTrials.gov with the following key terms: checkpoint inhibition, cancer immunotherapy, PD-1, PD-L1, SHP2, PTPN2, ITK, VRK2, CDK4/6, GSK-3, and PAG.

These antibodies, both alone and in combination, provide great clinical efficacy as evidenced by tumor regression and increased overall patients' survival. However, with this success comes multiple challenges. First, while patients who respond to ICIs have outstanding outcomes, there remains a large proportion of patients who do not respond at all. This all-or-none response has led to looking downstream of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) for additional therapeutic targets and for new combination therapies. Second, a majority of patients who receive ICIs go on to develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs) characterized by end-organ inflammation with T-cell infiltrates. The hallmarks of these clinically observed irAEs share many similarities with primary autoimmune diseases.

Nevertheless, many patients do not respond, and additional approaches, specifically blocking other inhibitory receptors on T cells, are being explored. Importantly, the source of the ligands for these receptors are often the tumor cells. Indeed, cancer cells express high levels of PD-L1 upon stimulation with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), a major cytokine in the tumor microenvironment. The increase in PD-L1 expression serves as a negative feedback towards the immune system, and allows the tumor to evade the attack of immune cells. A potential novel immunoregulator is mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that is secreted from pancreatic beta cells upon cytokines activation, and can induce an alternatively activated macrophage phenotype (M2), and thus may support tumor growth. While MANF was shown to be secreted from pancreatic beta cells, its IFN-\u03b3-induced secretion from tumor cells has never been assessed. Here we found that IFN-\u03b3 induced MANF secretion from diverse tumor cell-lines-melanoma cells, colon carcinoma cells and hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, there was no increase in MANF RNA or intracellular protein levels upon IFN-\u03b3 stimulation. However, IFN-\u03b3 induced ER calcium depletion, which was necessary for MANF secretion, as Dantrolene, an inhibitor of ER calcium release, prevented its secretion.

The protocols in this article were refined to test the consequences of PD-1 ligation on short-term T cell signaling, long-term T cell function, and the structural consequences of PD-1 ligation with PD-1 ligands. Basic Protocol 1 addresses the need for a robust and reproducible short-term assay to examine the signaling cascade triggered by PD-1. We describe a phospho flow cytometry method to determine how PD-1 ligation alters the level of CD3\u03b6 phosphorylation on Tyr142 , which can be easily applied to other proximal signaling proteins. Basic Protocol 2 describes a plate-bound assay that is useful to examine the long-term consequences of PD-1 ligation such as cytokine production and T cell proliferation. Complementary to that, Basic Protocol 3 describes an in vitro superantigen-based assay to evaluate T cell responses to therapeutic agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L axis, as well as immune synapse formation in the presence of PD-1 engagement. Finally, in Basic Protocol 4 we outline a tetramer-based method useful to interrogate the quality of PD-1/PD-L interactions. These protocols can be easily adapted for mouse studies and other inhibitory receptors.

As such, it has been successfully exploited for cancer immunotherapy. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 are ligands for PD-1; the former is ubiquitously expressed in inflamed tissues, whereas the latter is restricted to antigen-presenting cells. PD-L2 binds to PD-1 with 3-fold stronger affinity compared with PD-L1. To date, this affinity discrepancy has been attributed to a tryptophan (W110PD-L2) that is unique to PD-L2 and has been assumed to fit snuggly into a pocket on the PD-1 surface. Contrary to this model, using surface plasmon resonance to monitor real-time binding of recombinantly-expressed and -purified proteins, we found that W110PD-L2 acts as an \"elbow\" that helps shorten PD-L2 engagement with PD-1 and therefore lower affinity. Furthermore, we identified a \"latch\" between the C and D \u03b2-strands of the binding face as the source of the PD-L2 affinity advantage. We show that the 3-fold affinity advantage of PD-L2 is the consequence of these two opposing features, the W110PD-L2 \"elbow\" and a C-D region \"latch.\" Interestingly, using phylogenetic analysis, we found that these features evolved simultaneously upon the emergence of placental mammals, suggesting that PD-L2-affinity tuning was part of the alterations to the adaptive immune system required for placental gestation.", "Keywords": ["PD-L2", "T-cell biology", "glycoprotein structure", "immune checkpoint", "immune receptors/ligands", "immunotherapy", "programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)", "programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)", "protein evolution", "protein structure"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "B7-H1 Antigen", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Proliferation", "Female", "Humans", "Ligands", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Phylogeny", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Sequence Alignment", "Static Electricity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elliot A", "Last Name": "Philips", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Garcia-Espa\u00f1a", "Affiliation": "Research Unit, Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Sanit\u00e0ria Pere Virgili, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, 43005 Tarragona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Anna S", "Last Name": "Tocheva", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ian M", "Last Name": "Ahearn", "Affiliation": "Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016."}, {"First Name": "Kieran R", "Last Name": "Adam", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ruimin", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Mor", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032 am5121@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Xiang-Peng", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016 xiangpeng.kong@nyulangone.org."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2020Apr03"}, {"PMID": "33665153", "Title": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors and the shared epitope theory: from hypothesis to practice.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shalom", "Last Name": "Lerrer", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Mor", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Translational cancer research", "PubDate": "2019Dec"}, {"PMID": "31199820", "Title": "SLAMF6 clustering is required to augment T cell activation.", "Abstract": "The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family is comprised of nine distinct receptors that are expressed exclusively on hematopoietic cells.

However, little is known about the role of SLAMF6 in the adaptive immune responses and in order to utilize SLAMF6 interventional approaches, a better understanding of the biology of this receptor in T cell is warranted. Accordingly, the objective of our study was to investigate both functionally and structurally the role of SLAMF6 in T cell receptor (TCR) mediated responses. Biochemical and genetic experiments revealed that SLAMF6 was required for productive TCR downstream signaling. Interestingly, SLAMF6 ectodomain was required for its function, but not for its recruitment to the immunological synapse. Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that tyrosine 308 of the tail of SLAMF6 was crucial for its ability to enhance T cell function. Imaging studies revealed that SLAMF6 clustering, specifically with the TCR, resulted in dramatic increase in downstream signaling. Mechanistically, we showed that SLAMF6 enhanced T cell function by increasing T cell adhesiveness through activation of the small GTPase Rap1.

Antibodies targeting PD-1 elicit durable clinical responses in patients with multiple tumor indications. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to anti-PD-1 treatment, and a better understanding of the signaling pathways downstream of PD-1 could provide biomarkers for those whose tumors respond and new therapeutic approaches for those whose tumors do not. We used affinity purification mass spectrometry to uncover multiple proteins associated with PD-1. Among these proteins, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) was functionally and mechanistically analyzed for its contribution to PD-1 inhibitory responses. Silencing of SAP augmented and overexpression blocked PD-1 function. T cells from patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), who lack functional SAP, were hyperresponsive to PD-1 signaling, confirming its inhibitory role downstream of PD-1. Strikingly, signaling downstream of PD-1 in purified T cell subsets did not correlate with PD-1 surface expression but was inversely correlated with intracellular SAP levels. Mechanistically, SAP opposed PD-1 function by acting as a molecular shield of key tyrosine residues that are targets for the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, which mediates PD-1 inhibitory properties.

The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1-mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells.

These two contexts of T cell adhesion differ in that T cell-APC interactions can be considered static, while T cell-blood vessel interactions are challenged by the shear stress generated by circulation itself. T cell-APC interactions are classified as static in that the two cellular partners are static relative to each other. Usually, this interaction occurs within the lymph nodes. As a T cell interacts with the blood vessel wall, the cells arrest and must resist the generated shear stress.(1,2) These differences highlight the need to better understand static adhesion and adhesion under flow conditions as two distinct regulatory processes. The regulation of T cell adhesion can be most succinctly described as controlling the affinity state of integrin molecules expressed on the cell surface, and thereby regulating the interaction of integrins with the adhesion molecule ligands expressed on the surface of the interacting cell. Our current understanding of the regulation of integrin affinity states comes from often simplistic in vitro model systems. The assay of adhesion using flow conditions described here allows for the visualization and accurate quantification of T cell-epithelial cell interactions in real time following a stimulus. An adhesion under flow assay can be applied to studies of adhesion signaling within T cells following treatment with inhibitory or stimulatory substances.

CAPRI trafficking to the plasma membrane was secondary to calcium influx and was mediated by its C2A and C2B domains.

Ras and Rap proteins are regulated by several shared processes such as post-translational modification, phosphorylation, activation by guanine exchange factors and inhibition by GTPase-activating proteins. Sub-cellular localization and trafficking of these proteins to and from the plasma membrane are additional important regulatory features that impact small GTPases function. Despite its importance, the trafficking mechanisms of Ras and Rap proteins are not completely understood. Chaperone proteins play a critical role in trafficking of GTPases and will be the focus of the discussion in this work. We will review several aspects of chaperone biology focusing on specificity toward particular members of the small GTPase family.

One of the most successful approaches to the treatment of autoimmunity is through targeting of lymphocytes, whose multiple targetable functions include proliferation, cytokine secretion, and migration. The adhesion process is a critical step, not only for migration but also for their communication with antigen-presenting cells, and is therefore a clear target for therapy. This manuscript will discuss the migration of T cells, which are at the heart of many autoimmune responses. We will review the importance of increasing our comprehension of these events, focusing on migration since they enclose a multitude of potential therapeutic targets for autoimmunity. The interface between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells and the formation of the immunological synapse will be reported in detail. We will address the following questions: What enables T cells to migrate to sites of injury, and what are the options to intervene? What is the contribution of co-receptors to T cell adhesion? How can we manipulate this knowledge for therapeutic purposes?

T cells accomplish regulated adhesion by controlling the adhesive properties of integrins, a class of cell adhesion molecules consisting of heterodimeric pairs of transmembrane proteins that interact with target molecules on partner cells or extracellular matrix. The most prominent T cell integrin is lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA)-1, composed of subunits \u03b1L and \u03b22, whose target is the intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. The ability of a T cell to control adhesion derives from the ability to regulate the affinity states of individual integrins. Inside-out signaling describes the process whereby signals inside a cell cause the external domains of integrins to assume an activated state. Much of our knowledge of these complex phenomena is based on mechanistic studies performed in simplified in\u00a0vitro model systems. The T lymphocyte adhesion assay described here is an excellent tool that allows T cells to adhere to target molecules, under static conditions, and then utilizes a fluorescent plate reader to quantify adhesiveness. This assay has been useful in defining adhesion-stimulatory or inhibitory substances that act on lymphocytes, as well as characterizing the signaling events involved. Although described here for LFA-1 - ICAM-1 mediated adhesion; this assay can be readily adapted to allow for the study of other adhesive interactions (e.g.\u00a0VLA-4 - fibronectin).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cattle", "Cell Adhesion", "Humans", "Integrins", "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1", "Mice", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marianne", "Last Name": "Strazza", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Inbar", "Last Name": "Azoulay-Alfaguter", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Ariel", "Last Name": "Pedoeem", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Mor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine; Departments of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine; Adam.Mor@nyumc.org."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2014Jun13"}, {"PMID": "24780173", "Title": "Programmed death-1 pathway in cancer and autoimmunity.", "Abstract": "Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a co-receptor that is expressed predominantly by T cells. The binding of PD-1 to its ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, is vital for the physiologic regulation of the immune system. A major functional role of the PD-1 signaling pathway is the inhibition of self-reactive T cells, which serve to protect against autoimmune diseases. Elimination of the PD-1 pathway can therefore result in the breakdown of immune tolerance that can ultimately lead to the development of pathogenic autoimmunity. Conversely, tumor cells can at times co-opt the PD-1 pathway to escape from immunosurveillance mechanisms. Therefore, blockade of the PD-1 pathway has become an attractive target in cancer therapy. Recent clinical trials have shown that anti-PD-1 agents have profound effects on solid tumor regression. Current approaches include six agents that are either PD-1 and PD-L1 targeted neutralizing antibodies or fusion proteins. More than forty clinical trials are underway to better define the role of PD-1 blockade in variety of tumor types. In this review we will highlight the basic biology of the PD-1 system and discuss its potential roles in both autoimmunity and cancer.

The small GTPase Rap1 is the key coordinator mediating T-cell adhesion to endothelial cells, antigen-presenting cells, and virus-infected cells. We describe a signaling pathway, downstream of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) receptor, leading to Rap1-mediated adhesion. We identified a role for the Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G in the regulation of T-cell adhesion and showed that this factor is required for both T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated and CTLA-4-mediated T-cell adhesion. Our data indicated that C3G translocates to the plasma membrane downstream of TCR signaling, where it regulates activation of Rap1. We also showed that CTLA-4 receptor signaling mediates tyrosine phosphorylation in the C3G protein, and that this is required for augmented activation of Rap1 and increased adhesion mediated by leukocyte function-associated antigen type 1 (LFA-1). Zap70 is required for C3G translocation to the plasma membrane, whereas the Src family member Hck facilitates C3G phosphorylation.
