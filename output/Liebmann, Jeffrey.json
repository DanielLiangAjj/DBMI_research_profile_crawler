We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for POAG in 11,275 individuals of African ancestry (6,003 cases; 5,272 controls). We detected 46 risk loci associated with POAG at genome-wide significance. Replication and post-GWAS analyses, including functionally informed fine-mapping, multiple trait co-localization, and in silico validation, implicated two previously undescribed variants (rs1666698 mapping to DBF4P2; rs34957764 mapping to ROCK1P1) and one previously associated variant (rs11824032 mapping to ARHGEF12) as likely causal. For individuals of African ancestry, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for POAG from our mega-analysis (African ancestry individuals) outperformed a PRS from summary statistics of a much larger GWAS derived from European ancestry individuals.

This region, which is about 12\u00a0degrees (3.5\u00a0mm) in diameter, is essential for everyday functions such as driving, reading, and face recognition. Here, we describe a model of progression of glaucomatous damage to this GCL donut. This model is based upon assumptions supported by the literature, and it predicts the patterns of glaucomatous damage to the GCL donut, as seen with optical coherence tomography (OCT). After describing the assumptions and predictions of this model, we test the model against data from our laboratory, as well as from the literature. Finally, three uses of the model are illustrated. One, it provides an aid to help clinicians focus on the essential central macula and to alert them to look for other, non-glaucomatous causes, when the GCL damage does not fit the pattern predicted by the model. Second, the patterns of progression predicted by the model suggest alternative end points for clinical trials.

Objectives included evaluating eye gaze metrics and patterns as a function of ophthalmic education, deriving novel features from eye-tracking, and developing binary classification models for disease detection and expertise differentiation. Thirteen ophthalmology residents, fellows, and clinicians specializing in glaucoma participated in the study. Junior residents had less than 1\u2009year of experience, while senior residents had 2-3\u2009years of experience. The expert group consisted of fellows and faculty with over 3 to 30+ years of experience. Each participant was presented with a set of 20 Topcon OCT reports (10 healthy and 10 glaucomatous) and was asked to determine the presence or absence of glaucoma and rate their confidence of diagnosis. The eye movements of each participant were recorded as they diagnosed the reports using a Pupil Labs Core eye tracker. Expert ophthalmologists exhibited more refined and focused eye fixations, particularly on specific regions of the OCT reports, such as the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) probability map and circumpapillary RNFL b-scan. The binary classification models developed using the derived features demonstrated high accuracy up to 94.0% in differentiating between expert and novice clinicians. The derived features and trained binary classification models hold promise for improving the accuracy of glaucoma detection and distinguishing between expert and novice ophthalmologists.

Methods: A 5-year prospective, cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted. Eligible individuals aged 40 years and older were recruited from affordable housing developments and senior centers in New York City. Participants underwent on-site eye health screening (best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure [IOP] measurements, and fundus photography). Fundus images were graded via telemedicine by a retina specialist. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess the factors associated with abnormal retinal findings requiring referral to ophthalmology. Results: Participants with a retinal abnormality on fundus photography (n\u2009=\u2009157) were predominantly older adults, with a mean age of 68.4\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 years, female (63.7%), African American (50.3%), and Hispanic (43.3%). A total of 32 participants in our study passed the vision and IOP screening but had an abnormal retinal image and ocular pathology that would have been missed without fundus photography. Individuals who self-identified as having preexisting glaucoma (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20093.749, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.741-8.074, p\u2009=\u20090.0001) and had severe vision impairment (OR\u2009=\u20094.1034, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.0740-8.1186, p\u2009=\u20090.000) at the screening had significantly higher odds of having an abnormal retinal image. Conclusion: This community-based study targeted populations at-risk for eye disease, improved access to eye care, detected a significant number of retinal image abnormalities requiring follow-up by using telemedicine, and provided evidence of the importance of fundus photography during eye health screenings.

Fatigue and the end-of-day phenomenon can negatively impact task performance but have not been studied in the residency selection process. Our primary objective is to determine whether factors related to interview time and day as well as candidate's and interviewer's gender have a significant effect on residency interview scores. Methods \u2003Seven years of ophthalmology residency candidate evaluation scores from 2013 to 2019 were collected at a single academic institution, standardized by interviewer into relative percentiles (0-100 point grading scale), and grouped into the following categories for comparisons: different interview days (Day 1 vs. Day 2), morning versus afternoon (AM vs. PM), interview session (Day 1 AM/PM vs. Day 2 AM/PM), before and after breaks (morning break, lunch break, and afternoon break), residency candidate's gender, and interviewer's gender. Results \u2003Candidates in the morning sessions were found to have higher scores than afternoon sessions (52.75 vs. 49.28, p \u2009<\u20090.001). Interview scores in the early morning, late morning, and early afternoon were higher than late afternoon scores (54.47, 53.01, 52.15 vs. 46.74, p \u2009<\u20090.001). Across all interview years, there were no differences in scores received before and after morning breaks (51.71 vs. 52.83, p \u2009=\u20090.49), lunch breaks (53.01 vs. 52.15, p \u2009=\u20090.58), and afternoon breaks (50.35 vs. 48.30, p \u2009=\u20090.21). No differences were found in scores received by female versus male candidates (51.55 vs. 50.49, p \u2009=\u20090.21) or scores given by female versus male interviewers (51.31 vs. 50.84, p \u2009=\u20090.58).

Using an iterative, consensus-building approach and employing pilot data, an optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to aid in the detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy was sought to address this challenge. To maximize the chance of success, we utilized all available information from the OCT circle and cube scans, applied both quantitative and semiquantitative data analysis methods, and aimed to limit the use of perimetry to cases where it is absolutely necessary. The outcome of this approach was an OCT-based method for the diagnosis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy that did not require the use of perimetry for initial diagnosis.

Recent work suggests that the OCT probability (p-) maps, also known as deviation maps, can play a key role in an OCT-based method. However, artifacts seen on the p-maps of healthy control eyes can resemble patterns of damage due to glaucoma. We document in section 2 that these glaucoma-like artifacts are relatively common and are probably due to normal anatomical variations in healthy eyes. We also introduce a simple anatomical artifact model based upon known anatomical variations to help distinguish these artifacts from actual glaucomatous damage. In section 3, we apply this model to an OCT-based method for detecting glaucoma that starts with an examination of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) p-map. While this method requires a judgment by the clinician, sections 4 and 5 describe automated methods that do not. In section 4, the simple model helps explain the relatively poor performance of commonly employed summary statistics, including circumpapillary RNFL thickness.

The objective of our study was to test instruments, implement protocols, and collect preliminary data for a larger 5-year study, which aims to improve detection of eye diseases and follow-up eye care in vulnerable populations using community health workers (CHW) and patient navigators. In the study, trained CHWs conducted vision screening and patient navigators scheduled on-site eye exams and arranged appointments for those referred to ophthalmology to improve adherence to follow-up eye care.Materials and Methods: Eligible individuals age 40-and-older were\u00a0recruited from the Riverstone Senior Center in Upper Manhattan, New York City. Participants underwent on-site vision screening (visual acuity with correction, intraocular pressure measurements, and fundus photography). Individuals who failed the vision screening were scheduled with an on-site optometrist for an eye exam; those with ocular pathologies were referred to an ophthalmologist. Participants were also administered the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-8 (NEI-VFQ-8) and Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) test by community health workers.Results:Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a042) were predominantly older adults, with a mean age of 70.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8, female (61.9%), and Hispanic (78.6%). Most individuals (78.6%, n =\u00a033) failed vision screening. Of those who failed, 84.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a028) attended the on-site eye exam with the optometrist. Ocular diagnoses: refractive error 13/28 (46.4%), glaucoma/glaucoma suspect 9/28 (32.1%), cataract 7/28 (25.0%), retina abnormalities 6/28 (21.4%); 13 people required eyeglasses.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using CHWs and patient navigators for reducing barriers to vision screening and optometrist-based eye exams in vulnerable populations, ultimately improving early detection of eye disease and linking individuals to additional eye care appointments.

While the experimental research using animal models provides growing information about cellular and molecular processes, parallel analysis of the clinical presentation of glaucoma accelerates the translational progress towards improved understanding, treatment, and clinical testing of glaucoma. Optic nerve axon injury triggers early alterations of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) synapses with function deficits prior to manifest RGC loss in animal models of glaucoma. For testing the clinical relevance of experimental observations, this study analyzed the functional correlation of localized alterations in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where RGCs establish synaptic connections with retinal bipolar and amacrine cells. Participants of the study included a retrospective cohort of 36 eyes with glaucoma and a control group of 18 non-glaucomatous subjects followed for two-years. The IPL was analyzed on consecutively collected macular SD-OCT scans, and functional correlations with corresponding 10-2 visual field scores were tested using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models. The GEE-estimated rate of decrease in IPL thickness (R = 0.36, P<0.001) and IPL density (R = 0.36, P<0.001), as opposed to unchanged or increased IPL thickness or density, was significantly associated with visual field worsening at corresponding analysis locations. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, this association was independent from the patients' age, the baseline visual field scores, or the baseline thickness or alterations of retinal nerve fiber or RGC layers (P>0.05). These findings support early localized IPL alterations in correlation with progressing visual field defects in glaucomatous eyes. Considering the experimental data, glaucoma-related increase in IPL thickness/density might reflect dendritic remodeling, mitochondrial redistribution, and glial responses for synapse maintenance, but decreased IPL thickness/density might correspond to dendrite atrophy. The bridging of experimental data with clinical findings encourages further research along the translational path.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amacrine Cells",

It is also a challenge. The most sophisticated, and probably the most useful, commercially available clinical tool for identifying progression is the Guided Progression Analysis (GPA), which was initially developed to identify progression using 24-2 visual field tests. More recently, it has been extended to retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thicknesses measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, the OCT GPA requires a minimum of 3 tests to determine \"possible loss (progression)\" and a minimum of 4 tests to determine if the patient shows \"likely loss (progression).\" Thus, it is not designed to answer a fundamental question asked by both the clinician and the patient, namely: Did damage progress since the last visit? Some clinicians use changes in summary statistics, such as global/average circumpapillary RNFL thickness. However, these statistics have poor sensitivity and specificity due to segmentation and alignment errors. Instead of relying on the GPA analysis or summary statistics, one needs to evaluate RNFL and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer probability maps and circumpapillary OCT B-scan images. In addition, we argue that the clinician can make a better decision about suspected progression between 2 test days by topographically comparing the changes in the different OCT maps and images, in addition to topographically comparing the changes in the visual field with the changes in OCT probability maps.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Disease Progression", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Disk", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donald C", "Last Name": "Hood", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Bruna", "Last Name": "Melchior", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

Prior studies of the PIEZO1 mechanoreceptor have suggested a possible role in glaucoma pathophysiology. Here, we investigated associations between a Piezo1 gain-of-function variant common in individuals of African descent with glaucoma-related phenotypes. We analyzed whole genome sequences to identify Piezo1 variants and their frequencies among 1565 human participants. For the most common variant (e756del), we compared phenotypes between heterozygotes, homozygotes, and wildtypes. Longitudinal mixed effects models of visual field mean deviation (MD) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness were used to evaluate progression. Based on trends in the models, further investigation was conducted using Piezo1 gain-of-function mice. About 30% of African descent individuals had at least one e756del allele. There were trends suggesting e756del was associated with higher IOPs, thinner RNFLs, lower optic nerve head capillary densities, and greater decreases in MD and RNFL thickness over time, but these did not reach statistical significance. Among mice, increased Piezo1 activity was not significantly associated with IOP or retinal ganglion cell density. Our study confirms that the Piezo1 e756del gain-of-function variant is a frequent polymorphism present in African descent individuals but is unrelated to examined differences in glaucoma phenotypes. Ongoing work is needed to elucidate the role of Piezo1-mediated mechanotransduction in glaucoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Black People", "Cohort Studies", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Genotype", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Ion Channels", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Mice", "Phenotype", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sally L", "Last Name": "Baxter", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology, and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD), 9415 Campus Point Drive, MC0946, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "William T", "Last Name": "Keenan", "Affiliation": "Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Argus J", "Last Name": "Athanas", "Affiliation": "Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, UCSD, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Proudfoot", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology, and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD), 9415 Campus Point Drive, MC0946, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linda M", "Last Name": "Zangwill", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology, and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD), 9415 Campus Point Drive, MC0946, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Radha", "Last Name": "Ayyagari", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology, and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego (UCSD), 9415 Campus Point Drive, MC0946, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Edward S.

A large database of fundus photographs (n\u2009=\u200914,822) from a racially and ethnically diverse group of individuals (over 33% of African descent) was evaluated by expert reviewers and classified as GON or healthy. Several deep learning architectures and the impact of transfer learning were evaluated. The best performing model achieved an overall area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.91 in distinguishing GON eyes from healthy eyes. It also achieved an AUC of 0.97 for identifying GON eyes with moderate-to-severe functional loss and 0.89 for GON eyes with mild functional loss. A sensitivity of 88% at a set 95% specificity was achieved in detecting moderate-to-severe GON. In all cases, transfer improved performance and reduced training time. Model visualizations indicate that these deep learning models relied on, in part, anatomical features in the inferior and superior regions of the optic disc, areas commonly used by clinicians to diagnose GON. The results suggest that deep learning-based assessment of fundus images could be useful in clinical decision support systems and in the automation of large-scale glaucoma detection and screening programs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Deep Learning", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Optic Nerve Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Christopher", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Akram", "Last Name": "Belghith", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Bowd", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Proudfoot", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael H", "Last Name": "Goldbaum", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Weinreb", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Girkin", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of Alabama-Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Edward S.

POAG is characterized by an asymptomatic onset, where patients do not present with symptoms until significant visual loss occurs in late stages of the disease. Importantly, while glaucoma is associated with several risk factors that contribute to damage and disease progression, intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only proven modifiable risk factor at this time. Treatments for POAG include use of pharmacologic and surgical interventions. As of this writing, available pharmacologic options reduce IOP through reduction of aqueous humor production or by facilitating aqueous humor drainage through the uveoscleral outflow pathway (the unconventional pathway). Although cholinergic agonists (eg, pilocarpine) indirectly targets aqueous humor draining through the trabecular meshwork/Schlemm's canal (the conventional outflow pathway), cholinergic agonists are not frequently used, and as of this writing, no agents are currently available that target both the conventional and unconventional outflow pathways.

At the present time, intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be the most important modifiable risk factor for glaucoma onset and progression. Reduction of IOP has been repeatedly demonstrated to be an effective intervention across the spectrum of glaucoma, regardless of subtype or disease stage. In the setting of approval of IOP-lowering therapies, it is expected that effects on IOP will translate into benefits in long-term patient-reported outcomes. Nonetheless, the effect of these medications on IOP and their associated risks can be consistently and objectively measured. This helps to explain why regulatory approval of new therapies in glaucoma has historically used IOP as the outcome variable. Although all approved treatments for glaucoma involve IOP reduction, patients frequently continue to progress despite treatment. It would therefore be beneficial to develop treatments that preserve visual function through mechanisms other than lowering IOP. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that they will accept a clinically meaningful definition of visual field progression using Glaucoma Change Probability criteria. Nonetheless, these criteria do not take into account the time (and hence, the speed) needed to reach significant change. In this paper we provide an analysis based on the existing literature to support the hypothesis that decreasing the rate of visual field progression by 30% in a trial lasting 12-18 months is clinically meaningful. We demonstrate that a 30% decrease in rate of visual field progression can be reliably projected to have a significant effect on health-related quality of life, as defined by validated instruments designed to measure that endpoint.", "Keywords": ["Clinical trials", "Glaucoma", "Intraocular pressure", "Neuroprotection", "Perimetry", "Progression"], "MeSH terms": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Disease Management", "Disease Progression", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "C Gustavo", "Last Name": "De Moraes", "Affiliation": "Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Research Laboratory, Edward S.

The assessment of longitudinal series of visual fields, measured using Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP), is considered the reference standard for this effort. We seek efficient techniques for determining progression from longitudinal visual fields by formulating the problem as an optimization framework, learned from a population of glaucoma data. The longitudinal data from each patient's eye were used in a convex optimization framework to find a vector that is representative of the progression direction of the sample population, as a whole. Post-hoc analysis of longitudinal visual fields across the derived vector led to optimal progression (change) detection. The proposed method was compared to recently described progression detection methods and to linear regression of instrument-defined global indices, and showed slightly higher sensitivities at the highest specificities than other methods (a clinically desirable result). The proposed approach is simpler, faster, and more efficient for detecting glaucomatous changes, compared to our previously proposed machine learning-based methods, although it provides somewhat less information. This approach has potential application in glaucoma clinics for patient monitoring and in research centers for classification of study participants.", "Keywords": ["Change detection", "Computational modeling", "Data mining", "Glaucoma", "Progression", "Standard automated perimetry", "Visual field"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Siamak", "Last Name": "Yousefi", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael H", "Last Name": "Goldbaum", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ehsan S", "Last Name": "Varnousfaderani", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Akram", "Last Name": "Belghith", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tzyy-Ping", "Last Name": "Jung", "Affiliation": "Institute for Neural Computation and Institute of Engineering in Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Felipe A", "Last Name": "Medeiros", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linda M", "Last Name": "Zangwill", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Weinreb", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Girkin", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Bowd", "Affiliation": "Hamilton Glaucoma Center and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.

To better understand the etiology of XFS, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,484 cases and 1,188 controls from Japan and followed up the most significant findings in a further 6,901 cases and 20,727 controls from 17 countries across 6 continents. We discovered a genome-wide significant association between a new locus (CACNA1A rs4926244) and increased susceptibility to XFS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, P = 3.36 \u00d7 10(-11)). Although we also confirmed overwhelming association at the LOXL1 locus, the key SNP marker (LOXL1 rs4886776) demonstrated allelic reversal depending on the ancestry group (Japanese: OR(A allele) = 9.87, P = 2.13 \u00d7 10(-217); non-Japanese: OR(A allele) = 0.49, P = 2.35 \u00d7 10(-31)).

The analysis pipeline included three stages, namely, clustering, glaucoma boundary limit detection, and glaucoma progression detection testing. First, cross-sectional visual field tests collected from each subject were clustered using a mixture of Gaussians and model parameters were estimated using expectation maximization. The visual field clusters were further estimated to recognize glaucomatous visual field defect patterns by decomposing each cluster into several axes. The glaucoma visual field defect patterns along each axis then were identified. To derive a definition of progression, the longitudinal visual fields of stable glaucoma eyes on the abnormal cluster axes were projected and the slope was approximated using linear regression (LR) to determine the confidence limit of each axis. For glaucoma progression detection, the longitudinal visual fields of each eye on the abnormal cluster axes were projected and the slope was approximated by LR. Progression was assigned if the progression rate was greater than the boundary limit of the stable eyes; otherwise, stability was assumed. The proposed method was compared to a recently developed progression detection method and to clinically available glaucoma progression detection software. The clinical accuracy of the proposed pipeline was as good as or better than the currently available methods.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Artificial Intelligence", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Siamak", "Last Name": "Yousefi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael H", "Last Name": "Goldbaum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Madhusudhanan", "Last Name": "Balasubramanian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Felipe A", "Last Name": "Medeiros", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Linda M", "Last Name": "Zangwill", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey M", "Last Name": "Liebmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Girkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Weinreb", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Bowd", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "24697910", "Title": "Effect of focal lamina cribrosa defect on glaucomatous visual field progression.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the association between focal, structural defects of the lamina cribrosa (LC) and glaucomatous visual field (VF) progression.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Disease Progression", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Middle Aged", "Observer Variation", "Odds Ratio", "Optic Disk", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Tonometry, Ocular", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Omar S", "Last Name": "Faridi", "Affiliation": "Moise and Chella Safra Advanced Ocular Imaging Laboratory, Einhorn Clinical Research Center, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sung Chul", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Moise and Chella Safra Advanced Ocular Imaging Laboratory, Einhorn Clinical Research Center, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York; Department of Ophthalmology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.

The anatomical basis of this damage can be studied using frequency domain optical coherence tomography (fdOCT), by which the local thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and local retinal ganglion cell plus inner plexiform (RGC+) layer can be measured. Based upon averaged fdOCT results from healthy controls and patients, we show that: 1. For healthy controls, the average RGC+ layer thickness closely matches human histological data; 2. For glaucoma patients and suspects, the average RGC+ layer shows greater glaucomatous thinning in the inferior retina (superior visual field (VF)); and 3. The central test points of the 6\u00b0 VF grid (24-2 test pattern) miss the region of greatest RGC+ thinning. Based upon fdOCT results from individual patients, we have learned that: 1. Local RGC+ loss is associated with local VF sensitivity loss as long as the displacement of RGCs from the foveal center is taken into consideration; and 2. Macular damage is typically arcuate in nature and often associated with local RNFL thinning in a narrow region of the disc, which we call the macular vulnerability zone (MVZ). According to our schematic model of macular damage, most of the inferior region of the macula projects to the MVZ, which is located largely in the inferior quadrant of the disc, a region that is particularly susceptible to glaucomatous damage. A\u00a0small (cecocentral) region of the inferior macula, and all of the superior macula (inferior VF), project to the temporal quadrant, a region that is less susceptible to damage. The overall message is clear; clinicians need to be aware that glaucomatous damage to the macula is common, can occur early in the disease, and can be missed and/or underestimated with standard VF tests that use a 6\u00b0 grid, such as the 24-2 VF test.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Macula Lutea", "Nerve Fibers", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinal
