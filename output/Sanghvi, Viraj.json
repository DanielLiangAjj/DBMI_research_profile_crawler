Briefly, early events in the activation of Ag-experienced CD8 T cells are insensitive to transcriptional blockade with actinomycin D, and instead depend on the translation of pre-existing mRNAs and are blocked by cycloheximide. Ribosome profiling identifies \u223c92 mRNAs that are recruited into ribosomes following CD8 T cell stimulation.

The exact molecular effects of 4EBP1 activation in cancer are still unknown. Surprisingly, 4EBP1 is a target of genomic copy number gains (Chr. 8p11) in breast and lung cancer. We noticed that 4EBP1 gains are genetically linked to gains in neighboring genes, including WHSC1L1 and FGFR1. Our results show that FGFR1 gains act to attenuate the function of 4EBP1 via PI3K-mediated phosphorylation at Thr37/46, Ser65, and Thr70 sites. This implies that not 4EBP1 but instead FGFR1 is the genetic target of Chr. 8p11 gains in breast and lung cancer. Accordingly, these tumors show increased sensitivity to FGFR1 and PI3K inhibition, and this is a therapeutic vulnerability through restoring the tumor-suppressive function of 4EBP1. Ribosome profiling reveals genes involved in insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and the inositol pathway to be the relevant translational targets of 4EBP1. These mRNAs are among the top 200 translation targets and are highly enriched for structure and sequence motifs in their 5'UTR, which depends on the 4EBP1-EIF4E activity.

EIF4A was uniquely required for the translation of mRNAs with long and highly structured 5' untranslated regions, including those with multiple G-quadruplex elements.

Moreover, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma triggered by MYC and Keap1 inactivation depends on FN3K in\u00a0vivo. N-acetyl cysteine treatment partially rescues the effects of FN3K loss on NRF2 driven tumor phenotypes indicating a key role for NRF2-mediated redox balance.

Moreover, SESTRIN1 is a direct target of the lymphoma-specific EZH2 gain-of-function mutation (EZH2Y641X ). SESTRIN1 inactivation disrupts p53-mediated control of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and enables mRNA translation under genotoxic stress. SESTRIN1 loss represents an alternative to RRAGC mutations that maintain mTORC1 activity under nutrient starvation. The antitumor efficacy of pharmacological EZH2 inhibition depends on SESTRIN1, indicating that mTORC1 control is a critical function of EZH2 in lymphoma. Conversely, EZH2Y641X mutant lymphomas show increased sensitivity to RapaLink-1, a bifunctional mTOR inhibitor.

This implies that only a few miRNAs can function as effective tumor suppressors.

We identified a functionally interconnected group of miRNAs that exhibited a reduced abundance in leukemia cells from patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To pinpoint relevant target genes, we applied a machine learning approach to eliminate genes that were subject to redundant miRNA-mediated control and to identify those genes that were exclusively targeted by tumor-suppressive miRNAs. This strategy revealed the convergence of a small group of tumor suppressor miRNAs on the Myb oncogene, as well as their effects on HBP1, which encodes a transcription factor. The expression of both genes was increased in T-ALL patient samples, and each gene promoted the progression of T-ALL in mice.
