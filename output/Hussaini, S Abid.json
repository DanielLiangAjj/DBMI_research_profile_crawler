These pathological changes are concurrent with the onset of memory-related issues in AD patients with symptoms of forgetfulness such as misplacing items, disorientation in familiar environments etc. The lateral EC (LEC) is associated with non-spatial memory processing including object recognition. Since in LEC, neurons fire in response to objects (object cells) and at locations previously occupied by objects (trace cells), pathology in this region could lead to dysfunction in object location coding. In this paper we show that a transgenic mouse model, EC-App/Tau, which expresses both APP and tau primarily in the EC region, have deficits in LEC-specific memory tasks. Using in vivo single-unit electrophysiology recordings we show that the LEC neurons are hyperactive with low information content and high sparsity compared to the controls indicating poor firing fidelity. We finally show that object cells and trace cells fire less precisely in the EC-App/Tau mice compared to controls indicating poor encoding of objects. Overall, we show that AD pathology causes erratic firing of LEC neurons and object coding defects leading to LEC-specific memory impairment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Radha", "Last Name": "Raghuraman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Aoun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mathieu", "Last Name": "Herman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Shetler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eden", "Last Name": "Nahmani", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S Abid", "Last Name": "Hussaini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr17"}, {"PMID": "38559039", "Title": "Open-Source Tools to Analyze Temporal and Spatial Properties of Local Field Potentials.", "Abstract": "Analysis of local field potentials (LFPs) is important for understanding how ensemble neurons function as a network in a specific region of the brain. Despite the availability of tools for analyzing LFP data, there are some missing features such as analysis of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) and spatial properties. In addition, accessibility of most tools is restricted due to closed source code and/or high costs. To overcome these issues, we have developed two freely available tools that make temporal and spatial analysis of LFP data easily accessible. The first tool, hfoGUI (High Frequency Oscillation Graphical User Interface), allows temporal analysis of LFP data and scoring of HFOs such as ripples and fast ripples which are important in understanding memory function and neurological disorders. To complement the temporal analysis tool, a second tool, SSM (Spatial Spectral Mapper), focuses on the spatial analysis of LFP data. The SSM tool maps the spectral power of LFPs as a function of subject's position in a given environment allowing investigation of spatial properties of LFP signal. Both hfoGUI and SSM are open-source tools that have unique features not offered by any currently available tools, and allow visualization and spatio-temporal analysis of LFP data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Geoffrey M", "Last Name": "Barrett", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Srujan", "Last Name": "Vajram", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Shetler", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Aoun", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "S Abid", "Last Name": "Hussaini", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Mar14"}, {"PMID": "38303974", "Title": "Beyond correlation: optimal transport metrics for characterizing representational stability and remapping in neurons encoding spatial memory.", "Abstract": "Spatial representations in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HPC) are fundamental to cognitive functions like navigation and memory.

This limitation hinders our understanding and quantification of remapping, a key aspect of spatial memory function. To address this, we propose a family of metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as a versatile framework for characterizing remapping. Applied to both normalized and unnormalized distributions, the EMD provides a granular, noise-resistant, and rate-robust description of remapping. This approach enables the identification of specific cell types and the characterization of remapping in various scenarios, including disease models. Furthermore, the EMD's properties can be manipulated to identify spatially tuned cell types and to explore remapping as it relates to alternate information forms such as spatiotemporal coding. By employing approximations of the EMD, we present a feasible, lightweight approach that complements traditional methods.

However, the contribution of failed proteostasis to neuronal circuit dysfunction is an emerging concept in neurodegenerative research and will prove critical in understanding cognitive decline. Our objective is to convey Alzheimer's disease progression with the growing evidence for a bidirectional relationship of sleep disruption and proteostasis failure. Proteostasis dysfunction and tauopathy in Alzheimer's disease disrupts neurons that regulate the sleep-wake cycle, which presents behavior as impaired slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep patterns. Subsequent sleep loss further impairs protein clearance. Sleep loss is a defined feature seen early in many neurodegenerative disorders and contributes to memory impairments in Alzheimer's disease. Canonical pathological hallmarks, \u03b2-amyloid, and tau, directly disrupt sleep, and neurodegeneration of locus coeruleus, hippocampal and hypothalamic neurons from tau proteinopathy causes disruption of the neuronal circuitry of sleep. Acting in a positive-feedback-loop, sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption then increase spread of \u03b2-amyloid and tau, through impairments of proteasome, autophagy, unfolded protein response and glymphatic clearance. This phenomenon extends beyond \u03b2-amyloid and tau, with interactions of sleep impairment with the homeostasis of TDP-43, \u03b1-synuclein, FUS, and huntingtin proteins, implicating sleep loss as an important consideration in an array of neurodegenerative diseases and in cases of mixed neuropathology. Critically, the dynamics of this interaction in the neurodegenerative environment are not fully elucidated and are deserving of further discussion and research. Finally, we propose sleep-enhancing therapeutics as potential interventions for promoting healthy proteostasis, including \u03b2-amyloid and tau clearance, mechanistically linking these processes. With further clinical and preclinical research, we propose this dynamic interaction as a diagnostic and therapeutic framework, informing precise single- and combinatorial-treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Autophagy", "Proteostasis", "Sleep", "Tau", "Unfolded protein response", "\u03b2-amyloid"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Alzheimer Disease", "Proteostasis", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Sleep", "Neurons", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher Daniel", "Last Name": "Morrone", "Affiliation": "Brain Health Imaging Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 250 College St., Toronto, ON, M5T 1R8, Canada.

Using light as a probe for selective neuronal activation or inhibition and as a means to read out neural activity has dramatically enhanced our understanding of complex neural circuits. However, a common limitation of optogenetic studies to date is their invasiveness and spatiotemporal range. Direct viral injections into the brain tissue along with implantation of optical fibers and recording electrodes can disrupt the neuronal circuitry and cause significant damage. Conventional approaches are spatially limited around the site of the direct injection and insufficient in examining large networks throughout the brain. Lastly, optogenetics is currently not easily scalable to large animals or humans. Here, we demonstrate that optogenetic excitation can be achieved entirely non-invasively through the intact skull in mice. Using a needle-free combination of focused ultrasound-mediated viral delivery and extracorporeal illumination with red light, we achieved selective neuronal activation at depths up to 4\u00a0mm in the murine brain, confirmed through cFos expression and electrophysiology measurements within the treated areas. Ultrasound treatment significantly reduced freezing time during recall in fear conditioning experiments, but remote light exposure had a moderate effect on the freezing behavior of mice treated with viral vectors. The proposed method has the potential to open new avenues of studying, but also stimulating, neuronal networks, in an effort to elucidate normal or dysfunctional brain activity and treat neurological diseases.

Here, by using the polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) model of gestational infection we show that viral-like immune activation at mid-gestation persistently changes hypothalamic neurocircuit parameters in mouse dams and, consequently, is adverse to parenting behavior. Poly I:C-exposed dams favor non-pup-directed exploratory behavior at the expense of pup retrieval. These behavioral deficits are underlain by dendrite pruning and lesser immediate early gene activation in Galanin (Gal)+ neurons with dam-specific transcriptional signatures that reside in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Reduced activation of an exclusively inhibitory contingent of these distal-projecting Gal+ neurons allows for increased feed-forward inhibition onto putative dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in Poly I:C-exposed dams.

VPS26b was then found enriched in the trans-entorhinal cortex of human brains, where both VPS26b and the retromer-related receptor SORL1 were found deficient in AD.

Taken together, our findings suggest that SYNJ1 contributes to memory deficits in the aging hippocampus in all forms of AD.", "Keywords": ["Long-term memory", "SYNJ1", "hyperexcitability", "in\u00a0vivo electrophysiology", "neurodegenerative disorders", "single nucleotide polymorphisms", "synaptic dysfunction"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Cognition Disorders", "Haplotypes", "Hippocampus", "Memory Disorders", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutant Proteins", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases", "Place Cells", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andre M", "Last Name": "Miranda", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal; ICVS/3B's, PT Government Associate Laboratory, 4806-909 Braga/Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Mathieu", "Last Name": "Herman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rong", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; G.

However, the reason APOE4 is associated with increased AD risk remains a source of debate. Neuronal hyperactivity is an early phenotype in both AD mouse models and in human AD, which may play a direct role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Here, we have identified an APOE4-associated hyperactivity phenotype in the brains of aged APOE mice using four complimentary techniques-fMRI, in vitro electrophysiology, in vivo electrophysiology, and metabolomics-with the most prominent hyperactivity occurring in the entorhinal cortex. Further analysis revealed that this neuronal hyperactivity is driven by decreased background inhibition caused by reduced responsiveness of excitatory neurons to GABAergic inhibitory inputs. Given the observations of neuronal hyperactivity in prodromal AD, we propose that this APOE4-driven hyperactivity may be a causative factor driving increased risk of AD among APOE4 carriers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Apolipoprotein E3", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Brain Waves", "Energy Metabolism", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Fatty Acids", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Nuriel", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sergio L", "Last Name": "Angulo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Physiology/Pharmacology, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, The Robert F.
