Here we report a novel model where human pluripotent stem cell-derived expandable cell lines sharing features of airway secretory and basal cells engraft in the distal rat lung after conditioning by locoregional de-epithelialization followed by irradiation and immunosuppression. The engrafting cells, which we named distal lung epithelial progenitors (DLEPs), contributed to alveolar epithelial cells and generated 'KRT5-pods', structures involved in distal lung repair after severe injury, but only rarely to distal airways. Most strikingly, however, injury induced by the conditioning regimen was largely prevented by the engrafting DLEPs. The approach described here provides a model to study mechanisms involved in human lung regeneration, and potentially lays the foundation for the preclinical development of cell therapy to treat lung injury and disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hsiao-Yun", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Camilla", "Last Name": "Predella", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ya-Wen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mikael", "Last Name": "Pezet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Songjingyi", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Far\u00e8", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John W", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anjali", "Last Name": "Saqi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hans-Willem", "Last Name": "Snoeck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N Valerio", "Last Name": "Dorrello", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Nov29"}, {"PMID": "38071779", "Title": "Delphi Process for Validation of Fluid Treatment Algorithm for Critically Ill Pediatric Trauma Patients.", "Abstract": "While intravenous fluid therapy is essential to re-establishing volume status in children who have experienced trauma, aggressive resuscitation can lead to various complications.

Quantitative scoring of lung injury demonstrated time-dependent increases in interstitial and alveolar edema, neutrophil infiltration, and mild to moderate alveolar membrane thickening.

This mutation in F confers an advantage over wild-type virus in the CNS, contributing to disease in these patients. Using murine ex vivo organotypic brain cultures and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids, we show that CNS adaptive mutations in F enhance the spread of virus ex vivo. The spread of virus in human brain organoids is blocked by an inhibitory peptide that targets F, confirming that dissemination in the brain tissue is attributable to F. A single mutation in MeV F thus alters the fusion complex to render MeV more neuropathogenic. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) infection can cause serious complications in immunocompromised individuals, including measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE). In some cases, MeV persistence and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), another severe central nervous system (CNS) complication, develop even in the face of a systemic immune response. Both MIBE and SSPE are relatively rare but lethal. It is unclear how MeV causes CNS infection. We introduced specific mutations that are found in MIBE or SSPE cases into the MeV fusion protein to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of the viral fusion complex-comprising F and the receptor binding protein, H-allows virus to spread in the CNS. Using metagenomic, structural, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that altered fusion properties of the MeV H-F fusion complex permit MeV to spread in brain tissue.", "Keywords": ["central

reducing viral transmission. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is initiated by membrane fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, which is mediated by the viral spike protein.

Daily intranasal administration to ferrets completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact transmission during 24-hour cohousing with infected animals, under stringent conditions that resulted in infection of 100% of untreated animals. These lipopeptides are highly stable and thus may readily translate into safe and effective intranasal prophylaxis to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Intranasal", "Animals", "COVID-19", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Design", "Ferrets", "Lipopeptides", "Membrane Fusion", "Mice", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "SARS-CoV-2", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "Tissue Distribution", "Vero Cells", "Viral Fusion Protein Inhibitors", "Virus Internalization"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rory D", "Last Name": "de Vries", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Katharina S", "Last Name": "Schmitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Francesca T", "Last Name": "Bovier", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Camilla", "Last Name": "Predella", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Khao", "Affiliation": "Digizyme Inc., Brookline, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danny", "Last Name": "Noack", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Bart L", "Last Name": "Haagmans", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Sander", "Last Name": "Herfst", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Kyle N", "Last Name": "Stearns", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Drew-Bear", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sudipta", "Last Name": "Biswas", "Affiliation": "Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Rockx", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Ga\u00ebl", "Last Name": "McGill", "Affiliation": "Digizyme Inc., Brookline, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "N Valerio", "Last Name": "Dorrello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samuel H", "Last Name": "Gellman", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Alabi", "Affiliation": "Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. caa238@cornell.edu r.deswart@erasmusmc.nl am939@cumc.columbia.edu mp3509@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Rik L", "Last Name": "de Swart", "Affiliation": "Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands. caa238@cornell.edu r.deswart@erasmusmc.nl am939@cumc.columbia.edu mp3509@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Moscona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. caa238@cornell.edu r.deswart@erasmusmc.nl am939@cumc.columbia.edu mp3509@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Porotto", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. caa238@cornell.edu r.deswart@erasmusmc.nl am939@cumc.columbia.edu mp3509@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2021Mar26"}, {"PMID": "32926122", "Title": "Successful management of SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome and newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.", "Abstract": "Standard chemotherapy can still be used for new diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients with SARS-CoV-2.

With the current acceptance rate of donor lungs of only 20%, rescuing even one half of the rejected donor lungs would increase the number of transplantable lungs threefold, to 60%. We review recent advances in lung bioengineering that have potential to repair the epithelial and vascular compartments of the lung. Our focus is on the long-term support and recovery of the lung ex vivo, and the replacement of defective epithelium with healthy therapeutic cells. To this end, we first review the roles of the lung epithelium and vasculature, with focus on the alveolar-capillary membrane, and then discuss the available and emerging technologies for ex vivo bioengineering of the lung by decellularization and recellularization. While there have been many meritorious advances in these technologies for recovering marginal quality lungs to the levels needed to meet the standards for transplantation - many challenges remain, motivating further studies of the extended ex vivo support and interventions in the lung.

We report on the transport and deposition of intratracheally delivered stem cells as well as strategies to modulate the number of cells (e.g., dose), topographic distribution, and region-specific delivery in small (rodent) and large (porcine and human) lungs.

To reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with lung disease, new therapeutic strategies aimed at promoting lung repair and increasing the number of donor lungs available for transplantation are being explored. Because of the extreme complexity of this organ, previous attempts at bioengineering functional lungs from fully decellularized or synthetic scaffolds lacking functional vasculature have been largely unsuccessful. An intact vascular network is critical not only for maintaining the blood-gas barrier and allowing for proper graft function but also for supporting the regenerative cells. We therefore developed an airway-specific approach to removing the pulmonary epithelium, while maintaining the viability and function of the vascular endothelium, using a rat model. The resulting vascularized lung grafts supported the attachment and growth of human adult pulmonary cells and stem cell-derived lung-specified epithelial cells. We propose that de-epithelialization of the lung with preservation of intact vasculature could facilitate cell therapy of pulmonary epithelium and enable bioengineering of functional lungs for transplantation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bioengineering", "Cell Survival", "Extracellular Matrix", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Lung", "Lung Transplantation", "Muscle, Smooth", "Rats", "Regeneration", "Regenerative Medicine", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N Valerio", "Last Name": "Dorrello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon A", "Last Name": "Guenthart", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "O'Neill", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinho", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ya-Wen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mauer", "Last Name": "Biscotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Theresa", "Last Name": "Swayne", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Holly M", "Last Name": "Wobma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah X L", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Willem", "Last Name": "Snoeck", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2017Aug"}, {"PMID": "26324893", "Title": "Targeted delivery of liquid microvolumes into the lung.", "Abstract": "The ability to deliver drugs to specific sites in the lung could radically improve therapeutic outcomes of a variety of lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, severe bronchopneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Using conventional methods for pulmonary drug administration, precise, localized delivery of exact doses of drugs to target regions remains challenging. Here we describe a more controlled delivery of soluble reagents (e.g., drugs, enzymes, and radionuclides) in microvolume liquid plugs to targeted branches of the pulmonary airway tree: upper airways, small airways (bronchioles), or the most distal alveoli. In this approach, a soluble liquid plug of very small volume (<1 mL) is instilled into the upper airways, and with programmed air ventilation of the lungs, the plug is pushed into a specific desired (more distal) airway to achieve deposition of liquid film onto the lung epithelium. The plug volume and ventilation conditions were determined by mathematical modeling of plug transport in a tubular geometry, and targeted liquid film deposition was demonstrated in rat lungs by three different in vivo imaging modalities. The experimental and modeling data suggest that instillation of microvolumes of liquid into a ventilated pulmonary airway could be an effective strategy to deliver exact doses of drugs to targeted pathologic regions of the lung, especially those inaccessible by bronchoscopy, to increase in situ efficacy of the drug and minimize systemic side effects.", "Keywords": ["alveoli", "liquid instillation", "lung airway", "lung disease", "pulmonary drug delivery"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Lung", "Male", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Models, Theoretical", "Pulmonary Alveoli", "Pulmonary Surfactants", "Pulmonary Ventilation", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Respiratory Mechanics", "Respiratory System"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jinho", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "John D", "Last Name": "O'Neill", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "N Valerio", "Last Name": "Dorrello", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10029;"}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Bacchetta", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032;"}, {"First Name": "Gordana", "Last Name": "Vunjak-Novakovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032 gv2131@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2015Sep15"}]
