We investigated the hemodynamic implications of speed adjustments in HM3 recipients undergoing hemodynamic ramp tests. Clinically stable HM3 recipients who underwent routine invasive hemodynamic ramp tests between 2015 and 2022 at our center were included. Filling pressure optimization, defined as central venous pressure (CVP) <12\u2009mm Hg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) <18\u2009mm Hg, was assessed at baseline and final pump speeds. Patients with optimized pressures were compared to nonoptimized patients. Overall 60 HM3 recipients with a median age of 62 years (56, 71) and time from LVAD implantation of 187 days (124, 476) were included. Optimized filling pressures were found in 35 patients (58%) at baseline speed. Speed was adjusted in 84% of the nonoptimized patients. Consequently, 39 patients (65%) had optimized pressures at final speed. There were no significant differences in hemodynamic findings between baseline and final speeds (p > 0.05 for all). Six and 12 month readmission-free rates were higher in optimized compared with nonoptimized patients (p = 0.03 for both), predominantly due to lower cardiac readmission-free rates (p = 0.052). In stable outpatients supported with HM3 who underwent routine ramp tests, optimized hemodynamics were achieved in only 2 of 3 of the patients. Patients with optimized pressures had lower all-cause readmission rates, primarily driven by fewer cardiac-related hospitalizations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gal", "Last Name": "Rubinstein", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cathrine M", "Last Name": "Moeller", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dor", "Last Name": "Lotan", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sharon", "Last Name": "Slomovich", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Fernandez-Valledor", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Oren", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kyung T", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Justin A", "Last Name": "Fried", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Clerkin", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jayant K", "Last Name": "Raikhelkar", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Veli K", "Last Name": "Topkara", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yuji", "Last Name": "Kaku", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic, and Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Takeda", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic, and Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yoshifumi", "Last Name": "Naka", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac, Thoracic, and Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Burkhoff", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Farhana", "Last Name": "Latif", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Majure", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paolo C", "Last Name": "Colombo", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Melana", "Last Name": "Yuzefpolskaya", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel T", "Last Name": "Sayer", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nir", "Last Name": "Uriel", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)", "PubDate": "2024Feb20"}, {"PMID": "38214584", "Title": "Right heart failure after durable left ventricular assist device implantation.", "Abstract": "Right heart failure (RHF) is a well-known complication after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and portends increased morbidity and mortality.

Women account for a third of the heart failure population in the United States. Left ventricular assist devices have emerged as a safe and effective treatment option for patients with advanced heart failure. Pregnancy during LVAD support can occur, and it presents significant risks to both mother and fetus, including hemodynamic stress, thrombotic events, medication-associated teratogenicity, and uterine impingement. This literature review identified 10 cases of confirmed pregnancy during LVAD support, of which eight resulted in successful births. Maternal and fetal mortality occurred in one case, and there was a spontaneous abortion in one case. The review highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, promotion of shared decision-making, thoughtful anticoagulation, adjustment of LVAD speed, and medication optimization to maintain hemodynamic support during pregnancy. Hemodynamic changes during pregnancy include increased cardiac output, heart rate, and plasma volume, as well as decreased systemic vascular resistance, which can impact LVAD support. Despite reduced pulsatility in LVAD-supported patients, ovulation and reproductive capacity might be preserved, and viable pregnancies may be achieved with appropriate management. The review provides insights into the risks and considerations for a viable pregnancy during LVAD support, including the need for ongoing research to inform joined decision-making.", "Keywords": [],

Genome-wide mapping of myocardial DNA methylation in 36 patients with HF at LVAD implantation, 8 patients at LVAD explantation, and 7 nonfailing (NF) donors using a high-density bead array platform identified 2,079 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and 261 DMPs in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). LVAD support resulted in normalization of 3.2% of HF-associated DMPs. Methylation-expression correlation analysis yielded several protein-coding genes that are hypomethylated and upregulated (HTRA1, FBXO16, EFCAB13, and AKAP13) or hypermethylated and downregulated (TBX3) in HF. A potentially novel cardiac-specific super-enhancer long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) (LINC00881) is hypermethylated and downregulated in human HF. LINC00881 is an upstream regulator of sarcomere and calcium channel gene expression including MYH6, CACNA1C, and RYR2. LINC00881 knockdown reduces peak calcium amplitude in the beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).

In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart's innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for \u03b2-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of \u03b2-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel \u03b2-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

This biological process involves several pathophysiological adaptations at the genetic, molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. A growing body of clinical and translational investigations demonstrated that cardiac remodeling and chronic HF does not invariably result in a static, end-stage phenotype but can be at least partially reversed. One of the paradigms which shed some additional light on the breadth and limits of myocardial elasticity and plasticity is long term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in advanced HF pediatric and adult patients. MCS by providing (a) ventricular mechanical unloading and (b) effective hemodynamic support to the periphery results in functional, structural, cellular and molecular changes, known as cardiac reverse remodeling. Herein, we analyze and synthesize the advances in our understanding of the biology of MCS-mediated reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery. The MCS investigational setting offers access to human tissue, providing an unparalleled opportunity in cardiovascular medicine to perform in-depth characterizations of myocardial biology and the associated molecular, cellular, and structural recovery signatures. These human tissue findings have triggered and effectively fueled a \"bedside to bench and back\" approach through a variety of knockout, inhibition or overexpression mechanistic investigations in vitro and in vivo using small animal models. These follow-up translational and basic science studies leveraging human tissue findings have unveiled mechanistic myocardial recovery pathways which are currently undergoing further testing for potential therapeutic drug development. Essentially, the field is advancing by extending the lessons learned from the MCS cardiac recovery investigational setting to develop therapies applicable to the greater, not end-stage, HF population. This review article focuses on the biological aspects of the MCS-mediated myocardial recovery and together with its companion review article, focused on the clinical aspects, they aim to provide a useful framework for clinicians and investigators.", "Keywords": ["GDMT", "LVAD", "biology", "explant", "myocardial recovery"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Biology", "Child", "Heart Failure", "Heart-Assist Devices", "Humans", "Myocardium", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eleni", "Last Name": "Tseliou", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT; Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT."}, {"First Name": "Kory J", "Last Name": "Lavine", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Omar", "Last Name": "Wever-Pinzon", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT; Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT."}, {"First Name": "Veli K", "Last Name": "Topkara", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Bart", "Last Name": "Meyns", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology and Department of Cardiac Surgery, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Iki", "Last Name": "Adachi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiac Surgery, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Zimpfer", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiac Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}, {"First Name": "Emma J", "Last Name": "Birks", "Affiliation": "University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Burkhoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY; Cardiovascular Research Foundation (CRF), New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stavros G", "Last Name": "Drakos", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT; Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT.

Point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) has shown comparable or superior diagnostic accuracy in comparison with a chest x-ray (CXR) in patients presenting with symptoms of ADHF. The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the sensitivity and specificity of LUS in comparison with CXR for diagnosing ADHF and summarize the rapidly growing body of evidence in this domain. A total of 5 databases were searched through February 18, 2021, to identify observational studies that reported on the use of LUS compared with CXR in diagnosing ADHF in patients presenting with shortness of breath. Meta-analysis was conducted on the sensitivities and specificities of each diagnostic method. A total of 8 studies reporting on 2,787 patients were included in this meta-analysis. For patients presenting with signs and symptoms of ADHF, LUS was found to be more sensitive than CXR (91.8% vs 76.5%) and more specific than CXR (92.3% vs 87.0%) for the detection of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In conclusion, LUS is more sensitive and specific than CXR in detecting pulmonary edema. This highlights the importance of sonographic B-lines, along with the accurate interpretation of clinical data, in the diagnosis of ADHF.

We retrospectively reviewed all patients with AMI-CS supported with VA-ECMO between December 2008 and June 2018. One hundred twenty-six patients received VA-ECMO for AMI-CS during the study period; of these, 39 (31.0%) experienced ventricular recovery and were discharged while 87 (69.0%) did not recover, with 71 (56.3%) dying in the hospital and 16 (12.7%) surviving to discharge with either left ventricular assist device or heart transplant.

Four variables emerged as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality and were used to create the AMI-ECMO Risk Score: age >70 years, creatinine >1.5\u2009mg/dL, serum lactate > 4.0 mmol/L, and lack of TIMI 3 flow in culprit artery. In patients supported with VA-ECMO for AMI-CS, prompt, successful revascularization, and lower serum lactate were associated with ventricular recovery while younger age, lower serum lactate, and creatinine, and successful revascularization were associated with survival to discharge.

We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of patients with HM3 managed with RT from November 2014 through January 2020. We analyzed baseline characteristics, RT indications, and bleeding and thrombotic complications. We found that 50 of 161 patients with HM3 (31.1%) received RT starting at a median time of 90.5 days after LVAD implantation. Patients on RT were older and more likely to have ischemic heart failure than patients on standard anti-thrombotic therapy (ST). The most common indication for RT was gastrointestinal bleeding (29 patients [58.0%]). At 1-year follow-up, 5.0% of patients on RT developed a thrombotic event.

The sample was stratified into two groups based on preimplant CRP levels: CRP of 0-10 mg/L (low) and >10 mg/L (high). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to assess outcomes at 2 years after LVAD implantation, with log-rank testing used to compare groups. Cox proportional hazard models were used for multivariable adjustment. Patients with high preimplant CRP were younger, more likely to be INTERMACS class I, and had a higher need for temporary mechanical circulatory support before LVAD implant compared to those with lower CRP levels (all P < 0.001). The high CRP group had higher WBC counts and BNP levels (all P < 0.001). After adjustment, higher CRP (>10 mg/L) was associated with greater risk of mortality, RV failure, and stroke postimplant (P < 0.001). In addition, elevated postimplant CRP level at 3 months was associated with increased mortality and stroke on LVAD support (P < 0.001). CRP is a predictor of death and complications on LVAD support.

The impact of AF on functional TR and cardiovascular events is uncertain in patients with left ventricular assist devices. This study aimed to investigate the effect of AF on functional TR and cardiovascular events in patients with a HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device. Methods and Results We retrospectively reviewed 133 patients who underwent HeartMate 3 implantation at our center between November 2014 and November 2018. We excluded patients who had undergone previous or concomitant tricuspid valve procedures and those whose echocardiographic images were of insufficient quality. The primary end point was death and the presence of a cardiovascular event at 1\u00a0year. We defined cardiovascular event as a composite of death, stroke, and hospital readmission due to recurrent heart failure and significant residual TR as vena contracta width \u22653\u00a0mm. In total, 110 patients were included in this analysis. Patients were divided into 3 groups: no AF (n=51), paroxysmal AF (n=40), and persistent AF (PeAF) (n=19). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with PeAF had the worst survival (no AF 98%, paroxysmal AF 98%, PeAF 84%, log-rank P=0.038) and event-free rate (no AF 93%, paroxysmal AF 89%, PeAF 72%, log-rank P=0.048) at 1\u00a0year. Thirty-one (28%) patients had residual TR 1\u00a0month after left ventricular assist device implantation. Patients with residual TR had a significantly poor prognosis compared with those without residual TR (log-rank P=0.014).

In this single-center study, we compared post-heart transplant (OHT, orthotopic heart transplantation) survival for AL and ATTR amyloidosis, hypothesizing that these differences would persist post-OHT. Thirty-nine patients with CA (AL, n\u00a0=\u00a018; ATTR, n\u00a0=\u00a021) and 1023 non-amyloidosis subjects undergoing OHT were included. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate the impact of amyloid subtype and era (early era: from 2001 to 2007; late era: from 2008 to 2018) on survival post-OHT. Survival for non-amyloid patients was greater than ATTR (P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) and AL (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) patients in the early era. One, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were higher for ATTR patients than AL patients in the early era (100% vs 75%, 67% vs 50%, and 67% vs 33%, respectively, for ATTR and AL patients).

In the late era, AL and ATTR patients had unadjusted 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates of 100%, which was comparable to non-amyloid patients (90% vs 84% vs 81%).

The objectives of the current study were to describe the current trends and clinical consequences of IT in patients BTT with LVAD. The United Network of Organ Sharing database was queried to identify adult, single-organ heart transplant recipients who were BTT with LVAD between 2008 and 2018. Propensity score matching was then used to balance clinical covariates between those patient who did and did not receive IT. The primary outcomes of interest were graft survival, hospitalization for rejection and infection, and freedom from transplant coronary artery disease (TCAD). In the overall cohort, 49.1% (n = 3,978) received IT, with basiliximab being the most commonly used agent followed by antithymocyte globulin. After propensity score matching, 4,388 patients (2,194 without induction and 2,194 with induction) were identified. Between those who did and did not receive IT, there was no significant difference in graft survival, freedom from hospitalization for rejection, and freedom from hospitalization for infection. Patients who received IT experienced increased freedom from TCAD (p = 0.004) with unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.81 (95% Cardiac Index: 0.70-0.93). For freedom from TCAD, antithymocyte globulin was associated with better outcomes than basiliximab (80.2% vs. 73.1% at 5 years, log rank p value = 0.004). In a sensitivity analysis, there was no significant increase in hospitalization for infection in those patients with an infected LVAD before transplant. Use of induction therapy in patients BTT with LVAD appears to be safe and feasible, without a significant increase in the risk of infection or rejection, even in those patients with pretransplant device-related infections. IT, particularly antithymocyte globulin, was associated with increased time to development of TCAD. Routine use of IT in patients BTT with LVAD may be considered, and further randomized control trials are warranted to further support these data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Graft Survival", "Heart Failure", "Heart Transplantation", "Heart-Assist Devices", "Humans", "Immunosuppression Therapy", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lauren K", "Last Name": "Truby", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Jaya", "Last Name": "Batra", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Douglas L", "Last Name": "Jennings", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Takeda", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ersilia M", "Last Name": "DeFilippis", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hiroo", "Last Name": "Takayama", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yoshifumi", "Last Name": "Naka", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Maryjane A", "Last Name": "Farr", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Veli K", "Last Name": "Topkara", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)", "PubDate": "2020Mar"}, {"PMID": "32081232", "Title": "Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Heart Transplant Recipients With Allograft Failure.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Allografts", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Female", "Heart Transplantation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Treatment Failure", "Ventricular Dysfunction", "Waiting Lists"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ersilia M", "Last Name": "DeFilippis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maryjane A", "Last Name": "Farr", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angelo", "Last Name": "Biviano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Takeda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Veli K", "Last Name": "Topkara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "JACC.

We sought to compare its hemodynamic effects in these 2 populations. We performed a retrospective analysis of the hemodynamic effects of IABP for AMI or acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients with hemodynamic evidence of CS. The primary outcome was cardiac output (CO) change following insertion. In total, 205 patients were treated for CS resulting from AMI (73; 35.6%) or ADHF (132; 64.4%). At baseline, both cohorts had significant hemodynamic compromise with mean arterial pressure 75.6 \u00b1 12.3 mm Hg, CO 3.02 \u00b1 0.84 L/min, and cardiac power index 0.26 \u00b1 0.06 W/m2; these parameters were nearly identical between groups though ADHF-CS patients had a higher pre-IABP mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure than AMI-CS patients. After IABP insertion, ADHF-CS patients had moderate CO augmentation whereas AMI-CS experienced almost no improvement (0.58 \u00b1 0.79 L/min vs 0.12 \u00b1 1.00 L/min; p\u202f=\u202f0.0009). Intracardiac filling pressures were reduced by similar amounts in both cohorts. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced in patients with ADHF-CS but not in those with AMI-CS. In conclusion, following IABP insertion, ADHF-CS patients experience roughly a 5-fold greater CO augmentation compared with AMI-CS patients. Pre-IABP PA pressure differences and differential systemic vascular resistance reduction may explain these results and shed light on recent evidence supporting IABP use in ADHF-CS and curbing it in AMI-CS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Disease", "Aged", "Cardiac Output", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Hemodynamics", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Shock, Cardiogenic", "Survival Analysis", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Waqas", "Last Name": "Malick", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Justin Allan", "Last Name": "Fried", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Amirali", "Last Name": "Masoumi", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Abhinav", "Last Name": "Nair", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Jefferson Heart Institute, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Amelia", "Last Name": "Zuver", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Athena", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Haythe", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Maryjane", "Last Name": "Farr", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "LeRoy", "Last Name": "Rabbani", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dimitri", "Last Name": "Karmpaliotis", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ajay Jayant", "Last Name": "Kirtane", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Veli Kemal", "Last Name": "Topkara", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Takeda", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Arthur Reshad", "Last Name": "Garan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

Objectives: To evaluate factors associated with WLVAD, including the time taken before WLVAD. Setting/Subjects: Sixty-two patients who newly underwent initial LVAD therapy during January 1, 2010 and October 30, 2018 and subsequently underwent WLVAD by December 31, 2018 were divided into those who participated in the decision of WLVAD (defined as PT+, n\u2009=\u200914), and those who could not participate in the decision because of the medical reasons (defined as PT-, n\u2009=\u200948). Measurements: Time to WLVAD in PT+ and PT- was defined as WD_PT+ (days between patients' request and WLVAD) and WD_PT- (days between when patients became unable to express themselves and WLVAD), respectively. Circumstances around WLVAD, including location of death and use of palliative care (PC), were reviewed. Results: Mean age at WLVAD was 65.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1 years and 52 (83.9%) were men. Median days on LVAD support was 166.5 days (interquartile range\u2009=\u2009838).

The median number of PC visits in the last month was higher in PT+ than in PT- (4.5 vs. 0.5, p\u2009=\u20090.005). The median WD_PT+ was 5.5 days and was significantly shorter in the ICU (1 day vs. 46 days, p\u2009=\u20090.013). The median WD_PT- was 5.5 days and tended to be shorter in the ICU (4 days vs. 13 days, p\u2009=\u20090.072).

Recent studies suggest that low socioeconomic status (SES) predicts worst survival after heart transplantation. Both individual-level and neighborhood-level SES (nSES) have been linked to cardiovascular health; however, the impact of SES in CF-LVAD patients remains unknown. We hypothesized that SES is a major determinant of CF-LVAD candidacy and postimplantation outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 362 patients between February 2009 and May 2016. Neighborhood-level SES was measured using the American Community Survey data and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality SES index score. Individual-level SES was self reported. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression determined survival statistics. Patients in the highest SES tertile were older (58 \u00b1 13 vs. 53 \u00b1 14; p < 0.001), less likely to be black or Hispanic (26% vs. 70%; p < 0.001), more likely to be married (87% vs. 65%; p < 0.001), more likely to have private insurance (50% vs. 39%; p < 0.001), and more likely to have employment (29% vs. 15%; p < 0.001) compared with patients in the lowest tertile. Low nSES was associated with a decreased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.580; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.347-0.970; p = 0.038) in comparison to the high nSES. However, after adjusting for baseline clinical morbidities, the relationship was no longer present. When selecting patients for a LVAD, SES should not be thought of as an immutable risk factor. Carefully selected low-SES patients could be safely implanted with CF-LVAD with outcomes comparable to high-SES patients.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Heart Failure", "Heart Transplantation", "Heart-Assist Devices", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Selection", "Retrospective Studies", "Social Class"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Autumn M", "Last Name": "Clemons", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Raul J", "Last Name": "Flores", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Raia", "Last Name": "Blum", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Wayda", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Danielle L", "Last Name": "Brunjes", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Marlena", "Last Name": "Habal", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Raymond C", "Last Name": "Givens", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Lauren K", "Last Name": "Truby", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "A Reshad", "Last Name": "Garan", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Melana", "Last Name": "Yuzefpolskaya", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Koji", "Last Name": "Takeda", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hiroo", "Last Name": "Takayama", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Maryjane A", "Last Name": "Farr", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Yoshifumi", "Last Name": "Naka", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center - New York Presbyterian, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Paolo C", "Last Name": "Colombo", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Veli K", "Last Name": "Topkara", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}], "Journal": "ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992)", "PubDate": "2020Apr"}, {"PMID": "31097199", "Title": "Outcomes of bridge to cardiac retransplantation in the contemporary mechanical circulatory support era.", "Abstract": "Outcomes have improved in patients bridged to heart transplant on contemporary continuous-flow ventricular assist devices over the past decade.

Patients >18 years old treated at our institution with VA-ECMO from 2009 to 2018 for ADHF with CS were studied. Demographic, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic data were collected. The primary outcome was survival to discharge. Fifty-two patients received VA-ECMO for ADHF with CS; 24 (46.2%) survived. Seventeen (32.7%) had suffered cardiac arrest, and 37 (71.2%) were mechanically ventilated. Mean lactate was 4.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.45 mmol/L, and patients were receiving 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 vasopressor/inotropic infusions at ECMO initiation; these did not differ significantly between survivors and nonsurvivors.

We aimed to 1) characterize the changes in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type-II\u03b4 (CaMKII\u03b4), growth signaling, structural proteins, fibrosis, apoptosis, and gene expression before and after LVAD support and 2) assess whether the duration of support correlated with improvement or worsening of reverse remodeling. Left ventricular apex tissue and serum pairs were collected in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy ( n\u2009= 25, 23 men and 2 women) at LVAD implantation and after LVAD support at cardiac transplantation/LVAD explantation. Normal cardiac tissue was obtained from healthy hearts ( n = 4) and normal serum from age-matched control hearts ( n = 4). The duration of LVAD support ranged from 48 to 1,170 days (median duration: 270 days). LVAD support was associated with CaMKII\u03b4 activation, increased nuclear myocyte enhancer factor 2, sustained histone deacetylase-4 phosphorylation, increased circulating and cardiac myostatin (MSTN) and MSTN signaling mediated by SMAD2, ongoing structural protein dysregulation and sustained fibrosis and apoptosis (all P\u2009< 0.05). Increased CaMKII\u03b4 phosphorylation, nuclear myocyte enhancer factor 2, and cardiac MSTN significantly correlated with the duration of support. Phosphorylation of SMAD2 and apoptosis decreased with a shorter duration of LVAD support but increased with a longer duration of LVAD support. Further study is needed to define the optimal duration of LVAD support in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A long duration of left ventricular assist device support may be detrimental for myocardial recovery, based on myocardial tissue experiments in patients with prolonged support showing significantly worsened activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II\u03b4, increased nuclear myocyte enhancer factor 2, increased myostatin and its signaling by SMAD2, and apoptosis as

Predictive power of RDW on mortality after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation remains largely unknown. Four hundred nine patients who underwent CF-LVAD implantation between April 2004 and December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was 90 day mortality after CF-LVAD implantation. Median RDW before CF-LVAD implantation was 15.8%. Patients with elevated RDW (>15.8%) at baseline had significantly lower hemoglobin (10.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 vs. 11.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009mg/dl; p < 0.001), lower mean corpuscular volume (84.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7. vs. 88.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9; p < 0.001), higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 36.3\u2009\u00b1\u200921.8 vs. 30.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.1; p < 0.001), lower albumin (3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs. 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5; p < 0.001), and higher total bilirubin levels (1.67\u2009\u00b1\u20092.21 vs. 1.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96). Red cell distribution width was independently predictive of 90 day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.16 for 1% increase; CI, 1.04-1.31; p = 0.010). Discriminatory power of RDW alone was comparable to model of end-stage liver disease excluding international normalized ratio (MELD-Xi) and HeartMate II risk scores.

Normalization of LV structure and function was accompanied by partial normalization (~60%) of gene expression associated with incident HF. Similar findings were observed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent reverse LV remodeling following mechanical circulatory support. Persistence of the HF gene program was associated with an exaggerated hypertrophic response and increased mortality in tTA-TRAF2dox4W mice following transaortic constriction (TAC). These effects were no longer observed following TAC in tTA-TRAF2dox8W, wherein there was a more complete (88%) reversal of the incident HF genes.
