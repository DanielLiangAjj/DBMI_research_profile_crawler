Individual differences in ISC have recently been attributed to variability in focal neural processing. However, the extent to which these differences reflect purely intra-regional variability versus variation in the brain's baseline ability to transmit information between regions has yet to be established. Here, we show that an individual's degree and spatial distribution of ISC are closely related to their brain's functional organization at rest. Using resting state and movie watching fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we reveal that resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) profiles can be used to predict cortex-wide ISC. Similar region-level analyses demonstrate that the levels of ISC exhibited by brain regions during movie watching are associated with their connectivity to other regions at rest, and that the nature of these connectivity-activity relationships varies as a function of regional roles in sensory information processing. Finally, we show that an individual's unique spatial distribution of ISC, independent of its magnitude, is also related to their RSFC profile.

Here, we investigated potential visual sensory contributions to FER deficits in Sz (n = 28, 8/20 female/male; age 21-54 years) and adult ASD (n = 20, 4/16 female/male; age 19-43 years) participants compared to neurotypical (n = 30, 8/22 female/male; age 19-54 years) controls using task-based fMRI during an implicit static/dynamic FER task. Compared to neurotypical controls, both Sz (d = 1.97) and ASD (d = 1.13) participants had significantly lower FER scores which interrelated with diminished activation of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). In Sz, STS deficits were predicted by reduced activation of early visual regions (d = 0.85, p = 0.002) and of the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus (d = 0.44, p = 0.042), along with impaired cortico-pulvinar interaction.

Here we use naturalistic stimuli to examine the role of the right temporoparietal junction/posterior superior temporal sulcus (TPJ-pSTS)-an integrative hub for the cortical networks pertinent to the understanding complex social situations-in social inference, a key component of social cognition, in schizophrenia. Twenty-seven schizophrenia participants and 21 healthy control subjects watched a clip of the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly while high resolution multiband functional MRI images were collected. We used inter-subject correlation to measure the evoked activity, which we then compared to social cognition as measured by The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT). We also compared between groups the TPJ-pSTS blood oxygen level-dependent activity (i) relationship with the motion content in the film; (ii) synchronization with other cortical areas involved in the viewing of the movie; and (iii) relationship with the frequency of saccades made during the movie. Activation deficits were greatest in middle TPJ (TPJm) and correlated significantly with impaired TASIT performance across groups. Follow-up analyses of the TPJ-pSTS revealed decreased synchronization with other cortical areas, decreased correlation with the motion content of the movie, and decreased correlation with the saccades made during the movie. The functional impairment of the TPJm, a hub area in the middle of the TPJ-pSTS, predicts deficits in social inference in schizophrenia participants by disrupting the integration of visual motion processing into the TPJ. This disrupted integration then affects the use of the TPJ to guide saccades during the visual scanning of the movie clip.

To date, the large majority of studies have been conducted using deviants that differ from preceding standards in either tonal frequency (pitch) or duration. By contrast, MMN to sound location deviation has been studied to only a limited degree in Sz and has not previously been examined in CHR populations. Here, we evaluated location MMN across Sz and CHR using an optimized, multi-deviant pattern that included a location-deviant, as defined using interaural time delay (ITD) stimuli along with pitch, duration, frequency modulation (FM) and intensity deviants in a sample of 42 Sz, 33 CHR and 28 healthy control (HC) subjects. In addition, we obtained resting state functional connectivity (rsfMRI) on CHR subjects. Sz showed impaired MMN performance across all deviant types, along with strong correlation between MMN deficits and impaired neurocognitive function. In this sample of largely non-converting CHR subjects, no deficits were observed in either pitch or duration MMN. By contrast, CHR subjects showed significant impairments in location MMN generation particularly over right hemisphere and significant correlation between impaired location MMN and negative symptoms including deterioration of role function. In addition, significant correlations were observed between location MMN and rsfMRI involving brainstem circuits. In general, location detection using ITD stimuli depends upon precise processing within midbrain regions and provides a rapid and robust reorientation of attention.

Therefore, we investigated the position of the amygdala and its functional subdivisions within the network organization of the brain in 10 highly sampled individuals (5 h of fMRI data per person). We characterized three functional subdivisions within the amygdala of each individual. We discovered that one subdivision is preferentially correlated with the default mode network; a second is preferentially correlated with the dorsal attention and fronto-parietal networks; and third subdivision does not have any networks to which it is preferentially correlated relative to the other two subdivisions. All three subdivisions are positively correlated with ventral attention and somatomotor networks and negatively correlated with salience and cingulo-opercular networks. These observations were replicated in an independent group dataset of 120 individuals. We also found substantial across-subject variation in the distribution and magnitude of amygdala functional connectivity with the cerebral cortex that related to individual differences in the stereotactic locations both of amygdala subdivisions and of cortical functional brain networks. Finally, using lag analyses, we found consistent temporal ordering of fMRI signals in the cortex relative to amygdala subdivisions.

Here, we evaluate the potential contributions of EAP-related impairments in reading to functional capacity and outcome, relative to effects of auditory social cognitive and general neurocognitive dysfunction. Participants included 30-SZ and 28-controls of similar age, sex, and educational achievement. EAP was assessed using an auditory working memory (tone-matching) task. Phonological processing and reading Fluency were assessed using the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing and Woodcock-Johnson reading batteries, respectively. Auditory-related social cognition was assessed using measures of emotion/sarcasm recognition. Functional capacity and outcome were assessed using the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment and Specific Level of Functioning scale, respectively. fMRI resting-state functional-connectivity (rsFC) was used to evaluate potential underlying substrates. As predicted, SZ patients showed significant and interrelated deficits in both phonological processing (d\u2009=\u20090.74, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and reading fluency (d\u2009=\u20091.24, p\u2009<\u20090.00005). By contrast, single word reading (d\u2009=\u20090.35, p\u2009=\u20090.31) was intact. In SZ, deficits in EAP and phonological reading ability significantly predicted reduced functional capacity, but not functional outcome. By contrast, deficits in reading fluency significantly predicted impairments in both functional capacity and functional outcome. Moreover, deficits in reading fluency correlated with rsFC alterations among auditory thalamus, early auditory and auditory association regions. These findings indicate significant contributions of EAP deficits and functional connectivity changes in subcortical and early auditory regions to reductions in reading fluency, and of impaired reading ability to impaired functional outcome in SZ.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Auditory Perception", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reading", "Schizophrenia", "Thalamus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cl\u00e9ment", "Last Name": "Dond\u00e9", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1028; CNRS, UMR5292; Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Psychiatric Disorders: from Resistance to Response Team, Lyon, F-69000, France. clement.dondecoquelet@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Antigona", "Last Name": "Martinez", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pejman", "Last Name": "Sehatpour", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gaurav H", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Kraut", "Affiliation": "Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua T", "Last Name": "Kantrowitz", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Javitt", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA. dcj2113@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2019Nov05"}, {"PMID": "31492832", "Title": "Bimodal distribution of tone-matching deficits indicates discrete pathophysiological entities within the syndrome of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "To date, no measures are available that permit differentiation of discrete, clinically distinct subtypes of schizophrenia (SZ) with potential differential underlying pathophysiologies. Over recent years, there has been increasing recognition that SZ is heterogeneously associated with deficits in early auditory processing (EAP), as demonstrated using clinically applicable tasks such as tone-matching task (TMT). Here, we pooled TMT performances across 310 SZ individuals and 219 healthy controls (HC), along with clinical, cognitive, and resting-state functional-connectivity MRI (rsFC-MRI) measures. In addition, TMT was measured in a group of 24 patients at symptomatic clinical high risk (CHR) for SZ and 24 age-matched HC (age range 7-27 years). We provide the first demonstration that the EAP deficits are bimodally distributed across SZ subjects (P\u2009<\u20090.0001 vs. unimodal distribution), with one group showing entirely unimpaired TMT performance (SZ-EAP+), and a second showing an extremely large TMT impairment (SZ-EAP-), relative to both controls (d\u2009=\u20092.1) and SZ-EAP+ patients (d\u2009=\u20093.4). The SZ-EAP- group predominated among samples drawn from inpatient sites, showed higher levels of cognitive symptoms (PANSS), worse social cognition and a differential deficit in neurocognition (MATRICS battery), and reduced functional capacity. rsFC-MRI analyses showed significant reduction in SZ-EAP- relative to controls between subcortical and cortical auditory regions. As opposed to SZ, CHR patients showed intact EAP function. In HC age-matched to CHR, EAP ability was shown to increase across the age range of vulnerability preceding SZ onset. These results indicate that EAP measure segregates between discrete SZ subgroups. As TMT can be readily implemented within routine clinical settings, its use may be critical to account for the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes currently observed across SZ patients, as well as for pre-clinical detection and efficacious treatment selection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Brain", "Child", "Cognition", "Female", "Hearing Tests", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Memory", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Problem Solving", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Social Perception", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cl\u00e9ment", "Last Name": "Dond\u00e9", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1028; CNRS, UMR5292; Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Psychiatric Disorders: from Resistance to Response Team, Lyon, F-69000, France. clement.dondecoquelet@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Antigona", "Last Name": "Mart\u00ednez", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua T", "Last Name": "Kantrowitz", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gail", "Last Name": "Silipo", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisa C", "Last Name": "Dias", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gaurav H", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Deppartment of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Sanchez-Pe\u00f1a", "Affiliation": "Deppartment of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl M", "Last Name": "Corcoran", "Affiliation": "Deppartment of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Medalia", "Affiliation": "Deppartment of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alice", "Last Name": "Saperstein", "Affiliation": "Deppartment of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Blair", "Last Name": "Vail", "Affiliation": "Deppartment of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel C", "Last Name": "Javitt", "Affiliation": "Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA. dcj2113@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Translational psychiatry", "PubDate": "2019Sep06"}, {"PMID": "31301757", "Title": "Differential Patterns of Visual Sensory Alteration Underlying Face Emotion Recognition Impairment and Motion Perception Deficits in Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "Abstract": "Impaired face emotion recognition (FER) and abnormal motion processing are core features in schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that have been linked to atypical activity within the visual cortex.

In this review, we discuss how the expansion and rearrangement of the temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus (TPJ-pSTS) may have played a key role in the growth of human social abilities. Comparing the function and anatomy of the TPJ-pSTS in humans and macaques, which are thought to be separated by 25 million years of evolution, we find that the expansion of this region in humans has shifted the architecture of the dorsal and ventral processing streams. The TPJ-pSTS contains areas related to face-emotion processing, attention, theory of mind operations, and memory; its expansion has allowed for the elaboration and rearrangement of the cortical areas contained within, and potentially the introduction of new cortical areas. Based on the arrangement and the function of these areas in the human, we propose that the TPJ-pSTS is the basis of a third frontoparietal processing stream that underlies the increased social abilities in humans. We then describe a model of how the TPJ-pSTS areas interact as a hub that coordinates the activities of multiple brain networks in the exploration of the complex dynamic social scenes typical of the human social experience.", "Keywords": ["Default mode network", "Dorsal attention network", "Face-emotion processing", "Theory of mind", "Ventral attention network", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Attention", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Humans", "Nerve Net", "Theory of Mind"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gaurav H", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, USA.

However, 25 million years of evolution separate humans and macaques from their last common ancestor, and this has likely substantially impacted the function of the cortical networks underlying cognitive processes, such as attention. We examined the homology of frontoparietal networks underlying attention by comparing functional MRI data from macaques and humans performing the same visual search task. Although there are broad similarities, we found fundamental differences between the species. First, humans have more dorsal attention network areas than macaques, indicating that in the course of evolution the human attention system has expanded compared with macaques. Second, potentially homologous areas in the dorsal attention network have markedly different biases toward representing the contralateral hemifield, indicating that the underlying neural architecture of these areas may differ in the most basic of properties, such as receptive field distribution. Third, despite clear evidence of the temporoparietal junction node of the ventral attention network in humans as elicited by this visual search task, we did not find functional evidence of a temporoparietal junction in macaques. None of these differences were the result of differences in training, experimental power, or anatomical variability between the two species.
