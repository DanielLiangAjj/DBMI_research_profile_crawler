In murine models, aging-related changes in the hypothalamus, including microinflammation and gliosis, promote accelerated neurocognitive decline. We investigated relationships between hypothalamic microstructure and features of neurocognitive aging, including cortical thickness and cognition, in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults (age range 65-97 years, n=124). Hypothalamic microstructure was evaluated with two magnetic resonance imaging diffusion metrics: mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), using a novel image processing pipeline. Hypothalamic MD was cross-sectionally positively associated with age and it was negatively associated with cortical thickness. Hypothalamic FA, independent of cortical thickness, was cross-sectionally positively associated with neurocognitive scores. An exploratory analysis of longitudinal neurocognitive performance suggested that lower hypothalamic FA may predict cognitive decline. No associations between hypothalamic MD, age, and cortical thickness were identified in a younger control cohort (age range 18-63 years, n=99). To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that hypothalamic microstructure is associated with features of neurocognitive aging in humans.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "Cognition", "Cortical thickness", "Human", "Hypothalamus", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Aleksic", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Institute for Aging Research, Albert Einstein College of Medicine,\u00a0Bronx,\u00a0NY,\u00a0United States.

Here we report an unexpected role for oligodendroglial deficits in ANDS pathophysiology. We show that Anks1b-deficient mouse models display deficits in oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination, and Rac1 function, and recapitulate white matter abnormalities observed in ANDS patients. Selective loss of Anks1b from the oligodendrocyte lineage, but not from neuronal populations, leads to deficits in social preference and sensory reactivity previously observed in a brain-wide Anks1b haploinsufficiency model. Furthermore, we find that clemastine, an antihistamine shown to increase oligodendrocyte precursor cell maturation and central nervous system myelination, rescues deficits in social preference in 7-month-old Anks1b-deficient mice.

Animal studies of repetitive subconcussive head impacts are needed to begin to characterize the pathological basis and mechanisms underlying imaging and functional effects of repetitive subconcussive head impacts seen in humans. Since repetitive subconcussive head impacts have been largely unexplored in animals, we aimed to characterize the evolution of imaging, behavioural and pathological effects of repetitive subconcussive head impacts in awake adolescent rodents. Awake male and female Sprague Dawley rats (postnatal Day 35) received 140 closed-head impacts over the course of a week. Impacted and sham-impacted animals were restrained in a plastic cone, and unrestrained control animals were included to account for effects of restraint and normal development. Animals (n = 43) underwent repeated diffusion tensor imaging prior to and over 1 month following the final impact. A separate cohort (n = 53) was assessed behaviourally for fine motor control, emotional-affective behaviour and memory at acute and chronic time points. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses, which were exploratory in nature due to smaller sample sizes, were completed at 1 month following the final impact. All animals tolerated the protocol with no overt changes in behaviour or stigmata of traumatic brain injury, such as alteration of consciousness, intracranial haemorrhage or skull fracture. We detected longitudinal, sex-dependent diffusion tensor imaging changes (fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity decline) in corpus callosum and external capsule of repetitive subconcussive head impact animals, which diverged from both sham and control. Compared to sham animals, repetitive subconcussive head impact animals exhibited acute but transient mild motor deficits. Repetitive subconcussive head impact animals also exhibited chronic anxiety and spatial memory impairment that differed from the control animals, but these effects were not different from those seen in the sham condition. We observed trends in the data for thinning of the corpus callosum as well as regions with elevated Iba-1 in the corpus callosum and cerebral white matter among repetitive subconcussive head impact animals. While replication with larger study samples is needed, our findings suggest that subconcussive head impacts cause microstructural tissue changes in the developing rat brain, which are detectable with diffusion tensor imaging, with suggestion of correlates in tissue pathology and behaviour. The results point to potential mechanisms underpinning consequences of subconcussive head impacts that have been described in humans. The congruence of our imaging findings with human subconcussive head impacts suggests that neuroimaging could serve as a translational bridge to advance study of injury mechanisms and development of

"Identification of novel, non-invasive, non-cognitive based markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are a global priority. Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's pathology manifests in sensory association areas well before appearing in neural regions involved in higher-order cognitive functions, such as memory. Previous investigations have not comprehensively examined the interplay of sensory, cognitive, and motor dysfunction with relation to AD progression. The ability to successfully integrate multisensory information across multiple sensory modalities is a vital aspect of everyday functioning and mobility. Our research suggests that multisensory integration, specifically visual-somatosensory integration (VSI), could be used as a novel marker for preclinical AD given previously reported associations with important motor (balance, gait, and falls) and cognitive (attention) outcomes in aging. While the adverse effect of dementia and cognitive impairment on the relationship between multisensory functioning and motor outcomes has been highlighted, the underlying functional and neuroanatomical networks are still unknown. In what follows we detail the protocol for our study, named The VSI Study, which is strategically designed to determine whether preclinical AD is associated with neural disruptions in subcortical and cortical areas that concurrently modulate multisensory, cognitive, and motor functions resulting in mobility decline. In this longitudinal observational study, a total of 208 community-dwelling older adults with and without preclinical AD will be recruited and monitored yearly.

Methods: This is a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients. CXR scores of disease severity were analyzed for: (i) survivors (N = 224) versus non-survivors (N = 28) in the general floor group, and (ii) survivors (N = 92) versus non-survivors (N = 56) in the invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) group. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare survivors and non-survivors and between time points. Comparison across multiple time points used repeated measures ANOVA and corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: For general-floor patients, non-survivor CXR scores were significantly worse at admission compared to those of survivors (p < 0.05), and non-survivor CXR scores deteriorated at outcome (p < 0.05) whereas survivor CXR scores did not (p > 0.05). For IMV patients, survivor and non-survivor CXR scores were similar at intubation (p > 0.05), and both improved at outcome (p < 0.05), with survivor scores showing greater improvement (p < 0.05). Hospitalization and IMV duration were not different between groups (p > 0.05). CXR scores were significantly correlated with lactate dehydrogenase, respiratory rate, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, SpO2, and lymphocyte count (p < 0.05).

Voxelwise linear regression, comparing soccer players and non-contact/non-collision sports athletes healthy,non-athlete controls, identified regions of abnormally low and high fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) in athlete participants. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the effects of 2 week and 1 year heading exposure quartile on cognitive performance and on the volume of each high and each low DTI parameter. Athletes with no or lower exposure to repetitive heading exhibited greater expression of low RD, greater expression of high FA and better performance on tasks of attention, processing speed, verbal memory, and working memory compared to non-athletes. Soccer players with the highest exposure to repetitive head impacts, however, did not differ significantly from healthy, non-athletes on either micro-structural features or cognitive performance, findings not explained by concussion history or demographic factors.

Although most patients recover, a substantial minority suffers chronic disability. The mechanisms underlying mTBI-related detrimental effects remain poorly understood. Although animal models contribute valuable preclinical information and improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms following mTBI, only few studies have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the evolution of axonal injury following mTBI in rodents. It is known that DTI shows changes after human concussion and the role of delineating imaging findings in animals is therefore to facilitate understanding of related mechanisms. In this work, we used a rodent model of mTBI to investigate longitudinal indices of axonal injury. We present the results of 45 animals that received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at multiple time points over a 2-week period following concussive or sham injury yielding 109 serial observations. Overall, the evolution of DTI metrics following concussive or sham injury differed by group. Diffusion tensor imaging changes within the white matter were most noticeable 1\u2009week following injury and returned to baseline values after 2\u2009weeks. More specifically, we observed increased fractional anisotropy in combination with decreased radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity, in the absence of changes in axial diffusivity, within the white matter of the genu corpus callosum at 1\u2009week post-injury. Our study shows that DTI can detect microstructural white matter changes in the absence of gross abnormalities as indicated by visual screening of anatomical MRI and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections in a clinically relevant animal model of mTBI.

These devices have a common design theme and include the following components: (a) a pulse generator that houses the battery and control electronics, (b) an insulated lead or wire that conveys signals to the last component, which is (c) an electrode that contacts the end organ and senses and/or acts on the end organ. DBS electrodes are inserted into various deep gray nuclei, most commonly to treat the symptoms of movement disorders. Occipital, trigeminal, and spinal nerve stimulation devices are used as second-line therapy to control craniofacial or back pain. For cardiac devices, the authors describe two newer devices, the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator and the leadless pacemaker, both of which avoid complications related to having leads threaded through the venous system. Diaphragmatic stimulation devices stimulate the phrenic nerve to restore diaphragmatic movement. Gastric electrical stimulation devices act on various parts of the stomach for the treatment of gastroparesis or obesity. Finally, SNS devices are used to modulate urinary and defecatory functions.

To date, it remains unknown if two common analytic techniques, region of interest (ROI) versus voxel-wise (VW) analyses, detect injury in similar locations. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to directly compare the regions of abnormality elucidated by each method. Twenty-seven ROI and 11 VW studies met our inclusion criteria. Our ROI meta-analysis identified 11 regions, including the splenium of the corpus callosum, where fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly decreased in TBI patients, compared with controls. Likewise, we identified higher mean diffusivity/apparent diffusivity constant in the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum. Alternatively, our VW analysis identified one region of high FA in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and seven regions of low FA, with the two largest located in the corpus callosum. High mean diffusivity and high radial diffusivity, both in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, also was revealed by our VW analysis. Moreover, we have shown that the magnitude of damage in the corpus callosum revealed by ROI analysis (z\u2009=\u2009-3.15) is greater than that demonstrated by VW analysis (z\u2009=\u2009-1.41). Overall, this study indicates that both ROI and VW analytic methods are sensitive to low FA in the corpus callosum; however, the ROI method has more power to detect the full extent of tissue abnormality in the corpus callosum.

Materials and Methods In this prospective cross-sectional study, 98 individuals who were enrolled in a larger prospective study of amateur soccer players (from 2013 to 2016) were matched 1:1 for age and history of soccer heading in the prior 12 months. Among the subjects, 49 men (mean age, 25.7 years; range, 18-50 years) and 49 women (mean age, 25.8 years; range, 18-50 years) with median total soccer headings per year of 487 and 469, respectively, underwent 3.0-T DTI. Images were registered to the Johns Hopkins University template. A voxelwise linear regression was fitted for FA with terms for the number of headings during the previous 12 months and its interaction with sex after controlling for the following potential confounders: age, years of education, number of lifetime concussions, and handedness. In the resulting statistical maps, P < .01 indicated a statistically significant difference, with a threshold cluster size larger than 100 mm3. Results Among men, three regions were identified in which greater heading exposure was associated with lower FA; eight such regions were identified among women (>100 contiguous voxels, P < .01). In seven of the eight regions identified in women, the association between heading and FA was stronger in women than in men. There was no significant difference of heading with FA between the sexes for any region in which heading was associated with FA among men (P > .01, <100 contiguous voxels). Conclusion With similar exposure to heading, women exhibit more widespread evidence of microstructural white matter alteration than do men, suggesting preliminary support for a biologic divergence of brain response to repetitive trauma. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anisotropy", "Athletes", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging", "Prospective Studies", "Sex Factors", "Soccer", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Todd G", "Last Name": "Rubin", "Affiliation": "From the Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center, Department of Radiology (T.G.R., R.F., L.E.H., N.L., M.L.L.), Departments of Epidemiology and Population Health (M.K., R.B.L.), Neurology (R.B.L.), and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences (M.L.L.), and the Dominick P.

The aim of this collaboration was to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical research studies and clinical treatment outcomes, increase data quality, facilitate data sharing across studies, reduce study start-up time, more effectively aggregate information into metadata results, and educate new clinical investigators. The SRC CDE Working Group consisted of 32 worldwide experts in concussion from varied fields of related expertise divided into three Subgroups: Acute (<72\u2009h post-concussion), Subacute (3 days-3 months post-concussion) and Persistent/Chronic (>3 months post-concussion). To develop CDEs, the Subgroups reviewed various domains, then selected from, refined, and added to existing CDEs, case report forms and field-tested data elements from national registries and funded research studies. Recommendations were posted to the NINDS CDE Website for Public Review from February 2017 to April 2017. Following an internal Working Group review of recommendations, along with consideration of comments received from the Public Review period, the first iteration (Version 1.0) of the NINDS SRC CDEs was completed in June 2017. The recommendations include Core and Supplemental-Highly Recommended CDEs for cognitive data elements and symptom checklists, as well as other outcomes and end-points (e.g., vestibular, oculomotor, balance, anxiety, depression), and sample case report forms (e.g., injury reporting, demographics, concussion history) for domains typically included in clinical research studies. The NINDS SRC CDEs and supporting documents are publicly available on the NINDS CDE website www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov .

All patients were clinically stable, had undergone CSF shunt placement before 2 years of age, and had a documented history of complaints of headaches. Outcome was scored based on the Headache Disability Inventory and the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and other DTI-based measures (axial, radial, and mean diffusivity; AD, RD, and MD, respectively) were extracted in the corpus callosum and internal capsule with manual region-of-interest delineation and in other regions with TBSS. Paired t-tests, corrected with a 5% false discovery rate, were used to identify regions with significant differences between patients and controls. Within the patient group, linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between FA or ventricular volume and outcome, as well as the effect of shunt-related covariates.RESULTSTwenty-one hydrocephalus patients and 21 matched controls completed the study, and their data were used in the final analysis. The authors found significantly lower FA for patients than for controls in 20 of the 48 regions, mostly posterior white matter structures, in periventricular as well as more distal tracts. Of these 20 regions, 17 demonstrated increased RD, while only 5 showed increased MD and 3 showed decreased AD. No areas of increased FA were observed. Higher FA in specific periventricular white matter tracts, tending toward FA in controls, was associated with increased ventricular size, as well as improved clinical outcome.CONCLUSIONSThe study shows that TBSS-based DTI is a sensitive technique for elucidating changes in white matter structures due to hydrocephalus and chronic CSF shunting and provides preliminary evidence that DTI may be a valuable tool for tailoring shunt procedures to monitor ventricular size following shunting and achieve optimal outcome, as well as for guiding the development of alternate therapies for hydrocephalus.", "Keywords": ["AD = axial diffusivity", "ALIC = anterior limb of internal capsule", "CGC = cingulate gyrus component of the cingulum", "CGH = hippocampal component of the cingulum", "DTI = diffusion tensor imaging", "FA = fractional anisotropy", "FDR = false discovery rate", "FOHR = frontal occipital horn ratio", "HDI = Headache Disability Inventory", "HOQ = Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire", "ICP = intracranial pressure", "MD = mean diffusivity", "NPH = normal pressure hydrocephalus", "PLIC = posterior limb of internal capsule", "PVWM = periventricular white matter", "QoL = quality of life", "RD = radial diffusivity", "ROI = region of interest", "SVS = slit ventricle syndrome", "TBSS = tract-based spatial statistics", "chronic shunting", "diagnostic technique", "diffusion tensor imaging", "gCC = genu of corpus callosum", "headache", "pediatric hydrocephalus", "quality of life", "sCC = splenium of corpus callosum", "tract-based spatial statistics"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebral Ventricles", "Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts", "Child", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kristy", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "1Department of Radiology, Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and."}, {"First Name": "Avital", "Last Name": "Meiri", "Affiliation": "1Department of Radiology, Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and."}, {"First Name": "Wenzhu B", "Last Name": "Mowrey", "Affiliation": "Departments of2Epidemiology and Population Health."}, {"First Name": "Rick", "Last Name": "Abbott", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurological Surgery, Children's Hospital at Montefiore; and."}, {"First Name": "James T", "Last Name": "Goodrich", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurological Surgery, Children's Hospital at Montefiore; and."}, {"First Name": "Adam L", "Last Name": "Sandler", "Affiliation": "3Department of Neurological Surgery, Children's Hospital at Montefiore; and."}, {"First Name": "Asif K", "Last Name": "Suri", "Affiliation": "1Department of Radiology, Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Lipton", "Affiliation": "1Department of Radiology, Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and."}, {"First Name": "Mark E", "Last Name": "Wagshul", "Affiliation": "1Department of Radiology, Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "PubDate": "2018Dec01"}, {"PMID": "29158187", "Title": "White matter structural integrity and transcranial Doppler blood flow pulsatility in normal aging.", "Abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases underlie many forms of age-related cognitive impairment and the mechanism linking the two is hypothesized to involve adverse changes in white matter (WM) integrity. Despite being systemic, small vessel disease does not uniformly affect WM. We performed voxel-wise analysis of MRI images to examine the association between fractional anisotropy (FA) - a diffusion tensor measure of WM structural integrity - and pulsatility index (PI) - a transcranial Doppler ultrasound measure of abnormal arterial flow - in adults over the age of 70years who were free of stroke and dementia. We demonstrate that the relation of PI to microstructural changes in WM is artery specific and regional. We identified spatial clusters of significant correlations between elevated PI and reduced FA which cannot be explained by aging, supporting a vascular hypothesis of WM injury. These areas are not limited to the vascular territories of the vessels where PI is assessed, suggesting that the linkage between PI and FA is not likely a function of perfusion per se, but is consistent with injury caused by mechanical wave emanating from pulsating vessel walls.", "Keywords": ["Aging", "DTI", "Fractional anisotropy", "Pulsatility index", "TCD", "White matter structural integrity"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Anisotropy", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Stroke", "Ultrasonography, Doppler", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roman", "Last Name": "Fleysher", "Affiliation": "The Gruss Magnetic Resonance Research Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, United States; Department of Radiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, United States.

Normally, a brain atlas is chosen as the template. Limitations in the registration process result in persistent differences between individual subject brains and template, which can be a source of error in an analysis. We propose a new approach to the registration process where the subject of interest is the registration template. Through this change, we eliminate errors due to differences between a brain template and a subject's brain. We applied this method to the analysis of FA values derived from DTI data of 20 individual mTBI patients as compared to 48 healthy controls. Subject-centered analysis resulted in identification of significantly fewer regions of abnormally low FA compared to two separate atlas-centered analyses, with subject-centered abnormalities essentially representing the common subset of abnormal low FA regions detected by the two atlas-centered methods. Whereas each atlas-centered approach demonstrated abnormalities in nearly every subject (19/20 and 20/20), the subject-centered approach demonstrated abnormalities in fewer than half the subjects (9/20). This reduction of diffusion abnormalities observed using the subject-centered approach is due to elimination of misregistration errors that occur when registering the subject of interest to a template. Evaluation of atlas-centered analyses demonstrated that 9.8% to 13.3% of subject GM and CSF was misregistered onto the WM of the brain atlas, resulting in the observation of additional low FA clusters compared to the subject-centered approach. Without careful evaluation, these misregistrations could be misinterpreted as pathology.

There is also continuing disagreement over the more fundamental questions of which cortical layers generate \u03b1 rhythms and whether the generation of \u03b1 is equivalent across sensory systems. To address these latter questions, we analyzed laminar profiles of local field potentials (LFPs) and concomitant multiunit activity (MUA) from macaque V1, S1, and A1 during both spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Current source density (CSD) analysis of laminar LFP profiles revealed \u03b1 current generators in the supragranular, granular, and infragranular layers. MUA phase-locked to local current source/sink configurations confirmed that \u03b1 rhythms index local neuronal excitability fluctuations. CSD-defined \u03b1 generators were strongest in the supragranular layers, whereas LFP \u03b1 power was greatest in the infragranular layers, consistent with some of the previous reports. The discrepancy between LFP and CSD findings appears to be attributable to contamination of the infragranular LFP signal by activity that is volume-conducted from the stronger supragranular \u03b1 generators. The presence of \u03b1 generators across cortical depth in V1, S1, and A1 suggests the involvement of \u03b1 in feedforward as well as feedback processes and is consistent with the view that \u03b1 rhythms, perhaps in addition to a role in sensory inhibition, may parse sensory input streams in a way that facilitates communication across cortical areas.", "Keywords": ["auditory", "laminar", "somatosensory", "visual", "\u03b1 rhythm"], "MeSH terms": ["Analysis of Variance", "Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Macaca", "Male", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Periodicity", "Physical Stimulation", "Spectrum Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Saskia", "Last Name": "Haegens", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, Cognitive Neuroscience and Schizophrenia Program, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, New York 10962, shaegens@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Annamaria", "Last Name": "Barczak", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience and Schizophrenia Program, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, New York 10962, Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016."}, {"First Name": "Gabriella", "Last Name": "Musacchia", "Affiliation": "Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94303, Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Lipton", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, and."}, {"First Name": "Ashesh D", "Last Name": "Mehta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine and Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Lakatos", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience and Schizophrenia Program, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, New York 10962, Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016."}, {"First Name": "Charles E", "Last Name": "Schroeder", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, Cognitive Neuroscience and Schizophrenia Program, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, New York 10962."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2015Oct21"}, {"PMID": "26424564", "Title": "Hippocampal volume and cingulum bundle fractional anisotropy are independently associated with verbal memory in older adults.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) volumetrics as well as fractional anisotropy of the cingulum angular bundle (CAB) and the cingulum cingulate gyrus (CCG) bundle to performance on measures of verbal memory in non-demented older adults.

Relationships between atrophy of these structures and regional cingulum fractional anisotropy were also explored. Decreased HIP volume on the left and decreased fractional anisotropy of left CAB were associated with lower memory performance. Volume changes in ERC, PCC and CCG disruption were not associated with memory performance. In regression models, left HIP volume and left CAB-FA were each independently associated with episodic memory.

However, MRI acquisitions tend to be slow, limiting patient throughput and limiting potential indications for use while driving up costs. Compressed sensing (CS) is a method for accelerating MRI acquisition by acquiring less data through undersampling of k-space. This has the potential to mitigate the time-intensiveness of MRI. The limited body of research evaluating the effects of CS on MR images has been mostly positive with regards to its potential as a clinical tool. Studies have successfully accelerated MRI with this technology, with varying degrees of success. However, more must be performed before its diagnostic efficacy and benefits are clear. Studies involving a greater number radiologists and images must be completed, rating CS based on its diagnostic efficacy.

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and chronic pain in nondemented older adults. The study sample included 86 community-residing adults age 70 or older who were free of dementia and recruited from the Einstein Aging Study. Chronic pain was defined as pain over the last 3 months, that was moderate or severe (minimum rating of 4 out of 10) most, or all of the time. Hippocampal subfield volumes were estimated using FreeSurfer software. We modeled the association between chronic pain and hippocampal and subfield volume using linear regression. The sample had a mean age of 80 and was 58% female. Chronic pain, present in 55% of the sample, was associated with smaller right and total hippocampal volumes, particularly in women, after adjusting for age, education, and intracranial volume (eTICV). In addition, in women, volume was significantly reduced in participants with chronic pain in right CA2-3 (\u03b2=-0.35, p=0.010), right CA4-DG (\u03b2=-0.35, p=0.011), left presubiculum (\u03b2=-0.29, p=0.030), and left fimbria (\u03b2=-0.30, p=0.023). In men, chronic pain was not associated with the volume of any of the hippocampal subfield volumes.
