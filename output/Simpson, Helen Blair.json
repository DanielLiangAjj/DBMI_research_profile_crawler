[{"PMID": "38572246", "Title": "Assessing harmonized intelligence measures in a multinational study.", "Abstract": "Studies examining the neurocognitive and circuit-based etiology of psychiatric illness are moving toward inclusive, global designs. A potential confounding effect of these associations is general intelligence; however, an internationally validated, harmonized intelligence quotient (IQ) measure is not available. We describe the procedures used to measure IQ across a five-site, multinational study and demonstrate the harmonized measure's cross-site validity. Culturally appropriate intelligence measures were selected: four short-form Wechsler intelligence tests (Brazil, Netherlands, South Africa, United States) and the Binet Kamat (India). Analyses included IQ scores from 255 healthy participants (age 18-50; 42% male). Regression analyses tested between-site differences in IQ scores, as well as expected associations with sociodemographic factors (sex, socioeconomic status, education) to assess validity. Harmonization (e.g., a priori selection of tests) yielded the compatibility of IQ measures. Higher IQ was associated with higher socioeconomic status, suggesting good convergent validity. No association was found between sex and IQ at any site, suggesting good discriminant validity. Associations between higher IQ and higher years of education were found at all sites except the United States. Harmonized IQ scores provide a measure of IQ with evidence of good validity that can be used in neurocognitive and circuit-based studies to control for intelligence across global sites.", "Keywords":

"Abstract": "White matter pathways, typically studied with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have been implicated in the neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, due to limited sample sizes and the predominance of single-site studies, the generalizability of OCD classification based on diffusion white matter estimates remains unclear. Here, we tested classification accuracy using the largest OCD DTI dataset to date, involving 1336 adult participants (690 OCD patients and 646 healthy controls) and 317 pediatric participants (175 OCD patients and 142 healthy controls) from 18 international sites within the ENIGMA OCD Working Group. We used an automatic machine learning pipeline (with feature engineering and selection, and model optimization) and examined the cross-site generalizability of the OCD classification models using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Our models showed low-to-moderate accuracy in classifying (1) \"OCD vs. healthy controls\" (Adults, receiver operator characteristic-area under the curve\u2009=\u200957.19\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47 in the replication set; Children, 59.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.39), (2) \"unmedicated OCD vs. healthy controls\" (Adults, 62.67\u2009\u00b1\u20093.84; Children, 48.51\u2009\u00b1\u200910.14), and (3) \"medicated OCD vs. unmedicated OCD\" (Adults, 76.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.97; Children, 72.45\u2009\u00b1\u20098.87). There was significant site variability in model performance (cross-validated ROC AUC ranges 51.6-79.1 in adults; 35.9-63.2 in children). Machine learning interpretation showed that diffusivity measures of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and posterior thalamic radiation contributed to the classification of OCD from HC. The classification performance appeared greater than the model trained on grey matter morphometry in the prior ENIGMA OCD study (our study includes subsamples from the morphometry study). Taken together, this study points to the meaningful multivariate patterns of white matter features relevant to the neurobiology of OCD, but with low-to-moderate classification accuracy. The OCD classification performance may be constrained by site variability and medication effects on the white matter integrity, indicating room for improvement for future research.", "Keywords": [],

mixed findings on white matter microstructure alterations in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), likely due to variation in demographic and clinical characteristics, scanning methods, and underpowered samples. The OCD global study was created across five international sites to overcome these challenges by harmonizing data collection to identify consistent brain signatures of OCD that are reproducible and generalizable. Single-shell diffusion measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy), multi-shell Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and fixel-based measures, were extracted from skeletonized white matter tracts in 260 medication-free adults with OCD and 252 healthy controls. We additionally performed structural connectome analysis. We compared cases with controls and cases with early (<18) versus late (18+) OCD onset using mixed-model and Bayesian multilevel analysis. Compared with healthy controls, adult OCD individuals showed higher fiber density in the sagittal stratum (B[SE]\u2009=\u20090.10[0.05], P\u2009=\u20090.04) and credible evidence for higher fiber density in several other tracts. When comparing early (n\u2009=\u2009145) and late-onset (n\u2009=\u2009114) cases, converging evidence showed lower integrity of the posterior thalamic radiation -particularly radial diffusivity (B[SE]\u2009=\u20090.28[0.12], P\u2009=\u20090.03)-and lower global efficiency of the structural connectome (B[SE]\u2009=\u200915.3[6.6], P\u2009=\u20090.03) in late-onset cases. Post-hoc analyses indicated divergent direction of effects of the two OCD groups compared to healthy controls. Age of OCD onset differentially affects the integrity of thalamo-parietal/occipital tracts and the efficiency of the structural brain network. These results lend further support for the role of the thalamus and its afferent fibers and visual attentional processes in the pathophysiology of OCD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans",

Little research has studied whether EX/RP predictors may differ in medicated versus non-medicated samples (i.e., medication status as a moderator). We pooled data from two clinical trials conducted concurrently in the same specialty OCD clinic. One enrolled patients who were on stable SRI doses (EX/RP as SRI augmentation, n=58) while the other enrolled non-medicated patients (EX/RP monotherapy, n=38). Both trials used the same manualized EX/RP protocol and blinded independent evaluators. LASSO regression derived predictors and moderators of outcome. Improvement did not significantly differ between the EX/RP alone group and the SRI+EX/RP group. In both groups, higher baseline OCD severity and worse quality of life predicted poorer outcome. OCPD traits moderated results: Patients with more severe OCPD traits had better outcomes from EX/RP monotherapy than those receiving EX/RP with SRIs.

Yet, not all patients benefit equally from EX/RP. Prior studies have examined EX/RP predictors by predicting endpoint symptoms and/or pre-post symptom change, rather than accounting for trajectories of symptom change across treatment. We pooled data from four NIMH-funded clinical trials, yielding a large sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0334) of adults who received a standard course of manualized EX/RP. Independent evaluators rated OCD severity using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Data were analyzed using growth mixture modeling (GMM) to detect subgroups of participants with similar trajectories of symptom change followed by multinomial logistic regression to identify baseline variables capable of predicting class membership. GMM revealed three distinct trajectory classes: 22.5% of the sample showed dramatic improvement (dramatic progress class), 52.1% showed moderate improvement (moderate progress class), and 25.4% showed little change (little to no progress class). Membership in the little to no progress class was predicted by baseline avoidance and transdiagnostic internalizing factor levels. These findings suggest that OCD symptom improvement with outpatient EX/RP occurs via distinct trajectories.

OCD is heterogeneous in its clinical presentation and not all patients respond to first-line treatments. Several neurocircuit models of OCD have been proposed with the aim of providing a better understanding of the neural and cognitive mechanisms involved in the disorder. These models use advances in neuroscience and findings from neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies to suggest links between clinical profiles that reflect the symptoms and experiences of patients and dysfunctions in specific neurocircuits. Several models propose that treatments for OCD could be improved if directed to specific neurocircuit dysfunctions, thereby restoring efficient neurocognitive function and ameliorating the symptomatology of each associated clinical profile. Yet, there are several important limitations to neurocircuit models of OCD. The purpose of the current review is to highlight some of these limitations, including issues related to the complexity of brain and cognitive function, the clinical presentation and course of OCD, etiological factors, and treatment methods proposed by the models.

We defined LTT as the time lag between the awareness of discomfort and/or impairment caused by symptoms and the beginning of OCD-specific treatment. To determine the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associated with LTT, we built an interval-censored survival model to simultaneously assess the relationship between all variables, representing the best fit to our data format. The results of our study showed that approximately one-third of OCD patients sought treatment within two years of symptom awareness, one-third between two and nine years, and one-third after ten or more years. Median LTT was 4.0 years (mean\u00a0=\u00a07.96, SD\u00a0=\u00a09.54). Longer LTT was associated with older age, early onset of OCD symptoms, presence of contamination/cleaning symptoms and full-time employment. Shorter LTT was associated with the presence of aggression symptoms and comorbidity with hypochondriasis. The results of our study confirm the understanding that LTT in OCD is influenced by several interdependent variables - some of which are modifiable.

Our research center, which specializes in studying and treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), historically has provided in-person exposure and response prevention (ERP) to adults with OCD, but shifted to telehealth during the pandemic. Unlike in other modes of talk therapy, ERP's emphasis on therapist-supervised exposures presented unique opportunities and challenges to delivering treatment entirely via a virtual platform. This paper provides case examples to illustrate lessons we learned delivering ERP exclusively via telehealth in New York from March 2020 through June 2021 and offers recommendations for future study and practice. Though we observed a number of drawbacks to fully remote ERP, we also discovered advantages to delivering ERP this way, meriting additional research attention.", "Keywords": ["exposure and response prevention (ERP)", "obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)", "remotely delivered therapy", "telehealth"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dianne M", "Last Name": "Hezel", "Affiliation": "Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "Amy M", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "Shannon", "Last Name": "Glasgow", "Affiliation": "Stony Brook University."}, {"First Name": "Gail", "Last Name": "Cridland", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute."}], "Journal": "Cognitive and behavioral practice", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "35190533", "Title": "The thalamus and its subnuclei-a gateway to obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Larger thalamic volume has been found in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and children with clinical-level symptoms within the general population. Particular thalamic subregions may drive these differences. The ENIGMA-OCD working group conducted mega- and meta-analyses to study thalamic subregional volume in OCD across the lifespan. Structural T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 2649 OCD patients and 2774 healthy controls across 29 sites (50 datasets) were processed using the FreeSurfer built-in ThalamicNuclei pipeline to extract five thalamic subregions. Volume measures were harmonized for site effects using ComBat before running separate multiple linear regression models for children, adolescents, and adults to estimate volumetric group differences. All analyses were pre-registered ( https://osf.io/73dvy ) and adjusted for age, sex and intracranial volume. Unmedicated pediatric OCD patients (<12 years) had larger lateral (d\u2009=\u20090.46), pulvinar (d\u2009=\u20090.33), ventral (d\u2009=\u20090.35) and whole thalamus (d\u2009=\u20090.40) volumes at unadjusted p-values <0.05. Adolescent patients showed no volumetric differences. Adult OCD patients compared with controls had smaller volumes across all subregions (anterior, lateral, pulvinar, medial, and ventral) and smaller whole thalamic volume (d\u2009=\u2009-0.15 to -0.07) after multiple comparisons correction, mostly driven by medicated patients and associated with symptom severity. The anterior thalamus was also significantly smaller in patients after adjusting for thalamus size. Our results suggest that OCD-related thalamic volume differences are global and not driven by particular subregions and that the direction of effects are driven by both age and medication status.",

Evidence-based treatments can benefit many; however, optimal treatment can be difficult to access. Diagnosis is frequently delayed, and pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions often fail to follow evidence-based guidelines. To ameliorate this distressing situation, the International OCD Accreditation Task Force of the Canadian Institute for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders has developed knowledge and competency standards for specialized treatments for OCD through the lifespan. These are foundational to evidence-based practice and will form the basis for upcoming ATF development of certification/accreditation programs. Here, we present specialty standards for the pharmacological treatment of adult OCD. We emphasize the importance of integrating pharmacotherapy with clear diagnosis, appreciation of complicating factors, and evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy. Clear evidence exists to inform first- and second-line pharmacological treatments. In disease refractory to these initial efforts, multiple strategies have been investigated, but the evidence is more equivocal. These standards summarize this limited evidence to give the specialist practitioner a solid basis on which to make difficult decisions in complex cases.

We identified 64 studies from 1990 to 2020 comparing pretreatment and post-treatment imaging of patients with OCD, including metabolic and perfusion, neurochemical, structural, functional and connectivity-based modalities. Treatment class included pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy/exposure and response prevention, stereotactic lesions, deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Changes in several brain regions are consistent and correspond with treatment response despite the heterogeneity in treatments and neuroimaging modalities. Most notable are decreases in metabolism and perfusion of the caudate, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus and regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC). Modulating activity within regions of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical system may be a common therapeutic mechanism across treatments.

Here we investigated microstructural white matter alterations and their relation to clinical features in the largest dataset of adult and pediatric OCD to date. We analyzed diffusion tensor imaging metrics from 700 adult patients and 645 adult controls, as well as 174 pediatric patients and 144 pediatric controls across 19 sites participating in the ENIGMA OCD Working Group, in a cross-sectional case-control magnetic resonance study. We extracted measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) as main outcome, and mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity as secondary outcomes for 25 white matter regions. We meta-analyzed patient-control group differences (Cohen's d) across sites, after adjusting for age and sex, and investigated associations with clinical characteristics. Adult OCD patients showed significant FA reduction in the sagittal stratum (d\u2009=\u2009-0.21, z\u2009=\u2009-3.21, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and posterior thalamic radiation (d\u2009=\u2009-0.26, z\u2009=\u2009-4.57, p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

purported to treat anxiety and various other psychiatric symptoms. Yet support for using cannabis as a psychiatric treatment is currently limited by a lack of evidence from rigorous placebo-controlled studies. While regulatory hurdles and other barriers make clinical trials of cannabis challenging to conduct, addiction researchers have decades of experience studying cannabis use in human laboratory models. These include methods to control cannabis administration, to delineate clinical and mechanistic aspects of cannabis use, and to evaluate potential treatment applications for cannabis and its constituents. In this paper, we review these human laboratory procedures and describe how each can be applied to study cannabis use in patients with psychiatric disorders. Because anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric illnesses affecting American adults, and anxiety relief is also the most commonly-reported reason for medicinal cannabis use, we focus particularly on applying human laboratory models to study cannabis effects in individuals with anxiety and related disorders. Finally, we discuss how these methods can be integrated to study cannabis effects in other psychiatric conditions and guide future research in this area.", "Keywords": ["anxiety disorders", "cannabinoids", "cannabis (marijuana)", "clinical and translational research", "human laboratory research", "psychiatric disorders"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Reilly R", "Last Name": "Kayser", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "Haney", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Helen Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychiatry", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33659962", "Title": "Cutting-edge genetics in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "This article reviews recent advances in the genetics of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Findings from this work underscore the notion that the genetic architecture of OCD is highly complex and shared with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Also, the latest evidence points to the participation of gene networks involved in synaptic transmission, neurodevelopment, and the immune and inflammatory systems in this disorder. We conclude by highlighting that further study of the genetic architecture of OCD, a great part of which remains to be elucidated, could benefit the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches based on the biological basis of the disorder. Studies to date revealed that OCD is not a simple homogeneous entity, but rather that the underlying biological pathways are variable and heterogenous.

In the last several decades, exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) has emerged as one of the most evidence-based treatments for adult and pediatric OCD. Recommended as a first-line treatment in practice guidelines for OCD, EX/RP, when expertly delivered, can be superior to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medications alone and superior to adding antipsychotic medication to augment SRI treatment response. Despite a robust evidence base, EX/RP is not widely available. Moreover, although effective, only about half of patients who receive a standard course of EX/RP will achieve remission.This chapter will review innovations in delivering EX/RP, focusing on technology-based methods designed to increase access to EX/RP and translational neuroscience approaches to personalizing and optimizing EX/RP. Technology-based innovations to deliver EX/RP include video conferencing, internet-based treatment, and smartphone apps. Of these, internet-based, clinician-supported treatment has the most evidence base to date. Relevant to all technology-based innovations are the need for advances in the ethical, regulatory and financial aspects of understanding how access to EX/RP may be delivered to individuals of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in accordance with professional standards and regulations and covered by healthcare.Advances in our understanding of the neural processes underlying learning and memory have led to new ways to combine EX/RP with medications, behavioral interventions, or neuromodulatory methods, with the goal of enhancing the functioning of brain circuits that subserve fear processing and cognitive control. Among the pharmacological approaches to enhancing EX/RP outcome, both ketamine and cannabinoids show promise in small open trials but are in need of further study. Studies to train cognitive control are at an early stage of development yet provide preliminary evidence that training neural processes may be a new path to personalize treatment. How best to combine EX/RP with different types of neuromodulation is being actively studied.Together these innovations in the delivery of EX/RP for OCD hold great promise for improving outcomes of care for individuals with OCD by increasing the availability and the individual treatment effects of this already effective treatment.", "Keywords": ["Exposure and response prevention", "Technology-based interventions", "Translational neuroscience"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Behavior Therapy", "Child", "Humans", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sapana R", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Comer", "Affiliation": "Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, The New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA.

Therefore, we analyzed predictors of outcome in an open trial (n=30) of ICBT for OCD using the OCD-NET platform, which consists of 10 online modules delivered with therapist support. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) was administered by independent raters as the primary outcome measure at baseline and posttreatment.

Few studies have assessed functional connectivity within or between networks across the whole brain in unmedicated OCD patients or how patterns of connectivity predict response to exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) therapy, a first-line treatment for OCD. Herein, multiband resting-state functional MRI scans were collected from unmedicated, adult patients with OCD (n\u2009=\u200941) and healthy participants (n\u2009=\u200936); OCD patients were then offered twice weekly EX/RP (17 sessions). A whole-brain-network-based statistic approach was used to identify group differences in resting-state connectivity. We detected altered pre-treatment functional connectivity between task-positive regions in the temporal gyri (middle and superior) and regions of the cingulo-opercular and default networks in individuals with OCD. Signal extraction was performed using a reconstruction independent components analysis and isolated two independent subcomponents (IC1 and IC2) within this altered connectivity. In the OCD group, linear mixed-effects models tested whether IC1 or IC2 values predicted the slope of change in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores across EX/RP treatment. Lower (more different from controls) IC2 score significantly predicted greater symptom reduction with EX/RP (Bonferroni-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.002).

Although evidence-based pharmacotherapies exist, currently available medications are ineffective in some patients and may cause intolerable side effects in others. There is an urgent need for new treatments. Discussion: A growing body of basic and clinical research has showed that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a role in anxiety, fear, and repetitive behaviors. At the same time, some patients with OCD who smoke cannabis anecdotally report that it relieves their symptoms and mitigates anxiety, and several case reports describe patients whose OCD symptoms improved after they were treated with cannabinoids. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ECS could be a potential target for novel medications for OCD. In this study, we review evidence from both animal and human studies that suggests that the ECS may play a role in OCD and related disorders. We also describe findings from studies in which cannabinoid drugs were shown to impact symptoms of these conditions. Conclusions: An emerging body of evidence suggests that the ECS plays a role in OCD symptoms and may be a target for the development of novel medications. Further exploration of this topic through well-designed human trials is warranted.", "Keywords": ["OCD", "anxiety", "cannabinoid", "endocannabinoid system", "repetitive behavior"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Reilly R", "Last Name": "Kayser", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ivar", "Last Name": "Snorrason", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Margaret", "Last Name": "Haney", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Francis S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cannabis and cannabinoid research", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "32560926", "Title": "Accuracy of diagnostic judgments using ICD-11 vs. ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.", "Abstract": "We report results of an internet-based field study evaluating the diagnostic guidelines for the newly introduced ICD-11 grouping of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRD).

At the same time, neuroimaging studies of OCD have had notable limitations, including reliance on relatively small samples. International collaborative efforts to increase statistical power by combining samples from across sites have been bolstered by the ENIGMA consortium; this provides specific technical expertise for conducting multi-site analyses, as well as access to a collaborative community of neuroimaging scientists. In this article, we outline the background to, development of, and initial findings from ENIGMA's OCD working group, which currently consists of 47 samples from 34 institutes in 15 countries on 5 continents, with a total sample of 2,323 OCD patients and 2,325 healthy controls. Initial work has focused on studies of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, structural connectivity, and brain lateralization in children, adolescents and adults with OCD, also including the study on the commonalities and distinctions across different neurodevelopment disorders. Additional work is ongoing, employing machine learning techniques. Findings to date have contributed to the development of neurobiological models of OCD, have provided an important model of global scientific collaboration, and have had a number of clinical implications. Importantly, our work has shed new light on questions about whether structural and functional alterations found in OCD reflect neurodevelopmental changes, effects of the disease process, or medication impacts. We conclude with a summary of ongoing work by ENIGMA-OCD, and a consideration of future directions for neuroimaging research on OCD within and beyond ENIGMA.", "Keywords": ["ENIGMA", "MRI", "cortical

We examined this question by administrating the Simon task to 67 unmedicated adults with OCD and 67 matched controls. The interference effect (incongruent minus congruent) was used to measure conflict-resolution. Trial-by-trial dynamic adaptation (i.e., the Gratton effect), which is indicated by smaller interference effect after conflict-laden trials compared to after non-conflict-laden trials, was used to measure conflict-monitoring. A similar interference effect was found in both the OCD and HC groups with no significant between group differences. Following incongruent trials, the interference effect became smaller for the control group as expected, but was completely eliminated for the OCD group. These data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that conflict-resolution is not globally deficient in unmedicated OCD patients and provide direct evidence that conflict-monitoring is heightened in OCD patients.

Global networks were characterized using measures of network segregation (clustering and modularity), network integration (global efficiency), and their balance (small-worldness), and their community membership was assessed. Hub profiling of regional networks was undertaken using measures of betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality. Individually calculated network measures were integrated across the 37 datasets using a meta-analytical approach. These network measures were summated across the network density range of K\u2009=\u20090.10-0.25 per participant, and were integrated across the 37 datasets using a meta-analytical approach. Compared with healthy controls, at a global level, the structural covariance networks of OCD showed lower clustering (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), lower modularity (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and lower small-worldness (P\u2009=\u20090.017). Detection of community membership emphasized lower network segregation in OCD compared to healthy controls. At the regional level, there were lower (rank-transformed) centrality values in OCD for volume of caudate nucleus and thalamus, and surface area of paracentral cortex, indicative of altered distribution of brain hubs. Centrality of cingulate and orbito-frontal as well as other brain areas was associated with OCD illness duration, suggesting greater involvement of these brain areas with illness chronicity. In summary, the findings of this study, the largest brain structural covariance study of OCD to date, point to a less segregated organization of structural covariance networks in OCD, and reorganization of brain hubs. The segregation findings suggest a possible signature of altered brain morphometry in OCD, while the hub findings point to OCD-related alterations in trajectories of brain development and maturation, particularly in cingulate and orbitofrontal regions.", "Keywords": ["brain structural covariance network", "graph theory", "illness duration", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "pharmacotherapy"],

Herein, we investigate whether task-based neural activity can predict who responds best to EX/RP. Unmedicated adult patients with OCD (n = 36) and healthy participants (n = 33) completed the Simon Spatial Incompatibility Task during high-resolution, multiband functional MRI (fMRI); patients were then offered twice-weekly EX/RP (17 sessions). Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify brain regions where conflict-related activity moderated the slope of change in Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores across treatment. Conflict-related activity in the left pallidum and 35 cortical parcels/regions significantly predicted symptom improvement with EX/RP for patients with OCD (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05). Significant parcels/regions included cingulo-opercular and default mode network regions, specifically the anterior insula and anterior and posterior cingulate. Summarizing across these parcels/regions, greater conflict-related activity predicted greater EX/RP response and which patients achieved remission (Y-BOCS score \u2264 12; Cohen's d = 1.68) with >80% sensitivity and specificity. The association between brain activity and treatment response was partially mediated by patient EX/RP adherence (b = -2.99; 43.61% of total effect; P = 0.02). Brain activity and adherence together were highly predictive of remission. Together, these findings suggest that cingulo-opercular and default mode regions typically implicated in task control and introspective processes, respectively, may be targets for novel treatments that augment the ability of persons with OCD to resolve cognitive conflict and thereby facilitate adherence to EX/RP, increasing the likelihood of remission.", "Keywords": ["OCD", "conflict", "exposure", "fMRI", "psychotherapy"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Implosive Therapy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032; david.pagliaccio@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Middleton", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Dianne", "Last Name": "Hezel", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shari", "Last Name": "Steinman", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ivar", "Last Name": "Snorrason", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Gershkovich", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Campeas", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Pinto", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Page", "Last Name": "Van Meter", "Affiliation": "Center for OCD and Related Disorders, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2019Oct08"}, {"PMID": "31371720", "Title": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly prevalent and chronic condition that is associated with substantial global disability. OCD is the key example of the 'obsessive-compulsive and related disorders', a group of conditions which are now classified together in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, and which are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. In addition, OCD is an important example of a neuropsychiatric disorder in which rigorous research on phenomenology, psychobiology, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy has contributed to better recognition, assessment and outcomes. Although OCD is a relatively homogenous disorder with similar symptom dimensions globally, individualized assessment of symptoms, the degree of insight, and the extent of comorbidity is needed. Several neurobiological mechanisms underlying OCD have been identified, including specific brain circuits that underpin OCD. In addition, laboratory models have demonstrated how cellular and molecular dysfunction underpins repetitive stereotyped behaviours, and the genetic architecture of OCD is increasingly understood. Effective treatments for OCD include serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioural therapy, and neurosurgery for those with intractable symptoms. Integration of global mental health and translational neuroscience approaches could further advance knowledge on OCD and improve clinical outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Humans", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Prevalence", "Psychometrics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dan J", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cape Town and SA MRC Unit on Risk &\u00a0Resilience in Mental Disorders, Cape Town, South Africa. dan.stein@uct.ac.za."}, {"First Name": "Daniel L C", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "OCD Research Program, Instituto de Psiquiatria, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Lochner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Stellenbosch University and SA MRC Unit on Risk & Resilience in Mental Disorders, Stellenbosch, South Africa."}, {"First Name": "Euripedes C", "Last Name": "Miguel", "Affiliation": "OCD Research Program, Instituto de Psiquiatria, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Y C Janardhan", "Last Name": "Reddy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, India."}, {"First Name": "Roseli G", "Last Name": "Shavitt", "Affiliation": "OCD Research Program, Instituto de Psiquiatria, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Odile A", "Last Name": "van den Heuvel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

Using fMRI in humans, we investigated whether replacing threat with novel neutral outcomes (instead of just omitting threat) facilitates extinction by engaging the vmPFC more effectively than standard extinction. Computational modeling of associability (indexing surprise strength and dynamically modulating learning rates) characterized skin conductance responses and vmPFC activity during novelty-facilitated but not standard extinction. Subjects who showed faster within-session updating of associability during novelty-facilitated extinction also expressed better extinction retention the next day, as expressed through skin conductance responses. Finally, separable patterns of connectivity between the amygdala and ventral versus dorsal mPFC characterized retrieval of novelty-facilitated versus standard extinction memories, respectively. These results indicate that replacing threat with novel outcomes stimulates vmPFC involvement on extinction trials, leading to a more durable long-term extinction memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Psychiatric disorders characterized be excessive fear are a major public health concern. Popular clinical treatments, such as exposure therapy, are informed by principles of Pavlovian extinction. Thus, there is motivation to optimize extinction strategies in the laboratory so as to ultimately develop more effective clinical treatments. Here, we used functional neuroimaging in humans and found that replacing (rather than just omitting) expected aversive events with novel and neutral outcomes engages the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during extinction learning. Enhanced extinction also diminished activity in threat-related networks (e.g., the insula, thalamus) during immediate extinction and a 24 h extinction retention test. This is new evidence for how behavioral protocols designed to enhance extinction affects neurocircuitry underlying the learning and retention of extinction memories.", "Keywords": ["Pavlovian conditioning", "extinction", "fMRI", "inhibitory learning", "ventromedial prefrontal cortex"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Conditioning, Classical", "Extinction, Psychological", "Fear", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Galvanic Skin Response", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Models, Neurological", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Retention, Psychology", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph E", "Last Name": "Dunsmoor", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, joseph.dunsmoor@austin.utexas.edu."}, {"First Name": "Marijn C W", "Last Name": "Kroes", "Affiliation": "Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences and Beijing Key Laboratory of Behaviour and Mental Health, Peking University, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel D", "Last Name": "Daw", "Affiliation": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology, Peking University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544."}, {"First Name": "Helen B", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Phelps", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Apr24"}, {"PMID": "30745681", "Title": "Exposure and response prevention for obsessive-compulsive disorder: A review and new directions.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by distressing thoughts and repetitive behaviors that are interfering, time-consuming, and difficult to control.

Some methodologists claim that a one-stage individual-participant data (IPD) mega-analysis can be superior to a two-stage aggregated data meta-analysis, since more detailed computations can be performed in a mega-analysis. Before definitive conclusions regarding the performance of either method can be drawn, it is necessary to critically evaluate the methodology of, and results obtained by, meta- and mega-analyses. Methods: Here, we compare the inverse variance weighted random-effect meta-analysis model with a multiple linear regression mega-analysis model, as well as with a linear mixed-effects random-intercept mega-analysis model, using data from 38 cohorts including 3,665 participants of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We assessed the effect sizes and standard errors, and the fit of the models, to evaluate the performance of the different methods. Results: The mega-analytical models showed lower standard errors and narrower confidence intervals than the meta-analysis. Similar standard errors and confidence intervals were found for the linear regression and linear mixed-effects random-intercept models. Moreover, the linear mixed-effects random-intercept models showed better fit indices compared to linear regression mega-analytical models. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that results obtained by meta- and mega-analysis differ, in favor of the latter. In multi-center studies with a moderate amount of variation between cohorts, a linear mixed-effects random-intercept mega-analytical framework appears to be the better approach to investigate

studies have reported failures in goal-directed planning in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It remains unclear whether these deficits confer vulnerability to developing OCD, or are a consequence of symptoms. The present study examined goal-directed learning before and after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), using treatment as a tool to reduce symptoms. Eighteen adult OCD patients undergoing 17 sessions of CBT completed an established task of model-based (i.e., goal directed) versus model-free planning as well as measures of OCD and depression before and after treatment. We thus tested whether improvements in goal-directed performance accompany improvements in OCD symptoms or if instead task performance remains stable despite symptom improvement. Results showed prior to treatment, higher OCD severity was associated with greater deficits in model-based planning. OCD severity scores significantly improved from pre- to post-treatment. Inconsistent with the state-view, OCD symptom improvement was not accompanied by improvements in model-based performance.

Examining dimensions across psychiatric illnesses has proven challenging, as reliable behavioral paradigms that are known to engage specific neural circuits and translate across diagnostic populations are scarce. Delay discounting paradigms seem to be an exception: they are useful for understanding links between neural systems and behavior in healthy individuals, with potential for assessing how these mechanisms go awry in psychiatric illnesses. This article reviews relevant literature on delay discounting (or the rate at which the value of a reward decreases as the delay to receipt increases) in humans, including methods for examining it, its putative neural mechanisms, and its application in psychiatric research. There exist rigorous and reproducible paradigms to evaluate delay discounting, standard methods for calculating discount rate, and known neural systems probed by these paradigms. Abnormalities in discounting have been associated with psychopathology ranging from addiction (with steep discount rates indicating relative preference for immediate rewards) to anorexia nervosa (with shallow discount rates indicating preference for future rewards). The latest research suggests that delay discounting can be manipulated in the laboratory. Extensively studied in cognitive neuroscience, delay discounting assesses a dimension of behavior that is important for decision-making and is linked to neural substrates and to psychopathology. The question now is whether manipulating delay discounting can yield clinically significant changes in behavior that promote health. If so, then delay discounting could deliver on the RDoC promise.", "Keywords": ["Cognitive neuroscience", "RDoC", "decision-making", "delay discounting", "impulsivity", "intertemporal choice"], "MeSH terms": ["Delay Discounting", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.)", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karolina M", "Last Name": "Lempert", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology,University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia, PA,USA."}, {"First Name": "Joanna E", "Last Name": "Steinglass", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry,Columbia University Medical Center,New York, NY,USA."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Pinto", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry,Columbia University Medical Center,New York, NY,USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph W", "Last Name": "Kable", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology,University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia, PA,USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry,Columbia University Medical Center,New York, NY,USA."}], "Journal": "Psychological medicine", "PubDate": "2019Jan"}, {"PMID": "29937263", "Title": "Acceptability, Feasibility, and Effectiveness of Internet-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in New York.", "Abstract": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), consisting of exposure and response prevention (EX/RP), is both efficacious and preferred by patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), yet few receive this treatment in practice. This study describes the implementation of an Internet-based CBT program (ICBT) developed in Sweden in individuals seeking OCD treatment in New York. After translating and adapting the Swedish ICBT for OCD, we conducted an open trial with 40 adults with OCD. Using the RE-AIM implementation science framework, we assessed the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of ICBT. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was the primary outcome measure. Of 40 enrolled, 28 participants completed the 10-week ICBT. In the intent-to-treat sample (N = 40), Y-BOCS scores decreased significantly over time (F = 28.12, df = 2, 49, p < . 001). Depressive severity (F = 5.87, df = 2, 48, p < . 001), and quality of life (F = 12.34, df = 2, 48, p < . 001) also improved. Sensitivity analyses among treatment completers (N = 28) confirmed the intent-to-treat results, with a large effect size for Y-BOCS change (Cohen's d = 1.38). ICBT took less time to implement than face-to face EX/RP and participants were very to mostly satisfied with ICBT.

One hundred and eight patients with OCD were randomly assigned to two forms of CBT: exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) or stress management training (SMT). Measures of OCD symptoms, quality of life, therapist and patient expectancy and alliance were collected at several timepoints. Treatment type was a substantially stronger predictor of symptom reduction compared to alliance and expectancy. However, neither specific nor common factors predicted improvement in quality of life very well. Only in EX/RP, symptom change was associated with subsequent changes in alliance. Finally, therapist effects were estimated using Bayesian methods and were negligible.

In the last decade, investigators piloted novel deep brain stimulation (DBS)-based therapies for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Results from recent pivotal trials of these therapies, however, did not demonstrate the degree of efficacy expected from previous smaller trials. To discuss next steps, neurosurgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists and representatives from industry convened a workshop sponsored by the American Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery

In the current study, we test the hypothesis that less efficient task control in individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with OCD symptoms, and specifically, with the inability to inhibit unwanted behaviors in OCD. Thirty-five healthy controls, 30 participants with OCD, and 26 participants with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) completed the object-interference (OI) task to measure task control, the stop-signal task to measure response inhibition, and the arrow-flanker task to evaluate executive abilities not contingent upon task control. OCD patients, but not GAD patients or healthy controls, exhibited impaired performance on the OI task. The deficit in task control, but not in response inhibition, correlated with OCD symptom severity.

The American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guidelines suggest augmenting SRIs with either cognitive behavioral therapy consisting of exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) or antipsychotic medication (e.g., risperidone) [1]. EX/RP has been shown to be more effective [2]. However, some patients prefer medications over EX/RP [3]. How should treating clinicians respond in these situations? Conventional wisdom would suggest that patients who prefer one treatment may not benefit if assigned to another. Indeed, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that patients are less likely to improve and more likely to drop out when matched to a therapy condition they did not prefer [4].

The degree to which patients adhere to EX/RP procedures outside of sessions has been found to predict therapy outcomes, including who achieves post-treatment wellness. We sought to investigate which components of treatment adherence most relate to outcome and to develop adherence benchmarks to identify who does and does not become well to provide clinicians with prognostic tools. Adherence data came from 37 adult patients with DSM-IV OCD who received 17 sessions of EX/RP as part of a randomized controlled trial of augmentation strategies for incomplete response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Therapists rated between-session patient adherence at each exposure session by quantifying: 1) the quantity of homework exposures attempted; 2) the quality of attempted exposures; and 3) the degree of success with response prevention. Each adherence item significantly correlated with post-treatment OCD severity. Success with response prevention proved particularly strongly linked to therapy outcome. Time course analysis of this item accurately identified, relatively early in treatment, who would achieve post-treatment wellness.

This study aimed to determine whether AN pathophysiology is associated with altered connections within fronto-accumbal circuitry subserving reward processing. Diffusion and resting-state functional MRI scans were collected in female inpatients with AN (n\u2009=\u200922) and healthy controls (HC; n\u2009=\u200918) between the ages of 16 and 25 years. Individuals with AN were scanned during the acute, underweight phase of the illness and again following inpatient weight restoration. HC were scanned twice over the same timeframe. Based on univariate and multivariate analyses of fronto-accumbal circuitry, underweight individuals with AN were found to have increased structural connectivity (diffusion probabilistic tractography), increased white matter anisotropy (tract-based spatial statistics), increased functional connectivity (seed-based correlation in resting-state fMRI), and altered effective connectivity (spectral dynamic causal modeling). Following weight restoration, fronto-accumbal structural connectivity continued to be abnormally increased bilaterally with large (partial \u03b72 \u2009=\u20090.387; right NAcc-OFC) and moderate (partial \u03b72 \u2009=\u20090.197; left NAcc-OFC) effect sizes. Increased structural connectivity within fronto-accumbal circuitry in the underweight state correlated with severity of eating disorder symptoms.

Adults with OCPD (both with and without comorbid OCD) reported higher rates of all three childhood OCPTs relative to HC. Individuals with OCD (without OCPD) reported higher rates of inflexibility and drive for order relative to HC, suggesting that these traits may presage the development of OCD, independent of OCPD. Childhood OCPTs were associated with particular OCD symptom dimensions in adulthood (contamination/cleaning, doubt/checking, and symmetry/ordering), independent of OCD onset age and OCPD diagnosis.

The aims were to compare the types of sensory phenomena (SP, subjective experiences that precede or accompany compulsions) in OCD patients with and without tic disorders and to determine the frequency of mental compulsions, the co-occurrence of obsessions and compulsions, and the range of insight. SP were common in the whole sample, but patients with tic disorders were more likely to have physical sensations and urges only. Mental compulsions occurred in the majority of OCD patients. It was extremely rare for OCD patients to have obsessions without compulsions. A wide range of insight into OCD beliefs was observed, with a small subset presenting no insight. The data generated from this large sample will help practicing clinicians appreciate the full range of OCD symptoms and confirm prior studies in smaller samples the degree to which insight varies. These findings also support specific revisions to the WHO's diagnostic guidelines for OCD, such as describing sensory phenomena, mental compulsions and level of insight, so that the world-wide recognition of this disabling disorder is increased.", "Keywords": ["Insight", "Mental compulsions", "Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder", "Phenomenology", "Sensory phenomena"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brazil", "Child", "Compulsive Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obsessive Behavior", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Personality Assessment", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roseli G", "Last Name": "Shavitt", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Brazil.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, drug-free OCD adults (n=15) with near-constant obsessions received two 40-min intravenous infusions, one of saline and one of ketamine (0.5\u2009mg/kg), spaced at least 1-week apart.

As a result, only the first-phase data were used in additional analyses. Specifically, those receiving ketamine (n=8) reported significant improvement in obsessions (measured by OCD-VAS) during the infusion compared with subjects receiving placebo (n=7).

Brief but repeated episodes of abnormal circuit activity may thus set the stage for the development of persistent psychopathology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenoviridae", "Animals", "Artificial Gene Fusion", "Bacterial Proteins", "Behavior, Animal", "Channelrhodopsins", "Corpus Striatum", "Electric Stimulation", "Fluoxetine", "Frontal Lobe", "Luminescent Proteins", "Male", "Mice", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Optogenetics", "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors", "Thalamus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Susanne E", "Last Name": "Ahmari", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA. sea2103@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Spellman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neria L", "Last Name": "Douglass", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mazen A", "Last Name": "Kheirbek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karl", "Last Name": "Deisseroth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Gordon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ren\u00e9", "Last Name": "Hen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "PubDate": "2013Jun07"}, {"PMID": "23659348", "Title": "Delusional versus nondelusional body dysmorphic disorder: recommendations for DSM-5.", "Abstract": "The core feature of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is distressing or impairing preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. BDD beliefs are characterized by varying degrees of insight, ranging from good (ie, recognition that one's BDD beliefs are not true) through \"absent insight/delusional\" beliefs (ie, complete conviction that one's BDD beliefs are true). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., rev. (DSM-III-R) and The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) classified BDD's nondelusional form in the somatoform section of the manual and its delusional form in the psychosis section, as a type of delusional disorder, somatic type (although DSM-IV allowed double-coding of delusional BDD as both a psychotic disorder and BDD). However, little or no evidence on this issue was available when these editions were published. In this article, we review the classification of BDD's delusional and nondelusional variants in earlier editions of DSM and the limitations of their approaches. We then review empirical evidence on this topic, which has become available since DSM-IV was developed. Available evidence indicates that across a range of validators, BDD's delusional and nondelusional variants have many more similarities than differences, including response to pharmacotherapy. Based on these data, we propose that BDD's delusional and nondelusional forms be classified as the same disorder and that BDD's diagnostic criteria include an insight specifier that spans a range of insight, including absent insight/delusional BDD beliefs. We hope that this recommendation will improve care for patients with this common and often-severe disorder. This increased understanding of BDD may also have implications for other disorders that have an \"absent insight/delusional\" form.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Body Dysmorphic Disorders", "Body Image", "Delusions", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Humans", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katharine A", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "1 Body Dysmorphic Disorder Program, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashley S", "Last Name": "Hart", "Affiliation": "1 Body Dysmorphic Disorder Program, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dan J", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "5 Department of Psychiatry, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa."}], "Journal": "CNS spectrums", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "23609401", "Title": "Does extended release methylphenidate help adults with hoarding disorder?: a case series.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Central Nervous System Stimulants", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Female", "Hoarding Disorder", "Humans", "Male", "Methylphenidate", "Middle Aged", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carolyn I", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Bender", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Morrison", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raveen", "Last Name": "Mehendru", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Tolin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Helen Blair", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical psychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "23489416", "Title": "Altered activation in fronto-striatal circuits during sequential processing of conflict in unmedicated adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the functioning of fronto-striatal brain circuits that support self-regulatory capacities including conflict resolution and sequential processing in unmedicated adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).", "Keywords": ["Cognitive conflict", "Simon task", "fMRI", "fronto-striatal systems", "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "self-regulation"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Attention", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Corpus Striatum", "Executive Function", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.
