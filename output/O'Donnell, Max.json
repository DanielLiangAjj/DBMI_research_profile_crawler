[{"PMID": "38773184", "Title": "Racial and ethnic disparities post-hospitalization for COVID-19: barriers to access to care for survivors of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome.", "Abstract": "Racial and ethnic health disparities in the incidence and severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been observed globally and in the United States. Research has focused on transmission, hospitalization, and mortality among racial and ethnic minorities, but Long COVID-19 health disparities research is limited. This study retrospectively evaluated 195 adults who survived COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) in New York City from March-April 2020. Among survivors, 54% met the criteria for Long COVID syndrome. Hispanic/Latinx patients, were more likely to be uninsured (p\u2009=\u20090.027) and were less frequently discharged to rehabilitation facilities (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A cross-sectional telephone survey and interview were conducted with a subset of survivors (n\u2009=\u200969). Among these, 11% reported a lack of follow-up primary care post-discharge and 38% had subsequent emergency room visits. Notably, 38% reported poor treatment within the health care system, with 67% attributing this to racial or ethnic bias. Thematic analysis of interviews identified four perceived challenges: decline in functional status, discrimination during hospitalization, healthcare system inequities, and non-healthcare-related structural barriers. Sources of resilience included survivorship, faith, and family support. This study highlights structural and healthcare-related barriers rooted in perceived racism and poverty as factors impacting post-COVID-19 care.", "Keywords": ["ARDS", "Access to care", "COVID-19", "Long COVID", "Racial and ethnic disparities"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "COVID-19", "Male", "Female", "Middle Aged", "Healthcare Disparities", "Health Services Accessibility", "Aged", "Adult", "Survivors", "Retrospective Studies", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Hospitalization", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "New York City", "SARS-CoV-2", "Ethnic and Racial Minorities", "Hispanic or Latino"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alicia", "Last Name": "Ca\u00f1as", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison", "Last Name": "Wolf", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "En Chi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "School of Global Health, Dahdaleh Institute of Global Health Research, York University, Toronto, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Ruddy", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sal", "Last Name": "El-Sadek", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Gomez", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Furfaro", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brookline, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Fullilove", "Affiliation": "Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin M", "Last Name": "Burkart", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Zelnick", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Social Work, Touro University, New York City, USA."}, {"First Name": "Max R", "Last Name": "O'Donnell", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Medical Center, Suite E101, 8th Floor, PH building, 622 W. 168th street, New York City, NY, 10032, USA. mo2130@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2024May21"}, {"PMID": "38368384", "Title": "COVID-19 immune signatures in Uganda persist in HIV co-infection and diverge by pandemic phase.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in sub-Saharan Africa, where severe COVID-19 fatality rates are among the highest in the world and the immunological landscape is unique. In a prospective cohort study of 306 adults encompassing the entire clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda, we profile the peripheral blood proteome and transcriptome to characterize the immunopathology of COVID-19 across multiple phases of the pandemic. Beyond the prognostic importance of myeloid cell-driven immune activation and lymphopenia, we show that multifaceted impairment of host protein synthesis and redox imbalance define core biological signatures of severe COVID-19, with central roles for IL-7, IL-15, and lymphotoxin-\u03b1 in COVID-19 respiratory failure. While prognostic signatures are generally consistent in SARS-CoV-2/HIV-coinfection, type I interferon responses uniquely scale with COVID-19 severity in persons living with HIV. Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 severity peaked during phases dominated by A.23/A.23.1 and Delta B.1.617.2/AY variants. Independent of clinical severity, Delta phase COVID-19 is distinguished by exaggerated pro-inflammatory myeloid cell and inflammasome activation, NK and CD8+ T cell depletion, and impaired host protein synthesis. Combining these analyses with a contemporary Ugandan cohort of adults hospitalized with influenza and other severe acute respiratory infections, we show that activation of epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor pathways are distinct features of COVID-19, deepening translational understanding of mechanisms potentially underlying SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, our findings provide biological rationale for use of broad and targeted immunotherapies for severe COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa, illustrate the relevance of local viral and host factors to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology, and highlight underemphasized yet therapeutically exploitable immune pathways driving COVID-19 severity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans",

In this context, patient stratification based on biomarkers of a dysregulated host response may identify subgroups more likely to respond to targeted immunomodulatory therapeutics. In a prospective cohort of adults hospitalized with suspected sepsis in Uganda, we applied machine learning methods to develop a prediction model for 30-day mortality that integrates physiology-based risk scores with soluble biomarkers reflective of key domains of sepsis immunopathology. After model evaluation and internal validation, whole-blood RNA sequencing data were analyzed to compare biological pathway enrichment and inferred immune cell profiles between patients assigned differential model-based risks of mortality. Of 260 eligible adults (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 26-43 years; 59.2% female, 53.9% living with HIV), 62 (23.8%) died by 30 days after hospital discharge. Among 14 biomarkers, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) demonstrated the greatest importance for mortality prediction in machine learning models. A clinicomolecular model integrating sTNFR1 and Ang-2 with the Universal Vital Assessment (UVA) risk score optimized 30-day mortality prediction across multiple performance metrics.

Subgroups with Differential Responses to Corticosteroids.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Two distinct subphenotypes have been identified in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the presence of subgroups in ARDS associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unknown. Objectives: To identify clinically relevant, novel subgroups in COVID-19-related ARDS and compare them with previously described ARDS subphenotypes. Methods: Eligible participants were adults with COVID-19 and ARDS at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups with baseline clinical, respiratory, and laboratory data serving as partitioning variables. A previously developed machine learning model was used to classify patients as the hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory subphenotypes. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between subgroups. Heterogeneity of treatment effect for corticosteroid use in subgroups was tested. Measurements and Main Results: From March 2, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 483 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS met study criteria. A two-class latent class analysis model best fit the population (P\u2009=\u20090.0075). Class 2 (23%) had higher proinflammatory markers, troponin, creatinine, and lactate, lower bicarbonate, and lower blood pressure than class 1 (77%). Ninety-day mortality was higher in class 2 versus class 1 (75% vs. 48%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Considerable overlap was observed between these subgroups and ARDS subphenotypes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR cycle threshold was associated with mortality in the hypoinflammatory but not the hyperinflammatory phenotype. Heterogeneity of treatment effect to corticosteroids was observed (P\u2009=\u20090.0295), with improved mortality in the hyperinflammatory phenotype and worse mortality in the hypoinflammatory phenotype, with the caveat that corticosteroid treatment was not randomized. Conclusions: We identified two COVID-19-related ARDS subgroups with differential outcomes, similar to previously described ARDS subphenotypes. SARS-CoV-2 PCR cycle threshold had differential value for predicting mortality in the subphenotypes. The subphenotypes had differential treatment responses to corticosteroids.", "Keywords": ["ARDS", "COVID-19", "latent class analysis", "phenotyping"], "MeSH terms": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Aged", "COVID-19", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Latent Class Analysis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "Retrospective Studies", "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pratik", "Last Name": "Sinha", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Washington University Medical School, Saint Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Furfaro", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Cummings", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Darryl", "Last Name": "Abrams", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Delucchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences."}, {"First Name": "Manoj V", "Last Name": "Maddali", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "June", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Washington University Medical School, Saint Louis, Missouri."}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Thompson", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Murn", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Fountain", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Shelief Y", "Last Name": "Robbins-Juarez", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthew A", "Last Name": "Adan", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Tejus", "Last Name": "Satish", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mahesh", "Last Name": "Madhavan", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Aakriti", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Alexander K", "Last Name": "Lyashchenko", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cara", "Last Name": "Agerstrand", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Natalie H", "Last Name": "Yip", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Kristin M", "Last Name": "Burkart", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy R", "Last Name": "Beitler", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Baldwin", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Carolyn S", "Last Name": "Calfee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Brodie", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Max R", "Last Name": "O'Donnell", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2021Dec01"}, {"PMID": "34370701", "Title": "Severe COVID-19 in Uganda across Two Epidemic Phases: A Prospective Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Among a prospective cohort of children and adults admitted to a national COVID-19 treatment unit in Uganda from March to December 2020, we characterized the epidemiology of and risk factors for severe illness.

In this context, established and emerging rapid pathogen diagnostics may stratify sepsis patients into subgroups with prognostic and therapeutic relevance. In a prospective cohort of adults (age \u226518 years) hospitalized with suspected sepsis in Uganda, we stratified patients using rapid diagnostics for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and influenza, and compared clinical characteristics and 30-day outcomes across these pathogen-driven subgroups. From April 2017 to August 2019, 301 adults were enrolled (median age, 32 years [interquartile range, 26-42 years]; female, n = 178 [59%]). A total of 157 patients (53%) were HIV infected. Sixty-one patients (20%) tested positive for malaria, 52 (17%), for TB (including 49 of 157 [31%] HIV-infected patients), and 17 (6%), for influenza. Co-infection was identified in 33 (11%) patients. The frequency of multi-organ failure, including shock and acute respiratory failure, was greatest among patients with HIV-associated TB.

Despite improvements in anti-retroviral delivery, the burden of sepsis in Uganda remains concentrated among young, HIV-infected adults, with a high incidence of severe HIV-associated TB.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or normal control plasma. The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to receive normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in the clinical scale was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, P = 0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected.CONCLUSIONIn adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in day 28 clinical status. However, convalescent plasma was associated with significantly improved survival. A possible explanation is that survivors remained hospitalized at their baseline clinical status.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04359810.FUNDINGAmazon Foundation, Skoll Foundation.",

We hypothesized that advanced phenotyping with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) will detect low-frequency Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance. We assessed a reporter mycobacteriophage (\u03a62GFP10) in vitro to detect drug-resistant subpopulations and predict M. tuberculosis bactericidal activity in this pilot study. Subsequently, we prospectively studied 20 TB patients with serial \u03a62GFP10, Xpert MTB/RIF, and M. tuberculosis culture through end of treatment. WGS was performed, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined to detect mixed infection in selected M. tuberculosis isolates. Resistant M. tuberculosis isolates were detected at 1:100,000, and changes in cytometry-gated events were predictive of in vitroM. tuberculosis bactericidal activity using the \u03a62GFP10 assay. Emergent drug resistance was detected in one patient by \u03a62GFP10 at 3 weeks but not by conventional testing (M. tuberculosis culture and GeneXpert). WGS revealed a phylogeographically distinct extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) genome, identical to an XDR-TB isolate from the patient's spouse. Variant lineage-specific SNPs were present early, suggesting mixed infection as the etiology of emergent resistance with temporal trends providing evidence for selection during treatment. \u03a62GFP10 can detect low-frequency drug-resistant M. tuberculosis and with WGS characterize emergent M. tuberculosis resistance.

We fused the promoters of several genes upregulated in persisters to the red fluorescent protein tdTomato gene in \u03a62GFP10, a mycobacteriophage constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), thus generating \u03a62DRMs. A population enriched in INH persisters exhibited strong red fluorescence, by microscopy and flow cytometry, using a \u03a62DRM with tdTomato controlled from the dnaK promoter.

By combining association and correlated evolution tests with strategies for amplifying signal from rare variants, we found that loss-of-function mutations in ald (Rv2780), encoding L-alanine dehydrogenase, were associated with unexplained drug resistance. Convergent evolution of this loss of function was observed exclusively among multidrug-resistant strains. Drug susceptibility testing established that ald loss of function conferred resistance to D-cycloserine, and susceptibility to the drug was partially restored by complementation of ald.

Novel triage algorithms and rapid diagnostic tests are needed to expedite the identification and treatment of patients with severe sepsis due to M. tuberculosis bacteremia. In this article, we emphasize the importance of M. tuberculosis bacteremia as an under-recognized etiology of severe sepsis, and discuss the potential role of two emerging rapid diagnostic tests in the triage and prognostication of critically ill patients with advanced HIV infection and suspected disseminated M. tuberculosis.
