Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which constitutes most cases, is metabolically acquired. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the most common microvascular complication, is length-dependent damage to peripheral nerves. DPN pathogenesis is complex, but, at its core, it can be viewed as a state of impaired metabolism and bioenergetics failure operating against the backdrop of long peripheral nerve axons supported by glia. This unique peripheral nerve anatomy and the injury consequent to T2D underpins the distal-to-proximal symptomatology of DPN. Earlier work focused on the impact of hyperglycemia on nerve damage and bioenergetics failure, but recent evidence additionally implicates contributions from obesity and dyslipidemia. This review will cover peripheral nerve anatomy, bioenergetics, and glia-axon interactions, building the framework for understanding how hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia induce bioenergetics failure in DPN.

To identify specific lipid changes associated with PN, we conducted an untargeted lipidomics analysis comparing the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding on lipids in the plasma, liver, and peripheral nerve from three strains of mice (BL6, BTBR, and BKS). HFD feeding triggered distinct strain- and tissue-specific lipid changes, which correlated with PN in BL6 mice versus less robust murine models of metabolic dysfunction and PN (BTBR and BKS mice). The BL6 mice showed significant changes in neutral lipids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and plasmalogens within the nerve. Sphingomyelin (SM) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) were two lipid species that were unique to HFD BL6 sciatic nerve compared to other strains (BTBR and BKS). Plasma and liver lipids were significantly altered in all murine strains fed a HFD independent of PN status, suggesting that nerve-specific lipid changes contribute to PN pathogenesis. Many of the identified lipids affect mitochondrial function and mitochondrial bioenergetics, which were significantly impaired in ex vivo sural nerve and dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is the most prevalent complication of diabetes and prediabetes, and is characterized by progressive sensory loss resulting from nerve damage. While hyperglycemia is the major risk factor for PN in type 1 diabetes (T1D), the metabolic syndrome (MetS) underlies the onset and progression of PN in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes. Recent Advances: Recent reports show that dyslipidemia, a MetS component, is strongly associated with PN in T2D and prediabetes. Dyslipidemia is characterized by an abnormal plasma lipid profile with uncontrolled lipid levels, and both clinical and preclinical studies implicate a role for dietary fatty acids (FAs) in PN pathogenesis. Molecular studies further show that saturated and unsaturated FAs differentially regulate the nerve lipid profile and nerve function. Critical Issues: We first review the properties of FAs and the neuroanatomy of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Second, we discuss clinical and preclinical studies that implicate the involvement of FAs in PN. Third, we summarize the potential effects of FAs on nerve function and lipid metabolism within the peripheral nerves, sensory neurons, and Schwann cells. Future Directions: Future directions will focus on identifying molecular pathways in T2D and prediabetes that are modulated by FAs in PN. Determining pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the injurious effects of saturated FAs and beneficial properties of unsaturated FAs will provide mechanistic targets for developing new targeted therapies to treat PN associated with T2D and prediabetes.

PN causes severe morbidity for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes patients, including limb pain followed by numbness resulting from peripheral nerve damage. PN in T2D and prediabetes is associated with dyslipidemia and elevated circulating lipids; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying PN development in prediabetes and T2D are unknown. Peripheral nerve sensory neurons rely on axonal mitochondria to provide energy for nerve impulse conduction under homeostatic conditions. Models of dyslipidemia in vitro demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction in sensory neurons exposed to elevated levels of exogenous fatty acids. Herein, we evaluated the effect of dyslipidemia on mitochondrial function and dynamics in sensory axons of the saphenous nerve of a male high-fat diet (HFD)-fed murine model of prediabetes to identify mitochondrial alterations that correlate with PN pathogenesis in vivo We found that the HFD decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in axonal mitochondria and reduced the ability of sensory neurons to conduct at physiological frequencies. Unlike mitochondria in control axons, which dissipated their MMP in response to increased impulse frequency (from 1 to 50 Hz), HFD mitochondria dissipated less MMP in response to axonal energy demand, suggesting a lack of reserve capacity. The HFD also decreased sensory axonal Ca2+ levels and increased mitochondrial lengthening and expression of PGC1\u03b1, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Together, these results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction underlies an imbalance of axonal energy and Ca2+ levels and impairs impulse conduction within the saphenous nerve in prediabetic PN.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Diabetes and prediabetes are leading causes of peripheral neuropathy (PN) worldwide. PN has no cure, but development in diabetes and prediabetes is associated with dyslipidemia, including elevated levels of saturated fatty acids.

Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in ALS pathogenesis. The reversible nature of this dysregulation makes miRNAs attractive pharmacological targets and a potential therapeutic avenue. Under physiological conditions, miRNA biogenesis, which begins in the nucleus and includes further maturation in the cytoplasm, involves trans-activation response element DNA/RNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP43). However, TDP43 mutations or stress trigger TDP43 mislocalization and inclusion formation, a hallmark of most ALS cases, that may lead to aberrant protein/miRNA interactions in the cytoplasm. Herein, we demonstrated that TDP43 exhibits differential binding affinity for select miRNAs, which prompted us to profile miRNAs that preferentially bind cytoplasmic TDP43. Using cellular models expressing TDP43 variants and miRNA profiling analyses, we identified differential levels of 65 cytoplasmic TDP43-associated miRNAs. Of these, approximately 30% exhibited levels that differed by more than 3-fold in the cytoplasmic TDP43 models relative to our control model. The hits included both novel miRNAs and miRNAs previously associated with ALS that potentially regulate several predicted genes and pathways that may be important for pathogenesis.

Recent clinical studies have identified an association between the development of neuropathy and dyslipidemia in prediabetic and diabetic patients. Despite the prevalence of this complication, studies identifying molecular mechanisms that underlie neuropathy progression in prediabetes or diabetes are limited. However, dysfunctional mitochondrial pathways in hereditary neuropathy provide feasible molecular targets for assessing mitochondrial dysfunction in neuropathy associated with prediabetes or diabetes. Recent studies suggest that elevated levels of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) associated with dyslipidemia impair mitochondrial dynamics in sensory neurons by inducing mitochondrial depolarization, compromising mitochondrial bioenergetics, and impairing axonal mitochondrial transport. This causes lower neuronal ATP and apoptosis. Conversely, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) restore nerve and sensory mitochondrial function. Understanding the mitochondrial pathways that contribute to neuropathy progression in prediabetes and diabetes may provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of this debilitating complication.", "Keywords": ["Bioenergetics", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease", "Diabetes", "Fission", "Fusion", "Hereditary neuropathy", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial associated membranes", "Mitochondrial trafficking", "Prediabetes"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Diabetes Complications", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Dyslipidemias", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Heredodegenerative Disorders, Nervous System", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy E", "Last Name": "Rumora", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Masha G", "Last Name": "Savelieff", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stacey A", "Last Name": "Sakowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eva L", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.

Neuropathy progression and disease severity in prediabetes and diabetes correlates with dyslipidemia in man and murine models of disease. Dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated levels of circulating saturated fatty acids (SFAs) that associate with the progression of neuropathy. Increased intake of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diets confers metabolic health benefits; however, the impact of fatty acid saturation in neuropathy is unknown. This study examines the differential effect of SFAs and MUFAs on the development of neuropathy and the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the complication. Male mice Mus musculus fed a high-fat diet rich in SFAs developed robust peripheral neuropathy. This neuropathy was completely reversed by switching the mice from the SFA-rich high-fat diet to a MUFA-rich high-fat diet; nerve conduction velocities and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were restored. A MUFA oleate also prevented the impairment of mitochondrial transport and protected mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured sensory neurons treated with mixtures of oleate and the SFA palmitate. Moreover, oleate also preserved intracellular ATP levels, prevented apoptosis induced by palmitate treatment, and promoted lipid droplet formation in sensory neurons, suggesting that lipid droplets protect sensory neurons from lipotoxicity. Together, these results suggest that MUFAs reverse the progression of neuropathy by protecting mitochondrial function and transport through the formation of intracellular lipid droplets in sensory neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT There is a global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes, disorders that represent a continuum of metabolic disturbances in lipid and glucose metabolism. In the United States, 80 million individuals have prediabetes and 30 million have diabetes. Neuropathy is the most common complication of both disorders, carries a high morbidity, and, despite its prevalence, has no treatments. We report that dietary intervention with monounsaturated fatty acids reverses the progression of neuropathy and restores nerve function in high-fat diet-fed murine models of peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, the addition of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate to sensory neurons cultured under diabetic conditions shows that oleate prevents impairment of mitochondrial transport and mitochondrial dysfunction through a mechanism involving formation of axonal lipid droplets.", "Keywords": ["diabetes", "monounsaturated fatty acid", "neuropathy", "prediabetes", "saturated fatty acid", "sensory neuron"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Diet, High-Fat", "Disease Models, Animal", "Fatty Acids", "Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Obesity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy E", "Last Name": "Rumora", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "LoGrasso", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Hayes", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Faye E", "Last Name": "Mendelson", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Maegan A", "Last Name": "Tabbey", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Julia A", "Last Name": "Haidar", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, and."}, {"First Name": "Stephen I", "Last Name": "Lentz", "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109."}, {"First Name": "Eva L", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, and efeldman@umich.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019May08"}, {"PMID": "30696927", "Title": "Mitochondrial uncoupling has no effect on microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes.", "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR) contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in diabetes patients. The incidence of these complications is increasing with the diabetes epidemic, and current therapies minimally impact their pathogenesis in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Improved mechanistic understanding of each of the diabetic complications is needed in order to develop disease-modifying treatments for patients. We recently identified fundamental differences in mitochondrial responses of peripheral nerve, kidney, and retinal tissues to T2D in BKS-db/db mice. However, whether these mitochondrial adaptations are the cause or consequence of tissue dysfunction remains unclear. In the current study BKS-db/db mice were treated with the mitochondrial uncoupler, niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN), to determine the effects of mitochondrial uncoupling therapy on T2D, and the pathogenesis of DPN, DKD and DR. Here we report that NEN treatment from 6-24 wk of age had little effect on the development of T2D and diabetic complications. Our data suggest that globally targeting mitochondria with an uncoupling agent is unlikely to provide therapeutic benefit for DPN, DKD, or DR in T2D.

In human and murine fibroblasts, the gene encoding smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (Acta2) is tightly regulated by a network of transcription factors that either activate or repress the 5' promoter-enhancer in response to environmental cues signaling tissue repair and remodeling. Purine-rich element-binding protein B (Pur\u03b2) suppresses the expression of Acta2 by cooperatively interacting with the sense strand of a 5' polypurine sequence containing an inverted MCAT cis element required for gene activation. In this study, we evaluated the chemical basis of nucleoprotein complex formation between the Pur\u03b2 repressor and the purine-rich strand of the MCAT element in the mouse Acta2 promoter. Quantitative single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding assays conducted in the presence of increasing concentrations of monovalent salt or anionic detergent suggested that the assembly of a high-affinity nucleoprotein complex is driven by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Consistent with the results of pH titration analysis, site-directed mutagenesis revealed several basic amino acid residues in the intermolecular (R267) and intramolecular (K82 and R159) subdomains that are essential for Pur\u03b2 transcriptional repressor function in Acta2 promoter-reporter assays. In keeping with their diminished Acta2 repressor activity in fibroblasts, purified Pur\u03b2 variants containing an R267A mutation exhibited reduced binding affinity for purine-rich ssDNA. Moreover, certain double and triple-point mutants were also defective in binding to the Acta2 corepressor protein, Y-box-binding protein 1. Collectively, these findings establish the repertoire of noncovalent interactions that account for the unique structural and functional properties of Pur\u03b2.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Animals", "Cell Line", "DNA, Single-Stranded", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Mice", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Protein Domains", "Protein Structure, Quaternary", "Static Electricity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy E", "Last Name": "Rumora", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, \u2021Department of Medicine, and \u00a7Cardiovascular Research Institute of Vermont, University of Vermont College of Medicine , Burlington, Vermont 05405, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lauren A", "Last Name": "Ferris", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, \u2021Department of Medicine, and \u00a7Cardiovascular Research Institute of Vermont, University of Vermont College of Medicine , Burlington, Vermont 05405, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tamar R", "Last Name": "Wheeler", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, \u2021Department of Medicine, and \u00a7Cardiovascular Research Institute of Vermont, University of Vermont College of Medicine , Burlington, Vermont 05405, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Kelm", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, \u2021Department of Medicine, and \u00a7Cardiovascular Research Institute of Vermont, University of Vermont College of Medicine , Burlington, Vermont 05405, United States."}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2016May17"}, {"PMID": "23724822", "Title": "Structural basis of multisite single-stranded DNA recognition and ACTA2 repression by purine-rich element binding protein B (Pur\u03b2).", "Abstract": "A hallmark of dysfunctional fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation associated with fibrotic disorders is persistent expression of ACTA2, the gene encoding the cyto-contractile protein smooth muscle \u03b1-actin. In this study, a PURB-specific gene knockdown approach was used in conjunction with biochemical analyses of protein subdomain structure and function to reveal the mechanism by which purine-rich element binding protein B (Pur\u03b2) restricts ACTA2 expression in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Consistent with the hypothesized role of Pur\u03b2 as a suppressor of myofibroblast differentiation, stable short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Pur\u03b2 in cultured MEFs promoted changes in cell morphology, actin isoform expression, and cell migration indicative of conversion to a myofibroblast-like phenotype. Promoter-reporter assays in transfected Pur\u03b2 knockdown MEFs confirmed that these changes were attributable, in part, to derepression of ACTA2 transcription. To map the domains in Pur\u03b2 responsible for ACTA2 repression, several recombinant truncation mutants were generated and analyzed based on hypothetical, computationally derived models of the tertiary and quaternary structure of Pur\u03b2. Discrete subdomains mediating sequence- and strand-specific cis-element binding, protein-protein interaction, and inhibition of a composite ACTA2 enhancer were identified using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based assays. Our results indicate that the Pur\u03b2 homodimer possesses three separate but unequal single-stranded DNA-binding modules formed by subdomain-specific inter- and intramolecular interactions. This structural arrangement suggests that the cooperative assembly of the dimeric Pur\u03b2 repressor on the sense strand of the ACTA2 enhancer is dictated by the association of each subdomain with distinct purine-rich binding sites within the enhancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "Cell Differentiation", "DNA, Single-Stranded", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Fibroblasts", "Mice", "Myofibroblasts", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Purines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy E", "Last Name": "Rumora", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont 05405, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shu-Xia", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lauren A", "Last Name": "Ferris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Everse", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Kelm", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2013Jul02"}]
