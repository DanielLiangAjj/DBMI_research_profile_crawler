Here, we report that IgG accumulates during aging, particularly in white adipose tissue (WAT), to impair adipose tissue function and metabolic health. Caloric restriction (CR) decreases IgG accumulation in WAT, whereas replenishing IgG counteracts CR's metabolic benefits. IgG activates macrophages via Ras signaling and consequently induces fibrosis in WAT through the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway. Consistently, B cell null mice are protected from aging-associated WAT fibrosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance, unless exposed to IgG. Conditional ablation of the IgG recycling receptor, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), in macrophages prevents IgG accumulation in aging, resulting in prolonged healthspan and lifespan.

"Abstract": "Aging and obesity are the two prominent driving forces of metabolic dysfunction, yet the common underlying mechanisms remain elusive. PPAR\u03b3, a central metabolic regulator and primary drug target combatting insulin resistance, is hyperacetylated in both aging and obesity. By employing a unique adipocyte-specific PPAR\u03b3 acetylation-mimetic mutant knock-in mouse model, namely aKQ, we demonstrate that these mice develop worsened obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance as they age, and these metabolic deregulations are resistant to intervention by intermittent fasting. Interestingly, aKQ mice show a whitening phenotype of brown adipose tissue (BAT) manifested in lipid filling and suppressed BAT markers. Diet-induced obese aKQ mice retain an expected response to thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment, while BAT function remains impaired. This BAT whitening phenotype persists even with the activation of SirT1 through resveratrol treatment. Moreover, the adverse effect of TZDs on bone loss is exacerbated in aKQ mice and is potentially mediated by their increased Adipsin levels.

PPAR\u03b3 is well established to have an anti-inflammatory function in macrophages, but the mechanism that regulates its function in these cells remains to be fully elucidated. PPAR\u03b3 undergoes post-translational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, to mediate ligand responses, including on metabolic functions. Here, we report that PPAR\u03b3 acetylation in macrophages promotes their infiltration into adipose tissue, exacerbating metabolic dysregulation. We generated a mouse line that expresses a macrophage-specific, constitutive acetylation-mimetic form of PPAR\u03b3 (K293Qflox/flox:LysM-cre, mK293Q) to dissect the role of PPAR\u03b3 acetylation in macrophages. Upon high-fat diet feeding to stimulate macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue, we assessed the overall metabolic profile and tissue-specific phenotype of the mutant mice, including responses to the PPAR\u03b3 agonist Rosiglitazone. Macrophage-specific PPAR\u03b3 K293Q expression promotes proinflammatory macrophage infiltration and fibrosis in epididymal white adipose tissue, but not in subcutaneous or brown adipose tissue, leading to decreased energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and adipose tissue function. Furthermore, mK293Q mice are resistant to Rosiglitazone-induced improvements in adipose tissue remodeling.

This observation led us to question whether lipid synthesis and storage can be uncoupled from adipogenesis and adipocyte function. By inhibiting key enzymes in the lipid synthesis pathway during adipocyte development, we demonstrated that a basal level of lipid synthesis is essential for adipogenesis initiation but not for maturation and maintenance of adipocyte identity. Furthermore, inducing dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes abrogated adipocyte identity but not lipid storage.

plays versatile roles in endocrine function, hematopoiesis, bone homeostasis and metabolism, and, potentially, energy conservation. While the regulation of BMAT is inadequately understood, it is recognized as a unique and dynamic fat depot that is distinct from peripheral fat. As we age, bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds) accumulate throughout the bone marrow (BM) milieu to influence the microenvironment. This process is conceivably signaled by the secretion of adipocyte-derived factors including pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. Adipokines participate in the development of a chronic state of low-grade systemic inflammation (inflammaging), which trigger changes in the immune system that are characterized by declining fidelity and efficiency and cause an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory networks. In this review, we discuss the local effects of BMAT on bone homeostasis and the hematopoietic niche, age-related inflammatory changes associated with BMAT accrual, and the downstream effect on endocrine function, energy expenditure, and metabolism. Furthermore, we address therapeutic strategies to prevent BMAT accumulation and associated dysfunction during aging. In sum, BMAT is emerging as a critical player in aging and its explicit characterization still requires further research.", "Keywords": ["aging", "bone marrow adipocytes", "bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT)", "inflammaging", "inflammation"], "MeSH terms": ["Adipocytes", "Adipokines", "Adipose Tissue", "Aging", "Bone Marrow", "Bone and Bones", "Humans", "Inflammation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Aaron", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, ME, United States."}, {"First Name": "Clifford J", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, ME, United States."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "34162749", "Title": "Hepatocyte TLR4 triggers inter-hepatocyte Jagged1/Notch signaling to determine NASH-induced fibrosis.", "Abstract": "Aberrant hepatocyte Notch activity is critical to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-induced liver fibrosis, but mechanisms underlying Notch reactivation in developed liver are unclear. Here, we identified that increased expression of the Notch ligand Jagged1 (JAG1) tracked with Notch activation and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS) in human liver biopsy specimens and mouse NASH models. The increase in Jag1 was mediated by hepatocyte Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in pericentral hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-specific Jag1 overexpression exacerbated fibrosis in mice fed a high-fat diet or a NASH-provoking diet rich in palmitate, cholesterol, and sucrose and reversed the protection afforded by hepatocyte-specific TLR4 deletion, whereas hepatocyte-specific Jag1 knockout mice were protected from NASH-induced liver fibrosis. To test therapeutic potential of this biology, we designed a Jag1-directed antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and a hepatocyte-specific N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-modified siRNA, both of which reduced NASH diet-induced liver fibrosis in mice.

Unexpectedly, we have uncovered a previously undescribed pathway promoting mucous metaplasia that involves VEGFa and its receptor KDR. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis coupled with genetic mouse modeling demonstrates that loss of epithelial VEGFa, KDR, or MEK/ERK kinase promotes excessive club-to-goblet transdifferentiation during development and regeneration. Sox9 is required for goblet cell differentiation following Kdr inhibition in both mouse and human club cells. Significantly, airway mucous metaplasia in asthmatic and CF patients is also associated with reduced KDR signaling and increased SOX9 expression.

One shared pathology of these two diseases is a maladaptive reactivation of the Notch signaling pathway in liver. Notch antagonism with \u03b3-secretase inhibitors effectively suppresses hepatic glucose production and reduces liver fibrosis in NASH, but its extrahepatic side effects, particularly goblet cell metaplasia, limit therapeutic utility. To overcome this barrier, we developed a nanoparticle-mediated delivery system to target \u03b3-secretase inhibitor to liver (GSI NPs).

PPAR\u03b3 deacetylation on two lysine residues (K268 and K293) induces brown remodeling of white adipose tissue and uncouples the adverse effects of TZDs from insulin sensitization.

We generated mice homozygous with mice with deacetylation-mimetic PPAR\u03b3 mutations K268R/K293R (2KR) on an LDL-receptor knockout (Ldlr -/- ) background. 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice showed smaller atherosclerotic lesion areas than Ldlr -/- mice, particularly in aortic arches. With rosiglitazone treatment, 2KR:Ldlr -/- mice demonstrated a residual antiatherogenic response and substantial protection against bone loss and fluid retention. The antiatherosclerotic effect of 2KR was attributed to the protection of endothelium, indicated by improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and repressed expression of proatherogenic factors including inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6, and NADPH oxidase 2.

Inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) can undergo robust brown remodeling with appropriate stimuli and is therefore widely considered as a representative beige fat depot. However, adipose tissues residing in different anatomic depots exhibit a broad range of plasticity, raising the possibility that better beige fat depots with greater plasticity may exist. Here we identified and characterized a novel, naturally-existing beige fat depot, thigh adipose tissue (tAT). Unlike classic WATs, tAT maintains beige fat morphology at room temperature, whereas high-fat diet (HFD) feeding or aging promotes the development of typical WAT features, namely unilocular adipocytes. The brown adipocyte gene expression in tAT is consistently higher than in iWAT under cold exposure, HFD feeding, and rosiglitazone treatment conditions. Our molecular profiling by RNA-Seq revealed up-regulation of energy expenditure pathways and repressed inflammation in tAT relative to eWAT and iWAT. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the master fatty acid oxidation regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 is dispensable for maintaining and activating the beige character of tAT.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the excessive activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in this detrimental lung inflammation. Recently, we developed a unique class of peptide-gold nanoparticle (GNP) hybrids that act as potent nano-inhibitors of TLR4 signaling by modulating the process of endosomal acidification. In this study, we aimed to identify the key physiochemical factors that could further strengthen the anti-inflammatory activity of these nano-inhibitors, including the nanoparticle size, the density of peptides coating the nanoparticle surface, as well as the number of the effective amino acid phenylalanine (F) residues in the peptide sequence. Among these factors, we found that the nanoparticle size could significantly affect the TLR4 inhibition. Specifically, the peptide-GNP hybrids with a GNP core of 20\u202fnm (P12(G20)) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity on TLR4 activation and its downstream cytokine production among those with a GNP core of 13\u202fnm (P12(G13)) and 5\u202fnm (P12(G5)) in THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. This size-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of the hybrid P12 was also observed in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of ALI. It was found that P12(G20) was superior to P12(G13) in prolonging the survival of mice experiencing lethal LPS challenge, decreasing the acute lung inflammation, and alleviating diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs. Interestingly, P12(G20) could also promote long-term tolerance to endotoxin. Detailed mechanistic studies demonstrated that when compared to the smaller P12(G13), the larger P12(G20) had higher cellular uptake and a stronger endosomal pH buffering capacity, contributing to its enhanced therapeutic effects on reducing TLR4 activation in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study suggests that nanoparticle size is one key factor determining the anti-inflammatory potency of the peptide-GNP hybrids, and the hybrid P12 may serve as a promising, novel class of nanotherapeutics for modulating TLR signaling to treat ALI/ARDS. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We have developed a new class of nanoparticle-based inhibitors (i.e., peptide-GNP hybrids) targeting TLR4 signaling in macrophages. Through evidence-based engineering of the nanoparticle size, surface peptide ligand density and effective amino acid (phenylalanine, F) chain length, we identified a peptide-GNP hybrid, P12(G20), with enhanced anti-inflammatory activity. Specifically, P12(G20) was more potent in reducing inflammation in THP-1 cell-derived macrophages and in a LPS-induced ALI mouse model. More interestingly, P12(G20) facilitated long-term protection against lethal LPS challenge in vivo and induced endotoxin tolerance in vitro. We anticipate that these new hybrids would serve as the next generation anti-inflammatory nano-therapeutics for the treatment of ALI/ARDS or other acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.", "Keywords": ["Acute lung injury", "Anti-inflammatory therapeutics", "Bioactive nanoparticles", "Nanodrug", "Peptide", "Toll-like receptor signaling"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Lung Injury", "Animals", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gold", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Particle Size", "Peptides", "Phenylalanine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shool of Medicine, Shanghai 201620, China."}, {"First Name": "Yulu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"First Name": "Ye", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China."}, {"First Name": "Liya", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shool of Medicine, Shanghai 201620, China."}, {"First Name": "Lu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shool of Medicine, Shanghai 201620, China."}, {"First Name": "Kun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shool of Medicine, Shanghai 201620, China."}, {"First Name": "Henry Y", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 4H4, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Aihua", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shool of Medicine, Shanghai 201620, China."}, {"First Name": "Stuart E", "Last Name": "Turvey", "Affiliation": "BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 4H4, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shool of Medicine, Shanghai 201620, China; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai 200120, China.

Here, we investigated the functions of key acetyltransferases CBP/p300 in adipose remodeling and their physiological effects by generating adipose-specific deletion of CBP (Cbp-AKO), p300 (p300-AKO) and double-knockout (Cbp/p300-AKO) models. We demonstrated that Cbp-AKO exhibited marked brown remodeling of inguinal WAT (iWAT) but not epididymal WAT (eWAT) after cold exposure and that this pattern was exaggerated in diet-induced obesity (DIO). Despite this striking browning phenotype, loss of Cbp was insufficient to impact body weight or glucose tolerance. In contrast, ablation of p300 in adipose tissues had minimal effects on fat remodeling and adiposity. Surprisingly, double-knockout mice (Cbp/p300-AKO) developed severe lipodystrophy along with marked hepatic steatosis, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of Cbp and p300 activity suppressed adipogenesis. Collectively, these data suggest that (i) CBP, but not p300, has distinct functions in regulating fat remodeling and that this occurs in a depot-selective manner; (ii) brown remodeling occurs independently of the improvements in glucose metabolism and obesity and (iii) the combined roles of CBP and p300 are indispensable for normal adipose development.", "Keywords": ["Cbp/p300", "acetyltransferase", "adipocyte", "browning", "fat remodeling", "lipodystrophy", "obesity"], "MeSH terms": ["3T3-L1 Cells", "Adipogenesis", "Adipose Tissue, Brown", "Adipose Tissue, White", "Adiposity", "Animals", "Diet, High-Fat", "Glucose", "Lipodystrophy", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Obesity", "Thermogenesis", "p300-CBP Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Namwanje", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Longhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikki", "Last Name": "Aaron", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Kraakman", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of endocrinology", "PubDate": "2019Feb01"}, {"PMID": "30452728", "Title": "Are the Same Health Warnings Effective Across Different Countries?

Nevertheless, it is not completely understood how p53-mediated metabolic activities are regulated in vivo and whether this part of the activities has an independent role beyond tumor suppression. Mdmx (also called Mdm4), like Mdm2, acts as a major suppressor of p53 but the embryonic lethality of mdmx-null mice creates difficulties to evaluate its physiological significance in metabolism. Here, we report that the embryonic lethality caused by the deficiency of mdmx, in contrast to the case for mdm2, is fully rescued in the background of p533KR/3KR , an acetylation-defective mutant unable to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis. p533KR/3KR/mdmx-/- mice are healthy but skinny without obvious developmental defects. p533KR/3KR/mdmx-/- mice are resistant to fat accumulation in adipose tissues upon high fat diet. Notably, the levels of p53 protein are only slightly increased and can be further induced upon DNA damage in p533KR/3KR/mdmx-/- mice, suggesting that Mdmx is only partially required for p53 degradation in vivo. Further analyses indicate that the anti-obesity phenotypes in p533KR/3KR/mdmx-/- mice are caused by activation of lipid oxidation and thermogenic programs in adipose tissues. These results demonstrate the specific effects of the p53/Mdmx axis in lipid metabolism and adipose tissue remodeling and reveal a surprising role of Mdmx inhibition in anti-obesity effects beyond, commonly expected, tumor suppression.

Due to dramatic global forest change over the past decades, the importance of including forest or vegetation change in the assessment of water resources under climate change has been highly recognized by Intergovernmental Panel\u00a0on Climate Change (IPCC); however, this importance has not yet been examined quantitatively across the globe. Here, we used four remote sensing-based indices to represent changes in vegetation cover in forest-dominated regions, and then applied them to widely used models: the Fuh model and the Choudhury-Yang model to assess relative contributions of vegetation and climate change to annual runoff variations from 2000 to 2011 in forested landscape (forest coverage >30%) across the globe. Our simulations show that the global average variation in annual runoff due to change in vegetation cover is 30.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.5% with the rest attributed to climate change. Large annual runoff variation in response to vegetation change is found in tropical and boreal forests due to greater forest losses. Our simulations also demonstrate both offsetting and additive effects of vegetation cover and climate in determining water resource change.

However, there have been limited compounds available so far to attenuate TLR signaling and there have been no clinically approved TLR inhibitors (except the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine) in clinical use. In light of rapid advances in nanotechnology, manipulation of immune responsiveness using nano-devices may provide a new strategy to treat these diseases. Herein, we present a high throughput screening method for quickly identifying novel bioactive nanoparticles that inhibit TLR signaling in phagocytic immune cells. This screening platform is built on THP-1 cell-based reporter cells with colorimetric and luciferase assays. The reporter cells are engineered from the human THP-1 monocytic cell line by stable integration of two inducible reporter constructs. One expresses a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene under the control of a promoter inducible by the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1, and the other expresses a secreted luciferase reporter gene under the control of promoters inducible by interferon regulatory factors (IRFs).Upon TLR stimulation, the reporter cells activate transcription factors and subsequently produce SEAP and/or luciferase, which can be detected using their corresponding substrate reagents. Using a library of peptide-gold nanoparticle (GNP) hybrids established in our previous studies as an example, we identified one peptide-GNP hybrid that could effectively inhibit the two arms of TLR4 signaling cascade triggered by its prototypical ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The findings were validated by standard biochemical techniques including immunoblotting. Further analysis established that this lead hybrid had a broad inhibitory spectrum, acting on multiple TLR pathways, including TLR2, 3, 4, and 5. This experimental approach allows a rapid assessment of whether a nanoparticle (or other therapeutic compounds) can modulate specific TLR signaling in phagocytic immune cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alkaline Phosphatase", "Cell Line", "Genes, Reporter", "Gold", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Luciferases", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Monocytes", "NF-kappa B", "Phagocytosis", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 4", "Toll-Like Receptors", "Transcription Factor AP-1"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine; hongyang36@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Shan Yu", "Last Name": "Fung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital and University of British Columbia."}, {"First Name": "Aihua", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Stuart E", "Last Name": "Turvey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital and University of British Columbia."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2017Jul26"}, {"PMID": "28677104", "Title": "The dark side of browning.", "Abstract": "The induction of brown-like adipocyte development in white adipose tissue (WAT) confers numerous metabolic benefits by decreasing adiposity and increasing energy expenditure.

A combination of map-based cloning and whole-genome sequencing identified the genetic basis underlying the fatty acid phenotype as a lesion in the plant-specific eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIFiso4G1. Transcriptome analysis on developing seeds revealed a reduced level of plastid-encoded genes. Specifically, decreases in both transcript and protein levels of an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, the \u03b2-subunit of the plastidic heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (htACCase) encoded by accD, were evident in the mutant. Biochemical assays showed that the developing seeds of the mutant possessed a decreased htACCase activity in the plastid but an elevated activity of homomeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (hmACCase). These results suggested that the increased 20:1 was attributable at least in part to the enhanced cytosolic hmACCase activity. We also detected a significant repression of FATTY ACID DESATURASE 3 (FAD3) during seed development, which correlated with a decreased 18:3 level in seed oil.

Raptor prevents hepatic steatosis by stabilizing PHLPP2.", "Abstract": "Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), defined by the presence of Raptor, is an evolutionarily conserved and nutrient-sensitive regulator of cellular growth and other metabolic processes. To date, all known functions of Raptor involve its scaffolding mTOR kinase with substrate. Here we report that mTORC1-independent ('free') Raptor negatively regulates hepatic Akt activity and lipogenesis. Free Raptor levels in liver decline with age and in obesity; restoration of free Raptor levels reduces liver triglyceride content, through reduced \u03b2-TrCP-mediated degradation of the Akt phosphatase, PHLPP2. Commensurately, forced PHLPP2 expression ameliorates hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice. These data suggest that the balance of free and mTORC1-associated Raptor governs hepatic lipid accumulation, and uncover the potentially therapeutic role of PHLPP2 activators in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Blood Glucose", "Blotting, Western", "Chromatography, Gel", "Diet, High-Fat", "Fatty Liver", "Hepatocytes", "Immunoprecipitation", "Insulin", "Lipogenesis", "Liver", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Mice", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Obesity", "Oncogene Protein v-akt", "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases", "Regulatory-Associated Protein of mTOR", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Triglycerides", "beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "KyeongJin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Hayden", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David P", "Last Name": "Sparling", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole H", "Last Name": "Purcell", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2016Jan08"}, {"PMID": "26074075", "Title": "Hepatic SirT1-Dependent Gain of Function of Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase-1 Conveys Dysmetabolic and Tumor Progression Functions.", "Abstract": "Obesity is associated with higher incidence of cancer, but the predisposing mechanisms remain poorly understood. The NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SirT1 orchestrates metabolism, cellular survival, and growth. However, there is no unifying mechanism to explain the metabolic and tumor-related effects of SirT1. In this work, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the endogenous inhibitor of SirT1, Deleted-in-Breast-Cancer-1 (Dbc1), unexpectedly results in obesity and insulin resistance. Dbc1 deficiency promoted SirT1-dependent gain of function of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1), increasing plasma and tissue levels of unsaturated fatty acids. The metabolic abnormalities in Dbc1(-/-) mice were reversed by ablation of hepatic SirT1 or by inhibition of Scd1 activity. Furthermore, loss of Dbc1 impaired activation of the master tumor suppressor p53 and treatment with an Scd1 inhibitor extended survival of tumor-prone TP53(-/-) mice by decreasing tumor-related death. Together, our findings illustrate a shared mechanism of obesity and tumor progression mediated by hepatic SirT1 and resulting in the activation of a key lipid synthetic enzyme, with potential therapeutic implications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Insulin Resistance", "Liver", "Liver Neoplasms", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Obesity", "Sirtuin 1", "Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY\u00a010032,\u00a0USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenhui", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY\u00a010032,\u00a0USA."}, {"First Name": "Le", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY\u00a010032,\u00a0USA."}, {"First Name": "Colette M", "Last Name": "Knight", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Diabetes Research Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Utpal", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY\u00a010032,\u00a0USA.

This activation of mTor increases basal Akt activity, leading to a self-perpetuating lipogenic cycle. We have previously shown that the developmental Notch pathway has metabolic functions in adult mouse liver. Acute or chronic inhibition of Notch dampens hepatic glucose production and increases Akt activity and may therefore be predicted to increase hepatic lipid content. Here we now show that constitutive liver-specific ablation of Notch signaling, or its acute inhibition with a decoy Notch1 receptor, prevents hepatosteatosis by blocking mTor complex 1 (mTorc1) activity. Conversely, Notch gain of function causes fatty liver through constitutive activation of mTorc1, an effect that is reversible by treatment with rapamycin. We demonstrate that Notch signaling increases mTorc1 complex stability, augmenting mTorc1 function and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1c (Srebp1c)-mediated lipogenesis. These data identify Notch as a therapeutically actionable branch point of metabolic signaling at which Akt activation in the liver can be uncoupled from hepatosteatosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Body Weight", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Diet, High-Fat", "Enzyme Activation", "Fatty Liver", "Gene Expression Regulation", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lipogenesis", "Liver", "Male", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Protein Stability", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Triglycerides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Utpal B", "Last Name": "Pajvani", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. up2104@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Qiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thaned", "Last Name": "Kangsamaksin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Kitajewski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Henry N", "Last Name": "Ginsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Domenico", "Last Name": "Accili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature medicine", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}]
