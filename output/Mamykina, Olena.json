[{"PMID": "36989473", "Title": "Older Adult Engagement With Symptom Reporting in a COVID-19 Citizen Science Application.", "Abstract": "The current study examined the frequency and predictors of older adults' engagement with symptom reporting in COVIDWATCHER, a mobile health (mHealth) citizen science application. Citizen science is a type of participatory research that leverages information provided by community members. There were 1,028 COVIDWATCHER participants who engaged with symptom reporting between April 2020 and January 2021. Approximately 13.5% (n = 139) were adults aged \u226565 years. We used a Wilcoxon test to compare the mean frequency of engagement with symptom reporting by older adults (i.e., aged \u226565 years) to younger adults (i.e., aged \u226464 years) and multivariable linear regression to explore the predictors of engagement with symptom reporting. There was a significant difference in engagement with symptom reporting between adults aged \u226565 years compared to those aged \u226464 years (p < 0.001). In our final model, age (\u03b2 = 26.0; 95% confidence interval [14.8, 34.2]) was a significant predictor for engagement with symptom reporting. These results help further our understanding of older adult engagement with mHealth-enabled citizen science for symptom reporting.
