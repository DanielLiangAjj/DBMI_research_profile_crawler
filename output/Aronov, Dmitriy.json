Although hippocampal activity represents place and other behaviorally relevant variables, it is unclear how it encodes numerous memories of specific events in life. To study episodic coding, we leveraged the specialized behavior of chickadees-food-caching birds that form memories at well-defined moments in time whenever they cache food for subsequent retrieval. Our recordings during caching revealed very sparse, transient barcode-like patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons. Each \"barcode\" uniquely represented a caching event and transiently reactivated during the retrieval of that specific cache. Barcodes co-occurred with the conventional activity of place cells but were uncorrelated even for nearby cache locations that had similar place codes. We propose that animals recall episodic memories by reactivating hippocampal barcodes. Similarly to computer hash codes, these patterns assign unique identifiers to different events and could be a mechanism for rapid formation and storage of many non-interfering memories.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Birds", "Feeding Behavior", "Food", "Hippocampus", "Memory, Episodic", "Neurons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Selmaan N", "Last Name": "Chettih", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily L", "Last Name": "Mackevicius", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA; Basis Research Institute, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Hale", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dmitriy", "Last Name": "Aronov", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

We designed an apparatus that allows birds to cache and retrieve food at many sites while navigating in a laboratory arena. This apparatus enabled automated tracking of behavioral variables - including caches, retrievals, and investigations of different sites. We built probabilistic models to fit these behavioral data using a combination of mnemonic and non-mnemonic factors.

They combine these strategies with spatially precise memories of which sites contain caches and which sites they have previously checked.

Recordings of neural activity in Uva reveal strong syllable-related modulation, maximally active prior to syllable onsets and minimally active prior to syllable offsets. Furthermore, both song and Uva activity exhibit a pronounced coherent modulation at 10Hz-a pattern observed in downstream premotor areas in adult and, even more prominently, in juvenile birds.
