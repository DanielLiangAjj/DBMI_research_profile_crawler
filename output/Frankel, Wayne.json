[{"PMID": "37873369", "Title": "Heterozygous expression of a Kcnt1 gain-of-function variant has differential effects on SST- and PV-expressing cortical GABAergic neurons.", "Abstract": "More than twenty recurrent missense gain-of-function (GOF) mutations have been identified in the sodium-activated potassium (KNa) channel gene KCNT1 in patients with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), most of which are resistant to current therapies. Defining the neuron types most vulnerable to KCNT1 GOF will advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide refined targets for precision therapy efforts. Here, we assessed the effects of heterozygous expression of a Kcnt1 GOF variant (Y777H) on KNa currents and neuronal physiology among cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in mice, including those expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV), to identify and model the pathogenic mechanisms of autosomal dominant KCNT1 GOF variants in DEEs. Although the Kcnt1-Y777H variant had no effects on glutamatergic or VIP neuron function, it increased subthreshold KNa currents in both SST and PV neurons but with opposite effects on neuronal output; SST neurons became hypoexcitable with a higher rheobase current and lower action potential (AP) firing frequency, whereas PV neurons became hyperexcitable with a lower rheobase current and higher AP firing frequency. Further neurophysiological and computational modeling experiments showed that the differential effects of the Y777H variant on SST and PV neurons are not likely due to inherent differences in these neuron types, but to an increased persistent sodium current in PV, but not SST, neurons. The Y777H variant also increased excitatory input onto, and chemical and electrical synaptic connectivity between, SST neurons. Together, these data suggest differential pathogenic mechanisms, both direct and compensatory, contribute to disease phenotypes, and provide a salient example of how a pathogenic ion channel variant can cause opposite functional effects in closely related neuron subtypes due to interactions with other ionic conductances.", "Keywords": ["ADNFLE", "DEE", "GABAergic", "GOF variant", "KCNT1 channel", "KNa current", "PV", "SST", "Slack", "VIP", "electrophysiology", "epilepsy", "glutamatergic", "potassium channel"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy N", "Last Name": "Shore", "Affiliation": "Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at Virginia Tech Carilion, Center for Neurobiology Research, Roanoke, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keyong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at Virginia Tech Carilion, Center for Neurobiology Research, Roanoke, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mona", "Last Name": "Safari", "Affiliation": "Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at Virginia Tech Carilion, Center for Neurobiology Research, Roanoke, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alshaima'a M", "Last Name": "Qunies", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, UNT System College of Pharmacy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brittany D", "Last Name": "Spitznagel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "C David", "Last Name": "Weaver", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyle A", "Last Name": "Emmitte", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, UNT System College of Pharmacy, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wayne N", "Last Name": "Frankel", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew C", "Last Name": "Weston", "Affiliation": "Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at Virginia Tech Carilion, Center for Neurobiology Research, Roanoke, VA, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May29"}, {"PMID": "37782669", "Title": "Neurodevelopmental deficits and cell-type-specific transcriptomic perturbations in a mouse model of HNRNPU haploinsufficiency.", "Abstract": "Heterozygous de novo loss-of-function mutations in the gene expression regulator HNRNPU cause an early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.

Recent efforts have identified a wide variety of genetic variants that cause DEEs. Among these, variants in the DNM1 gene have emerged as definitive causes of DEEs, including infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. A mouse model of Dnm1-associated DEE, known as \"Fitful\" (Dnm1Ftfl ), recapitulates key features of the disease, including spontaneous seizures, early lethality, and neuronal degeneration. Previous work showed that DNM1 is a key regulator of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis and synaptic transmission and suggested that inhibitory neurotransmission may be more reliant on DNM1 function than excitatory transmission. The Dnm1Ftfl variant is thought to encode a dominant negative DNM1 protein; however, the effects of the Dnm1Ftfl variant on synaptic transmission are largely unknown. To understand these synaptic effects, we recorded from pairs of cultured mouse cortical neurons and characterized all four major connection types [excitation of excitation (E-E), inhibition of inhibition (I-I), E-I, I-E]. Miniature and spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were larger, but less frequent, at all Dnm1Ftfl synaptic types, and Dnm1Ftfl neurons had reduced expression of excitatory and inhibitory SV markers. Baseline evoked transmission, however, was reduced only at inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons, because of a smaller pool of releasable SVs. In addition to these synaptic alterations, Dnm1Ftfl neurons degenerated later in development, although their activity levels were reduced, suggesting that Dnm1Ftfl may impair synaptic transmission and neuronal health through distinct mechanisms.", "Keywords": ["cell death", "dynamin", "encephalopathy", "epilepsy", "network activity", "synaptic transmission"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dynamin I", "Lennox Gastaut Syndrome", "Mice", "Spasms, Infantile", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew P", "Last Name": "McCabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405."}, {"First Name": "Amy N", "Last Name": "Shore", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405."}, {"First Name": "Wayne N", "Last Name": "Frankel", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Matthew C", "Last Name": "Weston", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Sciences, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 mcweston@uvm.edu."}], "Journal": "eNeuro", "PubDate": "2021Mar-Apr"}, {"PMID": "33351789", "Title": "An early endothelial cell-specific requirement for Glut1 is revealed in Glut1 deficiency syndrome model mice.", "Abstract": "Paucity of the glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) protein resulting from haploinsufficiency of the SLC2A1 gene arrests cerebral angiogenesis and disrupts brain function to cause Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS).

Rare variants in GRIN2A encoding the GluN2A subunit are associated with a spectrum of disorders, ranging from mild speech and language delay to intractable neurodevelopmental disorders, including but not limited to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. A de novo missense variant, p.Ser644Gly, was identified in a child with this disorder, and Grin2a knock-in mice were generated to model and extend understanding of this intractable childhood disease. Homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice exhibited altered hippocampal morphology at 2 weeks of age, and all homozygotes exhibited lethal tonic-clonic seizures by mid-third week. Heterozygous adults displayed susceptibility to induced generalized seizures, hyperactivity, repetitive and reduced anxiety behaviours, plus several unexpected features, including significant resistance to electrically-induced limbic seizures and to pentylenetetrazole induced tonic-clonic seizures. Multielectrode recordings of neuronal networks revealed hyperexcitability and altered bursting and synchronicity. In heterologous cells, mutant receptors had enhanced NMDA receptor agonist potency and slow deactivation following rapid removal of glutamate, as occurs at synapses. NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in heterozygous hippocampal slices also showed a prolonged deactivation time course. Standard anti-epileptic drug monotherapy was ineffective in the patient. Introduction of NMDA receptor antagonists was correlated with a decrease in seizure burden. Chronic treatment of homozygous mouse pups with NMDA receptor antagonists significantly delayed the onset of lethal seizures but did not prevent them.

KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and recruits GATOR1, but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2.

Although fitful heterozygotes have milder recurrent seizures later in life, suggesting an additive or semi-dominant mechanism, the molecular etiology must also consider the fact that Dnm1a(Ftfl) exerts a dominant negative effect on endocytosis in vitro. Another complication is that the fitful mutation induces alterations in the relative abundance of Dnm1 splice variants; mutants have a downregulation of Dnm1a and an upregulation of Dnm1b, changes which may contribute to the epileptic pathology. To examine whether Dnm1a loss of function, Dnm1a(Ftfl) dominance or compensation by Dnm1b is the most critical for severe seizures, we studied alternate isoform-specific mutant mice.

Recently, mutations in DNM1 (dynamin 1) have been implicated in two EE syndromes, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Infantile Spasms. Dnm1 encodes dynamin 1, a large multimeric GTPase necessary for activity-dependent membrane recycling in neurons, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Dnm1Ftfl or \"fitful\" mice carry a spontaneous mutation in the mouse ortholog of DNM1 and recapitulate many of the disease features associated with human DNM1 patients, providing a relevant disease model of human EE's. In order to examine the cellular etiology of seizures and behavioral and neurological comorbidities, we engineered a conditional Dnm1Ftfl mouse model of DNM1 EE. Observations of Dnm1Ftfl/flox mice in combination with various neuronal subpopulation specific cre strains demonstrate unique seizure phenotypes and clear separation of major neurobehavioral comorbidities from severe seizures associated with the germline model. This demonstration of pleiotropy suggests that treating seizures per se may not prevent severe comorbidity observed in EE associated with dynamin-1 mutations, and is likely to have implications for other genetic forms of EE.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dynamin I", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Gene Deletion", "Humans", "Infant", "Lennox Gastaut Syndrome", "Male", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Neurons", "Phenotype", "Prosencephalon", "Spasms, Infantile", "Synaptic Transmission"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel K", "Last Name": "Asinof", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stacey J", "Last Name": "Sukoff Rizzo", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra R", "Last Name": "Buckley", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Barbara J", "Last Name": "Beyer", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Verity A", "Last Name": "Letts", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Wayne N", "Last Name": "Frankel", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "Boumil", "Affiliation": "The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "25933409", "Title": "DBA/2J genetic background exacerbates spontaneous lethal seizures but lessens amyloid deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal dysfunction. Early onset AD (EOAD) is commonly caused by mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or genes involved in the processing of APP including the presenilins (e.g. PSEN1 or PSEN2). In general, mouse models relevant to EOAD recapitulate amyloidosis, show only limited amounts of NFTs and neuronal cell dysfunction and low but significant levels of seizure susceptibility. To investigate the effect of genetic background on these phenotypes, we generated APPswe and PSEN1de9 transgenic mice on the seizure prone inbred strain background, DBA/2J. Previous studies show that the DBA/2J genetic background modifies plaque deposition in the presence of mutant APP but the impact of PSEN1de9 has not been tested. Our study shows that DBA/2J.APPswePSEN1de9 mice are significantly more prone to premature lethality, likely to due to lethal seizures, compared to B6.APPswePSEN1de9 mice-70% of DBA/2J.APPswePSEN1de9 mice die between 2-3 months of age. Of the DBA/2J.APPswePSEN1de9 mice that survived to 6 months of age, plaque deposition was greatly reduced compared to age-matched B6.APPswePSEN1de9 mice.

AE and GGE are complex genetic diseases with few causal variants identified to date. Gria4 deficient mice provide a model of AE, one for which the common laboratory inbred strain C3H/HeJ (HeJ) harbors a natural IAP retrotransposon insertion in Gria4 that reduces its expression 8-fold. Between C3H and non-seizing strains such as C57BL/6, genetic modifiers alter disease severity. Even C3H substrains have surprising variation in the duration and incidence of spike-wave discharges (SWD), the characteristic electroencephalographic feature of absence seizures. Here we discovered extensive IAP retrotransposition in the C3H substrain, and identified a HeJ-private IAP in the Pcnxl2 gene, which encodes a putative multi-transmembrane protein of unknown function, resulting in decreased expression. By creating new Pcnxl2 frameshift alleles using TALEN mutagenesis, we show that Pcnxl2 deficiency is responsible for mitigating the seizure phenotype - making Pcnxl2 the first known modifier gene for absence seizures in any species. This finding gave us a handle on genetic complexity between strains, directing us to use another C3H substrain to map additional modifiers including validation of a Chr 15 locus that profoundly affects the severity of SWD episodes.

Here we show that deletion of Mecp2 from cortical excitatory neurons but not forebrain inhibitory neurons in the mouse leads to spontaneous seizures. Selective deletion of Mecp2 from excitatory but not inhibitory neurons in the forebrain reduces GABAergic transmission in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal and somatosensory cortices. Loss of MeCP2 from cortical excitatory neurons reduces the number of GABAergic synapses in the cortex, and enhances the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Using single-cell deletion of Mecp2 in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, we show that GABAergic transmission is reduced in neurons without MeCP2, but is normal in neighboring neurons with MeCP2.

The endocytic proteins dynamin, clathrin, and amphiphysin are expressed and broadly distributed in IHCs. We used confocal vglut1-pHluorin imaging and membrane capacitance (Cm) measurements to study the spatial organization and dynamics of IHC exocytosis and endocytosis. Viral gene transfer expressed vglut1-pHluorin in IHCs and targeted it to synaptic vesicles. The intravesicular pH was \u223c6.5, supporting only a modest increase of vglut1-pHluorin fluorescence during exocytosis and pH neutralization. Ca(2+) influx triggered an exocytic increase of vglut1-pHluorin fluorescence at the AZs, around which it remained for several seconds. The endocytic Cm decline proceeded with constant rate (linear component) after exocytosis of the readily releasable pool (RRP). When exocytosis exceeded three to four RRP equivalents, IHCs additionally recruited a faster Cm decline (exponential component) that increased with the amount of preceding exocytosis and likely reflects bulk endocytosis. The dynamin inhibitor Dyngo-4a and the clathrin blocker pitstop 2 selectively impaired the linear component of endocytic Cm decline. A missense mutation of dynamin 1 (fitful) inhibited endocytosis to a similar extent as Dyngo-4a.

Although it is speculated that elevated Id2 levels contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders, it is unknown whether dysregulated Id2 expression is sufficient to perturb normal brain development or function. Here, we show that mice with elevated Id2 expression during embryonic stages develop microcephaly, and that females in particular are prone to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Analyses of Id2 transgenic brains indicate that Id2 activity is highly cell context specific: elevated Id2 expression in naive neural stem cells (NSCs) in early neuroepithelium induces apoptosis and loss of NSCs and intermediate progenitors. Activation of Id2 in maturing neuroepithelium results in less severe phenotypes and is accompanied by elevation of G1 cyclin expression and p53 target gene expression. In contrast, activation of Id2 in committed intermediate progenitors has no significant phenotype. Functional analysis with Id2-overexpressing and Id2-null NSCs shows that Id2 negatively regulates NSC self-renewal in vivo, in contrast to previous cell culture experiments. Deletion of p53 function from Id2-transgenic brains rescues apoptosis and results in increased incidence of brain tumors. Furthermore, Id2 overexpression normalizes the increased self-renewal of p53-null NSCs, suggesting that Id2 activates and modulates the p53 pathway in NSCs.

To examine the physiological and molecular basis of this, we studied Celf4-deficient neurons in brain slices. Assessment of intrinsic properties of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons showed that neurons from mutant heterozygotes and homozygotes have a lower action potential (AP) initiation threshold and a larger AP gain when compared with wild-type neurons. Celf4 mutant neurons also demonstrate an increase in persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) and a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation.
