Although increasing evidence highlights the relevance of RNA regulation, our understanding of its impact on a fully efficient DNA damage response remains limited. Here, through a targeted CRISPR-knockout screen, we identify RNA-binding proteins and modifiers that participate in the p53 response. Among the top hits, we find the m6A reader YTHDC1 as a master regulator of p53 expression. YTHDC1 binds to the transcription start sites of TP53 and other genes involved in the DNA damage response, promoting their transcriptional elongation. YTHDC1 deficiency also causes the retention of introns and therefore aberrant protein production of key DNA damage factors. While YTHDC1-mediated intron retention requires m6A, TP53 transcriptional pause-release is promoted by YTHDC1 independently of m6A. Depletion of YTHDC1 causes genomic instability and aberrant cancer cell proliferation mediated by genes regulated by YTHDC1. Our results uncover YTHDC1 as an orchestrator of the DNA damage response through distinct mechanisms of co-transcriptional mRNA regulation.", "Keywords": ["DDR", "RNAPII Pausing", "Splicing", "YTHDC1", "p53"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Elvira-Bl\u00e1zquez", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 Miguel", "Last Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Justel", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Aida", "Last Name": "Arcas", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Luisa", "Last Name": "Statello", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Enrique", "Last Name": "Go\u00f1i", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Jovanna", "Last Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Benedetta", "Last Name": "Ricci", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Zaccara", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivan", "Last Name": "Raimondi", "Affiliation": "New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA. iraimondi@nygenome.org."}, {"First Name": "Maite", "Last Name": "Huarte", "Affiliation": "Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. maitehuarte@unav.es."}], "Journal": "The EMBO journal", "PubDate": "2024Jul01"}, {"PMID": "38531646", "Title": "Understanding the redundant functions of the m6A-binding YTHDF proteins.", "Abstract": "N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modified nucleotide in mRNA, and it has important functions in mRNA regulation.

The original view was that different m6A sites within an mRNA could have different functions depending on which YTHDF paralog was bound to it, with bound YTHDF1 inducing translation, while bound YTHDF2 induced mRNA degradation. As a result, each YTHDF was proposed to have unique physiologic roles that arise from their unique binding properties and regulatory effects on mRNA. More recent data have called much of this into question, showing that all m6A sites bind all YTHDF proteins with equal ability, with a single primary function of all three YTHDF proteins to mediate mRNA degradation.

Therefore, the members of this protein family play crucial roles in gene regulation and several physiological and pathophysiological conditions. YTHDF proteins contain a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the m6A embedded in the RRACH consensus sequence on mRNAs.

We report the organoselenium compound ebselen as the first-in-class inhibitor of the YTHDF m6A-binding domain. Ebselen, whose interaction with YTHDF proteins was validated via orthogonal assays, cannot discriminate between the binding domains of the three YTHDF paralogs but can disrupt the interaction of the YTHDF m6A domain with the m6A-decorated mRNA targets. X-ray, mass spectrometry, and NMR studies indicate that in YTHDF1 ebselen binds close to the m6A cage, covalently to the Cys412 cysteine, or interacts reversibly depending on the reducing environment. We also showed that ebselen engages YTHDF proteins within cells, interfering with their mRNA binding. Finally, we produced a series of ebselen structural analogs that can interact with the YTHDF m6A domain, proving that ebselen expansion is amenable for developing new inhibitors.

Distinguishing these modifications in mapping studies has been difficult. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize PCIF1, the methyltransferase that generates m6Am. We find that PCIF1 binds and is dependent on the m7G cap. By depleting PCIF1, we generated transcriptome-wide maps that distinguish m6Am and m6A.

However, it remains unknown whether the m6A modification controls the differentiation of normal and/or malignant myeloid hematopoietic cells. Here we show that shRNA-mediated depletion of the m6A-forming enzyme METTL3 in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) promotes cell differentiation, coupled with reduced cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type METTL3, but not of a catalytically inactive form of METTL3, inhibits cell differentiation and increases cell growth. METTL3 mRNA and protein are expressed more abundantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells than in healthy HSPCs or other types of tumor cells. Furthermore, METTL3 depletion in human myeloid leukemia cell lines induces cell differentiation and apoptosis and delays leukemia progression in recipient mice in vivo. Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A coupled with ribosome profiling reveals that m6A promotes the translation of c-MYC, BCL2 and PTEN mRNAs in the human acute myeloid leukemia MOLM-13 cell line. Moreover, loss of METTL3 leads to increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, which contributes to the differentiation-promoting effects of METTL3 depletion. Overall, these results provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of METTL3 in myeloid leukemia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Differentiation",

"Title": "Identification of a core TP53 transcriptional program with highly distributed tumor suppressive activity.", "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene product in human cancer. Close to half of all solid tumors carry inactivating mutations in the TP53 gene, while in the remaining cases, TP53 activity is abrogated by other oncogenic events, such as hyperactivation of its endogenous repressors MDM2 or MDM4. Despite identification of hundreds of genes regulated by this transcription factor, it remains unclear which direct target genes and downstream pathways are essential for the tumor suppressive function of TP53. We set out to address this problem by generating multiple genomic data sets for three different cancer cell lines, allowing the identification of distinct sets of TP53-regulated genes, from early transcriptional targets through to late targets controlled at the translational level. We found that although TP53 elicits vastly divergent signaling cascades across cell lines, it directly activates a core transcriptional program of \u223c100 genes with diverse biological functions, regardless of cell type or cellular response to TP53 activation. This core program is associated with high-occupancy TP53 enhancers, high levels of paused RNA polymerases, and accessible chromatin. Interestingly, two different shRNA screens failed to identify a single TP53 target gene required for the anti-proliferative effects of TP53 during pharmacological activation in vitro. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis of thousands of cancer genomes revealed that none of these core target genes are frequently inactivated in tumors expressing wild-type TP53. These results support the hypothesis that TP53 activates a genetically robust transcriptional program with highly distributed tumor suppressive functions acting in diverse cellular contexts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Cycle Proteins", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Neoplasms", "Nuclear Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2", "Transcription, Genetic", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zdenek", "Last Name": "Andrysik", "Affiliation": "Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D", "Last Name": "Galbraith", "Affiliation": "Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna L", "Last Name": "Guarnieri", "Affiliation": "Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Zaccara", "Affiliation": "Centre for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, 38123 Trento, TN, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Kelly D", "Last Name": "Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ahwan", "Last Name": "Pandey", "Affiliation": "Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Morgan", "Last Name": "MacBeth", "Affiliation": "Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Inga", "Affiliation": "Centre for Integrative Biology (CIBIO), University of Trento, 38123 Trento, TN, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Joaqu\u00edn M", "Last Name": "Espinosa", "Affiliation": "Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA."}], "Journal": "Genome research", "PubDate": "2017Oct"}, {"PMID": "26081755", "Title": "Whole-genome cartography of p53 response elements ranked on transactivation potential.", "Abstract": "Many recent studies using ChIP-seq approaches cross-referenced to trascriptome data and also to potentially unbiased in vitro DNA binding selection experiments are detailing with increasing precision the p53-directed gene regulatory network that, nevertheless, is still expanding.

To investigate a possible crosstalk between p53 and NF\u03baB driven by chemotherapy-induced responses in the context of an inflammatory microenvironment, we performed a proof of concept study using MCF7 cells. Transcriptome analyses upon single or combined treatments with doxorubicin (Doxo, 1.5\u03bcM) and the NF\u03baB inducer TNF-alpha (TNF\u03b1, 5ng/ml) revealed 432 up-regulated (log2 FC> 2), and 390 repressed genes (log2 FC< -2) for the Doxo+TNF\u03b1 treatment. 239 up-regulated and 161 repressed genes were synergistically regulated by the double treatment. Annotation and pathway analyses of Doxo+TNF\u03b1 selectively up-regulated genes indicated strong enrichment for cell migration terms. A panel of genes was examined by qPCR coupled to p53 activation by Doxo, 5-Fluoruracil and Nutlin-3a, or to p53 or NF\u03baB inhibition. Transcriptome data were confirmed for 12 of 15 selected genes and seven (PLK3, LAMP3, ETV7, UNC5B, NTN1, DUSP5, SNAI1) were synergistically up-regulated after Doxo+TNF\u03b1 and dependent both on p53 and NF\u03baB. Migration assays consistently showed an increase in motility for MCF7 cells upon Doxo+TNF\u03b1. A signature of 29 Doxo+TNF\u03b1 highly synergistic genes exhibited prognostic value for luminal breast cancer patients, with adverse outcome correlating with higher relative expression.
