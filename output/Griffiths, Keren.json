While we have gained insight into mPTP biology over the last several decades, the lack of translation of this knowledge into successful clinical therapies underscores the need for continued investigation and use of different approaches to identify novel regulators of the mPTP with the hope of elucidating new therapeutic targets. Although the mPTP is known to be a voltage-gated channel, the identity of its voltage sensor remains unknown. Here we found decreased gating potential of the mPTP and increased expression and activity of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) in newborn Fragile X syndrome (FXS) mouse heart mitochondria, a model system of coenzyme Q excess and relatively decreased mPTP open probability. We further found that pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing of SQOR increased mPTP open probability in\u00a0vitro in adult murine cardiac mitochondria and in the isolated-perfused heart, likely by interfering with voltage sensing. Thus, SQOR is proposed to contribute to voltage sensing by the mPTP and may be a component of the voltage sensing apparatus that modulates the gating potential of the mPTP.", "Keywords": ["Sqor", "coenzyme Q", "mitochondria", "permeability transition pore", "proton leak", "sulfide quinone oxidoreductase", "ubiquinone", "voltage regulator"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Mitochondria, Heart", "Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore", "Sulfides", "Oxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Keren K", "Last Name": "Griffiths", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aili", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Jonas", "Affiliation": "Section of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology", "PubDate": "2024Feb29"}, {"PMID": "35923108", "Title": "Modeling propofol-induced cardiotoxicity in the isolated-perfused newborn mouse heart.", "Abstract": "Infants and children are vulnerable to developing propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) and young age is a risk factor. Cardiac involvement is often prominent and associated with death. However, the mechanisms of pediatric PRIS are poorly understood because of the paucity of investigation and lack of a gold standard animal model. Unfortunately, in vivo modeling of PRIS in a newborn mouse is not feasible and would be complicated by confounders. Thus, we focused on propofol-induced cardiotoxicity and aimed to develop an ex-vivo model in the isolated-perfused newborn mouse heart. We hypothesized that the model would recapitulate the key cardiac features of PRIS seen in infants and children and would corroborate prior in vitro observations. Isolated perfused newborn mouse hearts were exposed to a toxic dose of propofol or intralipid for 30-min. Surface electrocardiogram, ventricular contractile force, and oxygen extraction were measured over time. Real-time multiphoton laser imaging was utilized to quantify calcein and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester fluorescence. Propidium iodide uptake was assessed following drug exposure. A toxic dose of propofol rapidly induced dysrhythmias, depressed ventricular contractile function, impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased open probability of the permeability transition pore in propofol-exposed hearts without causing cell death. These features mimicked the hallmarks of pediatric PRIS and corroborated prior observations made in isolated newborn cardiomyocyte mitochondria. Thus, acute propofol-induced cardiotoxicity in the isolated-perfused developing mouse heart may serve as a relevant ex-vivo model for pediatric PRIS.", "Keywords": ["Langendorff preparation", "cardiotoxicity", "heart", "isolated-perfused heart", "model", "newborn", "propofol", "propofol infusion syndrome"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Cardiotoxicity", "Heart", "Humans", "Mice", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Propofol"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew B", "Last Name": "Barajas", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aili", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Keren K", "Last Name": "Griffiths", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linlin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Physiological reports", "PubDate": "2022Aug"}, {"PMID": "35723461", "Title": "Assessment of Open Probability of the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore in the Setting of Coenzyme Q Excess.", "Abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a voltage-gated, nonselective, inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) mega-channel important in health and disease. The mPTP mediates leakage of protons across the IMM during low-conductance opening and is specifically inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA). Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a regulator of the mPTP, and tissue-specific differences have been found in CoQ content and open probability of the mPTP in forebrain and heart mitochondria in a newborn mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS, Fmr1 knockout). We developed a technique to determine the voltage threshold for mPTP opening in this mutant strain, exploiting the role of the mPTP as a proton leak channel. To do so, oxygen consumption and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) were simultaneously measured in isolated mitochondria using polarography and a tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) ion-selective electrode during leak respiration. The threshold for mPTP opening was determined by the onset of CsA-mediated inhibition of proton leak at specific membrane potentials. Using this approach, differences in voltage gating of the mPTP were precisely defined in the context of CoQ excess.

We previously found hyperthermia in a newborn mouse model of fragile\u00a0X\u00a0syndrome and excessive leak in Fmr1 KO forebrain mitochondria caused by CoQ deficiency. The inefficient thermogenic nature of Fmr1 mutant forebrain mitochondria was reminiscent of BAT metabolic features. Thus, we aimed to characterize BAT mitochondrial function in these hyperthermic mice using a top-down approach. Although there was no change in steady-state levels of UCP1 expression between strains, BAT weighed significantly less in Fmr1 mutants compared with controls. Fmr1 KO BAT mitochondria demonstrated impaired substrate oxidation, lower mitochondrial membrane potentials and rates of respiration, and CoQ deficiency. The CoQ analog decylubiquinone normalized CoQ-dependent electron flux and unmasked excessive proton leak. Unlike mutant forebrain, where such deficiency resulted in pathological proton leak, CoQ deficiency within BAT mitochondria resulted largely in abnormal substrate oxidation. This suggests that CoQ is important in BAT for uncoupled respiration to produce heat during development. Although our data provide further evidence of a link between fragile\u00a0X\u00a0mental retardation protein (FMRP) and CoQ biosynthesis, the results highlight the importance of CoQ in developing tissues and suggest tissue-specific differences from CoQ deficiency.
