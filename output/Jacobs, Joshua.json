[{"PMID": "38948829", "Title": "Theta-phase locking of single neurons during human spatial memory.", "Abstract": "The precise timing of single-neuron activity in relation to local field potentials may support various cognitive functions. Extensive research in rodents, along with some evidence in humans, suggests that single-neuron activity at specific phases of theta oscillations plays a crucial role in memory processes. Our fundamental understanding of such theta-phase locking in humans and its dependency on basic electrophysiological properties of the local field potential is still limited, however. Here, using single-neuron recordings in epilepsy patients performing a spatial memory task, we thus aimed at improving our understanding of factors modulating theta-phase locking in the human brain. Combining a generalized-phase approach for frequency-adaptive theta-phase estimation with time-resolved spectral parameterization, our results show that theta-phase locking is a strong and prevalent phenomenon across human medial temporal lobe regions, both during spatial memory encoding and retrieval. Neuronal theta-phase locking increased during periods of elevated theta power, when clear theta oscillations were present, and when aperiodic activity exhibited steeper slopes. Theta-phase locking was similarly strong during successful and unsuccessful memory, and most neurons activated at similar theta phases between encoding and retrieval. Some neurons changed their preferred theta phases between encoding and retrieval, in line with the idea that different memory processes are separated within the theta cycle. Together, these results help disentangle how different properties of local field potentials and memory states influence theta-phase locking of human single neurons. This contributes to a better understanding of how interactions between single neurons and local field potentials may support human spatial memory.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tim A", "Last Name": "Guth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Armin", "Last Name": "Brandt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter C", "Last Name": "Reinacher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Schulze-Bonhage", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lukas", "Last Name": "Kunz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun20"}, {"PMID": "38819395", "Title": "Efficacy and Safety of Donidalorsen for Hereditary Angioedema.", "Abstract": "Hereditary angioedema is a rare disorder characterized by episodic, potentially life-threatening swelling caused by kallikrein-kinin dysregulation.

One potential mechanism for this coordination is a travelling wave, in which a neural oscillation propagates across the brain while organizing the order and timing of activity across regions. Although travelling waves are present across the brain in various species, their potential functional relevance has remained unknown. Here, using rare direct human brain recordings, we demonstrate a distinct functional role for travelling waves of theta- and alpha-band (2-13\u2009Hz) oscillations in the cortex. Travelling waves propagate in different directions during separate cognitive processes. In episodic memory, travelling waves tended to propagate in a posterior-to-anterior direction during successful memory encoding and in an anterior-to-posterior direction during recall. Because travelling waves of oscillations correspond to local neuronal spiking, these patterns indicate that rhythmic pulses of activity move across the brain in different directions for separate behaviours. More broadly, our results suggest a fundamental role for travelling waves and oscillations in dynamically coordinating neural connectivity, by flexibly organizing the timing and directionality of network interactions across the cortex to support cognition and behaviour.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Theta Rhythm", "Alpha Rhythm", "Male", "Adult", "Memory, Episodic", "Female", "Cerebral Cortex", "Young Adult", "Mental Recall"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Uma R", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Honghui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Amazon Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bard", "Last Name": "Ermentrout", "Affiliation": "Department of Mathematics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA. joshua.jacobs@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature human behaviour", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38390820", "Title": "Association Between Pharmacy Proximity With Cardiovascular Medication Use and Risk Factor Control in the United States.", "Abstract": "Poor neighborhood-level access to health care, including community pharmacies, contributes to cardiovascular disparities in the United States.

When patients encoded and retrieved particular memories, the relevant object-specific and place-specific neurons activated together during hippocampal ripples.

A more detailed understanding of these topics might prove helpful to clinicians seeking guidance for how best to care for Jewish patients, to anyone supporting dying individuals, or to anyone interested in learning more about the subject. The objectives of this chapter are to examine Jewish approaches to key bioethical issues surrounding palliative care, to analyze meaning-making rituals following a loss, at a funeral, and throughout mourning, and to explore Jewish beliefs in an afterlife. Research was collected from sacred texts, legal codes, modern rabbinic responsa literature, and secondary sources. Core, guiding principles include human beings' creation \"in the image of God,\" an obligation to save life, an obligation to mitigate pain, a prohibition against self-harm and hastening death, respect for the dead, and ritualized mourning periods (\"shiva,\" \"shloshim,\" and \"shanah\"), which feature special liturgy (\"kaddish\") and practices. Judaism is a religion that values thorough questioning, debate, and argumentation. It also encompasses diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and various denominations. Many Jews are also unaffiliated with a movement or rarely engage with traditional law altogether. For all of these reasons, no summary can comprehensively encapsulate the wide range of opinions that exist around any given topic. That said, what follows is a detailed overview of traditional Jewish approaches to artificial nutrition/hydration, extubation, dialysis, euthanasia and more.

Common supplementation delivery strategies are generally designed to provide nutrients to the mean of the group instead of an individual. Precision individual supplementation technologies, such as the Super SmartFeed (SSF, C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD, USA), are available but are generally cost prohibitive to producers. These systems require adaptation or training periods for cattle to utilize this technology. The objective of this research was to assess the training and adoption rates of three different groups of cattle (suckling calves, weaned steers, replacement heifers) to the SSF. Successful adaptation was determined if an individual's supplement intake was above the group average of total allotted feed consumed throughout the training period. Suckling calves (n = 31) underwent a 12 d training period on pasture; 45% of suckling calves adapted to the SSF and average daily intake differed (p < 0.0001) by day of training. Weaned steers (n = 79) were trained in drylot for 13 d. Of the weaned steers, 62% were trained to the SSF, and average daily intake differed (p < 0.0001) by day of training. Replacement heifers (n = 63) grazed tall fescue pastures and had access to SSF for 22 d of training. The success rate of replacement heifers was 73%.

Two adult male monkeys made saccades to obtain probabilistic rewards and were sensitive to the (statistically irrelevant) reward on the previous trial. TWs in frontal and parietal areas were stronger in trials that followed a prior reward versus a lack of reward and, in the frontal lobe, correlated with the monkeys' behavioral sensitivity to the prior reward.

Here, combining intracranial brain recordings with pharmacological manipulation, we describe the neurophysiological effects of a cholinergic blocker, scopolamine, on the human hippocampal formation during episodic memory. We found that the memory impairment caused by scopolamine was coupled to disruptions of both the amplitude and phase alignment of theta oscillations (2-10 Hz) during encoding. Across individuals, the severity of theta phase disruption correlated with the magnitude of memory impairment. Further, cholinergic blockade disrupted connectivity within the hippocampal formation.

Whether this translates into differential effects on cardiovascular disease events remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS We used the ACCORD-BP (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure) trial and the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) to emulate target trials of new users of ARBs versus ACEIs on cardiovascular disease events (primary outcome) and death (secondary outcome). We estimated marginal cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and treatment-specific cumulative incidence functions with inverse probability of treatment weights. We identified 3298 new users of ARBs or ACEIs (ACCORD-BP: 374 ARB versus 884 ACEI; SPRINT: 727 ARB versus 1313 ACEI). For participants initiating ARBs versus ACEIs, the inverse probability of treatment weight rate of the primary outcome was 3.2 versus 3.5 per 100 person-years in ACCORD-BP (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.63-1.31]) and 1.8 versus 2.2 per 100 person-years in SPRINT (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.56-1.18]). There were no appreciable differences in pooled analyses, except that ARBs versus ACEIs were associated with a lower death rate (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.37-0.85]). ARBs were associated with a lower rate of the primary outcome among subgroups of male versus female participants, non-Hispanic Black versus non-Hispanic White participants, and those randomly assigned to standard versus intensive blood pressure (Pinteraction: <0.01, 0.05, and <0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS In this secondary analysis of ACCORD-BP and SPRINT, new users of ARB- versus ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens experienced similar cardiovascular disease events rates, with important subgroup differences and lower rates of death overall.

Treatments remain inadequate, in large part, because the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of chronic pain remain poorly understood. Pain biomarkers could potentially identify and measure biological pathways and phenotypical expressions that are altered by pain, provide insight into biological treatment targets, and help identify at-risk patients who might benefit from early intervention. Biomarkers are used to diagnose, track, and treat other diseases, but no validated clinical biomarkers exist yet for chronic pain. To address this problem, the National Institutes of Health Common Fund launched the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) program to evaluate candidate biomarkers, develop them into biosignatures, and discover novel biomarkers for chronification of pain after surgery. This article discusses candidate biomarkers identified by A2CPS for evaluation, including genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, neuroimaging, psychophysical, psychological, and behavioral measures. Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures will provide the most comprehensive investigation of biomarkers for the transition to chronic postsurgical pain undertaken to date. Data and analytic resources generatedby A2CPS will be shared with the scientific community in hopes that other investigators will extract valuable insights beyond A2CPS's initial findings.

It is unknown to what degree commercially available FDC products meet the current hypertension management prescription patterns in the United States. Methods and Results This cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2015 to March 2020 included participants with hypertension taking \u22652 antihypertensive medications (N=2451). After constructing each participant's regimen according to antihypertensive classes used, we estimated the extent to which the 7 class-level FDC regimens available in the United States as of January 2023 would match the regimens used. Among a weighted population of 34.1 million US adults (mean age, 66.0\u2009years; 52.8% women; 69.1% non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity), the proportions using 2, 3, 4, and \u22655 antihypertensive classes were 60.6%, 28.2%, 9.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. The 7 FDC regimens were among 189 total regimens used (3.7%), and 39.2% of the population used one of the FDC regimens (95% CI, 35.5%-43.0%; 13.4 million US adults); 60.8% of the population (95% CI, 57.0%-64.5%; 20.7 million US adults) were using a regimen not available as a class-equivalent FDC product. Conclusions Three in 5 US adults with hypertension taking \u22652 antihypertensive classes are using a regimen that is not commercially available as a class-equivalent FDC product as of January 2023.

Across these findings, there remains an ongoing debate about the core function of the hippocampus and the generality of its representation. Researchers have debated whether the hippocampus's primary role relates to the representation of space, the neural basis of (episodic) memory, or some more general computation that generalizes across various cognitive domains. Within these different perspectives, there is much debate about the nature of feature encodings. Here, we suggest that in order to evaluate hippocampal responses-investigating, for example, whether neuronal representations are narrowly targeted to particular tasks or if they subserve domain-general purposes-a promising research strategy may be the use of multi-task experiments, or more generally switching between multiple task contexts while recording from the same neurons in a given session. We argue that this strategy-when combined with explicitly defined theoretical motivations that guide experiment design-could be a fruitful approach to better understand how hippocampal representations support different behaviors. In doing so, we briefly review key open questions in the field, as exemplified by articles in this special issue, as well as previous work using multi-task experiments, and extrapolate to consider how this strategy could be further applied to probe fundamental questions about hippocampal function.", "Keywords": ["cognitive map", "concept cells", "hippocampus", "multi-task experiments", "neural representation", "place cells", "spatial navigation"], "MeSH terms": ["Hippocampus", "Memory, Episodic", "Neurons", "Space Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claire Z", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Donoghue", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Runnan", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lukas", "Last Name": "Kunz", "Affiliation": "Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Shuo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Hippocampus", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "37028774", "Title": "Has Wrought Cobalt-Chromium-Molybdenum Alloy Changed for the Worse Over Time?", "Abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) failure due to tribocorrosion of modular junctions and resulting adverse local tissue reactions to corrosion debris have seemingly increased over the past few decades.

Overall, our results support a flexible encoding of multiple, distinct aspects of different tasks by single neurons in the human MTL, whereby some individual neurons change the nature of their feature coding between task contexts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Donoghue", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Runnan", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University."}, {"First Name": "Claire Z", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Cameron M", "Last Name": "Holman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas J", "Last Name": "Brandmeir", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, West Virginia University."}, {"First Name": "Shuo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Feb23"}, {"PMID": "36646837", "Title": "Neuronal activity in the human amygdala and hippocampus enhances emotional memory encoding.", "Abstract": "Emotional events comprise our strongest and most valuable memories.

First, 148 participants undergoing intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recording performed an episodic memory task.

High-frequency activity (HFA), a correlate of neuronal spiking activity, increased in both the hippocampus and the amygdala when participants successfully encoded emotional stimuli. Next, in a subset of participants (N\u2009=\u200919), we show that applying high-frequency electrical stimulation to the hippocampus selectively diminished memory for emotional stimuli and specifically decreased HFA. Finally, we show that individuals with depression (N\u2009=\u200919) also exhibit diminished emotion-mediated memory and HFA. By demonstrating how direct stimulation and symptoms of depression unlink HFA, emotion and memory, we show the causal and translational potential of neural activity in the amygdalohippocampal circuit for prioritizing emotionally arousing memories.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Emotions", "Mental Recall", "Hippocampus", "Amygdala", "Brain"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Salman E", "Last Name": "Qasim", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. salman.qasim@mssm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Uma R", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel M", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. joshua.jacobs@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature human behaviour", "PubDate": "2023May"}, {"PMID": "36642982", "Title": "Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Digoxin Loading Doses Based on Ideal Body Weight.", "Abstract": "Intravenous digoxin loading dose recommendations differ between clinical guidelines and Food and Drug Administration packaging for acute rate control.", "Keywords": ["arrhythmias", "digoxin", "dose-response relationship", "dosing", "drug monitoring"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Retrospective Studies", "Ideal Body Weight", "Digoxin", "Body Weight"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jessi L", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandre H", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna B", "Last Name": "Catino", "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Dechand", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}], "Journal": "The Annals of pharmacotherapy", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "36257934", "Title": "Flexibility of functional neuronal assemblies supports human memory.", "Abstract": "Episodic memories, or consciously accessible memories of unique events, represent a key aspect of human cognition.

While material standards for different variations of this alloy exist, there are only minimal requirements with respect to its microstructure which is directly related to the alloy's properties. Thus, a better understanding of the Ti6Al4V microstructure of common contemporary implant components and its effect on the electrochemical behavior is needed; including additively manufactured (AM) devices. Therefore, this study aimed at characterizing the microstructures of conventional and AM total joint replacement components, and to identify the effect of microstructure on the electrochemical behavior. Thus, 22 components from conventional (surgically retrieved cast and wrought implants) and AM implants (not previously implanted) were analysed to characterize microstructure by means of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS), and tested to determine its electrochemical behavior (potentiodynamic polarization and EIS). The microstructure of the conventional implants varied broadly but could be categorized into four groups as to their grain size and shape: fine equiaxed, coarse equiaxed, bimodal, and lamellar. The AM components exhibited a fifth category: lath-type. The AM components had a network of \u03b2-phase along the \u03b1-phase grain boundaries, prior \u03b2-grains, and manufacturing voids. Finally, the electrochemical study showed that the equiaxed coarse grains and lath-type grains (AM components) had inferior electrochemical behavior, whereas cast alloys had superior electrochemical behaviour; fine-grained wrought alloys likely provide the best compromise between electrochemical and mechanical properties.", "Keywords": ["Ti6Al4V", "additive manufacturing", "corrosion behavior", "implant alloy microstructure", "total joint replacements"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mozart Queiroz", "Last Name": "Neto", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, 1611 W, Harrison Street, Suite 201, Chicago, IL-60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simona", "Last Name": "Radice", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, 1611 W, Harrison Street, Suite 201, Chicago, IL-60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah J", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, 1611 W, Harrison Street, Suite 201, Chicago, IL-60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas B", "Last Name": "Frisch", "Affiliation": "Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, 1135 West University Dr, Suite 450, Rochester, MI- 48307, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mathew T", "Last Name": "Mathew", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Rockford, IL, 61107, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alfons", "Last Name": "Fischer", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, 1611 W, Harrison Street, Suite 201, Chicago, IL-60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, 1611 W, Harrison Street, Suite 201, Chicago, IL-60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Pourzal", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, 1611 W, Harrison Street, Suite 201, Chicago, IL-60612, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of bio- and tribo-corrosion", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "35795494", "Title": "Differentiating pulmonary hypertension associated with protein kinase inhibitors.", "Abstract": "Protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) have been implicated in pulmonary vascular toxicities including risk factors for at least three of the five World Health Organization groups of pulmonary hypertension (PH).

To understand the influence of implant alignment and testing control regime, we studied the effect of nine component alignment parameters on TKR volumetric wear in silico. We used a computational framework combining Latin Hypercube sampling design of experiments, finite element analysis, and a numerical model of polyethylene wear, to create a predictive model of how component alignment affects wear rate for each control regime. Nine component alignment parameters were investigated, five femoral variables and four tibial variables. To investigate perturbations of the nine implant alignment variables, two separate 300-point designs were executed, one for each control regime. The results were then used to generate surrogate statistical models using stepwise multiple linear regression. Wear at the neutral position was 4.5mm3/million cycle and 8.6mm3/million cycle for displacement and force-control, respectively. Stepwise multiple linear regression surrogate models were highly significant for each control regime, but force-control generated a stronger predictive model, with a higher R2, more included terms, and a lower RMSE. Both models predicted transverse plane rotational mismatch can lead to large changes in predicted wear; a transverse plane alignment mismatch of 15\u00b0 can elicit a change in wear of up to 5mm3/million cycle, almost double that of neutral alignment.

The main objective of this work was to investigate the potential role of Vitamin E to minimize corrosion-related concerns from CoCrMo hip implants. The study focused on two questions (i) Can Vitamin E inhibit CoCrMo corrosion? and (ii) Does Vitamin E moderate the toxicity associated with the CoCrMo implant particles? In the study (i) the electrochemical experiments (ASTM G61) with different concentrations of Vitamin E (1, 2, 3\u00a0mg/ml against the control) were performed using normal saline and simulated synovial fluid (Bovine calf serum-BCS, 30\u00a0g/L protein, pH 7.4) as electrolytes. The polished CoCrMo disc (Ra 50\u00a0nm) was the working electrode. The findings suggested that both Vitamin E-Saline (45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9%) and Vitamin E-BCS (91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03%) solutions protected against implant corrosion at a Vitamin E concentration of 3\u00a0mg/ml, but Vitamin E-BCS showed protection at all Vitamin E (1-3\u00a0mg/ml) concentration levels. These results suggested that the Vitamin E and the protein present in the BCS imparted additive effects towards the electrochemical inhibition. In the study (ii) the role of Vitamin E in cytotoxicity inhibition was studied using a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (N2a) for CoCrMo particles and Cr ions separately. The CoCrMo particles were generated from a custom-built hip simulator. The alamarBlue assay results suggested that Vitamin E provides significant protection (85% and 75% proliferation) to N2a cells against CoCrMo particles and Cr ions, respectively at 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml concentration, as compared to the control group. However, the results obtained from ROS expression and DNA fiber staining suggest that Vitamin E is only effective against CoCrMo degradation particles and not against Cr ions.

The alloy microstructure exhibits microstructural features such as grain boundaries, hard phases, and segregation bands, which may enable different damage modes, higher material loss, and the potential risk of adverse local tissue reactions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Chromium Alloys", "Cobalt", "Corrosion", "Device Removal", "Female", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molybdenum", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure", "Surface Properties"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie M", "Last Name": "McCarthy", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah J", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mathew T", "Last Name": "Mathew", "Affiliation": "University of Illinois College of Medicine, Rockford, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah J", "Last Name": "Lundberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Pourzal", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA."}], "Journal": "Clinical orthopaedics and related research", "PubDate": "2021Sep01"}, {"PMID": "34003868", "Title": "Metal-induced delayed type hypersensitivity responses potentiate particle induced osteolysis in a sex and age dependent manner.", "Abstract": "It is widely recognized that innate macrophage immune reactions to implant debris are central to the inflammatory responses that drive biologic implant failure over the long term. Less common, adaptive lymphocyte immune reactions to implant debris, such as delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), can also affect implant performance. It is unknown which key patient factors, if any, mediate these adaptive immune responses that potentiate particle/macrophage mediated osteolysis. The objective of this investigation was to determine to what degree known adaptive immune responses to metal implant debris can affect particle-induced osteolysis (PIO); and if this pathomechanism is dependent on: 1) innate immune danger signaling, i.e., NLRP3 inflammasome activity, 2) sex, and/or 3) age. We used an established murine calvaria model of PIO using male and female wild-type C57BL/6 vs. Caspase-1 deficient mice as well as young (12-16 weeks old) vs. aged (18-24 months old) female and male C57BL/6 mice. After induction of metal-DTH, and Cobalt-alloy particle (ASTM F-75, 0.4um median diameter) calvaria challenge, bone resorption was assessed using quantitative micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis and immune responses were assessed by measuring paw inflammation, lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) reactivity and adaptive immune cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-17 (ELISA). Younger aged C57BL/6 female mice exhibited the highest rate and severity of metal sensitivity lymphocyte responses that also translated into higher PIO compared to any other experimental group. The absence of inflammasome/caspase-1 activity significantly suppressed DTH metal-reactivity and osteolysis in both male and female Caspase-1 deficient mice. These murine model results indicate that young female mice are more predisposed to metal-DTH augmented inflammatory responses to wear debris, which is highly influenced by active NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1 danger signaling. If these results are clinically meaningful for orthopedic patients, then younger female individuals should be appropriately assessed and followed for DTH derived peri-implant complications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Bone Resorption", "Caspase 1", "Female", "Humans", "Hypersensitivity", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammasomes", "Interferon-gamma", "Interleukin-17", "Macrophages", "Male", "Metals", "Mice", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Osteolysis", "Prostheses and Implants", "Sex Characteristics", "Skull", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lauryn", "Last Name": "Samelko", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "Caicedo", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kyron", "Last Name": "McAllister", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nadim James", "Last Name": "Hallab", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "33993830", "Title": "The importance of recognizing and managing a rare form of angioedema: hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency.", "Abstract": "The majority of angioedema cases encountered in clinical practice are histamine-mediated (allergic); however, some cases are bradykinin-related (non-allergic) and do not respond to standard anti-allergy medications. Among bradykinin-related angioedema, hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, but chronic and debilitating condition. The majority of HAE is caused by deficiency (type 1) or abnormal function (type 2) of the naturally occurring protein, C1-inhibitor (C1-INH)-a major inhibitor of proteases in the contact (kallikrein-bradykinin cascade), fibrinolytic pathway, and complement systems. Failure to recognize HAE and initiate appropriate intervention can lead to years of pain, disability, impaired quality of life (QoL) and, in cases of laryngeal involvement, it can be life-threatening. HAE must be considered in the differential diagnosis of non-urticarial angioedema, particularly for patients with a history of recurrent angioedema attacks, family history of HAE, symptom onset in childhood/adolescence, prodromal signs/symptoms before swellings, recurrent/painful abdominal symptoms, and upper airway edema. Management strategies for HAE include on-demand treatment for acute attacks, short-term prophylaxis prior to attack-triggering events/procedures, and long-term or routine prophylaxis for attack prevention. Patients should be evaluated at least annually to assess need for routine prophylaxis. HAE specific medications like plasma-derived and recombinant C1-INH products, kallikrein inhibitors, and bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists, have improved management of HAE. While the introduction of intravenous C1-INH represented a major breakthrough in routine HAE prophylaxis, some patients fail to achieve adequate control and others have psychological barriers or experience complications related to intravenous administration. Subcutaneous (SC) C1-INH, SC monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapies, and an oral kallikrein inhibitor offer effective alternatives for HAE attack prevention and may facilitate self-administration. HAE management should be individualized, with QoL improvement being a key goal.

Wear and corrosion are among fundamental processes which cause material loss in a joint biotribological system; the characteristics of wear and corrosion debris are central to determining the in vivo bioreactivity. Much effort has been made elucidating the debris-induced tissue responses. However, due to the complexity of the biological environment of the artificial joint, as well as a lack of effective imaging tools, there is still very little understanding of the size, composition, and concentration of the particles needed to trigger adverse local tissue reactions, including periprosthetic osteolysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIR-I) provides fast biochemical composition analysis in the direct context of underlying physiological conditions with micron-level spatial resolution, and minimal additional sample preparation in conjunction with the standard histopathological analysis workflow. In this study, we have demonstrated that FTIR-I can be utilized to accurately identify fine polyethylene debris accumulation in macrophages that is not achievable using conventional or polarized light microscope with histological staining. Further, a major tribocorrosion product, chromium phosphate, can be characterized within its histological milieu, while simultaneously identifying the involved immune cell such as macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, we have shown the different spectral features of particle-laden macrophages through image clustering analysis. The presence of particle composition variance inside macrophages could shed light on debris evolution after detachment from the implant surface.

Increased reported failure rates associated with the utilization of modular junctions have raised many clinical concerns. Typically, these modular interfaces contain circumferential machining marks (threads or microgrooves), but the effect of the machining marks on the fretting-corrosion behavior of total hip implant materials is unknown. This study reports the effects of microgrooves on the fretting-corrosion behavior of hip implant materials. The flat portions of two cylindrical, polished, CrCrMo alloy pins were loaded horizontally against one rectangular Ti alloy rod. Two surface preparation groups were used for the Ti6Al4V rod (polished and machined). The polished group was prepared using the same methods as the CoCrMo pins. The machined samples were prepared by creating parallel lines on the rod surfaces to represent microgrooves present on the stem tapers of head-neck modular junctions. Newborn calf serum (30\u00a0g/L protein content; 37\u00a0\u00b0C) at pH of levels of 7.6 and 3.0 were used to simulate the normal joint fluid and a lowered pH within a crevice, respectively. The samples were tested in a fretting corrosion apparatus under a 200N normal force and a 1Hz sinusoidal fretting motion with a displacement amplitude of 25\u00a0\u03bcm. All electrochemical measurements were performed with a potentiostat in a three-electrode configuration. The results show significant differences between machined samples and polished samples in both electrochemical and mechanical responses. In all cases, the magnitude of the drop in potential was greater in the machined group compared to the polished group. The machined group showed a lower total dissipated friction energy for the entire test compared to the polished group. Additionally, the potentiostatic test measurements revealed a higher evolved charge in the machined group compared to the polished group at both pH conditions (pH 7.6 and 3.0). The machined surfaces lowered the overall dissipated friction energy at pH 7.6 compared to pH 3.0, but also compromised electrochemical performance in the tested conditions. Therefore, the role of synergistic interaction of wear and corrosion with surface topographical changes is evident from the outcome of the study.

To develop a collaborative approach for cardiology issues and concerns in the care of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients by drawing on the experiences of cardiology pharmacists across the country. On March 26, 2020, a conference call was convened composed of 24 cardiology residency-trained pharmacists (23 actively practicing in cardiology and 1 in critical care) from 16 institutions across the United States to discuss cardiology issues each have encountered with COVID-19 patients. Discussion centered around providing optimal pharmaceutical care while limiting staff exposure. The collaborative of pharmacists found for the ST-elevation myocardial infarction patient, many institutions were diverting COVID-19 rule-out patients to their Emergency Department (ED). Thrombolytics are an alternative to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) allowing for timely treatment of patients and decreased staff exposure. An emergency response grab and go kit includes initial drugs and airway equipment so the patient can be treated and the cart can be left outside the room. Cardiology pharmacists have developed policies and procedures to address monitoring of QT prolonging medications, the use of inhaled prostacyclins, and national drug shortages. Technology has allowed us to practice social distancing, while staying in close contact with our teams, patients, and colleagues and continuing to teach. Residents are engaged in unique decision-making processes with their preceptors and assist as pharmacist extenders.

Impacts of prior RT on tumor recurrence are poorly understood but may increase tumor aggressiveness. Metabolic changes have been investigated in radiation-induced brain injury; however, the tumor-promoting effect following prior radiation is lacking. Since RT is vital to GBM management, we quantified tumor-promoting effects of prior RT on patient-derived intracranial GBM xenografts and characterized metabolic alterations associated with the protumorigenic microenvironment. Human xenografts (GBM143) were implanted into nude mice 24 hrs following 20 Gy cranial radiation vs. sham animals. Tumors in pre-radiated mice were more proliferative and more infiltrative, yielding faster mortality (p < 0.0001). Histologic evaluation of tumor associated macrophage/microglia (TAMs) revealed cells with a more fully activated ameboid morphology in pre-radiated animals. Microdialyzates from radiated brain at the margin of tumor infiltration contralateral to the site of implantation were analyzed by unsupervised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In pre-radiated animals, metabolites known to be associated with tumor progression (i.e., modified nucleotides and polyols) were identified. Whole-tissue metabolomic analysis of pre-radiated brain microenvironment for metabolic alterations in a separate cohort of nude mice using 1H-NMR revealed a significant decrease in levels of antioxidants (glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC)), NAD+, Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates, and rise in energy carriers (ATP, GTP). GSH and ASC showed highest Variable Importance on Projection prediction (VIPpred) (1.65) in Orthogonal Partial least square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA); Ascorbate catabolism was identified by GC-MS. To assess longevity of radiation effects, we compared survival with implantation occurring 2 months vs. 24 hrs following radiation, finding worse survival in animals implanted at 2 months. These radiation-induced alterations are consistent with a chronic disease-like microenvironment characterized by reduced levels of antioxidants and NAD+, and elevated extracellular ATP and GTP serving as chemoattractants, promoting cell motility and vesicular secretion with decreased levels of GSH and ASC exacerbating oxidative stress. Taken together, these data suggest IR induces tumor-permissive changes in the microenvironment with metabolomic alterations that may facilitate tumor aggressiveness with important implications for recurrent glioblastoma. Harnessing these metabolomic insights may provide opportunities to attenuate RT-associated aggressiveness of recurrent GBM.", "Keywords": ["glioblastoma (GBM)", "metabolomics", "radiation therapy (RT)", "recurrence", "tumor microenvironment (TME)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kshama", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ivan", "Last Name": "Vuckovic", "Affiliation": "Metabolomics Core Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Song", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Metabolomics Core Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yuning", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Brett L", "Last Name": "Carlson", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Olson", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xuan-Mai", "Last Name": "Petterson", "Affiliation": "Metabolomics Core Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Slobodan I", "Last Name": "Macura", "Affiliation": "Metabolomics Core Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jann", "Last Name": "Sarkaria", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Terry C", "Last Name": "Burns", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32424312", "Title": "Functionally distinct high and low theta oscillations in the human hippocampus.", "Abstract": "Based on rodent models, researchers have theorized that the hippocampus supports episodic memory and navigation via the theta oscillation, a ~4-10\u00a0Hz rhythm that coordinates brain-wide neural activity.

To characterize human hippocampal theta, we examine the properties of theta oscillations throughout the anterior-posterior length of the hippocampus as neurosurgical subjects performed a virtual spatial navigation task. During virtual movement, we observe hippocampal oscillations at multiple frequencies from 2 to 14\u2009Hz. The posterior hippocampus prominently displays oscillations at ~8-Hz and the precise frequency of these oscillations correlates with the speed of movement, implicating these signals in spatial navigation. We also observe slower ~3\u2009Hz oscillations, but these signals are more prevalent in the anterior hippocampus and their frequency does not vary with movement speed.

Therefore, the volumetric material loss of 59 retrieved tibial liners was quantitatively determined using a coordinate measuring-machine. All retrievals were made of the same polyethylene and design by a single manufacturer. Using time in-situ and linear regression, a wear rate for each liner was determined and corrected for bedding-in. Backside damage was qualitatively scored. The following implant positioning parameters were obtained from radiographs: anatomical lateral-distal femoral angle, anatomical medial-proximal tibial angle, femoral tilt angle, and posterior tibial slope. The patella position was assessed by the Blackburne-Peel index and the Insall-Salvati ratio. Unlike the Insall-Salvati ratio, the Blackburne-Peel index is known to detect surgical joint line elevation. Using general linear modeling the most impactful factors on wear rate and backside damage was determined, thereby taking patient demographic factors into account. The mean volumetric wear rate was 11.6\u2009mm3 /y. Wear decreased with older age (P\u2009=\u2009.021) and female sex (P\u2009=\u2009.001).

The backside damage score also increased with joint line elevation (P\u2009=\u2009.036). A Blackburne-Peel index decrease of 0.1, signifying joint line elevation, was found to increase the wear rate by 1.8\u2009mm3 /y and increase back-sided wear.

However, methods for transitioning between oral, inhaled, and parenteral formulations are not well-established, except in the form of case reports and case series. Collectively, these emphasize the lack of a standardized process and approach in transitioning patients between PAH prostanoid therapies. In this case series, we report our experience at an accredited Pulmonary Hypertension center in transitioning between various oral, inhaled, and parenteral prostanoids to offer additional guidance on safe transitions in therapy. Methods: All cases of prostanoid transitions at an accredited Pulmonary Hypertension center from March 2018 to September 2019 were included in this report. The transition approach for each case was developed through a review of the literature, extrapolation of available pharmacokinetic data, and collaboration between pharmacists and clinicians. Results: This case series describes the transition of 3 patients from selexipag to parenteral treprostinil; 1 patient transitioning from parenteral treprostinil to selexipag; 1 patient transitioning from oral treprostinil to parenteral treprostinil; and 1 patient transitioning from inhaled treprostinil to selexipag. Four of the 6 patients presented here were transitioned to an alternate prostanoid on account of clinical worsening, while the remaining 2 patients transitioned due to intolerance of parenteral therapy and poor medication adherence. This case series includes patients with various etiologies of PAH including idiopathic PAH, methamphetamine-associated PAH, and scleroderma-associated PAH. All patients successfully completed each transition without serious adverse events. Conclusions: With the increasing utilization and availability of prostanoids, there is a critical need for a standardized approach in transitioning safely between different formulations without compromising treatment efficacy.

Clinically, ALTR appears as benign, aseptic masses or bursae in the periprosthetic tissues. Histopathologically, ALTRs are distinguished by an intense lymphocyte infiltrate, destruction of the synovial surfaces, widespread necrosis, and fibrin exudate. Tribocorrosion of modular junctions appears to be the cause of ALTR in MOP patients. The various tribocorrosion damage modes occurring at modular junctions produce metal ions and a diversity of particulates in relation to size, chemical composition, and structure.

In addition to behaviors that require an animal to attend to the current spatial location, navigating to remote destinations is a common part of daily life. To examine the neural basis of these behaviors, we recorded single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients playing Treasure Hunt, a virtual-reality spatial-memory task. By analyzing how the activity of these neurons related to behavior in Treasure Hunt, we found that the firing rates of many MTL neurons during navigation significantly changed depending on the position of the current spatial target. In addition, we observed neurons whose firing rates during navigation were tuned to specific heading directions in the environment, and others whose activity changed depending on the timing within the trial.

This study utilized Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIR-I) to gain a better understanding of the chemical structure of implant debris and its impact on the surrounding biological environment. Therefore, retrieved joint capsule tissue from five total hip replacement patients was analyzed. All five cases presented different implant designs and histopathological patterns. All tissue samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Unstained, 5 \u03bcm thick sections were prepared. The unstained sections were placed on BaF2 windows and deparaffinized with xylene prior to analysis. FTIR-I data were collected at a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1 using an Agilent Cary 670 spectrometer coupled with Cary 620 FTIR microscope. The results of study demonstrated that FTIR-I is a powerful tool that can be used complimentary to the existing histopathological evaluation of tissue. FTIR-I was able to distinguish areas with different cell types (macrophages, lymphocytes). Small, but distinct differences could be detected depending on the state of cells (viable, necrotic) and depending on what type of debris was present (polyethylene [PE], suture material, and metal oxides). Although, metal oxides were mainly below the measurable range of FTIR-I, the infrared spectra of tissues exhibited noticeable difference in their presence. Tens of micrometer sized polyethylene particles could be easily imaged, but also accumulations of submicron particles could be detected within macrophages. FTIR-I was also able to distinguish between PE debris, and other birefringent materials such as suture. Chromium-phosphate particles originating from corrosion processes within modular taper junctions of hip implants could be identified and easily distinguished from other phosphorous materials such as bone. In conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated that FTIR-I is a useful tool that can image and determine the biochemical information of retrieved tissue samples over tens of square millimeters in a completely label free, nondestructive, and objective manner.

However, the etiology of metal hypersensitivity responses in TJAs remains unclear. Metal implant debris is known to act as a danger signal that drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation. It remains unknown if implant debris induced inflammasome activation regulates T cell lineage in TJA metal hypersensitivity responses. In this study, we show both in vivo and in vitro that the pathogenesis of metal hypersensitivity responses to implant debris are largely dependent on activation of the inflammasome/caspase-1 pathway and subsequent production of IL-17A/F by CD4+ T cells. Inhibiting either the inflammasome pathway or IL-17A bioactivity in vivo and in vitro (in vivo using NLRP3 and Caspase-1 deficient mice or in vitro using blocking agents such as Capase-1 inhibitor, IL-1Ra and anti-IL-17A), significantly (p<0.05) mitigated metal-DTH paw inflammation as well as lymphocyte cytokine (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17) and proliferation responses in metal-sensitized mice and primary human PBMCs.

We asked to what extent metallic particles could also disseminate to remote hematopoietic bone marrow. Cored samples of red marrow from the axial skeleton and proximal humerus were obtained postmortem from four males and two females aged 79-92 years. Seven to seventeen years prior to their demise, each subject had undergone successful revision of their arthroplasty for mechanical failure in which an unintended wear condition had generated a large volume of metal particles. The marrow samples were analyzed using stained histological sections and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Intracellular metal alloy particles were detected in the bone marrow of the cranium, proximal humerus, sternum, ribs, lumbar vertebrae, and the iliac crest. The components previously revised for mechanical failure were confirmed to be the predominant source of the disseminated wear debris. Particles of either Ti, Ti6Al4V, CoCrMo, FeCrNi alloys, or BaSO4 were identified in 24 of the 25 marrow samples examined. The particles ranged in size from 50 nm (the limit of resolution of our technique) to 6 \u03bcm. Metallic wear particles generated by hip and knee arthroplasties can disseminate widely to hematopoietic bone marrow throughout the axial skeleton and proximal humerus, especially in cases with a history of severe wear. The hematopoietic microenvironment is potentially sensitive to metallic degradation products. However, actual medical sequelae from disseminated wear debris is a rare occurrence. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Single-cell recordings of grid cells in the rodent entorhinal cortex revealed hexagonal coding of the local environment during spatial navigation [1]. Grid-like activity has also been identified in human single-cell recordings during virtual navigation [2]. Human fMRI studies further provide evidence that grid-like signals are also accessible on a macroscopic level [3-7]. Studies in both non-human\u00a0primates [8] and humans [9, 10] suggest that grid-like coding in the entorhinal cortex generalizes beyond spatial navigation during locomotion, providing evidence for grid-like mapping of visual space during visual exploration-akin to the grid cell positional code in rodents during spatial navigation. However, electrophysiological correlates of the\u00a0grid code in humans remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence for grid-like, hexadirectional coding of visual space by human high-frequency activity, based on two independent datasets: non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy subjects and entorhinal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in an epileptic patient. Both datasets consistently show a hexadirectional modulation of broadband high-frequency activity (60-120\u00a0Hz).

The goal of the current study was to identify urinary biomarkers that differentiate total hip replacement patients who eventually develop osteolysis from patients who do not. We used a repository of 24-h urine samples collected prior to surgery and annually thereafter in 26 patients, 16 who developed osteolysis, and 10 who did not. We examined the markers at radiographic diagnosis, annually for 6 years preceding diagnosis, at the first post-operative sampling point, and pre-operatively. Patients in the osteolysis and non-osteolysis groups were matched according to time post-surgery and did not differ in the male:female ratio or age at surgery. Seven candidate biomarkers were measured, including free deoxypyridinoline (DPD), cross-linked N-telopeptides (NTX), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), osteoprotegerin (OPG), \u03b1-crosslaps (\u03b1-CTX), and \u03b2-crosslaps (\u03b2-CTX). As an individual biomarker, DPD demonstrated the highest ability to predict osteolysis, with an area under the curve (AUC) in Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses of 0.844 at 6 years prior to diagnosis. A panel of \u03b1-CTX and IL-6 was able to identify at-risk patients with an AUC of 0.941 or greater at all post-operative time points and an AUC of 1.000 pre-operatively. The results demonstrate the potential of using non-invasive biomarkers to identify patients at risk for peri-implant osteolysis long before the emergence of radiographic signs. Further, the high accuracy of the pre-operative biomarker levels demonstrates the potential importance of pre-existing, patient-specific factors driving subsequent osteolysis.

Here we examine the specific cognitive processes implemented by MTL structures (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) to organize memory by using electrical brain stimulation, leveraging its ability to establish causal links between brain regions and features of behavior. We studied neurosurgical patients of both sexes who performed spatial-navigation and verbal-episodic memory tasks while brain stimulation was applied in various regions during learning. During the verbal memory task, stimulation in the MTL disrupted the temporal organization of encoded memories such that items learned with stimulation tended to be recalled in a more randomized order. During the spatial task, MTL stimulation impaired subjects' abilities to remember items located far away from boundaries. These stimulation effects were specific to the MTL. Our findings thus provide the first causal demonstration in humans of the specific memory processes that are performed by the MTL to encode when and where events occurred.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Numerous studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in encoding spatial and temporal memories, but they have not been able to causally demonstrate the nature of the cognitive processes by which this occurs in real-time.

In rodents, boundary representations have been identified at the single-cell level in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of the hippocampal formation. Although studies of hippocampal function and spatial behavior suggest that similar representations might exist in humans, boundary-related neural activity has not been identified electrophysiologically in humans until now. To address this gap in the literature, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the hippocampal formation of surgical epilepsy patients (of both sexes) while they performed a virtual spatial navigation task and compared the power in three frequency bands (1-4, 4-10, and 30-90 Hz) for target locations near and far from the environmental boundaries. Our results suggest that encoding locations near boundaries elicited stronger theta oscillations than for target locations near the center of the environment and that this difference cannot be explained by variables such as trial length, speed, movement, or performance. These findings provide direct evidence of boundary-dependent neural activity localized in humans to the subiculum, the homolog of the hippocampal subregion in which most boundary cells are found in rodents, and indicate that this system can represent attended locations that rather than the position of one's own body.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Spatial computations using environmental boundaries are an integral part of the brain's spatial mapping system. In rodents, border/boundary cells in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex reveal boundary coding at the single-neuron level. Although there is good reason to believe that such representations also exist in humans, the evidence has thus far been limited to functional neuroimaging studies that broadly implicate the hippocampus in boundary-based navigation.

However, catastrophic adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR) secondary to metal debris from both the bearing surface and the head-neck junction is a well-recognized complication. The measurement of metal ion levels in the serum is often a first-line test to identify failure of a MoM bearing. The authors describe a 70-year-old man who presented with a multiply revised MoM THA and a large periprosthetic fluid collection incidentally seen during computed tomography for renal nephrolithiasis. The patient reported painless, progressive swelling over the lateral aspect of the hip. An infectious workup including serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and intraarticular hip aspiration yielded negative results. Metal ion levels in the serum, including a minimally elevated cobalt level, were unremarkable, and metal-lymphocyte transformation testing yielded negative results. Radiographic imaging revealed progressive osteolysis around the proximal femur, and magnetic resonance imaging showed large fluid collections with irregular wall thickening surrounding the gluteal and iliopsoas musculature. At revision surgery, a large fluid collection and corrosion at the head-neck junction were present. Pathology specimens confirmed the presence of an ALTR. This report presents a previously undescribed case of an ALTR secondary to MoM THA in the absence of elevated serum metal ion levels. This indicates the necessity of considering all aspects of a patient's clinical presentation, imaging modalities, and laboratory testing in the evaluation and diagnosis of a symptomatic MoM THA.

Several processes leading to the generation of detrimental corrosion products have been reported in first generation modular devices. Contemporary junctions differ in their geometries, surface finishes, and head alloy. This study specifically provides an overview for CoCrMo/CoCrMo and CoCrMo/Ti6Al4V head-neck contemporary junctions. A retrieval study of 364 retrieved THRs was conducted which included visual examination and determination of damage scores, as well as the examination of damage features using scanning electron microscopy. Different separately occurring or overlapping damage modes were identified that appeared to be either mechanically or chemically dominated. Mechanically dominated damage features included plastic deformation, fretting, and material transfer, whereas chemically dominate damage included pitting corrosion, etching, intergranular corrosion, phase boundary corrosion, and column damage. Etching associated cellular activity was also observed. Furthermore, fretting corrosion, formation of thick oxide films, and imprinting were observed which appeared to be the result of both mechanical and chemical processes. The occurrence and extent of damage caused by different modes was shown to depend on the material, the material couple, and alloy microstructure. In order to minimize THR failure due to material degradation within modular junctions, it is important to distinguish different damage modes, determine their cause, and identify appropriate counter measures, which may differ depending on the material, specific microstructural alloy features, and design factors such as surface topography. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Options for therapy include surgery, laser therapy, or medications. Propranolol is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved medication option. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier because of its high lipophilicity, which increases the likelihood of central nervous system effects. In this case, a preterm infant developed infantile hemangiomas on the left forearm, left trunk, left buttock, and nasal tip. The patient was treated with propranolol and concurrently required placement into a heated incubator and was subsequently unable to wean from the incubator. Upon discontinuation of propranolol, temperature instability resolved. Atenolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, was then initiated for the infantile hemangiomas and displayed no adverse effect on the thermoregulation of the infant.", "Keywords": ["adverse drug reaction", "atenolol", "infantile hemangioma", "propranolol", "temperature instability"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Betsy Walters", "Last Name": "Burkey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hany", "Last Name": "Aziz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The journal of pediatric pharmacology and therapeutics : JPPT : the official journal of PPAG", "PubDate": "2017Mar-Apr"}, {"PMID": "28419029", "Title": "Females with Unexplained Joint Pain Following Total Joint Arthroplasty Exhibit a Higher Rate and Severity of Hypersensitivity to Implant Metals Compared with Males: Implications of Sex-Based Bioreactivity Differences.", "Abstract": "Recent studies indicate that females demonstrate an increased risk of experiencing adverse local tissue reactions, aseptic loosening, and revision after primary metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty compared with males; the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for sex discrepancies in implant failure remain unclear.

This local inflammatory pseudo disease state is primarily caused by implant debris interaction with innate immune cells, i.e., macrophages. This implant debris can also activate an adaptive immune reaction giving rise to the concept of implant-related metal sensitivity. However, a consensus of studies agree the dominant form of this response is due to innate reactivity by macrophages to implant debris danger signaling (danger-associated molecular pattern) eliciting cytokine-based and chemokine inflammatory responses. This review covers implant debris-induced release of the cytokines and chemokines due to activation of the innate (and the adaptive) immune system and how this leads to subsequent implant failure through loosening and osteolysis, i.e., what is known of central chemokines (e.g., IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, MIP-1, CCL9, CCL10, CCL17, and CCL22) associated with implant debris reactivity as related to the innate immune system activation/cytokine expression, e.g., danger signaling (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-33, etc.), toll-like receptor activation (e.g., IL-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, etc.), bone catabolism (e.g., TRAP5b), and hypoxia responses (HIF-1\u03b1). More study is needed, however, to fully understand these interactions to effectively counter cytokine- and chemokine-based orthopedic implant-related inflammation.", "Keywords": ["CXC", "allergy", "chemokines", "implant debris", "inflammasome", "orthopedics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nadim J", "Last Name": "Hallab", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Rush University Medical Center , Chicago, IL , USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Rush University Medical Center , Chicago, IL , USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28143691", "Title": "Changing Paradigms in the Treatment of Severe Asthma: The Role of Biologic Therapies.", "Abstract": "Cytokine antagonists are monoclonal antibodies that offer new treatment options for refractory asthma but will also increase complexity because they are effective only for patients with certain asthma subtypes that remain to be more clearly defined. The clinical and inflammatory heterogeneity within refractory asthma makes it difficult to manage the disease and to determine which, if any, biologic therapy is suitable for a specific patient. The purpose of this article is to provide a data-driven discussion to clarify the use of biologic therapies in patients with refractory asthma. We first discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of refractory asthma. We then interpret current evidence for biomarkers of eosinophilic or type 2-high asthma so that clinicians can determine potential treatments for patients based on knowledge of their effectiveness in specific asthma phenotypes. We then assess clinical data on the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of approved and pipeline biologic therapies.

The ability of implant debris to cause excessive inflammation via danger signaling (NLRP3 inflammasome) vs. pathogen associated pattern recognition receptors (e.g. Toll-like receptors; TLRs) remains controversial. Recently, specific non-conserved histidines on human TLR4 have been shown activated by cobalt and nickel ions in solution. However, whether this TLR activation is directly or indirectly an effect of metals or secondary endogenous alarmins (danger-associated molecular patterns, DAMPs) elicited by danger signaling, remains unknown and contentious. Our study indicates that in both a human macrophage cell line (THP-1) and primary human macrophages, as well as an in vivo murine model of inflammatory osteolysis, that Cobalt-alloy particle induced NLRP3 inflammasome danger signaling inflammatory responses were highly dominant relative to TLR4 activation, as measured respectively by IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, tissue histology and quantitative bone loss measurement. Despite the lack of metal binding histidines H456 and H458 in murine TLR4, murine calvaria challenge with Cobalt alloy particles induced significant macrophage driven in vivo inflammation and bone loss inflammatory osteolysis, whereas LPS calvaria challenge alone did not. Additionally, no significant increase (p<0.05) in inflammation and inflammatory bone loss by LPS co-challenge with Cobalt vs. Cobalt alone was evident, even at high levels of LPS (i.e. levels commiserate with hematogenous levels in fatal sepsis, >500pg/mL). Therefore, not only do the results of this investigation support Cobalt alloy danger signaling induced inflammation, but under normal homeostasis low levels of hematogenous PAMPs (<2pg/mL) from Gram-negative bacteria, seem to have negligible contribution to the danger signaling responses elicited by Cobalt alloy metal implant debris. This suggests the unique nature of Cobalt alloy particle bioreactivity is strong enough to illicit danger signaling that secondarily activate concomitant TLR activation, and may in part explain Cobalt particulate associated inflammatory and toxicity-like reactions of specific orthopedic implants.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alloys", "Animals", "Cobalt", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-1beta", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Monocytes", "Osteoporosis", "Prostheses and Implants", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 4", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lauryn", "Last Name": "Samelko", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Landgraeber", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrabe 55, 45122, Essen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kyron", "Last Name": "McAllister", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nadim James", "Last Name": "Hallab", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27416075", "Title": "TLR4 (not TLR2) dominate cognate TLR activity associated with CoCrMo implant particles.", "Abstract": "Innate immune reactions to orthopedic implant debris are the primary cause of total joint replacement (TJR) failure over the long term (15-20 years). The role of pathogen associated pattern recognition receptors (i.e., TLRs) in regulating immune reactivity to metal implant particles remains controversial. Do different TLRs (i.e., TLR2 vs. TLR4) activated by their respective ligands in concert with metal implant debris elicit equivalent innate immune responses? In this investigation, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that Gram-negative PAMPs are more pro-inflammatory than Gram-positive PAMPs. In vitro results indicated TLR4 activation in concert with CoCrMo orthopedic implant debris (CoCrMo/LPS+) challenged primary macrophages resulted in significantly greater inflammatory responses than CoCrMo/PAM3CSK+ (TLR2). Similarly, in vivo results indicated CoCrMo/LPS+ TLR4 challenge induced a twofold increase in inflammation-induced bone resorption (osteolysis) than CoCrMo/PAM3CSK+ (p\u2009<\u20090.01) or CoCrMo (p\u2009<\u20090.03) alone in an established murine calvaria model. This points to a more potent TLR4-based effect of CoCrMo/LPS+ on innate immune responses, that is, IL-1\u00df, TNF-\u03b1, and resulting osteolysis. Differential CoCrMo/LPS+ induced osteolysis compared to CoCrMo/PAM3CSK+, reveals inherent differences in TLR4 versus TLR2 activation which are relevant to (i) how different types of implant debris elicit differential reactivity, (ii) how TLR2 Gram-positive bacteria benefits from less immune activation possibly due to the down-regulation of TLR2 surface expression, that subsequently impacts Gram-positive infections in TJRs, and (iii) how using TLR4 LPS (a Gram-negative agonist) may not accurately model Gram-positive bacteria responses, alone and/or with specific types of implant particles, particularly CoCrMo alloy. \u00a9 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

One hint of theta's function came from the discovery in rodents that theta oscillations are traveling waves that allow parts of the hippocampus to simultaneously exhibit separate oscillatory phases. Because hippocampal theta oscillations in humans have different properties compared with rodents, we examined these signals directly using multielectrode recordings from neurosurgical patients. Our findings confirm that human hippocampal theta oscillations are traveling waves, but also show that these oscillations appear at a broader range of frequencies compared with rodents. Human traveling waves showed a distinctive pattern of spatial propagation such that there is a consistent phase spread across the hippocampus regardless of the oscillations' frequency. This suggests that traveling theta oscillations are important functionally in humans because they coordinate phase coding throughout the hippocampus in a consistent manner. Significance statement: We show for the first time in humans that hippocampal theta oscillations are traveling waves, moving along the length of the hippocampus in a posterior-anterior direction. The existence of these traveling theta waves is important for understanding hippocampal neural coding because they cause neurons at separate positions in the hippocampus to experience different theta phases simultaneously. The theta phase that a neuron measures is a key factor in how that cell represents behavioral information. Therefore, the existence of traveling theta waves indicates that, to fully understand how a hippocampal neuron represents information, it is vital to also account for that cell's location in addition to conventional measures of neural activity.", "Keywords": ["ECoG", "hippocampus", "theta oscillation", "traveling wave"], "MeSH terms": ["Epilepsy", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Theta Rhythm"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Honghui", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering, Sciences, and Health Systems, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, and."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027 joshua.jacobs@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2015Sep09"}, {"PMID": "26321628", "Title": "Diagnosis and Management of Adverse Local Tissue Reactions Secondary to Corrosion at the Head-Neck Junction in Patients With Metal on Polyethylene Bearings.", "Abstract": "We reviewed 27 patients who underwent revision for an adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR) secondary to corrosion at the head-neck junction with MoP bearings.

Because neuronal oscillations may reflect rhythmic modulations of neuronal excitability, phase-coupled oscillatory networks could be the functional building block for routing information through the brain. Current techniques are not suited for directly characterizing such networks. To be able to extract phase-coupled oscillatory networks we developed a new method, which characterizes networks by phase coupling between sites. Importantly, this method respects the fact that neuronal oscillations have energy in a range of frequencies. As a consequence, we characterize these networks by between-site phase relations that vary as a function of frequency, such as those that result from between-site temporal delays. Using human electrocorticographic recordings we show that our method can uncover phase-coupled oscillatory networks that show interesting patterns in their between-site phase relations, such as travelling waves.

A primary mechanism by which the brain represents space is through hippocampal place cells, which indicate when an animal is at a particular location. An important issue is understanding how the hippocampal place-cell network represents specific properties of the environment, such as signifying that a particular position is near a doorway or that another position is near the end of a corridor. The entorhinal cortex (EC), as the main input to the hippocampus, may play a key role in coding these properties because it contains neurons that activate at multiple related positions per environment. We examined the diversity of spatial coding across the human medial temporal lobe by recording neuronal activity during virtual navigation of an environment containing four similar paths. Neurosurgical patients performed this task as we recorded from implanted microelectrodes, allowing us to compare the human neuronal representation of space with that of animals. EC neurons activated in a repeating manner across the environment, with individual cells spiking at the same relative location across multiple paths. This finding indicates that EC cells represent non-specific information about location relative to an environment's geometry, unlike hippocampal place cells, which activate at particular random locations.

Thus, such stimulus-independent activity has important implications for the neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory as well as the development of cognitive neural prosthetics. Here, we developed a brain computer interface (BCI) to test the ability of such pre-stimulus activity to modulate subsequent memory encoding. We recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in neurosurgical patients as they performed a free recall memory task, and detected iEEG theta and alpha oscillations that correlated with optimal memory encoding. We then used these detected oscillatory changes to trigger the presentation of items in the free recall task.

We apply our model in the full three-dimensional architecture of the brain to quantify the effects of regional resistance to radiation owing to hypoxia in vivo determined by [(18)F]-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography (FMISO-PET) and the patient-specific three-dimensional radiation treatment plan. Incorporation of hypoxia into our model with FMISO-PET increases the model-data agreement by an order of magnitude. This improvement was robust to our definition of hypoxia or the degree of radiation resistance quantified with the FMISO-PET image and our computational model, respectively.

We obtained maternal and umbilical cord blood samples from 3 patients with a MOM hip arthroplasty and 7 control subjects without any metallic implants. Serum metal ion levels including chromium, cobalt, titanium, and nickel were tested using high-resolution sector-field inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Mothers with MOM-bearing implants had significantly elevated levels of serum cobalt and chromium compared with control-group mothers, and umbilical cord blood from mothers with MOM implants also had significantly higher serum metal ion levels compared with control-group mothers. The results of this study show that circulating serum levels of metal ion degradation products from MOM bearings cross the placenta and expose the fetus to metal ions. However, the placenta exerts a modulatory effect on cord blood, resulting in decreased levels compared with maternal samples (approximately 15% of maternal chromium and 50% of maternal cobalt).

Intracranial recordings taken as 56 neurosurgical patients studied and recalled lists of words revealed significant hippocampal PAC, with slow-theta activity (2.5-5 Hz) modulating gamma band activity (34-130 Hz). Furthermore, a significant number of hippocampal electrodes exhibited greater PAC during successful than unsuccessful encoding, with the gamma activity at these sites coupled to the trough of the slow-theta oscillation. These same conditions facilitate LTP in animal models, providing a possible mechanism of action for this effect in human memory. Uniquely in the hippocampus, phase preference during item encoding exhibited a biphasic pattern.

However, the reasons that some facets of implant debris (e.g., particle size, shape, base material, etc.) are more pro-inflammatory remain controversial. This precludes accurate prediction and optimal design of modern total joint replacements. We hypothesized that debris particle size can influence adsorbed protein film composition and affect subsequent bioreactivity. We measured size-dependent proteinfilm adsorption, and adsorbed protein-film-dependent cytokine release using equal surface areas of different sized cobalt-chromium alloy (CoCr-alloy) particles and in vitro challenge of human macrophages (THP-1 and human primary). Smaller (5 \u03bcm diameter) versus larger (70 \u03bcm diameter) particles preferentially adsorbed more serum protein in general (p<0.03), where higher molecular weight serum proteins consistent with IgG were identified. Additionally, 5-\u03bcm CoCr-alloy particles pre-coated with different protein biofilms (IgG vs. albumin) resulted in a difference in cytokine expression in which albumin-coated particles induced more TNF-\u03b1 release and IgG-coated particles induced more IL-1\u03b2 release from human monocytes/macrophages. In these preliminary in vitro studies, we have demonstrated the capability of equal surface areas of different particle sizes to influence adsorbed protein composition and that adsorbed protein differences on identical particles can translate into complex differences in bioreactivity.

This inflammatory disease state is caused by implant debris acting, primarily, on innate immune cells, that is, macrophages. This slow progressive pathological bone loss or \"aseptic loosening\" is a potentially life-threatening condition due to the serious complications in older people (>75 yrs) of total joint replacement revision surgery. In some people implant debris (particles and ions from metals) can influence the adaptive immune system as well, giving rise to the concept of metal sensitivity. However, a consensus of studies agrees that the dominant form of this response is due to innate reactivity by macrophages to implant debris where both danger (DAMP) and pathogen (PAMP) signalling elicit cytokine-based inflammatory responses. This paper discusses implant debris induced release of the cytokines and chemokines due to activation of the innate (and the adaptive) immune system and the subsequent formation of osteolysis. Different mechanisms of implant-debris reactivity related to the innate immune system are detailed, for example, danger signalling (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-33, etc.), toll-like receptor activation (e.g., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, etc.), apoptosis (e.g., caspases 3-9), bone catabolism (e.g., TRAP5b), and hypoxia responses (Hif1-\u03b1).

When a rat runs through an environment, large-amplitude theta oscillations (4-10 Hz) reliably appear in the hippocampus's electrical activity. The consistency of this pattern led to theta playing a central role in theories on the neural basis of mammalian spatial navigation and memory. However, in fact, hippocampal oscillations at 4-10 Hz are rare in humans and in some other species. This presents a challenge for theories proposing theta as an essential component of the mammalian brain, including models of place and grid cells. Here, I examine this issue by reviewing recent research on human hippocampal oscillations using direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients. This work indicates that the human hippocampus does indeed exhibit rhythms that are functionally similar to theta oscillations found in rodents, but that these signals have a slower frequency of approximately 1-4 Hz.

The survival rate of children with unfavorable neuroblastoma remains low among all childhood cancers. MYCN and MYC play a crucial role in determining the malignancy of unfavorable neuroblastomas, whereas high-level expression of the favorable neuroblastoma genes is associated with a good disease outcome and confers growth suppression of neuroblastoma cells. A small fraction of neuroblastomas harbors TP53 mutations at diagnosis, but a higher proportion of the relapse cases acquire TP53 mutations. In this study, we investigated the effect of S(+)-ibuprofen on neuroblastoma cell lines, focusing on the expression of the MYCN, MYC, AKT, p53 proteins and the favorable neuroblastoma genes in vitro as biomarkers of malignancy. Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with S(+)-ibuprofen resulted in a significant growth suppression. This growth effect was accompanied by a marked decrease in the expression of MYC, MYCN, AKT and an increase in p53 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines without TP53 mutation. In addition, S(+)-ibuprofen enhanced the expression of some favorable neuroblastoma genes (EPHB6, CD44) and genes involved in growth suppression and differentiation (EGR1, EPHA2, NRG1 and SEL1L). Gene expression profile and Ingenuity pathway analyses using TP53-mutated SKNAS cells further revealed that S(+)-ibuprofen suppressed molecular pathways associated with cell growth and conversely enhanced those of cell cycle arrest and the unfolded protein response.

We examined the electrophysiological basis of RS directly using brain recordings from implanted electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrodes in neurosurgical patients.

We measured signature hypoxia associated responses (i.e. HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF and TNF-\u03b1) to Cobalt-alloy implant debris both in vitro (using a human THP-1 macrophage cell line and primary human monocytes/macrophages) and in vivo. HIF-1\u03b1 in peri-implant tissues of failed metal-on-metal implants were compared to similar tissues from people with metal-on-polymer hip arthroplasties, immunohistochemically. Increasing concentrations of cobalt ions significantly up-regulated HIF-1\u03b1 with a maximal response at 0.3 mM.

By treating NB cell lines [SKNAS, SKNBE(2)C, CHP134, and SY5Y] with epigenetic modifiers for a short time, followed by sphere-forming culture conditions, we have established stem cell-like NB cells that are phenotypically stable for more than a year. These cells are characterized by their high expression of stemness factors, stem cell markers, and open chromatin structure. We referred to these cells as induced CSCs (iCSCs). SKNAS iCSC and SKNBE(2)C iCSC clones (as few as 100 cells) injected s.c. into SCID/Beige mice formed tumors, and in one case, SKNBE(2)C iCSCs metastasized to the adrenal gland, suggesting their increased metastatic potential. SKNAS iCSC xenografts showed the histologic appearance of totally undifferentiated large-cell NBs (LCNs), the most aggressive and deadly form of NB in humans. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that SKNAS iCSC xenografts expressed high levels of the stem cell marker CXCR4, whereas the SKNAS monolayer cell xenografts did not. The patterns of CXCR4 and MYC expression in SKNAS iCSC xenografts resembled those in the LCNs. The xenografts established from the NB iCSCs shared two common features: the LCN phenotype and high-level MYC/MYCN expression.

However, we do not have a detailed understanding of how the brain represents individual stimuli within a category. Here we used direct human brain recordings and machine-learning algorithms to characterize the distributed patterns that distinguish specific cognitive states. Epilepsy patients with surgically implanted electrodes performed a working-memory task and we used machine-learning algorithms to predict the identity of each viewed stimulus. We found that the brain's representation of stimulus-specific information is distributed across neural activity at multiple frequencies, electrodes, and timepoints. Stimulus-specific neuronal activity was most prominent in the high-gamma (65-128 Hz) and theta/alpha (4-16 Hz) bands, but the properties of these signals differed significantly between individuals and for novel stimuli compared to common ones. Our findings are helpful for understanding the neural basis of memory and developing brain-computer interfaces by showing that the brain distinguishes specific cognitive states by diverse spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cerebral Cortex", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Memory, Short-Term"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marcel A J", "Last Name": "van Gerven", "Affiliation": "Radboud University Nijmegen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.vangerven@donders.ru.nl"}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Maris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Sperling", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashwini", "Last Name": "Sharan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Litt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gordon", "Last Name": "Baltuch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "NeuroImage", "PubDate": "2013Apr15"}, {"PMID": "23291185", "Title": "Inhibition of the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin and Notch signaling pathways sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to chemotherapy.", "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors in early adolescence. Multi-drug chemotherapy has greatly increased the five year survival rate from 20% to 70%. However, the rate has been staggering for 30 years and the prognosis is particularly poor for patients with recurrence and metastasis. Our study aimed to investigate the role of Wnt-\u03b2-catenin, Notch and Hedgehog pathway in OS development because all these pathways are involved in skeletal development, tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Our results showed that the major components in Wnt-\u03b2-catenin pathway, e.g. Wnt3a, \u03b2-catenin and Lef1, were consistently upregulated in human osteosarcoma cell line Saos2 cells compared to human fetal osteoblasts (hFOB), whereas the changes in the expression levels of Notch and Hh signaling molecules were not consistent. Knocking down \u03b2-catenin increased the Saos2 sensitivity to methotrexate (MTX) induced cell death. Consistently, the expression level of \u03b2-catenin protein correlated with the invasiveness of OS, as evidenced by more intensive \u03b2-catenin immunoreactivity in higher grade OS samples. Chemical inhibition of the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling enhanced MTX mediated death of Saos2 cells. A synergistic effect with MTX was observed when both inhibitors for Wnt-\u03b2-catenin and Notch pathways were simultaneously used, while the addition of the Hh inhibitor did not further improve the efficacy. Our findings provide some novel insight to OS pathogenesis and lay a foundation for future application of Wnt-\u03b2-catenin and Notch inhibitors together with the currently used chemotherapeutic drugs to improve the outcome of OS treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bone Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Humans", "Osteosarcoma", "Receptors, Notch", "Signal Transduction", "Wnt Proteins", "beta Catenin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yimin", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongxin", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ethan Q", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Huiwu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Gitelis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Regis J", "Last Name": "O'Keefe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yrj\u00f6 T", "Last Name": "Konttinen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guoyong", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tian-Fang", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "PubDate": "2013Feb08"}, {"PMID": "23283342", "Title": "Synchronous and asynchronous theta and gamma activity during episodic memory formation.", "Abstract": "To test the hypothesis that neural oscillations synchronize to mediate memory encoding, we analyzed electrocorticographic recordings taken as 68 human neurosurgical patients studied and subsequently recalled lists of common words. To the extent that changes in spectral power reflect synchronous oscillations, we would expect those power changes to be accompanied by increases in phase synchrony between the region of interest and neighboring brain areas. Contrary to the hypothesized role of synchronous gamma oscillations in memory formation, we found that many key regions that showed power increases during successful memory encoding also exhibited decreases in global synchrony. Similarly, cortical theta activity that decreases during memory encoding exhibits both increased and decreased global synchrony depending on region and stage of encoding. We suggest that network synchrony analyses, as used here, can help to distinguish between two major types of spectral modulations: (1) those that reflect synchronous engagement of regional neurons with neighboring brain areas, and (2) those that reflect either asynchronous modulations of neural activity or local synchrony accompanied by global disengagement from neighboring regions.

There are many unknowns regarding how CoCrMo metal bearings interact with the human body.

The materials, mechanical deformation, corrosion, wear-assisted corrosion, and wear products will be discussed. Possible adverse health effects caused by wear products will be briefly addressed, as well as some of the many open questions such as the detailed chemistry of corrosion, tribochemical reactions and the formation of graphitic layers.

We tested three cohorts (Group 1: n = 21 prospective longitudinal MoM hip arthroplasty; Group 2: n = 17 retrospective MoM hip arthroplasty; and Group 3: n = 20 controls without implants).
