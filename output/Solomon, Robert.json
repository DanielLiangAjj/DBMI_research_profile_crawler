Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that SMC \"phenotypic switching\" plays a central role in atherosclerosis development and complications. Yet, SMC roles and mechanisms underlying the disease pathogenesis are poorly understood. Here, employing SMC lineage tracing mice, comprehensive molecular, cellular, histological, and computational profiling, coupled to genetic and pharmacological studies, we reveal that atherosclerosis, in terms of SMC behaviors, share extensive commonalities with tumors. SMC-derived cells in the disease show multiple characteristics of tumor cell biology, including genomic instability, replicative immortality, malignant proliferation, resistance to cell death, invasiveness, and activation of comprehensive cancer-associated gene regulatory networks. SMC-specific expression of oncogenic KrasG12D accelerates SMC phenotypic switching and exacerbates atherosclerosis. Moreover, we present a proof of concept showing that niraparib, an anti-cancer drug targeting DNA damage repair, attenuates atherosclerosis progression and induces regression of lesions in advanced disease in mouse models.

We illustrate how alcohol industry groups seek to keep their customers in the dark about alcohol-related cancer risks. In Canada, a federally funded scientific study examining the introduction of cancer warning labels on containers was shut down following industry interference. We show that the industry complaints about the study had no legal merit. Of 47 WHO member countries with alcohol warning labels, only South Korea requires cancer warnings on alcohol containers. However, industry complaints, supported by sympathetic governments, helped weaken the warning labels' implementation. Ireland has legislated for cancer warnings but faces continuing legal opposition expressed through regional and global bodies. Cancer societies and the public health community have failed to counter industry pressures to minimize consumer awareness of alcohol's cancer risks.

Recent experience in British Columbia and Alberta illustrates the potential traffic safety benefits of enacting comprehensive impairment-related roadside administrative measures. In 2010, British Columbia enacted a package of roadside administrative sanctions, which included mandatory ALSs, AVIs, monetary penalties, license-reinstatement fees, and remedial programs. A study conducted two years later reported that alcohol-related fatal crashes had fallen by 52%. Alberta enacted similar provisions, and saw alcohol-related fatalities decrease by 46% within six months of the legislation coming into force. Although effective, these new roadside sanctions generated a flurry of legal challenges. The cases indicate that while the provinces have broad leeway, there are legal limits on their authority to impose onerous administrative sanctions on drivers, particularly if they are based on a single roadside alcohol or drug-screening test.Conclusions: With careful drafting, the provinces can enact cost-effective roadside administrative sanctions that have been shown to significantly reduce impaired driving deaths and injuries. The legality of any administrative sanction will likely depend on its severity, the reliability of the test or evidence upon which it is based, and the extent to which the driver has a meaningful opportunity to challenge the decision.", "Keywords": ["Impaired driving", "administrative counter measures", "deterrence"], "MeSH terms": ["Alberta", "British Columbia", "Driving Under the Influence", "Law Enforcement", "Licensure", "State Government"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Solomon", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Law, Western University, London, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Lauren", "Last Name": "MacLeod", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Law, Western University, London, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Dumschat", "Affiliation": "MADD Canada, Oakville, Canada."}], "Journal": "Traffic injury prevention", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32305256", "Title": "Is Duration of Symptoms Predictive of Acute Myocardial Infarction?", "Abstract": "Patient interviews regarding the duration of symptoms are commonly conducted when evaluating a patient with possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and are believed to distinguish between AMI and non-AMI symptoms.

To evaluate public health impacts of wildfire smoke, we integrated numerical simulations and observations for regional fire events during August-September of 2017. A one-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting and Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system was used to simulate fire smoke transport and dispersion. To reduce modeling bias in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and to optimize smoke exposure estimates, we integrated modeling results with the high-resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction satellite aerosol optical depth and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency AirNow ground-level monitoring PM2.5 concentrations. Three machine learning-based data fusion algorithms were applied: An ordinary multi-linear regression method, a generalized boosting method, and a random forest (RF) method. 10-Fold cross-validation found improved surface PM2.5 estimation after data integration and bias correction, especially with the RF method. Lastly, to assess transient health effects of fire smoke, we applied the optimized high-resolution PM2.5 exposure estimate in a short-term exposure-response function. Total estimated regional mortality attributable to PM2.5 exposure during the smoke episode was 183 (95% confidence interval: 0, 432), with 85% of the PM2.5 pollution and 95% of the consequent multiple-cause mortality contributed by fire emissions.

Two series of structured interviews were conducted with 10 neurosurgeons who work in a range of situations in diverse markets, and with Memorial Hermann Healthcare System senior executive leadership. Their responses form the basis for the subsequent discussion. Neurosurgeons can be independent, join a confederation such as an Independent Physician Association or another type of \"clinically integrated\" network, or be employed by a hospital, medical school, or physician group. With varying levels of integration comes the strength of size, management expertise, negotiating leverage, economies of scale, and possibly financial advantages, but with impact on autonomy and independence. Constructive alignment can lead to a win-win situation for both the individual physician and the organization, but options vary widely due to heterogeneous local conditions. This paper reviews possible relationships, moving along a spectrum from no financial integration to full integration.

SPMs are also decreased in advanced plaques of fat-fed Ldlr-/- mice. Administration of RvD1 to these mice during plaque progression restores the RvD1:LTB4 ratio to that of less advanced lesions and promotes plaque stability, including decreased lesional oxidative stress and necrosis, improved lesional efferocytosis, and thicker fibrous caps. These findings provide molecular support for the concept that defective inflammation resolution contributes to the formation of clinically dangerous plaques and offer a mechanistic rationale for SPM therapy to promote plaque stability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gabrielle", "Last Name": "Fredman", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Departments of Medicine, Pathology &Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Hellmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, The Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Proto", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Departments of Medicine, Pathology &Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Kuriakose", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Departments of Medicine, Pathology &Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Romain A", "Last Name": "Colas", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, The Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bernhard", "Last Name": "Dorweiler", "Affiliation": "Division of Vascular Surgery, Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Langenbeckstra\u00dfe 1, Mainz D-55131, Germany."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Solomon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "The Department of Pathology, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, Albany, New York 12208, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric J", "Last Name": "Heyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Spite", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, The Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ira", "Last Name": "Tabas", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Departments of Medicine, Pathology &Cell Biology, and Physiology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2016Sep23"}, {"PMID": "27504683", "Title": "Morphine-Modified Hepatobiliary Scanning Protocol for the Diagnosis of Acute Cholecystitis.", "Abstract": "We report a morphine-modified hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scanning protocol that uses 2 mg of morphine IV push at the bedside as a pretreatment.

Recent drug policy changes in the United States suggest growing political feasibility for legal regulation of cannabis in other North American jurisdictions. This commentary discusses the outcomes of an interdisciplinary policy meeting with Canadian experts and knowledge users in the area of substance use interventions. The meeting explored possibilities for applying cross-substance learning on policy interventions for alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, towards the goal of advancing a public health framework for reducing harms associated with substance use in Canada. The meeting also explored how the shift in approach to cannabis policy can provide an opportunity to explore potential changes in substance use policy more generally, especially in relation to tobacco and alcohol as legally regulated substances associated with a heavy burden of illness.
