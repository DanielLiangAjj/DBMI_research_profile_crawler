[{"PMID": "37758948", "Title": "Dopaminergic error signals retune to social feedback during courtship.", "Abstract": "Hunger, thirst, loneliness and ambition determine the reward value of food, water, social interaction and performance outcome1. Dopamine neurons respond to rewards meeting these diverse needs2-8, but it remains unclear how behaviour and dopamine signals change as priorities change with new opportunities in the environment. One possibility is that dopamine signals for distinct drives are routed to distinct dopamine pathways9,10. Another possibility is that dopamine signals in a given pathway are dynamically tuned to rewards set by the current priority. Here we used electrophysiology and fibre photometry to test how dopamine signals associated with quenching thirst, singing a good song and courting a mate change as male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were provided with opportunities to retrieve water, evaluate song performance or court a female. When alone, water reward signals were observed in two mesostriatal pathways but singing-related performance error signals were routed to Area X, a striatal nucleus specialized for singing. When courting a female, water seeking was reduced and dopamine responses to both water and song performance outcomes diminished. Instead, dopamine signals in Area X were driven by female calls timed with the courtship song. Thus the dopamine system handled coexisting drives by routing vocal performance and social feedback signals to a striatal area for communication and by flexibly re-tuning to rewards set by the prioritized drive.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Male", "Courtship", "Dopamine", "Finches", "Vocalization, Animal", "Water", "Feedback, Physiological", "Drinking", "Thirst", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Electrophysiology", "Brain", "Communication", "Reward", "Feedback, Psychological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Roeser", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vikram", "Last Name": "Gadagkar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. vikram.gadagkar@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Anindita", "Last Name": "Das", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pavel A", "Last Name": "Puzerey", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Kardon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jesse H", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. jessehgoldberg@gmail.com."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2023Nov"}, {"PMID": "35354031", "Title": "Dopamine neurons evaluate natural fluctuations in performance quality.", "Abstract": "Many motor skills are learned by comparing ongoing behavior to internal performance benchmarks. Dopamine neurons encode performance error in behavioral paradigms where error is externally induced, but it remains unknown whether dopamine also signals the quality of natural performance fluctuations. Here, we record dopamine neurons in singing birds and examine how spontaneous dopamine spiking activity correlates with natural fluctuations in ongoing song. Antidromically identified basal ganglia-projecting dopamine neurons correlate with recent, and not future, song variations, consistent with a role in evaluation, not production. Furthermore, maximal dopamine spiking occurs at a single vocal target, consistent with either actively maintaining the existing song or shifting the song to a nearby form. These data show that spontaneous dopamine spiking can evaluate natural behavioral fluctuations unperturbed by experimental events such as cues or rewards.", "Keywords": ["CP: Neuroscience", "Gaussian process model", "basal ganglia", "birdsong", "dopamine", "generalized linear model", "motor skill learning", "natural behavior", "performance prediction error", "skill maintenance", "ventral tegmental area"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basal Ganglia", "Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Learning", "Vocalization, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Duffy", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Computational Neuroscience Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth W", "Last Name": "Latimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Department of Neurobiology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jesse H", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adrienne L", "Last Name": "Fairhall", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Computational Neuroscience Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.

One possibility is that some neurons are movement related and others are not. Another possibility is that the precise behavioral conditions matter-that a single neuron can be movement related under certain behavioral states but not others. We recorded single VTA and VP neurons in birds transitioning between singing and nonsinging states while monitoring body movement with microdrive-mounted accelerometers. Many VP and VTA neurons exhibited body movement-locked activity exclusively when the bird was not singing. During singing, VP and VTA neurons could switch off their tuning to body movement and become instead precisely time-locked to specific song syllables. These changes in neuronal tuning occurred rapidly at state boundaries. Our findings show that movement-related activity in limbic circuits can be gated by behavioral context.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural signals in the limbic system have long been known to represent body movements as well as reward.
