[{"PMID": "38888342", "Title": "The interferon-induced protein, IFIT2, requires RNA-binding activity and neuronal expression to protect mice from intranasal vesicular stomatitis virus infection.", "Abstract": "The interferon (IFN) system protects mammals from diseases caused by virus infections. IFN synthesis is induced by pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways activated by virus infection. IFN is secreted from the infected cells and acts upon neighboring cells by binding cell surface receptors and triggering induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes and proteins, many of which block different steps of virus replication. The IFN-induced tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (IFIT) are a family of RNA-binding proteins. We and others have previously reported that IFIT2 protects mice from many neurotropic RNA viruses; indeed, Ifit2-/- mice are very susceptible to intranasal or subcutaneous infections with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Here, using a newly generated conditional knockout mouse, we report that ablation of Ifit2 expression only in neuronal cells was sufficient to render mice susceptible to neuropathogenesis caused by intranasal, but not subcutaneous, infection of VSV. Another genetically modified mouse line, expressing a mutant IFIT2 that cannot bind RNA, was as susceptible to VSV infection as Ifit2-/- mice. These results demonstrated that IFIT2 RNA-binding activity is essential for protecting mice against neurological diseases caused by intranasal infection of VSV.IMPORTANCEInterferon's (IFN's) antiviral effects are mediated by the proteins encoded by the interferon-stimulated genes. IFN-stimulated genes (IFIT2) is one such protein, which inhibits replication of many RNA viruses in the mouse brain and the resultant neuropathology. Our study sheds light on how IFIT2 works. By ablating Ifit2 expression only in neuronal cells, using a newly generated conditional knockout mouse line, we showed that Ifit2 induction in the neurons of the infected mouse was necessary for antiviral function of interferon. IFIT2 has no known enzyme activity; instead, it functions by binding to cellular or viral proteins or RNAs. We engineered a new mouse line that expressed a mutant IFIT2 that cannot bind RNA. These mice were very susceptible to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus indicating that the RNA-binding property of IFIT2 was essential for its antiviral function in vivo.", "Keywords": ["IFIT2", "interferon", "neurotropic viruses"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Darshana", "Last Name": "Poddar", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikhil", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomoaki", "Last Name": "Ogino", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, The University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xu", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patricia M", "Last Name": "Kessler", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiran", "Last Name": "Mendries", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ranjan", "Last Name": "Dutta", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ganes C", "Last Name": "Sen", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2024Jun18"}, {"PMID": "38868618", "Title": "Mixed Reality in the Operating Room: An Initial Use in Frontal Sinus Setback in Gender-affirming Facial Surgery.", "Abstract": "Demand for gender-affirming facial surgery is growing rapidly. Frontal sinus setback, one of the key procedures used in gender-affirming facial surgery, has a particularly high impact on gender perception. Mixed reality (MR) allows a user to view and virtually overlay three-dimensional imaging on the patient and interact with it in real time. We used the Medivis's SurgicalAR system in conjunction with the Microsoft HoloLens Lucille2 (Microsoft). Computed tomography imaging was uploaded to SurgicalAR, and a three-dimensional (3D) hologram was projected onto the display of the HoloLens. The hologram was registered and matched to the patient, allowing the surgeon to view bony anatomy and underlying structures in real time on the patient. The surgeon was able to outline the patient's frontal sinuses using the hologram as guidance. A 3D printed cutting guide was used for comparison. Negligible difference between the mixed reality-based outline and 3D-printed outline was seen. The process of loading the hologram and marking the frontal sinus outline lasted less than 10 minutes.

IFN is also an important player in many non-viral diseases and in the development of normal immune cells. Although the signaling pathways for IFN induction by viral RNA or DNA have been extensively studied, its mode of induction in uninfected cells remains obscure. Here, we report that inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, can induce IFN-\u03b2 through activation of the cytoplasmic RIG-I signaling pathway. However, RIG-I is activated not by RNA, but by PACT, the protein activator of PKR. In cell lines or primary cells expressing RIG-I and PACT, activation of the MAPK, p38, by cytokine signaling, leads to phosphorylation of PACT, which binds to primed RIG-I and activates its signaling pathway.

One of the key factors for resistance to antimicrobial medications is growth of bacteria in biofilm. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition was created as an alternative treatment by developing novel anti-biofilm medicines. Cell-cell communication is impeded by QS inhibition, which targets QS signaling pathway. The goal of this work is to develop newer drugs that are effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by decreasing QS and acting as anti-biofilm agents. In this investigation, N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)benzamide/N-(thiazol-2-yl)benzamide derivatives 3a-h were designed and synthesized in good yields. Further, molecular docking analyses revealed that binding affinity values were founded -11.2 to -7.6\u2005kcal/mol that were moderate to good. The physicochemical properties of these prepared compounds were investigated through in-silico method.

RSA59 intracranial injection of Ifit2-deficient (-/-) compared to wild-type (WT) mice results in impaired acute microglial activation, reduced CX3CR1 expression, limited migration of peripheral lymphocytes into the brain, and impaired virus control followed by severe morbidity and mortality. While the protective role of Ifit2 is established for acute viral encephalitis, less is known about its influence during the chronic demyelinating phase of RSA59 infection. To understand this, RSA59 infected Ifit2-/- and Ifit2+/+ (WT) were observed for neuropathological outcomes at day 5 (acute phase) and 30 post-infection (chronic phase). Our study demonstrates that Ifit2 deficiency causes extensive RSA59 spread throughout the spinal cord gray and white matter, associated with impaired CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Further, the cervical lymph nodes of RSA59 infected Ifit2-/- mice showed reduced activation of CD4+ T cells and impaired IFN\u03b3 expression during acute encephalomyelitis. Interestingly, BBB integrity was better preserved in Ifit2-/- mice, as evidenced by tight junction protein Claudin-5 and adapter protein ZO-1 expression surrounding the meninges and blood vessels and decreased Texas red dye uptake, which may be responsible for reduced leukocyte infiltration. In contrast to sparse myelin loss in WT mice, the chronic disease phase in Ifit2-/- mice was associated with severe demyelination and persistent viral load, even at low inoculation doses. Overall, our study highlights that Ifit2 provides antiviral functions by promoting acute neuroinflammation and thereby aiding virus control and limiting severe chronic demyelination. IMPORTANCE Interferons execute their function by inducing specific genes collectively termed as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), among which interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2, Ifit2, is known for restricting neurotropic viral replication and spread. However, little is known about its role in viral spread to the spinal cord and its associated myelin pathology. Toward this, our study using a neurotropic murine \u03b2-coronavirus and Ifit2-deficient mice demonstrates that Ifit2 deficiency causes extensive viral spread throughout the gray and white matter of the spinal cord accompanied by impaired microglial activation and T cell infiltration. Furthermore, infected Ifit2-deficient mice showed impaired activation of T cells in the cervical lymph node and relatively intact blood-brain barrier integrity. Overall, Ifit2 plays a crucial role in mounting host immunity against neurotropic murine coronavirus in the acute phase while preventing mice from developing viral-induced severe chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination, the characteristic feature of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS).", "Keywords": ["Ifit2", "coronavirus", "demyelination", "interferon-gamma", "microglia"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Humans", "Animals", "White Matter", "Murine hepatitis virus", "Myelin Sheath", "Interferons", "Proteins", "Spinal Cord", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Coronavirus Infections", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Madhav", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata , Mohanpur, West Bengal, India."}, {"First Name": "Debanjana", "Last Name": "Chakravarty", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata , Mohanpur, West Bengal, India."}, {"First Name": "Afaq", "Last Name": "Hussain", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata , Mohanpur, West Bengal, India."}, {"First Name": "Ajay", "Last Name": "Zalavadia", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Burrows", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Rayman", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikhil", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence C", "Last Name": "Kenyon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cornelia", "Last Name": "Bergmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ganes C", "Last Name": "Sen", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jayasri", "Last Name": "Das Sarma", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata , Mohanpur, West Bengal, India."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2023Aug31"}, {"PMID": "37328393", "Title": "A timeline of surgical lighting - Is automated lighting the future?", "Abstract": "High quality surgical lighting is central to successful performance in the operating room and therefore to both patient care and treatment.

However, considering the uncertainty due to diseases, pests, droughts, floods and impending effects of climate change is essential when designing rotation strategies. Analysing this time-tested technique of crop rotations with a new lens of Parrondo's paradox allows us to optimally use the rotation technique in synchrony with uncertainty. While previous approaches are reactive to the diversity of crop types and environmental uncertainties, we make use of the said uncertainties to enhance crop rotation schedules. We calculate optimum switching probabilities in a randomized cropping sequence and suggest optimum deterministic sequences and judicious use of fertilizers.

Extending this theory by replacing single individuals with subpopulations at nodes yields a graph-structured metapopulation.

Growth of microbes in biofilm is one of the main causes of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition, which targets the QS signalling system by obstructing cell-cell communication, was developed as an alternative treatment by creating innovative anti-biofilm drugs. Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop novel antimicrobial drugs that are effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting QS and acting as anti-biofilm agents. In this study, N-(2- and 3-pyridinyl)benzamide derivatives were selected to design and syntheses. Antibiofilm activity was revealed by all the synthesized compounds and the biofilm was visibly impaired, and the OD595nm readings of solubilized biofilm cells presented a momentous difference between the treated and untreated biofilms. The best anti-QS zone was observed for compound 5d and found to be 4.96\u2005mm. Through in\u2005silico research, the physicochemical characteristics and binding manner of these produced compounds were examined. For the purpose of understanding the stability of the protein and ligand complex, molecular dynamic simulation was also carried out.

We have thus performed multiple sequence alignment of 4996 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes as a case study using MAFFT followed by phylogenetic analysis using Nextstrain to identify virus clades. Furthermore, based on the entropy of each genomic coordinate of the aligned sequences, conserved regions are identified. After refinement of the conserved regions, based on its length, one conserved region is identified for which the primers and probes are reported for virus detection. The refined conserved regions are also used to identify T-cell and B-cell epitopes along with their immunogenic and antigenic scores. Such scores are used for selecting the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes.

On the other hand, 12 conserved regions are selected based on refinement criteria out of which one is selected as the potential target for virus detection.

Exploring this association at the population-level may provide novel insights and help to explain differences in COVID-19 severity between countries. We explore whether there is an association between the gut microbiome of people within different countries and the severity of COVID-19, measured as hospitalisation rate. We use data from the large (n = 3,055) open-access gut microbiome repository curatedMetagenomicData, as well as demographic and country-level metadata. Twelve countries were placed\u00a0into two groups (high/low) according to COVID-19 hospitalisation rate before December 2020 (ourworldindata.com). We use an unsupervised machine learning method, Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This method analyses both the local geometry and global topology of a high-dimensional dataset, making it particularly suitable for population-level microbiome data. We report an association of distinct baseline population-level gut microbiome signatures with COVID-19 severity. This was found both with a PERMANOVA, as well as with TDA. Specifically, it suggests an association of anti-inflammatory bacteria, including Bifidobacteria species and Eubacterium rectale, with lower severity, and pro-inflammatory bacteria such as Prevotella copri with higher severity. This study also reports a significant impact of country-level confounders, specifically of the proportion of over 70-year-olds in the population, GDP, and human development index. Further interventional studies should examine whether these relationships are causal, as well as considering the contribution of other variables such as genetics, lifestyle, policy, and healthcare system. The results of this study support the value of a population-level association design in microbiome research in general and for the microbiome-COVID-19 relationship, in particular.

Rarely, it is found in patients with a structurally normal heart. We describe a case of BBR-VT in a patient with normal ventricular function, a year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis. A 73-year-old man with a past medical history of non-obstructive coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis status post-TAVR with a 23-mm Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) about 1 year prior presented with palpitations and syncope. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern and atrioventricular dissociation. The tachycardia was incessant and paroxysmal during 24-h telemetry monitoring. An electrophysiology study showed a normal A-H interval of 90 ms and a prolonged H-V interval of 84 ms with evidence of a split His. A hemodynamically stable VT was induced with a cycle length of 453 ms, which was identical to the clinical VT. This was diagnosed to be BBR-VT given the typical ECG pattern of LBBB, the presence of His inscription before each ventricular signal, and the H-H interval variation-predicted V-V variation when there was a wobble in tachycardia cycle length. Injury of the His-Purkinje system post-TAVR can provide the substrate for the development of BBR-VT.

So far, the theoretical literature has focused on the case of a single mutant entering a graph-structured population, asking how the graph affects the probability that a mutant takes over a population and the time until this typically happens. For continuously evolving systems, the more relevant case is that mutants constantly arise in an evolving population. Typically, such mutations occur with a small probability during reproduction events. We thus focus on the low mutation rate limit. The probability distribution for the fitness in this process converges to a steady state at long times. Intuitively, amplifiers of selection are expected to increase the population's mean fitness in the steady state. Similarly, suppressors of selection are expected to decrease the population's mean fitness in the steady state. However, we show that another set of graphs, called suppressors of fixation, can attain the highest population mean fitness. The key reason behind this is their ability to efficiently reject deleterious mutants.

Thus, they may have similar consequences as caused by the human miRNAs in human body. Therefore, the same way by which human miRNAs are inhibited can be applied for such potential regions of virus as well by administering drugs to the interacting human proteins. In this regard, the multiple sequence alignment technique Clustal Omega is used to align 2656 human miRNAs with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome to identify the potential regions within the virus reference genome which have high similarities with the human miRNAs. The potential regions in virus genome are identified based on the highest number of nucleotide match, greater than or equal to 5 at a genomic position, for the aligned miRNAs. As a result, 38 potential SARS-CoV-2 regions are identified consisting of 249 human miRNAs. Among these 38 potential regions, some top regions belong to nucleocapsid, RdRp, helicase, and ORF8. To understand the biological significance of these potential regions, the targets of the human miRNAs are considered for KEGG pathways and protein-protein and drug-protein interaction analysis as the human miRNAs are similar to the potential regions of SARS-CoV-2.

This can be used for the identification of the target site in a virus by identifying a 3-6 nt length Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) adjacent to the potential target site, thus motivating us to adopt CRISPR-Cas technique to identify SARS-CoV-2 as well as other members of Coronaviridae family. In this regard, we have developed a fast and effective method using k-mer technique in order to identify the PAM by scanning the whole genome of the respective virus. Subsequently, palindromic sequences adjacent to the PAM locations are identified as the potential target sites. Palindromes are considered in this work as they are known to identify viruses. Once all the palindrome-PAM combinations are identified, PAMs specific for the RNA-guided DNA Cas9/Cas12 endonuclease are identified to bind and cut the target sites. In this regard, PAMs such as 5'-TGG-3' and 5'-TTTA-3' in NSP3 and Exon for SARS-CoV-2, 5'-GGG-3' and 5'-TGG-3' in Exon and NSP2 for MERS-CoV and 5'-AGG-3' and 5'-TTTG-3' in Helicase and NSP3 respectively for SARS-CoV-1 are identified corresponding to SpCas9 and FnCas12a endonucleases. Finally, to recognise the target sites of Coronaviridae family as cleaved by SpCas9 and FnCas12a, complements of the palindromic target regions are designed as primers or guide RNA (gRNA). Therefore, such complementary gRNAs along with respective Cas proteins can be considered in assays for the identification of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1.", "Keywords": ["CRISPR-Cas", "Palindrome", "Primer", "Protospacer Adjacent Motif", "SARS-CoV-2", "Target site identification"], "MeSH terms": ["Base Sequence", "CRISPR-Associated Protein 9", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Gene Editing", "Humans", "Inverted Repeat Sequences", "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nimisha", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw, Poland; Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Institute of Technical Education and Research, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (Deemed to be University), Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India."}, {"First Name": "Indrajit", "Last Name": "Saha", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

Among the many pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors, STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein, plays a pivotal role in triggering responses to microbial or cellular cytoplasmic DNA. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a common human pathogen, activates STING signaling, and the resultant induction of type I interferon causes inhibition of virus replication. In this context, we have observed that phosphorylation of Tyr245 of STING by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase is necessary for interferon induction. Here, we report that phosphorylation of Tyr240 by the tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for all signaling activities of STING. Our analysis showed that upon ligand-binding, STING dimerizes and interacts with membrane-bound EGFR, which autophosphorylates and provides the platform for the recruitment of cytoplasmic Syk to the signaling complex and its activation. Activated Syk phosphorylates Tyr240 of STING, followed by phosphorylation of Tyr245 by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Pharmacological or genetic ablation of Syk activity resulted in an arrest of STING in the ER compartment and a complete block of gene induction. Consequently, in the absence of Syk, HSV-1 could not induce interferon, and it replicated more robustly. IMPORTANCE The innate immune response to virus infection leads to interferon production and inhibition of viral replication. STING, an ER-bound protein, mediates such a response to cytoplasmic cellular or microbial DNA. HSV-1, a DNA virus, activates STING, and it replicates more efficiently in the absence of STING signaling. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr240 of STING by the protein tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for STING-mediated gene induction. To signal, ligand-activated STING recruits two kinases, Syk and EGFR, which phosphorylate Tyr240 and Tyr245, respectively. The dependence of STING signaling on Syk has broad significance, because STING plays a major role in many microbial, mitochondrial, and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer development and therapy.", "Keywords": ["EGFR", "HSV-1", "STING signaling", "Syk", "Tyr phosphorylation", "interferon"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "ErbB Receptors", "Herpes Simplex", "Herpesvirus 1, Human", "Humans", "Interferon-beta", "Membrane Proteins", "Phosphorylation", "Syk Kinase", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chenyao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikhil", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manoj", "Last Name": "Veleeparambil", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patricia M", "Last Name": "Kessler", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Belinda", "Last Name": "Willard", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ganes C", "Last Name": "Sen", "Affiliation": "Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinicgrid.239578.2, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2021Dec21"}, {"PMID": "34912372", "Title": "Hotspot Mutations in SARS-CoV-2.", "Abstract": "Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread very rapidly around the world, resulting in a global pandemic. Though the vaccination process has started, the number of COVID-affected patients is still quite large. Hence, an analysis of hotspot mutations of the different evolving virus strains needs to be carried out. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment of 71,038 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 98 countries over the period from January 2020 to June 2021 is performed using MAFFT followed by phylogenetic analysis in order to visualize the virus evolution. These steps resulted in the identification of hotspot mutations as deletions and substitutions in the coding regions based on entropy greater than or equal to 0.3, leading to a total of 45 unique hotspot mutations. Moreover, 10,286 Indian sequences are considered from 71,038 global SARS-CoV-2 sequences as a demonstrative example that gives 52 unique hotspot mutations. Furthermore, the evolution of the hotspot mutations along with the mutations in variants of concern is visualized, and their characteristics are discussed as well. Also, for all the non-synonymous substitutions (missense mutations), the functional consequences of amino acid changes in the respective protein structures are calculated using PolyPhen-2 and I-Mutant 2.0.

Methodology This study took place at a multi-hospital, urban academic medical center. The protocol was developed by neurosurgery and anesthesia faculty, advanced practice providers, nursing, and pharmacy. Timing of the following points was recorded: initial order, order release, pharmacy verification, vancomycin infusion, and surgical incision. Fifty consecutive penicillin-allergic patients undergoing neurosurgical intervention were prospectively enrolled. Data comparison was made between the pilot and retrospective review cohorts. Results The pilot cohort achieved correct administration of vancomycin in 100% of cases. Average infusion start time prior to incision increased by 257% (p<0.0001).

Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also interacts with host proteins to pave its entry into host cells. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 and design of effective antiviral drugs, host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be very useful. In this regard, we have initially created a human-SARS-CoV-2 PPI database from existing works in the literature which has resulted in 7085 unique PPIs. Subsequently, we have identified at most 10 proteins with highest degrees viz. hub proteins from interacting human proteins for individual virus protein. The identification of these hub proteins is important as they are connected to most of the other human proteins. Consequently, when they get affected, the potential diseases are triggered in the corresponding pathways, thereby leading to comorbidities. Furthermore, the biological significance of the identified hub proteins is shown using KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway analysis is also essential for identifying the pathways leading to comorbidities. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 proteins viz. NSP2, NSP5, Envelope and ORF10 interacting with human hub proteins like COX4I1, COX5A, COX5B, NDUFS1, CANX, HSP90AA1 and TP53 lead to comorbidities. Such comorbidities are Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, HTLV-1 infection, prostate cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Subsequently, using Enrichr tool possible repurposable drugs which target the human hub proteins are reported in this paper as well. Therefore, this work provides a consolidated study for human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions to understand the relationship between comorbidity and hub proteins so that it may pave the way for the development of anti-viral drugs.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Comorbidities", "Hub proteins", "Protein-protein interaction", "Repurposable drugs", "SARS-CoV-2"], "MeSH terms": ["Antiviral Agents", "COVID-19", "Comorbidity", "Humans", "SARS-CoV-2", "Viral Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nimisha", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Institute of Technical Education and Research, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (Deemed to Be University), Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Indrajit", "Last Name": "Saha", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

Many DNA viruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1), trigger STING signaling causing inhibition of virus replication. Here, we report that HSV1 evades this antiviral immune response by inducing a cellular microRNA, miR-24, which binds to the 3' untranslated region of STING mRNA and inhibits its translation. Expression of the gene encoding miR-24 is induced by the transcription factor AP1 and activated by MAP kinases in HSV1-infected cells. Introduction of exogenous miR-24 or prior activation of MAPKs, causes further enhancement of HSV1 replication in STING-expressing cells. Conversely, transfection of antimiR-24 inhibits virus replication in those cells. HSV1 infection of mice causes neuropathy and death; using two routes of infection, we demonstrated that intracranial injection of antimiR-24 alleviates both morbidity and mortality of the infected mice.

Although, different forms of vaccines are being rolled out for vaccination programs around the globe, the mutation of the virus is still a cause of concern among the research communities. Hence, it is important to study the constantly evolving virus and its strains in order to provide a much more stable form of cure. This fact motivated us to conduct this research where we have initially carried out multiple sequence alignment of 15359 and 3033 global dataset without Indian and the dataset of exclusive Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes respectively, using MAFFT. Subsequently, phylogenetic analyses are performed using Nextstrain to identify virus clades. Consequently, the virus strains are found to be distributed among 5 major clades or clusters viz. 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C. Thereafter, mutation points as SNPs are identified in each clade. Henceforth, from each clade top 10 signature SNPs are identified based on their frequency i.e. number of occurrences in the virus genome. As a result, 50 such signature SNPs are individually identified for global dataset without Indian and dataset of exclusive Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes respectively. Out of each 50 signature SNPs, 39 and 41 unique SNPs are identified among which 25 non-synonymous signature SNPs (out of 39) resulted in 30 amino acid changes in protein while 27 changes in amino acid are identified from 22 non-synonymous signature SNPs (out of 41). These 30 and 27 amino acid changes for the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in their respective protein structure as well. Finally, in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clades, the non-synonymous signature SNPs are considered to evaluate the changes in proteins as biological functions with the sequences using PROVEAN and PolyPhen-2 while I-Mutant 2.0 is used to evaluate their structural stability. As a consequence, for global dataset without Indian sequences, G251V in ORF3a in clade 19A, F308Y and G196V in NSP4 and ORF3a in 19B are the unique amino acid changes which are responsible for defining each clade as they are all deleterious and unstable. Such changes which are common for both global dataset without Indian and dataset of exclusive Indian sequences are R203M in Nucleocapsid for 20B, T85I and Q57H in NSP2 and ORF3a respectively for 20C while for exclusive Indian sequences such unique changes are A97V in RdRp, G339S and G339C in NSP2 in 19A and Q57H in ORF3a in 20A.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Clade", "Deleterious mutations", "Non-Synonymous Signature SNP", "SARS-CoV-2"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "COVID-19", "Genome, Viral", "Humans", "Mutation", "Phylogeny", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nimisha", "Last Name": "Ghosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Institute of Technical Education and Research, Siksha 'O' Anusandhan (Deemed to be University), Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Indrajit", "Last Name": "Saha", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

Conventional approaches to analyse microbiome data typically entail dimensionality reduction and assume linearity of the observed relationships, however, the microbiome is a highly complex ecosystem marked by non-linear relationships. In this study, we use topological data analysis (TDA) to explore differences and similarities between the gut microbiome across several countries. Methods: We used curated adult microbiome data at the genus level from the GMrepo database. The dataset contains OTU and demographical data of over 4,400 samples from 19 studies, spanning 12 countries. We analysed the data with tmap, an integrative framework for TDA specifically designed for stratification and enrichment analysis of population-based gut microbiome datasets. Results: We find associations between specific microbial genera and groups of countries. Specifically, both the USA and UK were significantly co-enriched with the proinflammatory genera Lachnoclostridium and Ruminiclostridium, while France and New Zealand were co-enriched with other, butyrate-producing, taxa of the order Clostridiales. Conclusion: The TDA approach demonstrates the overlap and distinctions of microbiome composition between and within countries. This yields unique insights into complex associations in the dataset, a finding not possible with conventional approaches.

The present study therefore aimed to empirically investigate ethical concerns regarding informed consent and voluntariness in Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulator (DBS) placement who participated in an intraoperative neuroscience study.MethodsTwo semi-structured 30-minute interviews were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively via telephone.

To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60\u00a0nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2'-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well.

TMS was delivered to the left M1 using single-pulse and three, ppTMS paradigms, each using a different preconditioning stimulus: 70%, 80% or 90% of resting motor threshold. Corticospinal inhibition was present in all three ppTMS conditions. ppTMS TEP peaks were reduced predominantly under the ppTMS 70 protocol but less so for ppTMS 80 and not at all for ppTMS 90. There was a significant negative correlation between MEPs and N45 TEP peak for ppTMS 70 reaching statistical trends for ppTMS 80 and 90. Whilst ppTMS MEPs show inhibition across a range of preconditioning stimulus intensities, ppTMS TEPs do not.

However, during this period, the virus has mutated to adapt to the different environmental conditions in the world and made the task of vaccine design more challenging. In this situation, the identification of virus strains is very much timely and important task. We have performed genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries to identify and prepare a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset of SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, with the use of this SNP data, the advantage of hierarchical clustering is taken care of in such a way so that Average Linkage and Complete Linkage with Jaccard and Hamming distance functions are applied separately in order to identify the virus strains as clusters present in the SNP data. In this regard, the consensus of both the clustering results are also considered while Silhouette index is used as a cluster validity index to measure the goodness of the clusters as well to determine the number of clusters or virus strains. As a result, we have identified five major clusters or virus strains present worldwide. Apart from quantitative measures, these clusters are also visualized using Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) plot. The evolution of these clusters are also shown. Furthermore, top 10 signature SNPs are identified in each cluster and the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in the respective protein structures. Also, the sequence and structural homology-based prediction along with the protein structural stability of these non-synonymous signature SNPs are reported in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clusters. As a consequence, T85I, Q57H and R203M in NSP2, ORF3a and Nucleocapsid respectively are found to be responsible for Cluster 1 as they are damaging and unstable non-synonymous signature SNPs. Similarly, F506L and S507C in Exon are responsible for both Clusters 3 and 4 while Clusters 2 and 5 do not exhibit such behaviour due to the absence of any non-synonymous signature SNPs.

Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which experience drives circuit reorganization to establish a network of Fos-activated cells. It is also not\u00a0known whether FOS is required in this process beyond serving as a marker of recent neural activity and, if so, which of its many gene targets underlie circuit reorganization. Here we demonstrate that when mice engage in spatial exploration of novel environments, perisomatic inhibition of Fos-activated hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by parvalbumin-expressing interneurons is enhanced, whereas perisomatic inhibition by cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons is weakened. This bidirectional modulation of inhibition is abolished when the function of the FOS transcription factor complex is disrupted. Single-cell RNA-sequencing, ribosome-associated mRNA profiling and chromatin analyses, combined with electrophysiology, reveal that FOS activates the transcription of Scg2, a gene that encodes multiple distinct neuropeptides, to coordinate these changes in inhibition. As parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons mediate distinct features of pyramidal cell activity4-6, the SCG2-dependent reorganization of inhibitory synaptic input might be predicted to affect network function in vivo.

It has two different crystallographic polymorphs, \u03b1- and \u03b2-Ni(OH)2 , showing advantages in either theoretical capacity or cycling/rate performance, manifesting a trade-off trend that needs to be optimized for practical applications. Here, the synergistic superiorities in both activity and stability of corrugated \u03b2-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are demonstrated through an electrochemical abuse approach. With \u224891% capacity retention after 10\u00a0000 cycles, the corrugated \u03b2-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 457 C g-1 at a high current density of 30 A g-1 , which is nearly two and four times that of the regular \u03b1- and \u03b2-Ni(OH)2 , respectively. Operando spectroscopy and finite element analysis reveal that greatly enhanced chemical activity and structural robustness can be attributed to the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain-induced highly curved micromorphology.

They are clinically heterogenous and can present as deficits in movement, cognition, executive function, memory, visuospatial awareness and language. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that allows for the assessment of cortical function in vivo. We review how TMS has been used for the investigation of three neurodegenerative diseases that differ in their neuroanatomical axes: (1) Motor cortex-corticospinal tract (motor neuron diseases), (2) Non-motor cortical areas (dementias), and (3) Subcortical structures (parkinsonisms). We also make four recommendations that we hope will benefit the use of TMS in neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, TMS has traditionally been limited by the lack of an objective output and so has been confined to stimulation of the motor cortex; this limitation can be overcome by the use of concurrent neuroimaging methods such as EEG. Given that neurodegenerative diseases progress over time, TMS measures should aim to track longitudinal changes, especially when the aim of the study is to look at disease progression and symptomatology. The lack of gold-standard diagnostic confirmation undermines the validity of findings in clinical populations. Consequently, diagnostic certainty should be maximized through a variety of methods including multiple, independent clinical assessments, imaging and fluids biomarkers, and post-mortem pathological confirmation where possible. There is great interest in understanding the mechanisms by which symptoms arise in neurodegenerative disorders. However, TMS assessments in patients are usually carried out during resting conditions, when the brain network engaged during these symptoms is not expressed. Rather, a context-appropriate form of TMS would be more suitable in probing the physiology driving clinical symptoms. In all, we hope that the recommendations made here will help to further understand the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Parkinson's disease", "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "dementia", "dementia with lewy bodies (DLB)", "motor neuron disease (MND)", "neurodegenarative diseases", "transcrancial magnetic stimulation (TMS)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vishal", "Last Name": "Rawji", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Latorre", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nikhil", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Rothwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Lorenzo", "Last Name": "Rocchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32959674", "Title": "Surgical CPT Coding Discrepancies: Analysis of Surgeons and Employed Coders.", "Abstract": "Surgeon providers and billing professionals use Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to specify patient treatment and associated charges.

It is unclear how specialized gene expression programs emerge during development to endow these subtypes with their unique properties. To assess the developmental progression of transcriptional maturation of each subtype of principal somatosensory neuron, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of cells traversing the primary somatosensory neuron lineage in mice. Here we show that somatosensory neurogenesis gives rise to neurons in a transcriptionally unspecialized state, characterized by co-expression of transcription factors that become restricted to select subtypes as development proceeds. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of sensory neurons from mutant mice lacking transcription factors suggest that these broad-to-restricted transcription factors coordinate subtype-specific gene\u00a0expression programs in subtypes in which their expression is maintained. We also show that neuronal targets are involved in this process; disruption of the prototypic target-derived neurotrophic factor NGF leads to aberrant subtype-restricted patterns of transcription factor expression.

Experiments included measurement of gaseous emissions, and physical, chemical, and biological characterization of exhaust particulate matter (PM).

PM samples exhibited cytotoxic effect on HEK 293T cells (IC50 < 100 \u03bcg/mL) and there was significant potential for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

Approaches to care that have comparable outcomes and complications are increasingly assessed for quality improvement and, when possible, cost containment. Efforts to identify components of care to reduce length of stay (LOS) have been ongoing. Spinal anesthesia (SA), for select lumbar spine procedures, has garnered interest as an alternative to general anesthesia (GA) that might reduce cost and in-hospital LOS and accelerate recovery. While clinical outcomes with SA or GA have been studied extensively, few authors have looked at the cost-analysis in relation to clinical outcomes. The authors' objectives were to compare the clinical perioperative outcomes of patients who received SA and GA, as well as the direct costs associated with each modality of care, and to determine which, in a retrospective analysis, can serve as a dominant procedural approach.METHODSThe authors retrospectively analyzed a homogeneous surgical population of 550 patients who underwent hemilaminotomy for disc herniation and who received either SA (n = 91) or GA (n = 459). All clinical and billing data were obtained via each patient's chart and the hospital's billing database, respectively. Additionally, the authors prospectively assessed patient-reported outcome measures for a subgroup of consecutively treated patients (n = 75) and compared quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains between the two cohorts. Furthermore, the authors performed a propensity score-matching analysis to compare the two cohorts (n = 180).RESULTSDirect hospital costs for patients receiving SA were 40% higher, in the hundreds of dollars, than for patients who received GA (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, there was a significant difference with regard to LOS (p < 0.0001), where patients receiving SA had a considerably longer hospital LOS (27.6% increase in hours). Patients undergoing SA had more comorbidities (p = 0.0053), specifically diabetes and hypertension. However, metrics of complications, including readmission (p = 0.3038) and emergency department (ED) visits at 30 days (p = 1.0), were no different. Furthermore, in a small pilot group, QALY gains were statistically no different (n = 75, p = 0.6708). Propensity score-matching analysis demonstrated similar results as the univariate analysis: there was no difference between the cohorts regarding 30-day readmission (p = 1.0000); ED within 30 days could not be analyzed as there were no patients in the SA group; and total direct costs and LOS were significantly different between the two cohorts (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0126, respectively).CONCLUSIONSBoth SA and GA exhibit the qualities of a good anesthetic, and the utilization of these modalities for lumbar spine surgery is safe and effective. However, this work suggests that SA is associated with increased LOS and higher direct costs, although these differences may not be clinically or fiscally meaningful.", "Keywords": ["ED = emergency department", "GA = general anesthesia", "LOS = length of stay", "OR = operating room", "SA = spinal anesthesia", "general anesthesia", "hemilaminotomy", "lumbar surgery", "spinal anesthesia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Anesthesia, Spinal", "Female", "Humans", "Intervertebral Disc Degeneration", "Intervertebral Disc Displacement", "Lumbar Vertebrae", "Lumbosacral Region", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nikhil", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Piazza", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Marcotte", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Ali K", "Last Name": "Ozturk", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "H Isaac", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Zarina S", "Last Name": "Ali", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Schuster", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}, {"First Name": "Neil R", "Last Name": "Malhotra", "Affiliation": "1Department of Neurosurgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

Some important feature vectors were used to train the algorithm, which included pseudo-amino acid composition (PAAC) and five-factor solution score (5FSS). This clearly differentiated into two groups of nitrilases, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic, achieving maximum sensitivity of 100.00%, specificity of 90.00%, accuracy of 95.00% and Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of about 0.90 for the pseudo-amino acid composition. On the other hand, five-factor solution score achieved a sensitivity of 96.00%, specificity of 84.00%, accuracy of 90.00% and Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of about 0.81. The total count of aliphatic amino acids, Ala (A), Gly (G), Leu (L), Ile (I), Val (V), Met (M) and Pro (P), was found to be higher, i.e., 42.7 in case of aliphatic nitrilases, whereas it was 40.1 in aromatic nitrilases.

NS1 is a highly conserved non-structural protein among flaviviruses, which exist in diverse forms.

The miRNAs regulate the gene expression post-transcriptionally. Viral infection strongly influences the abundance and the distribution of miRNAs and other ncRNAs within the host cells. Viruses may encode their own miRNA, which help in the viral life cycle and other aspects of pathogenesis. Viruses are known to successfully modulate the expression pattern of ncRNAs.

MicroRNAs are regulatory non-coding RNAs which regulate the expression of various genes in cells. Viruses modulate the expression of various microRNAs to suppress anti-viral signaling and evade the immune response. SOCS (Suppressor of cytokine signalling) family of proteins are negative regulators of anti-viral Jak-STAT pathway. In this study, we demonstrated the regulatory role of SOCS5 in Jak-STAT signaling and its exploitation by JEV through a microRNA mediated mechanism. JEV infection in human brain microglial cells (CHME3) downregulated the expression of miR-432, and upregulated SOCS5 levels. SOCS5 was validated as a target of miR-432 by using 3'UTR clone of SOCS5 in luciferase vector along with miR-432 mimic. The overexpression of miR-432 prior to JEV infection enhanced the phosphorylation of STAT1 resulting into increased ISRE activity and cellular inflammatory response resulting into diminished viral replication. The knockdown of SOCS5 resulted into increased STAT1 phosphorylation and suppressed viral replication. JEV infection mediated downregulation of miR-432 leads to SOCS5 upregulation, which helps the virus to evade cellular anti-viral response.

Most fructose is cleared by the portal system and metabolized in the liver; however, systemic levels of fructose can rise with increased consumption. We tested whether there were sex differences in the renal responses to a high-fructose diet in mice. Two-month-old male and female C57BL6/129/SV mice (n = 6 mice per sex per treatment) were randomized to receive control or high-fructose (65% by weight) diets as pelleted chow ad libitum for 3 mo. Fructose feeding did not significantly affect body weight but led to a 19% and 10% increase in kidney weight in male and female mice, respectively. In male mice, fructose increased the expression (\u223c50%) of renal cortical proteins involved in metabolism, including glucose transporter 5 (facilitative fructose transporter), ketohexokinase, and the insulin receptor (\u03b2-subunit). Female mice had lower basal levels of glucose transporter 5, which were unresponsive to fructose. However, female mice had increased urine volume and plasma K(+) and decreased plasma Na(+) with fructose, whereas male mice were less affected. Likewise, female mice showed a two- to threefold reduction in the expression Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter 2 in the thick ascending limb and aquaporin-2 in the collecting duct with fructose relative to female control mice, whereas male mice had no change. Overall, our results support greater proximal metabolism of fructose in male animals and greater distal tubule/collecting duct (electrolyte homeostasis) alterations in female animals.

The motor system adapts to maintain motor performance with the primary motor cortex (BA4) emerging as a pivotal node within this neuroplastic process. Studies of ageing often consider BA4 a homogenous area but cytoarchitectonic studies have revealed two subdivisions, an anterior (BA4a) and posterior subdivision (BA4p). Here we focus upon the effects of ageing on the involvement of BA4a and BA4p during movement and motor imagery (MI). Thirty-one right-handed healthy volunteers were recruited and screened for their ability to perform imagery (5 subjects excluded). The sample was split into an older group (n = 13, mean age 56.4 SD 9.4) and a younger group (n = 13, mean age 27.4 SD 5.3). We used an fMRI block-design (auditory-paced [1 Hz] right hand finger-thumb opposition sequence [2,3,4,5, 2...]) with MI & rest and actual movement & rest. We explored the distribution-based clustering and weighted laterality index within BA4a and BA4p. The involvement of BA4p during MI (measured with distribution-based clustering) was significantly greater in the older group (p<0.05) than in the younger group. Hemispheric balance of BA4p decreased with age during MI (Spearman rho -0.371; p<0.05), whereas that of BA4a decreased with age during actual movement (Spearman rho =\u200a-0.458 p<0.01). Irrespective of age, we found BA4 is involved during motor imagery, strengthening the rationale for its potential use in older subjects.

Precisely timed somatic inhibition limits both the number of action potentials and the time window during which firing can occur. The activity-dependent transcription factor NPAS4 regulates inhibitory synapse number and function in cell culture, but how this transcription factor affects the inhibitory inputs that form on distinct domains of a neuron in vivo was unclear. Here we show that in the mouse hippocampus behaviourally driven expression of NPAS4 coordinates the redistribution of inhibitory synapses made onto a CA1 pyramidal neuron, simultaneously increasing inhibitory synapse number on the cell body while decreasing the number of inhibitory synapses on the apical dendrites. This rearrangement of inhibition is mediated in part by the NPAS4 target gene brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), which specifically regulates somatic, and not dendritic, inhibition.
