The reference method for SM mass measurement is whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) appendicular lean mass (ALM) serves as an affordable and practical SM surrogate. Empirical equations, developed on relatively small and diverse samples, are now used to predict total body SM from ALM and other covariates; prediction models for extremity SM mass are lacking. The aim of the current study was to develop and validate total body, arm, and leg SM mass prediction equations based on a large sample (N\u2009=\u2009475) of adults evaluated with whole-body MRI and DXA for SM and ALM, respectively. Initial models were fit using ordinary least squares stepwise selection procedures; covariates beyond extremity lean mass made only small contributions to the final models that were developed using Deming regression. All three developed final models (total, arm, and leg) had high R2s (0.88-0.93; all p\u2009<\u20090.001) and small root-mean square errors (1.74, 0.41, and 0.95\u00a0kg) with no bias in the validation sample (N\u2009=\u200995). The new total body SM prediction model (SM\u2009=\u20091.12\u2009\u00d7\u2009ALM - 0.63) showed good performance, with some bias, against previously reported DXA-ALM prediction models. These new total body and extremity SM prediction models, developed and validated in a large sample, afford an important and practical opportunity to evaluate SM mass in research and clinical

To support this premise, preliminary data on the relation between sleep duration and quality and long-term weight change in a subsample of participants from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery are presented. Results indicate a relation between sleep duration and BMI and percent weight loss 9 years after surgery. Additionally, sleep quality explained 25% of the variance in weight change between 6- and 9-year follow-up visits. These data from a small exploratory study, in combination with the known effects of sleep on energy balance, suggest that sleep may play an important role in both immediate and sustained weight loss following bariatric surgery.

Birth cohort analyses of prenatal exposures to PAH and child BMI Z-scores from age 5-14 years were conducted. African-American and Hispanic children born in the Bronx or Northern Manhattan, New York (1998-2006), whose mothers underwent personal air monitoring for airborne PAH exposure during pregnancy, were followed up with measurements of height and weight at approximate ages 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12.5 and 13.5 years. Multivariable generalized estimating equation analyses were used to relate prenatal airborne PAH exposures to child BMI Z-scores through time. The analyses adjusted for many known risk factors for childhood obesity and included interactions terms between age and exposure tertiles and age squared and exposure tertiles. In total, 535 children had at least one height and weight measure during follow-up. The prevalence of obesity was 20.6% at age 5 and increased across follow-ups until age 11 when it was 33.0%. At age 5, BMI Z-scores were significantly greater for children in the third tertile of exposure relative to the first tertile (0.35 Z-score units, 95% CI 0.09, 0.61, p\u202f=\u202f0.007) and were non-significantly higher for the second tertile of exposure compared to the first tertile (0.25 Z-score units, 95% CI -0.02, 0.52, P\u202f=\u202f0.075). The trajectories of BMI Z-scores by tertiles of exposure converged as the children aged, such that by age 11 years the estimated mean BMI Z-scores associated with each tertile of exposure were not different. Prenatal exposures to airborne PAH were associated with higher childhood BMI Z-scores at a young age, but growth trajectories converged by age 11 years. Accordingly, highly exposed children spend a greater proportion of their childhood with higher BMI Z-scores.", "Keywords": ["Air pollution", "Body mass index", "Obesity", "Pediatric", "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Air Pollution", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Environmental Exposure", "Female", "Growth and Development", "Humans", "New York", "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew G", "Last Name": "Rundle", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, United States.

The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effects of triiodothyronine (T3) repletion on energy homeostasis and skeletal muscle physiology in weight-reduced subjects and to compare these results with the effects of leptin repletion. Nine healthy in-patients with obesity were studied at usual weight (Wtinitial) and following a 10% dietary weight loss while receiving 5 wk of a placebo (Wt-10%placebo) or T3 (Wt-10%T3) in a single-blind crossover design. Primary outcome variables were skeletal muscle work efficiency and vastus lateralis muscle mRNA expression. These results were compared with the effects of leptin repletion in a population of 22 subjects, some of whom participated in a previous study. At Wt-10%placebo, skeletal muscle work efficiency and relative expression of the more-efficient/less-efficient MHC I/MHC II isoforms were significantly increased and the ratio of the less-efficient to the more-efficient sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoforms (SERCA1/SERCA2) was significantly decreased. These changes were largely reversed by T3 repletion to a degree similar to the changes that occurred with leptin repletion. These data support the hypothesis that the effects of leptin on energy expenditure in weight-reduced individuals are largely mediated by T3 and suggest that further study of the possible role of thyroid hormone repletion as adjunctive therapy to help sustain weight loss is needed.", "Keywords": ["energy homeostasis", "leptin", "muscle", "thyroid", "weight loss"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cross-Over Studies", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Humans", "Leptin", "Male", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Obesity", "Single-Blind Method", "Triiodothyronine", "Weight Loss", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Rosenbaum", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rochelle L", "Last Name": "Goldsmith", "Affiliation": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Fadia", "Last Name": "Haddad", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California at Irvine , Irvine, California."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth M", "Last Name": "Baldwin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California at Irvine , Irvine, California."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Smiley", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dympna", "Last Name": "Gallagher", "Affiliation": "Obesity Research Center, Columbia University, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital , New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rudolph L", "Last Name": "Leibel", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Practical estimations of total adipose tissue mass (TATM), total adipose tissue fat mass (TATFM) and total body fat are valuable for epidemiology, but validated prediction equations based on MRI are not currently available. We aimed to derive and validate new anthropometric equations to estimate MRI-measured TATM/TATFM/total body fat and compare them with existing prediction equations using older methods. The derivation sample included 416 participants (222 women), aged between 18 and 88 years with BMI between 15\u00b79 and 40\u00b78 (kg/m2). The validation sample included 204 participants (110 women), aged between 18 and 86 years with BMI between 15\u00b77 and 36\u00b74 (kg/m2). Both samples included mixed ethnic/racial groups. All the participants underwent whole-body MRI to quantify TATM (dependent variable) and anthropometry (independent variables). Prediction equations developed using stepwise multiple regression were further investigated for agreement and bias before validation in separate data sets. Simplest equations with optimal R (2) and Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good agreement without bias in the validation analyses: men: TATM (kg)=0\u00b7198 weight (kg)+0\u00b7478 waist (cm)-0\u00b7147 height (cm)-12\u00b78 (validation: R 2 0\u00b779, CV=20 %, standard error of the estimate (SEE)=3\u00b78 kg) and women: TATM (kg)=0\u00b7789 weight (kg)+0\u00b70786 age (years)-0\u00b7342 height (cm)+24\u00b75 (validation: R (2) 0\u00b784, CV=13 %, SEE=3\u00b70 kg). Published anthropometric prediction equations, based on MRI and computed tomographic scans, correlated strongly with MRI-measured TATM: (R (2) 0\u00b770-0\u00b782). Estimated TATFM correlated well with published prediction equations for total body fat based on underwater weighing (R (2) 0\u00b770-0\u00b780), with mean bias of 2\u00b75-4\u00b79 kg, correctable with log-transformation in most equations.

Its diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are in a state of flux. It is evident that hyponatremic patients are symptomatic with a potential for serious consequences at sodium levels that were once considered trivial. The recommendation to treat virtually all hyponatremics exposes the need to resolve the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma of deciding whether to water restrict a patient with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or administer salt and water to a renal salt waster. In this review, we briefly discuss the pathophysiology of SIADH and renal salt wasting (RSW), and the difficulty in differentiating SIADH from RSW, and review the origin of the perceived rarity of RSW, as well as the value of determining fractional excretion of urate (FEurate) in differentiating both syndromes, the high prevalence of RSW which highlights the inadequacy of the volume approach to hyponatremia, the importance of changing cerebral salt wasting to RSW, and the proposal to eliminate reset osmostat as a subtype of SIADH, and finally propose a new algorithm to replace the outmoded volume approach by highlighting FEurate. This algorithm eliminates the need to assess the volume status with less reliance on determining urine sodium concentration, plasma renin, aldosterone and atrial/brain natriuretic peptide or the BUN to creatinine ratio.", "Keywords": ["algorithm", "fractional excretion urate (FEurate)", "hyponatremia", "renal salt wasting"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John K", "Last Name": "Maesaka", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, NY 11501, USA. jmaesaka@winthrop.org."}, {"First Name": "Louis", "Last Name": "Imbriano", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, NY 11501, USA. limbriano@winthrop.org."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Mattana", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, NY 11501, USA. jmattana@winthrop.org."}, {"First Name": "Dympna", "Last Name": "Gallagher", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA. dg108@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Naveen", "Last Name": "Bade", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, NY 11501, USA. nbade@winthrop.org."}, {"First Name": "Sairah", "Last Name": "Sharif", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, NY 11501, USA. ssharif@winthrop.org."}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "PubDate": "2014Dec08"}, {"PMID": "24170704", "Title": "Body composition analysis by air displacement plethysmography in normal weight to extremely obese adults.", "Abstract": "To compare body composition parameters estimated by air displacement plethysmography (ADP) to dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in body mass index (BMI) classifications that include extremely obese (BMI \u2265 40.0 kg/m(2) ), and to examine if differences between analyses were influenced by BMI.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adult", "Body Composition", "Body Weight", "Female", "Health", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Plethysmography", "Retrospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kazanna C", "Last Name": "Hames", "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Physical Activity, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven J", "Last Name": "Anthony", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Thornton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dympna", "Last Name": "Gallagher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bret H", "Last Name": "Goodpaster", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}, {"PMID": "23522982", "Title": "Comparison of the relationship between bone marrow adipose tissue and volumetric bone mineral density in children and adults.", "Abstract": "Several large-scale studies have reported the presence of an inverse relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in adults.
