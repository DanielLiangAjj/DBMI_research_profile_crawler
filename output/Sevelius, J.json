Among trans women, gender-based stigma intersects with social positions such as engagement in sex work and substance use, as well as race-based stigma to generate a social context of vulnerability and increased risk of HIV acquisition. In Brazil, trans women are the 'most at-risk' group for HIV, with 55 times higher estimated odds of HIV infection than the general population; further, uptake of HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among trans women is significantly lower than other at-risk groups. Through extensive formative work, we developed Manas por Manas, a multilevel intervention using HIV prevention strategies with demonstrated feasibility and acceptability by trans women in Brazil, to address intersectional stigma and increase engagement in the HIV prevention continuum.", "Keywords": ["HIV & AIDS", "clinical trial", "health equity", "primary prevention", "transgender persons"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Transgender Persons", "Brazil", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Social Stigma", "Male", "Adult", "HIV Testing", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Young Adult", "Adolescent", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jae", "Last Name": "Sevelius", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA js6254@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Maria Amelia Sousa Mascena", "Last Name": "Veras", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas da Santa Casa de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Jose Luis", "Last Name": "Gomez", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas da Santa Casa de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Gustavo", "Last Name": "Saggese", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas da Santa Casa de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Adrienne Rain", "Last Name": "Mocello", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katia Cristina", "Last Name": "Bassichetto", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias M\u00e9dicas da Santa Casa de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Torsten B", "Last Name": "Neilands", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sheri A", "Last Name": "Lippman", "Affiliation": "Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."}], "Journal": "BMJ open", "PubDate": "2024Jun21"}, {"PMID": "38673414", "Title": "Intersectional Mentorship in Academic Medicine: A Conceptual Review.", "Abstract": "Academic medical institutions seek to recruit and retain a diverse workforce to foster equitable, supportive environments in which early-stage investigators, especially those who are underrepresented in medicine, can thrive. Intersectionality is a critical theoretical framework rooted in Black feminist activism and scholarship that elucidates how power and privilege are differentially structured for groups at different intersectional sociodemographic positions. As a dynamic method of analyzing multiple axes of power and inequality, intersectionality has the potential to offer a critical lens through which to view the mentor-mentee relationship. In this article, we seek to elaborate upon and extend the concept of intersectional mentoring, elucidate its essential components, and explore its application in the context of mentoring early-stage investigators in academic medicine. We propose that intersectional mentorship requires an orientation toward deep cultural humility, lifetime learning about the impact of systemic oppressions on present-day opportunities and experiences of mentees, and changing systems that perpetuate inequities by centering praxis-the application of principles of intersectionality through action to transform power dynamics in academic culture and institutions. Intersectional mentorship can help build a more equitable and representative workforce to advance intersectionally relevant and innovative approaches to achieving health equity.", "Keywords": ["academic medicine", "health equity", "intersectionality", "mentoring"], "MeSH terms": ["Mentors", "Humans", "Academic Medical Centers", "Mentoring"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jae M", "Last Name": "Sevelius", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Orlando O", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Community Health Systems, School of Nursing, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Bowleg", "Affiliation": "Applied Social Psychology, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "PubDate": "2024Apr19"}, {"PMID": "38556932", "Title": "Online Group Psychotherapy to Increase Self-acceptance and Reduce Shame Among Transgender Migrants: An Observational Report.", "Abstract": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people experience higher levels of stigma, discrimination, and interpersonal violence due to their gender identity and/or expression, particularly TGD people with a migration background.

In Phase II, we conducted 15 in-depth interviews with PrEP-experienced TW and used thematic analysis to explain Phase I findings.

TW engaged in \"non-survival sex work\" had little difficulty staying on PrEP, while those engaged in \"survival sex work\" struggled to stay on PrEP. In Phase I, fewer participants not retained at 24 weeks reported gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) use (56% versus 71%). In Phase II, participants prioritized medical gender affirmation services over PrEP but also described the bidirectional benefits of accessing GAHT and PrEP.

Methods: This is a secondary analysis of baseline data from Trans Amigas, a study conducted in Brazil, 2018. The study population consisted of TGW living with HIV, older than 18 years, residing in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area. We used multivariable logistic regression (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05), mediation, and bootstrapping for the analysis. Results: One hundred and thirteen participants completed the study. Fear of public mistreatment had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 7.42 (p\u2009=\u20090.003) for difficulty reporting new symptoms to providers. Concerning fear of public mistreatment, we found that unemployment had an aOR of 3.62 (p\u2009=\u20090.036); sex work, an aOR of 2.95 (p\u2009=\u20090.041); and issues related to name change in documents, an aOR of 2.71 (p\u2009=\u20090.033). For the indirect effect on difficulty reporting new symptoms, mediated by fear of public mistreatment, unemployment had an aOR of 1.52 (confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.88-2.24); sex work, an aOR of 1.48 (CI\u2009=\u20090.81-2.52); and name change issues, an aOR of 1.47 (CI\u2009=\u20090.96-2.43). Conclusions: Anticipated stigma was associated with communication difficulties between TGW living with HIV and providers. Our data suggest that structural factors associated with anticipated stigma could indirectly impact on difficulty reporting new symptoms. These findings indicate the importance of considering social contexts that intersect with individual experiences when analyzing communication barriers between providers and patients, and the need to strengthen social policies for TGW in Brazil.

In formative work, we identified culturally specific and modifiable barriers to HIV treatment engagement among transgender women living with HIV (TWH), including prioritizing transition-related healthcare over HIV treatment, avoiding HIV care settings due to gender-related and HIV stigma, concerns about potential drug interactions with hormones, and inadequate social support. Grounded in the investigators' Models of Gender Affirmation and Health Care Empowerment, we developed the Healthy Divas intervention to optimize engagement in HIV care among TWH at risk for treatment failure and consequential morbidity, mortality, and onward transmission of HIV. Methods and Analysis: We conducted a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention's efficacy in Los Angeles and San Francisco to improve engagement in care among TWH (N = 278). The primary outcome was virologic control indicated by undetectable HIV-1 level (undetectability = < 20 copies/mL), at baseline and follow-up assessment for 12 months at 3-month intervals.

Many TGD clients are seeking care related to affirming their gender identity but also may present with anxiety, depression, trauma, substance abuse, or other problems for which a clinician may commonly provide services. Some clinicians may hesitate to accept TGD clients into their practice if they have little specialized training to work with this population in an affirming manner, especially in more underserved areas where a generalist practice is the norm. Numerous professional associations and experts have developed guidelines for affirmative behavioral health care for TGD people. However, what is needed are community informed recommendations to bridge from the official guidelines to clinicians' in-session activities. The Trans Collaborations Practice Adaptations for Psychological Interventions for Transgender and Gender Diverse Adults are derived from iterative interviews with TGD community members and affirming mental health clinicians in the Central United States. The 12 practice adaptations are intended to guide clinicians to adapt their usual treatment approach to be TGD affirming, especially in underserved and rural areas. The practice adaptations cover numerous aspects of practice including the office setting and paperwork, understanding gender identity and incorporating it into the case conceptualization, therapist's self-awareness, and referrals. The Trans Collaborations Practice Adaptations will help clinicians work confidently and competently with adult TGD clients, regardless of the presenting problem, to ensure TGD communities receive the best interventions for their behavioral health concerns.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Debra A", "Last Name": "Hope", "Affiliation": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln."}, {"First Name": "Natalie R", "Last Name": "Holt", "Affiliation": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln."}, {"First Name": "Nathan", "Last Name": "Woodruff", "Affiliation": "Trans Collaborations Local Community Board Richard Mocarski."}, {"First Name": "Heather", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "University of Nebraska at Kearney."}, {"First Name": "Jae A", "Last Name": "Puckett", "Affiliation": "Michigan State University."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Eyer", "Affiliation": "University of Alabama."}, {"First Name": "Shelley", "Last Name": "Craig", "Affiliation": "University of Toronto."}, {"First Name": "Jamie", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "University of Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Jay", "Last Name": "Irwin", "Affiliation": "University of Nebraska - Omaha."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Pachankis", "Affiliation": "Yale University."}, {"First Name": "K J", "Last Name": "Rawson", "Affiliation": "Northeastern University."}, {"First Name": "Jae", "Last Name": "Sevelius", "Affiliation": "University of California, San Francisco."}, {"First Name": "Sim", "Last Name": "Butler", "Affiliation": "University of Alabama."}], "Journal": "Professional psychology, research and practice", "PubDate": "2022Aug"}, {"PMID": "35818894", "Title": "The ethical imperative to reduce HIV stigma through community-engaged, status-neutral interventions designed with and for transgender women of colour in the United States.", "Abstract": "In the era of biomedical HIV prevention and treatment technologies, such as treatment as prevention (TasP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), there is momentum to develop and rigorously evaluate interventions focused on PrEP among those at risk for HIV acquisition and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV.

We sought to understand the contextual factors affecting how SGM research participants interact with SOGI questions to enhance participant experience and increase the accuracy and sensitivity of research findings. Methods: We recruited SGM adults for in-person semi-structured focus groups or online cognitive interviews from 2016 to 2018. During focus groups and cognitive interviews, we asked participants to respond to SOGI question sets. We employed template analysis to describe the contextual factors that affected SGM participants' responses to SOGI questions. Results: We had a total of 74 participants, including 55 participants organized into nine focus groups and 19 participants in cognitive interviews. Most self-identified as a sexual minority person (88%), and 51% identified as a gender minority person. Two main themes were: (1) the need to know the relevance (of why SOGI questions are asked) and (2) the importance of environmental and contextual cues (communicating physical safety and freedom from discrimination that influenced SOGI disclosure). Conclusions: Contextualizing the relevance of SOGI data sought could help improve the accuracy and sensitivity of data collection efforts. Environmental cues that communicate acceptance and safety for SGM individuals in research settings may support disclosure.

We conducted a qualitative study to answer the question, \"For SGM people, what are the major limitations with current SOGI questions?\" Focus groups probed reactions to SOGI questions adapted from prior national surveys and clinical best practice guidelines. Questions were refined and presented in semi-structured cognitive interviews. Template analysis using a priori themes guided analysis. There were 74 participants: 55 in nine focus groups and 19 in cognitive interviews. Participants were diverse: 51.3% identified as gender minorities, 87.8% as sexual minorities, 8.1% as Hispanic/Latinx, 13.5% as Black or African-American, and 43.2% as Non-white. Two major themes emerged: (1) SOGI questions did not allow for identity fluidity and complexity, reducing inclusion and representation, and (2) SOGI question stems and answer choices were often not clear as to which SOGI dimension was being assessed. To our knowledge, this represents the largest body of qualitative data studying SGM perspectives when responding to SOGI questions.

Thirty-eight women (10 trans, 25 cis, and 3 \"other\" gender) participated in six semistructured, facilitated focus groups. In addition, five HIV care providers participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Both trans and cis women identified the desire for gender affirmation, a feeling of safety (specifically space without men), and potential community building within a care and healing context as powerful facilitators of an inclusive all-women care environment. At the same time, they recognized that tensions do exist between idealized visions of such an environment, deep-seated sentiments and behaviors among some cis women toward trans women, and the practical realities of creating the optimal spaces for all women.

Relationship stigma-the anticipation of negative treatment based on having a relationship with a member of a stigmatized group-has been linked to adverse health behaviors, but it remains unclear whether different sources of relationship stigma (i.e., family, friends, and the general public) are associated with HIV risk behaviors and whether these associations may vary by men's sexual identities (e.g., gay, bisexual, and heterosexual). The current study examined associations between relationship stigma and HIV risk behaviors and whether these associations were moderated by sexual identity. We recruited a convenience sample of 185 cisgender men in primary partnerships with transgender women to participate in a one-time survey. Gay identified men reported greater levels of relationship stigma from the general public compared with heterosexually identified men. In multivariable models, higher levels of relationship stigma from the public were associated with increased odds of engaging in drug use prior to having condomless sex and receiving an STI diagnosis in the last 30\u00a0days. There were significant interaction effects such that higher levels of relationship stigma from the public were associated with both indicators of HIV risk for gay identified men but not for heterosexually identified men.

This study examined the role of syndemic conditions and social gender affirmation processes (living full-time in one's identified gender) in potentiating sexual risk among TMSM adults in Massachusetts, US. Cross-sectional data were restricted to TMSM who reported lifetime sexual behaviour with a cisgender male (n\u2009=\u2009173; mean age\u2009=\u200929.4, SD\u2009=\u20099.6; 18.5% people of colour; 93.1% non-heterosexual identity; 56.1% hormones/surgery). Sexual risk outcomes were: lifetime STI diagnoses, three or more sexual partners in the previous six months, and condomless anal/vaginal sex at last encounter with a cisgender male. Age- and survey mode-adjusted logistic regression models regressed sexual risk outcomes on the main effect of syndemics (six indicators summed: binge drinking, substance use, depression, anxiety, childhood abuse, intimate partner violence), followed by the interaction of syndemics and social gender affirmation. Syndemics were associated with increased odds of all sexual risk indicators (adjusted odds ratios [aORs]\u2009=\u20091.32-1.55; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Social gender affirmation moderated the association between syndemics and condomless anal/vaginal sex at last encounter with a cisgender male (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Syndemics were associated with sexual risk in TMSM who had socially affirmed their gender (aOR\u2009=\u20091.79; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.42-2.25; p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not among those TMSM who had not (aOR\u2009=\u20090.86; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.63-1.19; p\u2009=\u20090.37).

Respondents who indicated a transfeminine gender identity were included in the current study (n = 3,878). Multivariable logistic regression was used to model ever being incarcerated and experiencing victimization while incarcerated as a function of race/ethnicity and health-related indicators. Overall, 19.3% reported having ever been incarcerated. Black and Native American/Alaskan Native transgender women were more likely to report a history of incarceration than White (non-Hispanic) respondents, and those with a history of incarceration were more likely to report negative health-related indicators, including self-reporting as HIV-positive. Among previously incarcerated respondents, 47.0% reported victimization while incarcerated. Black, Latina, and mixed race transgender women were more likely to report experiences of victimization while incarcerated.
