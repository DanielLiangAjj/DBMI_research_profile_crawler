movement requires descending input from the motor cortex and sensory feedback through the spinal cord. We previously developed a paired brain and spinal electrical stimulation approach in rats that relies on convergence of the descending motor and spinal sensory stimuli in the cervical cord. This approach strengthened sensorimotor circuits and improved volitional movement through associative plasticity. In humans, it is not known whether posterior epidural spinal cord stimulation targeted at the sensorimotor interface or anterior epidural spinal cord stimulation targeted within the motor system is effective at facilitating brain evoked responses. In 59 individuals undergoing elective cervical spine decompression surgery, the motor cortex was stimulated with scalp electrodes and the spinal cord was stimulated with epidural electrodes, with muscle responses being recorded in arm and leg muscles. Spinal electrodes were placed either posteriorly or anteriorly, and the interval between cortex and spinal cord stimulation was varied. Pairing stimulation between the motor cortex and spinal sensory (posterior) but not spinal motor (anterior) stimulation produced motor evoked potentials that were over five times larger than brain stimulation alone. This strong augmentation occurred only when descending motor and spinal afferent stimuli were timed to converge in the spinal cord. Paired stimulation also increased the selectivity of muscle responses relative to unpaired brain or spinal cord stimulation. Finally, clinical signs suggest that facilitation was observed in both injured and uninjured segments of the spinal cord. The large effect size of this paired stimulation makes it a promising candidate for therapeutic neuromodulation. KEY POINTS: Pairs of stimuli designed to alter nervous system function typically target the motor system, or one targets the sensory system and the other targets the motor system for convergence in cortex. In humans undergoing clinically indicated surgery, we tested paired brain and spinal cord stimulation that we developed in rats aiming to target sensorimotor convergence in the cervical cord. Arm and hand muscle responses to paired sensorimotor stimulation were more than five times larger than brain or spinal cord stimulation alone when applied to the posterior but not anterior spinal cord. Arm and hand muscle responses to paired stimulation were more selective for targeted muscles than the brain- or spinal-only conditions, especially at latencies that produced the strongest effects of paired stimulation. Measures of clinical evidence of compression were only weakly related to the paired stimulation effect, suggesting that it could be applied as therapy in people affected by disorders of the central nervous system.", "Keywords": ["cervical", "electrical stimulation", "epidural", "motor cortex", "motor evoked potentials", "myelopathy", "spinal cord"], "MeSH terms": ["Motor Cortex", "Humans", "Male", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Middle Aged", "Spinal Cord", "Adult", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Spinal Cord Stimulation", "Aged", "Electric Stimulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "McIntosh", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evan F", "Last Name": "Joiner", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob L", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phoebe", "Last Name": "Greenwald", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra C", "Last Name": "Dionne", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynda M", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Earl", "Last Name": "Thuet", "Affiliation": "New York Presbyterian, The Och Spine Hospital, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oleg", "Last Name": "Modik", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evgeny", "Last Name": "Shelkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Lombardi", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeeshan M", "Last Name": "Sardar", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald A", "Last Name": "Lehman", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew K", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "K Daniel", "Last Name": "Riew", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Noam Y", "Last Name": "Harel", "Affiliation": "Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Virk", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine\u00a0-\u00a0New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mandigo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason B", "Last Name": "Carmel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of physiology", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38706113", "Title": "Is Upper Extremity or Lower Extremity Function More Important for Patient Satisfaction?

We examined whether the stool proteome of mouse models of GC or individuals with hereditary diffuse GC (HDGC) have utility as biomarkers for early detection. Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool from a genetically engineered mouse model driven by oncogenic KrasG12D and loss of p53 and Cdh1 in gastric parietal cells (known as TCON mice) identified differentially abundant proteins compared to littermate controls. Immunoblot assays validated a panel of proteins including actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2 (ASAH2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and valosin-containing protein (VCP) as enriched in TCON stool compared to littermate control stool. Immunofluorescence analysis of these proteins in TCON stomach sections revealed increased protein expression as compared to littermate controls. Proteomic mass spectrometry of stool obtained from HDGC patients with CDH1 mutations identified increased expression of ASAH2, DPP4, VCP, lactotransferrin (LTF), and tropomyosin-2 (TPM2) relative to stool from healthy sex and age-matched donors. Chemical inhibition of ASAH2 using C6-urea ceramide was toxic to GC cell lines and patient derived-GC organoids. This toxicity was reversed by adding downstream products of the S1P synthesis pathway, suggesting a dependency on ASAH2 activity in GC. An exploratory analysis of the HDGC stool microbiome identified features which correlated with patient tumors.

Mathematical modeling can help evaluate the role of each mutational process during tumor progression, however existing frameworks can only capture certain aspects of chromosomal instability (CIN). We present CINner, a mathematical framework for modeling genomic diversity and selection during tumor evolution. The main advantage of CINner is its flexibility to incorporate many genomic events that directly impact cellular fitness, from driver gene mutations to copy number alterations (CNAs), including focal amplifications and deletions, missegregations and whole-genome duplication (WGD). We apply CINner to find chromosome-arm selection parameters that drive tumorigenesis in the absence of WGD in chromosomally stable cancer types. We found that the selection parameters predict WGD prevalence among different chromosomally unstable tumors, hinting that the selective advantage of WGD cells hinges on their tolerance for aneuploidy and escape from nullisomy. Direct application of CINner to model the WGD proportion and fraction of genome altered (FGA) further uncovers the increase in CNA probabilities associated with WGD in each cancer type. CINner can also be utilized to study chromosomally stable cancer types, by applying a selection model based on driver gene mutations and focal amplifications or deletions. Finally, we used CINner to analyze the impact of CNA probabilities, chromosome selection parameters, tumor growth dynamics and population size on cancer fitness and heterogeneity. We expect that CINner will provide a powerful modeling tool for the oncology community to quantify the impact of newly uncovered genomic alteration mechanisms on shaping tumor progression and adaptation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Khanh N", "Last Name": "Dinh", "Affiliation": "Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ignacio", "Last Name": "V\u00e1zquez-Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rhea", "Last Name": "Malhotra", "Affiliation": "Computational Oncology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Weiner", "Affiliation": "Computational Oncology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew W", "Last Name": "McPherson", "Affiliation": "Computational Oncology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Tavar\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr03"}, {"PMID": "38364229", "Title": "What is the effect of preoperative depression on outcomes after minimally invasive surgery for adult spinal deformity?

We previously developed a paired brain and spinal electrical stimulation approach in rats that relies on convergence of the descending motor and spinal sensory stimuli in the cervical cord. This approach strengthened sensorimotor circuits and improved volitional movement through associative plasticity. In humans it is not known whether dorsal epidural SCS targeted at the sensorimotor interface or anterior epidural SCS targeted within the motor system is effective at facilitating brain evoked responses. In 59 individuals undergoing elective cervical spine decompression surgery, the motor cortex was stimulated with scalp electrodes and the spinal cord with epidural electrodes while muscle responses were recorded in arm and leg muscles. Spinal electrodes were placed either posteriorly or anteriorly, and the interval between cortex and spinal cord stimulation was varied. Pairing stimulation between the motor cortex and spinal sensory (posterior) but not spinal motor (anterior) stimulation produced motor evoked potentials that were over five times larger than brain stimulation alone. This strong augmentation occurred only when descending motor and spinal afferent stimuli were timed to converge in the spinal cord. Paired stimulation also increased the selectivity of muscle responses relative to unpaired brain or spinal cord stimulation. Finally, paired stimulation effects were present regardless of the severity of myelopathy as measured by clinical signs or spinal cord imaging. The large effect size of this paired stimulation makes it a promising candidate for therapeutic neuromodulation.", "Keywords": ["Cervical", "Electrical stimulation", "Epidural", "Motor cortex", "Motor evoked potentials", "Myelopathy", "Spinal cord"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "McIntosh", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Neurology, Columbia University, 650 W. 168th St, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evan F", "Last Name": "Joiner", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, 650 W. 168th St, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacob L", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine - New York Presbyterian, Och Spine, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10065."}, {"First Name": "Phoebe", "Last Name": "Greenwald", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University, 650 W. 168th St, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynda M", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Department of Rehabilitation and Human Performance, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

As it is likely that thousands of genetic variants contribute to CRC risk, it is clinically important to investigate whether these genetic variants can be used jointly for CRC risk prediction. In this paper, we derived and compared different approaches to generating predictive polygenic risk scores (PRS) from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) including 55,105 CRC-affected case subjects and 65,079 control subjects of European ancestry. We built the PRS in three ways, using (1) 140 previously identified and validated CRC loci; (2) SNP selection based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping followed by machine-learning approaches; and (3) LDpred, a Bayesian approach for genome-wide risk prediction. We tested the PRS in an independent cohort of 101,987 individuals with 1,699 CRC-affected case subjects. The discriminatory accuracy, calculated by the age- and sex-adjusted area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), was highest for the LDpred-derived PRS (AUC = 0.654) including nearly 1.2\u00a0M genetic variants (the proportion of causal genetic variants for CRC assumed to be 0.003), whereas the PRS of the 140 known variants identified from GWASs had the lowest AUC (AUC = 0.629). Based on the LDpred-derived PRS, we are able to identify 30% of individuals without a family history as having risk for CRC similar to those with a family history of CRC, whereas the PRS based on known GWAS variants identified only top 10% as having a similar relative risk. About 90% of these individuals have no family history and would have been considered average risk under current screening guidelines, but might benefit from earlier screening. The developed PRS offers a way for risk-stratified CRC screening and other targeted interventions.", "Keywords": ["cancer risk prediction", "colorectal cancer", "machine learning", "polygenic risk score"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Asian People", "Bayes Theorem", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome, Human", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Minta", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lori C", "Last Name": "Sakoda", "Affiliation": "Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Hoffmeister", "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg 69120, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth A", "Last Name": "Rosenthal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine (Medical Genetics), University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey K", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Franzel J B", "Last Name": "van Duijnhoven", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Nutrition and Health, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen 176700, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Platz", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna H", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "University of Southern California, Preventative Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher H", "Last Name": "Dampier", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA 22903, USA."}, {"First Name": "Albert", "Last Name": "de la Chapelle", "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alicja", "Last Name": "Wolk", "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm 17177, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Amit D", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Identifying potentially modifiable risk factors for these cancers is essential for prevention. Here we estimated the relationship between adiposity and cancer across the biliary tract, including cancers of the gallbladder (GBC), intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDC), extrahepatic bile ducts (EHBDC), and the ampulla of Vater (AVC). We pooled data from 27 prospective cohorts with over 2.7 million adults. Adiposity was measured using baseline body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip, and waist-to-height ratios. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sex, education, race, smoking, and alcohol consumption with age as the time metric and the baseline hazard stratified by study. During 37,883,648 person-years of follow-up, 1,343 GBC cases, 1,194 EHBDC cases, 784 IHBDC cases, and 623 AVC cases occurred. For each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, there were risk increases for GBC (HR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.19-1.36), IHBDC (HR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.45), and EHBDC (HR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.23), but not AVC (HR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11). Increasing waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio were associated with GBC and IHBDC but not EHBDC or AVC. These results indicate that adult adiposity is associated with an increased risk of biliary tract cancer, particularly GBC and IHBDC. Moreover, they provide evidence for recommending weight maintenance programs to reduce the risk of developing these cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify a correlation between adiposity and biliary tract cancers, indicating that weight management programs may help minimize the risk of these diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anthropometry", "Biliary Tract Neoplasms", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah S", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland. sarah.jackson@nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "Alison L", "Last Name": "Van Dyke", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Ruth M", "Last Name": "Pfeiffer", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Jessica L", "Last Name": "Petrick", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Olov", "Last Name": "Adami", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Demetrius", "Last Name": "Albanes", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Gabriella", "Last Name": "Andreotti", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Laura E", "Last Name": "Beane Freeman", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Berrington de Gonz\u00e1lez", "Affiliation": "Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Julie E", "Last Name": "Buring", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

We also found that multiple cancers are genetically correlated with non-cancer traits including smoking, psychiatric diseases and metabolic characteristics.

We used inverse odds ratio weighting and logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for estimated total effects (ORTE ) of body mass index, waist circumference, and adult weight gain on CRC risk, and estimated effects operating through seven inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers (natural indirect effect; ORNIE ) or through paths independent of these biomarkers (natural direct effect; ORNDE ) among 209 CRC cases and 382 matched controls nested within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a prospective cohort of male health professionals. A one-interquartile range (IQR) increase in body mass index (3.6 kg/m2 ) was associated with an ORTE of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.73), which decomposed into an ORNIE of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.52) and an ORNDE of 1.11 (0.87, 1.42), with possibly stronger mediation by these biomarkers for adult weight gain (IQR = 10.4 kg; ORTE = 1.32 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.64]; ORNIE = 1.47 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.81]; ORNDE = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.72, 1.11]), but no mediation for waist circumference.

The objective of this study was to investigate the associations of FHC with risk of BTC in the Biliary Tract Cancers Pooling Project (BiTCaPP).Methods: We used Cox proportional hazards regressions models to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals for associations between FHC (any, first-degree, in female relative, in male relative, relative with gastrointestinal cancer, and relative with hormonally related cancer) and BTC risk by anatomic site within the biliary tract, adjusting for sex and race/ethnicity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted that restricted to studies reporting cholecystectomy data and to people without a history of cholecystectomy.Results: Data on FHC were available from 12 prospective studies within BiTCaPP, which collectively contributed 2,246 cases (729 gallbladder, 345 intrahepatic and 615 extrahepatic bile duct, and 385 ampulla of Vater cancers) with 21,706,107 person-years of follow-up. A marginal, inverse association between FHC and gallbladder cancer was driven to the null when analysis was restricted to studies reporting cholecystectomy data and to people without a history of cholecystectomy. FHC was not associated with risk of BTC at the other anatomic sites.Conclusions: These findings do not support an association between FHC and BTCs.Impact: In a study of 1.5 million people, FHC is not a risk factor for BTCs.

In addition, compared to those without periodontal disease, HRs for CRC were 0.91 (95% CI 0.74-1.12) for periodontal disease, and 1.22 (95% CI 0.91-1.63) when limited to moderate to severe periodontal disease. The results were not modified by smoking status, body mass index or alcohol consumption. Women with fewer teeth, possibly moderate or severe periodontal disease, might be at a modest increased risk of developing CRC, suggesting a potential role of oral health in colorectal carcinogenesis.", "Keywords": ["colorectal cancer", "microbiota", "oral health", "periodontal disease", "tooth loss"], "MeSH terms": ["Alcohol Drinking", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Epidemiologic Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Periodontal Diseases", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Tooth Loss"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fatemeh", "Last Name": "Momen-Heravi", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.

There it interacts with several essential molecules, including nephrin and neph1, which are required for slit diaphragm formation and as an intracellular signaling hub. Here, we show that diminished MAGI-1 expression in cultured podocytes reduced nephrin and neph1 membrane localization and weakened tight junction integrity. Global magi1 knock-out mice, however, demonstrated normal glomerular histology and function into adulthood. We hypothesized that a second mild but complementary genetic insult might induce glomerular disease susceptibility in these mice. To identify such a gene, we utilized the developing fly eye to test for functional complementation between MAGI and its binding partners. In this way, we identified diminished expression of fly Hibris (nephrin) or Roughest (neph1) as dramatically exacerbating the effects of MAGI depletion. Indeed, when these combinations were studied in mice, the addition of nephrin, but not neph1, heterozygosity to homozygous deletion of MAGI-1 resulted in spontaneous glomerulosclerosis. In cultured podocytes, MAGI-1 depletion reduced intercellular contact-induced Rap1 activation, a pathway critical for proper podocyte function. Similarly, magi1 knock-out mice showed diminished glomerular Rap1 activation, an effect dramatically enhanced by concomitant nephrin haploinsufficiency. Finally, combined overexpression of MAGI-1 and nephrin increased Rap1 activation, but not when substituting a mutant MAGI-1 that cannot bind nephrin. We conclude that the interaction between nephrin and MAGI-1 regulates Rap1 activation in podocytes to maintain long term slit diaphragm structure.", "Keywords": ["Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1)", "mouse genetics", "nephrology", "podocyte", "proteinuria"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Enzyme Activation", "Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental", "Guanylate Kinases", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Podocytes", "rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jie", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029,; the Division of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China 150001."}, {"First Name": "Sujin", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "the Saint James School of Medicine, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines."}, {"First Name": "Ruth I", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "the Biology Department, Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, 06459."}, {"First Name": "Bingbing", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029,; the Department of Nephrology, Laboratory of Renal Disease, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China 200062."}, {"First Name": "Jianhua", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Vadaparampil", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Christopher M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Kirk N", "Last Name": "Campbell", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Grahammer", "Affiliation": "the Department of Medicine IV, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tobias B", "Last Name": "Huber", "Affiliation": "the Department of Medicine IV, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany,; the BIOSS Center for Biological Signaling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany,; FRIAS, Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies and Center for Systems Biology (ZBSA), Albert-Ludwigs-University, 79104 Freiburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Vivette D", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "the Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "the School of Biomedical Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}, {"First Name": "Lewis", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029,.

Here, we describe the characterization of a multi-incident MS family that nominated a rare missense variant (p.G420D) in plasminogen (PLG) as a putative genetic risk factor for MS. Genotyping of PLG p.G420D (rs139071351) in 2160 MS patients, and 886 controls from Canada, identified 10 additional probands, two sporadic patients and one control with the variant. Segregation in families harboring the rs139071351 variant, identified p.G420D in 26 out of 30 family members diagnosed with MS, 14 unaffected parents, and 12 out of 30 family members not diagnosed with disease. Despite considerably reduced penetrance, linkage analysis supports cosegregation of PLG p.G420D and disease. Genotyping of PLG p.G420D in 14446 patients, and 8797 controls from Canada, France, Spain, Germany, Belgium, and Austria failed to identify significant association with disease (P\u00a0=\u00a00.117), despite an overall higher prevalence in patients (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.32; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.93-1.87). To assess whether additional rare variants have an effect on MS risk, we sequenced PLG in 293 probands, and genotyped all rare variants in cases and controls. This analysis identified nine rare missense variants, and although three of them were exclusively observed in MS patients, segregation does not support pathogenicity. PLG is a plausible biological candidate for MS owing to its involvement in immune system response, blood-brain barrier permeability, and myelin degradation. Moreover, components of its activation cascade have been shown to present increased activity or expression in MS patients compared to controls; further studies are needed to clarify whether PLG is involved in MS susceptibility.", "Keywords": ["association", "genetics", "linkage", "multiple sclerosis", "plasminogen"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Case-Control Studies",

Despite growing enthusiasm, the patterns and implications of this rapid adoption are largely unknown. National trends in DBS surgery performed for all indications between 2002 and 2011 are reported. METHODS Using a national database of hospital discharges, admissions for DBS for 14 indications were identified and categorized as either FDA approved, humanitarian device exempt (HDE), or emerging. Trends over time were examined, differences were analyzed by univariate analyses, and outcomes were analyzed by hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2011, there were an estimated 30,490 discharges following DBS for approved indications, 1647 for HDE indications, and 2014 for emerging indications. The volume for HDE and emerging indications grew at 36.1% annually in comparison with 7.0% for approved indications. DBS for emerging indications occurred at hospitals with more neurosurgeons and neurologists locally, but not necessarily at those with the highest DBS caseloads. Patients treated for HDE and emerging indications were younger with lower comorbidity scores. HDE and emerging indications were associated with greater rates of reported complications, longer lengths of stay, and greater total costs. CONCLUSIONS DBS for HDE and emerging indications underwent rapid growth in the last decade, and it is not exclusively the most experienced DBS practitioners leading the charge to treat the newest indications. Surgeons may be selecting younger and healthier patients for their early experiences. Differences in reported complication rates warrant further attention and additional costs should be anticipated as surgeons gain experience with new patient populations and targets.", "Keywords": ["ARF = Area Resource File", "DBS = deep brain stimulation", "ET = essential tremor", "HCUP = Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project", "HDE = humanitarian device exempt", "LOS = length of stay", "NIS = Nationwide Inpatient Sample", "Nationwide Inpatient Sample", "OCD = obsessive-compulsive disorder", "PD = Parkinson disease", "deep brain stimulation", "functional neurosurgery", "neuromodulation", "practice patterns", "technology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Time Factors", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brett E", "Last Name": "Youngerman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew K", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Charles B", "Last Name": "Mikell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}, {"First Name": "Sameer A", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York; and."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurosurgery", "PubDate": "2016Aug"}, {"PMID": "26416969", "Title": "Human substantia nigra neurons encode decision outcome and are modulated by categorization uncertainty in an auditory categorization task.", "Abstract": "The ability to categorize stimuli - predator or prey, friend or foe - is an essential feature of the decision-making process. Underlying that ability is the development of an internally generated category boundary to generate decision outcomes. While classic temporal difference reinforcement models assume midbrain dopaminergic neurons underlie the prediction error required to learn boundary location, these neurons also demonstrate a robust response to nonreward incentive stimuli. More recent models suggest that this may reflect a motivational aspect to performing a task which should be accounted for when modeling dopaminergic neuronal behavior. To clarify the role of substantia nigra dopamine neurons in uncertain perceptual decision making, we investigated their behavior using single neuron extracellular recordings in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing deep brain stimulation. Subjects underwent a simple auditory categorical decision-making task in which they had to classify a tone as either low- or high-pitched relative to an explicit threshold tone and received feedback but no reward. We demonstrate that the activity of human SN dopaminergic neurons is predictive of perceptual categorical decision outcome and is modulated by uncertainty. Neuronal activity was highest during difficult (uncertain) decisions that resulted in correct responses and lowest during easy decisions that resulted in incorrect responses. This pattern of results is more consistent with a \"motivational\" role with regards to perceptual categorization and suggests that dopamine neurons are most active when critical information - as represented by uncertainty - is available for learning decision boundaries.", "Keywords": ["Decision making", "dopamine", "perceptual categorization", "single neuron recording", "substantia nigra"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "McGovern", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York ram2140@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Andrew K", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles B", "Last Name": "Mikell", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "John P", "Last Name": "Sheehy", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Vincent P", "Last Name": "Ferrera", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Physiological reports", "PubDate": "2015Sep"}, {"PMID": "26391917", "Title": "NSAID Use and Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: The Liver Cancer Pooling Project.", "Abstract": "Chronic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), the two most common types of liver cancer. A number of prior experimental studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin and ibuprofen, may potentially protect against liver cancer. However, no observational study has examined the association between aspirin duration and dose or other over-the-counter non-aspirin NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, and liver cancer incidence. Furthermore, the association between NSAID use and risk of ICC is unclear. As part of the Liver Cancer Pooling Project, we harmonized data on 1,084,133 individuals (HCC = 679, ICC = 225) from 10 U.S.-based prospective cohort studies. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Current aspirin use, versus nonuse, was inversely associated with HCC (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.81), which persisted when restricted to individuals not using non-aspirin NSAIDs and in a 5- and 10-year lag analysis. The association between aspirin use and HCC risk was stronger for users who reported daily use, longer duration use, and lower dosage. Ibuprofen use was not associated with HCC risk. Aspirin use was associated with a reduced ICC risk in men (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.98) but not women (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.89-2.01; P(interaction) = 0.01).

We used single neuron extracellular recordings in awake human subjects undergoing surgery for Parkinson disease to characterize the features and timing of this response in the substantia nigra. We recorded 49 neurons in the substantia nigra. Using an auditory oddball task, we showed that they fired more rapidly following novel sounds than repetitive tones. The response was biphasic with peaks at approximately 250 ms, comparable to that described in primate studies, and a second peak at 500 ms. This response was primarily driven by slower firing neurons as firing rate was inversely correlated to novelty response.
