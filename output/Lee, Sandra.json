[{"PMID": "38925878", "Title": "Understanding individualised genetic interventions as research-treatment hybrids.", "Abstract": "Until recently, medicine has had little to offer most of the millions of patients suffering from rare and ultrarare genetic conditions. But the development in 2019 of Milasen, the first genetic intervention developed for and administered to a single patient suffering from an ultrarare genetic disorder, has offered hope to patients and families. In addition, Milasen raised a series of conceptual and ethical questions about how individualised genetic interventions should be developed, assessed for safety and efficacy and financially supported. The answers to these questions depend in large part on whether individualised therapies are understood as human subjects research or clinical innovation, different domains of biomedicine that are regulated by different modes of oversight, funding and professional norms. In this article, with development and administration of the drug Milasen as our case study, we argue that at least some individualised genetic therapies are not, as some have argued, either research or treatment. Instead, they are research-treatment hybrids, a category that has both epistemological and pragmatic repercussions for funding, ethics oversight and regulation.", "Keywords": ["Child", "Ethics- Medical", "Ethics- Research", "Genetic Therapy"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Josephine", "Last Name": "Johnston", "Affiliation": "Hastings Center, Garrison, New York, USA johnstonj@thehastingscenter.org."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "Tabb", "Affiliation": "Department of Philosophy, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Pacia", "Affiliation": "Hastings Center, Garrison, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra Soo-Jin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wendy K", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul S", "Last Name": "Appelbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of medical ethics", "PubDate": "2024Jun26"}, {"PMID": "38805390", "Title": "Understanding the Gap: A Cross-Sectional Survey of ELSI Scholars' Dissemination Practices and Translation Goals.", "Abstract": "Researchers engaged in the study of the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genetics and genomics are often publicly funded and intend their work to be in the public interest.

Team members identified challenges and opportunities that were used to create guidelines and administrative tools to support manuscript development. The guidelines were organized by the three values of equity, inclusion, and efficiency and included eight principles. A visual dashboard was created to allow all team members to see who was leading or involved in each paper. Additional tools to promote equity, inclusion, and efficiency included providing standardized project management for each manuscript and making \"concept sheets\" for each manuscript accessible to all team members.

Our goal was to understand how parents, institutional review board members, and clinical geneticists familiar with individualized genetic interventions conceptualize these activities and their implications for the relationship between research and clinical care.", "Keywords": ["Ethics", "Gene therapy", "Pediatrics", "Rare genetic disease", "Regulatory governance"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Parents", "Rare Diseases", "Motivation", "Genetic Engineering", "Qualitative Research"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sandra Soo-Jin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Ethics, Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics, Columbia University, New York, NY.

Inadequate inclusion as articulated by scientists, policymakers, and ethicists has prompted large-scale initiatives aimed at recruiting populations historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Despite explicit calls to increase diversity, the meaning of diversity - which dimensions matter for what outcomes and why - remain strikingly imprecise. Drawing on our document review and qualitative data from observations and interviews of funders and research teams involved in five precision medicine research (PMR) projects, we note that calls for increasing diversity often focus on \"representation\" as the goal of recruitment. The language of representation is used flexibly to refer to two objectives: achieving sufficient genetic variation across populations and including historically disenfranchised groups in research. We argue that these dual understandings of representation are more than rhetorical slippage, but rather allow for the contemporary collection of samples and data from marginalized populations to stand in as correcting historical exclusion of social groups towards addressing health inequity. We trace the unresolved historical debates over how and to what extent researchers should procure diversity in PMR and how they contributed to ongoing uncertainty about what axes of diversity matter and why. We argue that ambiguity in the meaning of representation at the outset of a study contributes to a lack of clear conceptualization of diversity downstream throughout subsequent phases of the study.", "Keywords": ["bioethics", "diversity", "precision medicine research"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Precision Medicine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sandra Soo-Jin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Ethics, Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie M", "Last Name": "Fullerton", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioethics & Humanities, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin E", "Last Name": "McMahon", "Affiliation": "Division of Ethics, Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Bentz", "Affiliation": "Division of Ethics, Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aliya", "Last Name": "Saperstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Sociology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Jeske", "Affiliation": "Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Vasquez", "Affiliation": "Department of Sociology, University of Illinois-Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Foti", "Affiliation": "Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Larissa", "Last Name": "Saco", "Affiliation": "Department of Sociology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Janet K", "Last Name": "Shim", "Affiliation": "Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}], "Journal": "The Yale journal of biology and medicine", "PubDate": "2022Sep"}, {"PMID": "35935917", "Title": "Three decades of ethical, legal, and social implications research: Looking back to chart a path forward.", "Abstract": "More than thirty years ago in the United States, the National Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its partner in the Human Genome Project (HGP), the Department of Energy (DOE), called for proposals from social scientists, ethicists, lawyers, and others to explore the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of mapping and sequencing the human genome.

In this paper, we examine how practices of recruitment have unfolded in the wake of these diversity mandates. We find that a very common approach to seeking diverse participants leverages understandings of spatial, geographic, and site diversity as proxies and access points for participant diversity. That is, PMR investigators recruit from a diverse sampling of geographic areas, neighborhoods, sites, and institutional settings as both opportunistic but also meaningful ways to \"bake in\" participant diversity. In this way, logics of geographic and institutional diversity shift the question from who to recruit, to where. However, despite seeing geographic and site diversity as social and scientific 'goods' in the abstract and as key to getting diverse participants, PMR teams told us that working with diverse sites was often difficult in practice due to constraints in funding, time, and personnel, and inadequate research infrastructures and capacity. Thus, the ways in which these geographic and institutional diversity strategies were implemented resulted ultimately in limiting the meaningful inclusion of populations and organizations that had not previously participated in biomedical research and reproduced the inclusion of institutions that are already represented. These prevailing assumptions about and practices of \"baked-in\" diversity in fact exacerbate and produce other forms of inequity, in research capacity and research representation. These findings underscore how structural inequities in research resources must be addressed for diversity to be achieved in both research sites and research participants.", "Keywords": ["Biomedical research", "Diversity", "Inclusion", "Precision medicine", "Research participation"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Research Personnel", "Residence Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janet K", "Last Name": "Shim", "Affiliation": "Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, USA.

However, in ovarian carcinomas there are contradictory reports on its relationship to outcome, immune response, and correlation with clinicopathological features. We assembled a series of 1623 endometriosis-associated ovarian carcinomas, including 1078 endometrioid (ENOC) and 545 clear cell (CCOC) ovarian carcinomas, through combining resources of the Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis (OTTA) Consortium, the Canadian Ovarian Unified Experimental Resource (COEUR), local, and collaborative networks. Validated immunohistochemical surrogate assays for ARID1A mutations were applied to all samples. We investigated associations between ARID1A loss/mutation, clinical features, outcome, CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+ TILs), and DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd). ARID1A loss was observed in 42% of CCOCs and 25% of ENOCs. We found no associations between ARID1A loss and outcomes, stage, age, or CD8+ TIL status in CCOC. Similarly, we found no association with outcome or stage in endometrioid cases. In ENOC, ARID1A loss was more prevalent in younger patients (p\u2009=\u20090.012) and was associated with MMRd (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the presence of CD8+ TILs (p\u2009=\u20090.008). Consistent with MMRd being causative of ARID1A mutations, in a subset of ENOCs we also observed an association with ARID1A loss-of-function mutation as a result of small indels (p\u2009=\u20090.035, versus single nucleotide variants). In ENOC, the association with ARID1A loss, CD8+ TILs, and age appears confounded by MMRd status. Although this observation does not explicitly rule out a role for ARID1A influence on CD8+ TIL infiltration in ENOC, given current knowledge regarding MMRd, it seems more likely that effects are dominated by the hypermutation phenotype. This large dataset with consistently applied biomarker assessment now provides a benchmark for the prevalence of ARID1A loss-of-function mutations in endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers and brings clarity to the prognostic significance. \u00a9 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.", "Keywords": ["ARID1A", "CD8", "DNA mismatch repair", "clear cell ovarian carcinoma", "endometrioid ovarian carcinoma", "endometriosis-associated ovarian carcinoma", "immunohistochemistry", "prognosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Brain Neoplasms", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Canada", "Carcinoma", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Endometriosis", "Female", "Humans", "Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary", "Nuclear Proteins", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karolin", "Last Name": "Heinze", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Tayyebeh M", "Last Name": "Nazeran", "Affiliation": "University of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, and BC Cancer.

It also emphasizes evidence gaps and suggests approaches that may minimize negative consequences and promote health equality.", "Keywords": ["bioethics", "pharmacogenomics", "pharmacotherapy", "therapeutics"], "MeSH terms": ["Health Promotion", "Humans", "Pharmacogenetics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emma F", "Last Name": "Magavern", "Affiliation": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Deepti", "Last Name": "Gurdasani", "Affiliation": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Fu L", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, St Georges University of London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sandra Soo-Jin", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Ethics, Department Medical Humanities and Ethics, Columbia University, New York, N.Y., USA."}], "Journal": "British journal of clinical pharmacology", "PubDate": "2022Jan"}, {"PMID": "33984519", "Title": "Cancer Health Assessments Reaching Many (CHARM): A clinical trial assessing a multimodal cancer genetics services delivery program and its impact on diverse populations.", "Abstract": "Advances in the application of genomic technologies in clinical care have the potential to increase existing healthcare disparities. Studies have consistently shown that only a fraction of eligible patients with a family history of cancer receive recommended cancer genetic counseling and subsequent genetic testing. Care delivery models using pre-test and post-test counseling are not scalable, which contributes to barriers in accessing genetics services. These barriers are even more pronounced for patients in historically underserved populations. We have designed a multimodal intervention to improve subsequent cancer surveillance, by improving the identification of patients at risk for familial cancer syndromes, reducing barriers to genetic counseling/testing, and increasing patient understanding of complex genetic results. We are evaluating this intervention in two large, integrated healthcare systems that serve diverse patient populations (NCT03426878). The primary outcome is the number of diagnostic (hereditary cancer syndrome) findings. We are examining the clinical and personal utility of streamlined pathways to genetic testing using electronic medical record data, surveys, and qualitative interviews. We will assess downstream care utilization of individuals receiving usual clinical care vs. genetic testing through the study. We will evaluate the impacts of a literacy-focused genetic counseling approach versus usual care genetic counseling on care utilization and participant understanding, satisfaction, and family communication. By recruiting participants belonging to historically underserved populations, this study is uniquely positioned to evaluate the potential of a novel genetics care delivery program to reduce care disparities.", "Keywords": ["Family history", "Genetic counseling", "Genetics", "Hereditary cancer", "Underserved populations"], "MeSH terms": ["Genetic Counseling", "Genetic Testing", "Genomics", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kathleen F", "Last Name": "Mittendorf", "Affiliation": "Department of Translational and Applied Genomics, Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, 3800 N.

Consent forms often include complex language and concepts, which can be a barrier to diverse enrollment, and these studies often blur traditional research-clinical boundaries. There is a move toward self-directed, web-based research enrollment, but more evidence is needed about how these enrollment approaches work in practice. In this study, we developed and evaluated a literacy-focused, web-based consent approach to support enrollment of diverse participants in an ongoing clinical genomic implementation study. Methods: As part of the Cancer Health Assessments Reaching Many (CHARM) study, we developed a web-based consent approach that featured plain language, multimedia, and separate descriptions of clinical care and research activities. CHARM offered clinical exome sequencing to individuals at high risk of hereditary cancer. We interviewed CHARM participants about their reactions to the consent approach. We audio recorded, transcribed, and coded interviews using a deductively and inductively derived codebook. We reviewed coded excerpts as a team to identify overarching themes. Results: We conducted 32 interviews, including 12 (38%) in Spanish. Most (69%) enrolled without assistance from study staff, usually on a mobile phone. Those who completed enrollment in one day spent an average of 12\u2009minutes on the consent portion. Interviewees found the information simple to read but comprehensive, were neutral to positive about the multimedia support, and identified increased access to testing in the study as the key difference from clinical care. Conclusions: This study showed that interviewees found our literacy-focused, web-based consent approach acceptable; did not distinguish the consent materials from other online study processes; and valued getting access to testing in the study. Overall, conducting empirical bioethics research in an ongoing clinical trial was useful to demonstrate the acceptability of our novel consent approach but posed practical challenges.", "Keywords":

This study sought to identify additional clinicopathologic characteristics correlated with worse patient outcomes. Retrospective chart review of stage IIC and IIIA melanoma patients were evaluated between 1995 and 2011 with clinical follow-up through 2015. Records were reviewed for demographics, clinical characteristics, and tumor pathology. Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test were used to assess group differences. Clinicopathologic features were evaluated relative to overall survival (OS), time to distant metastases, and local/regional recurrence. Overall, 128 patients were included (45 stage IIC and 83 stage IIIA) with a median follow-up time of 5.7 years. Compared with stage IIIA patients, stage IIC patients were older, and their melanomas were more likely to be nodular, amelanotic, thicker, have higher mitotic rate, tumor lymphocytic infiltrate, no radial growth phase, and less likely to have associated precursor lesions. Stage IIC patients had shorter OS and time to distant metastases; multivariate regression revealed that older age (>55 years) and mitotic rate (>5 mitoses/mm) were independent predictors of OS. Melanomas in stage IIC disease may be biologically distinct from those that are seen in stage IIIA. While sentinel node biopsies remain the standard-of-care, these results suggest that clinicians may want to assess the clinicopathologic characteristics described above to aggressively counsel, screen for distant disease, and consider adjuvant therapy, in particular for older patients and higher mitotic rates in thicker primary tumors, regardless of nodal status.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Melanoma", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasm Staging", "Retrospective Studies", "Skin Neoplasms", "Survival Rate", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sally Y", "Last Name": "Tan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Najita", "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Harvard School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoxue", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Harvard School of Public Health."}, {"First Name": "Lauren C", "Last Name": "Strazzulla", "Affiliation": "Ronald O.

We aimed to validate the previously described IHC algorithm (Calculator of Ovarian carcinoma Subtype/histotype Probability version 3, COSPv3) in an independent population-based cohort, and to identify problem areas for IHC predictions. Histotype was abstracted from cancer registries for eligible ovarian carcinoma cases diagnosed from 2002 to 2011 in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. Slides were reviewed according to World Health Organization 2014 criteria, tissue microarrays were stained with and scored for the 8 COSPv3 IHC markers, and COSPv3 histotype predictions were calculated. Discordant cases for review and COSPv3 prediction were arbitrated by integrating morphology with IHC results. The integrated histotype (N=880) was then used to identify areas of inferior COSPv3 performance. Review histotype and integrated histotype demonstrated 93% agreement suggesting that IHC information revises expert review in up to 7% of cases. There was also 93% agreement between COSPv3 prediction and integrated histotype. COSPv3 errors predominated in 4 areas: endometrioid carcinoma (EC) versus clear cell (N=23), EC versus low-grade serous (N=15), EC versus high-grade serous (N=11), and high-grade versus low-grade serous (N=6). Most problems were related to Napsin A-negative clear cell, WT1-positive EC, and p53 IHC wild-type high-grade serous carcinomas. Although 93% of COSPv3 prediction accuracy was validated, some histotyping required integration of morphology with ancillary test results.

Diagnostic typing criteria have evolved over time, and past cohorts may be misclassified by current standards. Our objective was to reclassify the recently assembled Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource and the Alberta Ovarian Tumor Type cohorts using immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers and to develop an IHC algorithm for ovarian carcinoma histotyping. A total of 1626 ovarian carcinoma samples from the Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource and the Alberta Ovarian Tumor Type were subjected to a reclassification by comparing the original with the predicted histotype. Histotype prediction was derived from a nominal logistic regression modeling using a previously reclassified cohort (N=784) with the binary input of 8 IHC markers. Cases with discordant original or predicted histotypes were subjected to arbitration. After reclassification, 1762 cases from all cohorts were subjected to prediction models (\u03c7 Automatic Interaction Detection, recursive partitioning, and nominal logistic regression) with a variable IHC marker input. The histologic type was confirmed in 1521/1626 (93.5%) cases of the Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource and the Alberta Ovarian Tumor Type cohorts. The highest misclassification occurred in the endometrioid type, where most of the changes involved reclassification from endometrioid to high-grade serous carcinoma, which was additionally supported by mutational data and outcome. Using the reclassified histotype as the endpoint, a 4-marker prediction model correctly classified 88%, a 6-marker 91%, and an 8-marker 93% of the 1762 cases.

Canadian Immunohistochemistry Quality Control Run 42 assessed WT1, Napsin A, and p53; commonly used markers for histotyping ovarian carcinomas. A 42-core tissue microarray, which included the 5 major histotypes of ovarian carcinomas with a subset having known TP53 mutational status, was used for this Canadian Immunohistochemistry Quality Control challenge. Participants included 43 laboratories for p53, 29 for WT1, and 26 for Napsin A. p53 was scored as aberrant if the staining was strong and diffuse or absent. Napsin A and WT1 were scored positive if any tumor cells stained. The reference p53 expression pattern was inferred by TP53 mutation type when available. For WT1, Napsin A, and cases lacking mutational data, the reference staining pattern was based on the majority staining result. The error rate for p53 was 8.8%. Most errors (84%) were due to weak staining. The sensitivity and specificity of aberrant p53 expression for an underlying TP53 mutation was 91.6% and 87.9%, respectively. The error rate for WT1 was 0.76% with all errors occurring in laboratories using the 6F-h2 clone. The average errors for laboratories using 6F-h2 were 2.4 compared with 0 for WT-49. The error rate for Napsin A was 4%. The average errors for laboratories using polyclonal Napsin A were 3 compared with 1.1 for monoclonal Napsin A. Weak p53 staining increases interpretative errors, primarily due to absence of staining in tumors with wild-type TP53. p53 immunohistochemistry correlates strongly with TP53 mutational status.

These so-called \"cheaters\" can have a fitness advantage in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether cheating provides an important selective advantage in nature. We used a population genomic approach to examine the history of genes involved in cheating behaviors in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, testing whether these genes experience rapid evolutionary change as a result of conflict over spore-stalk fate. Candidate genes and surrounding regions showed elevated polymorphism, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and lower levels of population differentiation, but they did not show greater between-species divergence. The signatures were most consistent with frequency-dependent selection acting to maintain multiple alleles, suggesting that conflict may lead to stalemate rather than an escalating arms race. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and cheating and underscore how sequence-based approaches can be used to elucidate the history of conflicts that are difficult to observe directly.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Dictyostelium", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genome, Protozoan", "Genomics", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Selection, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Ostrowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204, USA.

Many are economically important, and others have improved our understanding of ecology and adaptive radiation [2]. However, the mechanisms that these arthropods use to induce plant galls are poorly understood. We sequenced the genome of the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor; Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), a plant parasitic gall midge and a pest of wheat (Triticum spp.), with the aim of identifying genic modifications that contribute to its plant-parasitic lifestyle. Among several adaptive modifications, we discovered an expansive reservoir of potential effector proteins. Nearly 5% of the 20,163 predicted gene models matched putative effector gene transcripts present in the M. destructor larval salivary gland. Another 466 putative effectors were discovered among the genes that have no sequence similarities in other organisms. The largest known arthropod gene family (family SSGP-71) was also discovered within the effector reservoir. SSGP-71 proteins lack sequence homologies to other proteins, but their structures resemble both ubiquitin E3 ligases in plants and E3-ligase-mimicking effectors in plant pathogenic bacteria. SSGP-71 proteins and wheat Skp proteins interact in vivo. Mutations in different SSGP-71 genes avoid the effector-triggered immunity that is directed by the wheat resistance genes H6 and H9. Results point to effectors as the agents responsible for arthropod-induced plant gall formation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Biological", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Base
