However, the underlying protumorigenic pathways are yet to be defined. Additional work is needed to develop physiologically relevant in vitro 3D culture models that better recapitulate the human tumor microenvironment and can be used to dissect the contributions of matrix stiffness to EAC pathogenesis. Here, we describe a modular, tumor ECM-mimetic hydrogel platform with tunable mechanical properties, defined presentation of cell-adhesive ligands, and protease-dependent degradation that supports robust in vitro growth and expansion of patient-derived EAC 3D organoids (EAC PDOs). Hydrogel mechanical properties control EAC PDO formation, growth, proliferation, and activation of tumor-associated pathways that elicit stem-like properties in the cancer cells, as highlighted through in vitro and in vivo environments. We also demonstrate that the engineered hydrogel serves as a platform for identifying potential therapeutic targets to disrupt the contribution of protumorigenic matrix mechanics in EAC. Together, these studies show that an engineered PDO culture platform can be used to elucidate underlying matrix-mediated mechanisms of EAC and inform the development of therapeutics that target ECM stiffness in EAC.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Cell Biology", "Drug therapy", "Extracellular matrix", "Oncology"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Hydrogels", "Extracellular Matrix", "Adenocarcinoma", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ricardo", "Last Name": "Cruz-Acu\u00f1a", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Secunda W", "Last Name": "Kariuki", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kensuke", "Last Name": "Sugiura", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Spyros", "Last Name": "Karaiskos", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eleanor M", "Last Name": "Plaster", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering and."}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Loebel", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gizem", "Last Name": "Efe", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Karakasheva", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel T", "Last Name": "Gabre", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianhua", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason A", "Last Name": "Burdick", "Affiliation": "BioFrontiers Institute and Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2023Dec01"}, {"PMID": "37356631", "Title": "Long-term outcomes following successful endoscopic treatment of T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma: a multicenter cohort study.", "Abstract": "Endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) is guideline endorsed for management of early-stage (T1) esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

Despite recent progress in defining the molecular changes accompanying ESCC initiation and development, patient prognosis remains poor. The functional annotation of these molecular changes is the necessary next step and requires models that both capture the molecular features of ESCC and can be readily and inexpensively manipulated for functional annotation. Mice treated with the tobacco smoke mimetic 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) predictably form ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia. Of note, 4NQO lesions also arise in the oral cavity, most commonly in the tongue, as well as the forestomach, which all share the stratified squamous epithelium. However, these mice cannot be simply manipulated for functional hypothesis testing, as generating isogenic mouse models is time- and resource-intensive. Herein, we overcome this limitation by generating single cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) organoids from mice treated with 4NQO to characterize murine ESCC or preneoplastic cells ex vivo. These organoids capture the salient features of ESCC and esophageal preneoplasia, can be cheaply and quickly leveraged to form isogenic models, and can be utilized for syngeneic transplantation experiments. We demonstrate how to generate 3D organoids from normal, preneoplastic, and SCC murine esophageal tissue and maintain and cryopreserve these organoids. The applications of these versatile organoids are broad and include the utilization of genetically engineered mice and further characterization by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry, the generation of isogeneic organoid lines using CRISPR technologies, and drug screening or syngeneic transplantation. We believe that the widespread adoption of the techniques demonstrated in this protocol will accelerate progress in this field to combat the severe burden of ESCC.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck", "Mouth Neoplasms", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Organoids", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Flashner", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Cecilia", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University;

coordinated inflammatory processes. T cells regulate inflammation in vivo and modulate vascular remodeling in other settings, but their role in venous thrombus resolution remains undefined. To determine the role of T cells in venous thrombus resolution in vivo, stasis induced thrombi were created by vena cava ligation in outbred CD-1 mice. CD4 and CD8 positive T cells, as determined by flow cytometry, were present in thrombi both during thrombus formation and resolution. Depletion of the CD4 and CD8 positive T cells by antibody treatment selectively impaired thrombus resolution compared to animals treated with isotype control antibodies, without an effect on venous thrombus formation. Quantitation of intra-thrombus macrophage numbers, fibrinolytic marker expression, and gelatinolytic activity by zymography revealed that T cell depletion decreased the number of macrophages, reduced the expression of fibrinolytic marker urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and decreased the activity of matrix metalloprotinease-9 (MMP-9). These data implicate CD4 and CD8 positive T cells in functionally contributing to venous thrombus resolution, thus representing a potential therapeutic target, but also underscoring potential risks involved in T cell depletion used clinically for solid organ and hematopoietic transplantation procedures.", "Keywords": ["CD4", "CD8", "T cells", "macrophage", "matrix metalloproteinase", "peripheral vascular disease", "thrombus resolution"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Count", "Fibrinolysis", "Gelatin", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Macrophages", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9", "Mice", "Venous Thrombosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Subhradip", "Last Name": "Mukhopadhyay", "Affiliation": "Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Gabre", "Affiliation": "Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Chabasse", "Affiliation": "Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan S", "Last Name": "Bromberg", "Affiliation": "Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Toni M", "Last Name": "Antalis", "Affiliation": "Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajabrata", "Last Name": "Sarkar", "Affiliation": "Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."}], "Journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "PubDate": "2020Feb28"}, {"PMID": "28497484", "Title": "CD44 variant isoform 9 emerges in response to injury and contributes to the regeneration of the gastric epithelium.", "Abstract": "The CD44 gene encodes several protein isoforms due to alternative splicing and post translational modifications. Given that CD44 variant isoform 9 (CD44v9) is expressed within Spasmolytic Polypeptide/TFF2-Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) glands during repair, CD44v9 may be play a funcitonal role during the process of regeneration of the gastric epithelium. Here we hypothesize that CD44v9 marks a regenerative cell lineage responsive to infiltrating macrophages during regeneration of the gastric epithelium. Ulcers were induced in CD44-deficient (CD44KO) and C57BL/6 (BL6) mice by a localized application of acetic acid to the serosal surface of the stomach. Gastric organoids expressing CD44v9 were derived from mouse stomachs and transplanted at the ulcer site of CD44KO mice. Ulcers, CD44v9 expression, proliferation and histology were measured 1, 3, 5 and 7-days post-injury. Human-derived gastric organoids were generated from stomach tissue collected from elderly (>55 years) or young (14-20 years) patients. Organoids were transplanted into the stomachs of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice at the site of injury. Gastric injury was induced in NRG-SGM3 (NRGS) mice harboring human-derived immune cells (hnNRGS) and the immune profile anlayzed by CyTOF. CD44v9 expression emerged within regenerating glands the ulcer margin in response to injury. While ulcers in BL6 mice healed within 7-days post-injury, CD44KO mice exhibited loss of repair and epithelial regeneration. Ulcer healing was promoted in CD44KO mice by transplanted CD55v9-expressing gastric organoids. NSG mice exhibited loss of CD44v9 expression and gastric repair. Transplantation of human-derived gastric organoids from young, but not aged stomachs promoted repair in NSG mouse stomachs in response to injury. Finally, compared to NRGS mice, huNRGS animals exhibited reduced ulcer sizes, an infiltration of human CD162+ macrophages and an emergence of CD44v9 expression in SPEM. Thus, during repair of the gastic epithelium CD44v9 emerges within a regenerative cell lineage that coincides with macrophage inflitration within the injured mucosa.
