In the hominid isocortex, CD44+ astrocytes comprise the subpial \"interlaminar\" astrocytes, sending long processes into the cortex. The hippocampus also contains similar astrocytes. We have examined all levels of the human central nervous system and found CD44+ astrocytes in every region. Astrocytes in white matter and astrocytes that interact with large blood vessels but not with capillaries in gray matter are CD44+, the latter extending long processes into the parenchyma. Motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, such as oculomotor, facial, hypoglossal, and in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, are surrounded by CD44+ processes, contrasting with neurons in the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. We found CD44+ processes that intercalate between ependymal cells to reach the ventricle. We also found CD44+ astrocytes in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Protoplasmic astrocytes, which do not normally contain CD44, acquire it in pathologies like hypoxia and seizures. The pervasive and inducible expression of CD44 in astrocytes is a novel finding that lays the foundations for functional studies into the significance of CD44 in health and disease.", "Keywords": ["CD44", "astrocytes", "hypoxia", "interlaminar astrocytes", "seizures"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Astrocytes", "Hyaluronan Receptors", "Hypoxia", "Neocortex", "Seizures", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Osama", "Last Name": "Al-Dalahmah", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Sosunov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Albany Medical Center, Albany, NY 12208, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nacoya", "Last Name": "Madden", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carol M", "Last Name": "Troy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guy M", "Last Name": "McKhann", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "James E", "Last Name": "Goldman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Cells", "PubDate": "2024Jan10"}, {"PMID": "37449272", "Title": "Caspase-9 inhibition confers stronger neuronal and vascular protection compared to VEGF neutralization in a mouse model of retinal vein occlusion.", "Abstract": "Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a sight-threatening condition typically treated with intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists.

inhibition with new irreversible small peptidomimetics.", "Abstract": "Caspase-2 (Casp2) is a promising therapeutic target in several human diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the design of an active-site-directed inhibitor selective to individual caspase family members is challenging because caspases have extremely similar active sites. Here we present new peptidomimetics derived from the VDVAD pentapeptide structure, harboring non-natural modifications at the P2 position and an irreversible warhead. Enzyme kinetics show that these new compounds, such as LJ2 or its specific isomers LJ2a, and LJ3a, strongly and irreversibly inhibit Casp2 with genuine selectivity. In agreement with the established role of Casp2 in cellular stress responses, LJ2 inhibits cell death induced by microtubule destabilization or hydroxamic acid-based deacetylase inhibition. The most potent peptidomimetic, LJ2a, inhibits human Casp2 with a remarkably high inactivation rate (k3/Ki ~5,500,000\u2009M-1\u2009s-1), and the most selective inhibitor, LJ3a, has close to a 1000 times higher inactivation rate on Casp2 as compared to Casp3. Structural analysis of LJ3a shows that the spatial configuration of C\u03b1 at the P2 position determines inhibitor efficacy. In transfected human cell lines overexpressing site-1 protease (S1P), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and Casp2, LJ2a and LJ3a fully inhibit Casp2-mediated S1P cleavage and thus SREBP2 activation, suggesting a potential to prevent NASH development. Furthermore, in primary hippocampal neurons treated with \u03b2-amyloid oligomers, submicromolar concentrations of LJ2a and of LJ3a prevent synapse loss, indicating a potential for further investigations in AD treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Caspase 2", "Caspase 3", "Neurons", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Peptidomimetics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elodie", "Last Name": "Bosc", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Anastasie", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Feryel", "Last Name": "Soualmia", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Pascale", "Last Name": "Coric", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, CNRS, CiTCoM, F-75006, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Ju Youn", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lily Q", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gullen", "Last Name": "Lacin", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Kaitao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronak", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Duplus", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Tixador", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bernard", "Last Name": "Brugg", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Reboud-Ravaux", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Carol M", "Last Name": "Troy", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Bouaziz", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, CNRS, CiTCoM, F-75006, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Karin", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chahrazade", "Last Name": "El Amri", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Etienne D", "Last Name": "Jacotot", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France. etienne.jacotot@inserm.fr."}], "Journal": "Cell death & disease", "PubDate": "2022Nov15"}, {"PMID": "36351424", "Title": "CyclinD2-mediated regulation of neurogenic output from the retinal ciliary margin is perturbed in albinism.", "Abstract": "In albinism, aberrations in the ipsi-/contralateral retinal ganglion cell (RGC) ratio compromise the functional integrity of the binocular circuit.

We found that the mouse ventral CMZ generates predominantly ipsilaterally projecting RGCs, but this output is altered in the albino visual system because of CyclinD2 downregulation and disturbed timing of the cell cycle. Consequently, albino as well as CyclinD2-deficient pigmented mice exhibit diminished ipsilateral retinogeniculate projection and poor depth perception. In albino mice, pharmacological stimulation of calcium channels, known to upregulate CyclinD2 in other cell types, augmented CyclinD2-dependent neurogenesis of ipsilateral RGCs and improved stereopsis.

Neurovascular injuries damage homeostatic communication between endothelial, pericyte, glial, and neuronal cells through signaling pathways that remain to be established. To understand the mechanisms that contribute to neuronal death, we use a mouse model of retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Using this model, we previously discovered that after vascular damage, there was non-apoptotic activation of endothelial caspase-9 (EC Casp9); knock-out of EC Casp9 led to a decrease in retinal edema, capillary ischemia, and neuronal death. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of EC Casp9 in vision loss and inflammation. We found that EC Casp9 is implicated in contrast sensitivity decline, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and glial reactivity. One of the noted glial changes was increased levels of astroglial cl-caspase-6, which we found to be activated cell intrinsically by astroglial caspase-9 (Astro Casp9). Lastly, we discovered that Astro Casp9 contributes to capillary ischemia and contrast sensitivity decline after RVO (P-RVO).

Since the identification of the family of cell death proteases, there has been a search for tools to identify and expand the function of specific family members in development, health, and disease states. However, many of the currently commercially available caspase tools that are widely used are not specific for the targeted caspase. In this report, we delineate the approach we have used to identify, validate, and target caspase-9 in the nervous system using a novel inhibitor and genetic approaches with immunohistochemical read-outs.

Recent work has demonstrated that caspase-9 can drive neurovascular injury through nonapoptotic endothelial cell dysfunction. CASP9 polymorphisms have been linked with various cancers, neurological disorders, autoimmune pathologies and lumbar disc disease. Clinical reports suggest alterations in caspase-9 expression, activity or function may be associated with acute and chronic neurodegeneration, retinal neuropathy, slow-channel myasthenic syndrome, lumbar disc disease, cardiomyopathies, atherosclerosis and autoimmune disease. Healthy tissues maintain caspase-9 activity at low basal levels, rendering supraphysiological caspase-9 activation a tractable target for therapeutic interventions. Strategies for selective inhibition of caspase-9 include dominant negative caspase-9 mutants and pharmacological inhibitors derived from the XIAP protein, whose Bir3 domain is an endogenous highly selective caspase-9 inhibitor. However, the mechanistic implications of caspase-9 expression and activation remain indeterminate in many pathologies.

The p75NTR is widely expressed in the developing brain and is downregulated as the nervous system matures, with only a few neuronal subpopulations retaining expression into adulthood. However, p75NTR expression is induced following damage to the adult brain, including after traumatic brain injury, which is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. A major consequence of traumatic brain injury is the progressive neuronal loss that continues secondary to the initial trauma, which ultimately contributes to cognitive decline. Understanding mechanisms governing this progressive neuronal death is key to developing targeted therapeutic strategies to provide neuroprotection and salvage cognitive function. In this study, we demonstrate that a cortical impact injury to the sensorimotor cortex elicits p75NTR expression in apoptotic neurons in the injury penumbra, confirming previous studies. To establish whether preventing p75NTR induction or blocking the ligands would reduce the extent of secondary neuronal cell death, we used a noninvasive intranasal strategy to deliver either siRNA to block the induction of p75NTR, or function-blocking antibodies to the ligands pro-nerve growth factor and pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

Here we describe a \"thin\" lissencephaly (TLIS) variant characterized by megalencephaly, frontal predominant pachygyria, intellectual disability, and seizures. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing and targeted re-sequencing identified recessive mutations of CRADD in six individuals with TLIS from four unrelated families of diverse ethnic backgrounds. CRADD (also known as RAIDD) is a death-domain-containing adaptor protein that oligomerizes with PIDD and caspase-2 to initiate apoptosis. TLIS variants cluster in the CRADD death domain, a platform for interaction with other death-domain-containing proteins including PIDD. Although caspase-2 is expressed in the developing mammalian brain, little is known about its role in cortical development. CRADD/caspase-2 signaling is implicated in neurotrophic factor withdrawal- and amyloid-\u03b2-induced dendritic spine collapse and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting a role in cortical sculpting and plasticity. TLIS-associated CRADD variants do not disrupt interactions with caspase-2 or PIDD in co-immunoprecipitation assays, but still abolish CRADD's ability to activate caspase-2, resulting in reduced neuronal apoptosis in\u00a0vitro. Homozygous Cradd knockout mice display megalencephaly and seizures without obvious defects in cortical lamination, supporting a role for CRADD/caspase-2 signaling in mammalian brain development. Megalencephaly and lissencephaly associated with defective programmed cell death from loss of CRADD function in humans implicate reduced apoptosis as an important pathophysiological mechanism of cortical malformation.

A key neuropathological feature of the disease is the over-production of amyloid-beta and the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques in brain regions of the afflicted individuals. Throughout the years scientists have generated numerous Alzheimer's disease mouse models that attempt to replicate the amyloid-beta pathology. Unfortunately, the mouse models only selectively mimic the disease features. Neuronal death, a prominent effect in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, is noticeably lacking in these mice. Hence, we and others have employed a method of directly infusing soluble oligomeric species of amyloid-beta - forms of amyloid-beta that have been proven to be most toxic to neurons - stereotaxically into the brain. In this report we utilize male C57BL/6J mice to document this surgical technique of increasing amyloid-beta levels in a select brain region. The infusion target is the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus because this brain structure, along with the basal forebrain that is connected by the cholinergic circuit, represents one of the areas of degeneration in the disease. The results of elevating amyloid-beta in the dentate gyrus via stereotaxic infusion reveal increases in neuron loss in the dentate gyrus within 1 week, while there is a concomitant increase in cell death and cholinergic neuron loss in the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca of the basal forebrain. These effects are observed up to 2 weeks. Our data suggests that the current amyloid-beta infusion model provides an alternative mouse model to address region specific neuron death in a short-term basis. The advantage of this model is that amyloid-beta can be elevated in a spatial and temporal manner.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "Peptide Fragments", "Stereotaxic Techniques"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying Y", "Last Name": "Jean", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center; yyj2103@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jimena", "Last Name": "Baleriola", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mauro", "Last Name": "F\u00e0", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "Hengst", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Carol M", "Last Name": "Troy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center; The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center; Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2015Jun17"}, {"PMID": "26131922", "Title": "Detection of Axonally Localized mRNAs in Brain Sections Using High-Resolution In Situ Hybridization.", "Abstract": "mRNAs are frequently localized to vertebrate axons and their local translation is required for axon pathfinding or branching during development and for maintenance, repair or neurodegeneration in postdevelopmental periods. High throughput analyses have recently revealed that axons have a more dynamic and complex transcriptome than previously expected. These analysis, however have been mostly done in cultured neurons where axons can be isolated from the somato-dendritic compartments. It is virtually impossible to achieve such isolation in whole tissues in vivo. Thus, in order to verify the recruitment of mRNAs and their functional relevance in a whole animal, transcriptome analyses should ideally be combined with techniques that allow the visualization of mRNAs in situ. Recently, novel ISH technologies that detect RNAs at a single-molecule level have been developed. This is especially important when analyzing the subcellular localization of mRNA, since localized RNAs are typically found at low levels. Here we describe two protocols for the detection of axonally-localized mRNAs using a novel ultrasensitive RNA ISH technology.

Here, we report that combined delivery of short interfering CASP2 and inhibition of CASP6 using a dominant negative CASP6 mutant activates astrocytes and M\u00fcller cells, increases CNTF levels in the retina and leads to enhanced retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration. In dissociated adult rat mixed retinal cultures, dominant negative CASP6 mutant + short interfering CASP2 treatment also significantly increases GFAP+ glial activation, increases the expression of CNTF in culture, and subsequently increases the number of retinal ganglion cells with neurites and the mean retinal ganglion cell neurite length. These effects are abrogated by the addition of MAB228 (a monoclonal antibody targeted to the gp130 component of the CNTF receptor) and AG490 (an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway downstream of CNTF signalling). Similarly, in the optic nerve crush injury model, MAB228 and AG490 neutralizes dominant negative CASP6 mutant + short interfering CASP2-mediated retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration, M\u00fcller cell activation and CNTF production in the retina without affecting retinal ganglion cell survival.

In the present study, using two different neuronal apoptotic paradigms, \u03b2-amyloid treatment and NGF (nerve growth factor) withdrawal, we examined the hierarchical role of caspase-2 activation in the transcriptional control of neuron death. Both paradigms induce rapid activation of caspase-2 as well as activation of the transcription factor c-Jun and subsequent induction of the pro-apoptotic BH3 (Bcl-homology domain 3)-only protein Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death).
