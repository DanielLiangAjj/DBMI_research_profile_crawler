The primary aim of this review is to provide a concise overview of recent literature on the prevalence of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among US Veterans, and associations with mental and physical health conditions.

OWS has not been studied using nationally representative data.Objectives: We examined the prevalence and clinical correlates of OWS among U.S. adults with NMOU.Methods: We used data from 36,309\u2009U.S. adult participants in the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, 1,527 of whom reported past 12-month NMOU. Adjusted linear and logistic regression models examined associations between OWS and its clinical correlates, including psychiatric disorders, opioid use disorder (OUD; excluding the withdrawal criterion), medical conditions, and healthcare utilization among people with regular (i.e. \u22653\u2009days/week) NMOU (n\u2009=\u2009534).Results: Over half (50.4%) of the sample was male. Approximately 9% of people with NMOU met criteria for DSM-5 OWS, with greater prevalence of OWS (\u223c20%) among people with regular NMOU. Individuals with bipolar disorder, dysthymia, panic disorder, and borderline personality disorder had greater odds of OWS (aOR range\u2009=\u20092.71-4.63). People with OWS had lower mental health-related quality of life (\u03b2=-8.32, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Individuals with OUD also had greater odds of OWS (aOR range\u2009=\u200926.02-27.77), an association that increased with more severe OUD. People using substance use-related healthcare services also had greater odds of OWS (aOR range\u2009=\u20096.93-7.69).Conclusion: OWS was prevalent among people with OUD and some psychiatric disorders.

Adults with problematic substance use were recruited from two settings: a research setting in an urban medical center and a suburban inpatient addiction treatment program. Participants who reported past-year cannabis use (n\u00a0=\u00a0392) were included in this study and completed a semi-structured, clinician-administered diagnostic interview. Regression models estimated the associations between binary DSM-5 CUD and severity levels with a set of validators, including cannabis use variables, psychopathology, and functional impairment. DSM-5 CUD and all severity levels were associated with cannabis use validators, including number of days used, self-reporting that cannabis use was a major problem, and greater cannabis craving. DSM-5 CUD and severe CUD were associated with other psychiatric disorders and social impairment. Findings add information about the validity of DSM-5 CUD diagnosis and severity levels, with severe CUD receiving the strongest support from its association with validators across all domains, as distinct from the mild and moderate CUD measures that were associated with cannabis-specific validators alone. Severe CUD is likely to require more intensive treatment to bolster physical, psychiatric, and social functioning, whereas the mild and moderate severity thresholds provide useful information for identifying less severe disorders for prevention and brief intervention.", "Keywords": ["Cannabis use disorder", "Cannabis use disorder severity", "Concurrent validity", "DSM-5", "Diagnosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antisocial Personality Disorder", "Craving", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Hallucinogens", "Humans", "Marijuana Abuse", "Substance-Related Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Fink", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dvora", "Last Name": "Shmulewitz", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zachary L", "Last Name": "Mannes", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Malka", "Last Name": "Stohl", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ofir", "Last Name": "Livne", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah S", "Last Name": "Hasin", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

However, subgroups reporting medical comorbidities, significant pain, a greater number of concussions, less social support, and adverse psychosocial factors were at greater risk for psychological distress. Additionally, athletes experiencing psychological distress in retirement often do not seek treatment for their distress. Based on the existing literature, there is a need for greater standardization and use of reliable measures, as well as use of diagnostic interviews in order to assess the most accurate prevalence of psychological distress among these athletes. Longitudinal designs, matched control groups, more heterogeneous samples, and use of multivariate analyses would also help to more accurately determine the prevalence and risk factors of psychological distress in this population.

Participants recruited from community health centers in Florida completed questionnaires assessing demographics, substance use, symptoms of GAD and depression, and HCU. Adjusted binary and multinomial logistic regressions assessed the association between moderate-severe GAD symptoms and past 6-month missed HIV-care appointments, overnight hospitalization, and emergency department (ED)/urgent care visits. Participants reporting moderate-severe GAD symptoms had a greater odds of missing an HIV-care appointment (AOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28-3.24, p\u2009=\u20090.003), spending 2 (AOR 4.35, 95% CI 2.18-8.69, p\u2009<\u20090.001) or 3+ (AOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.20-6.45, p\u2009=\u20090.016) nights in the hospital, and visiting an ED/urgent care facility 2 (AOR 2.63, 95% CI 1.39-4.96, p\u2009=\u20090.003) or 3+ (AOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.27-5.26 p\u2009=\u20090.008) times compared to participants reporting none-mild anxiety. Depression was associated with fewer ED/urgent care visits and overnight hospitalizations, while no association was found with missed primary care appointments.

Though men are more likely than women to use illicit substances and engage in heavy drinking, the prevalence of substance use in women is growing and their escalation toward dependence occurs more rapidly. Loneliness and substance use have greater relevance within the HIV+ population, with higher rates of substance misuse than the general population. However, the association between loneliness and substance use within HIV+ individuals remains understudied. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that there would be an association between loneliness and substance moderated by gender in HIV+ older adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2013 and January 2014. Study participants included 96 HIV-positive Black/African American men and women recruited through the University of Florida Center for HIV/AIDS Research, Education and Service (UF CARES) in Jacksonville, Florida. Participants completed an interviewer-administered assessment examining mental and behavioral health. Pearson correlations examined associations between loneliness and substance use. Binary logistic regression analyses stratified by gender examined the association between loneliness and substance use while controlling for covariates. Among women, loneliness was associated with illicit drug use, AOR\u2009=\u20093.37, 95% CI: 1.23-9.21, p\u2009=\u2009.018 and heavy drinking, AOR\u2009=\u20092.47, 95% CI: 1.07-5.71, p\u2009=\u2009.033. No significant associations were found between loneliness and illicit drug use, and heavy drinking in men. Substance use among women in this population may be linked to loneliness. Interventions should be gender specific.
