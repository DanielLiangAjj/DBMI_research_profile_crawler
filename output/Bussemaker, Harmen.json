High-throughput in vitro binding assays coupled with computational analysis have made it possible to accurately define such sequence recognition in a biophysically interpretable yet mechanism-agonistic way for individual TFs. The fact that such sequence-to-affinity models are now available for hundreds of TFs provides new avenues for predicting how the DNA binding specificity of a TF changes when its protein sequence is mutated. To this end, we developed an analytical framework based on a tetrahedron embedding that can be applied at the level of a given structural TF family. Using bHLH as a test case, we demonstrate that we can systematically map dependencies between the protein sequence of a TF and base preference within the DNA binding site. We also develop a regression approach to predict the quantitative energetic impact of mutations in the DNA binding domain of a TF on its DNA binding specificity, and perform SELEX-seq assays on mutated TFs to experimentally validate our results. Our results point to the feasibility of predicting the functional impact of disease mutations and allelic variation in the cell-wide TF repertoire by leveraging high-quality functional information across sets of homologous wild-type proteins.", "Keywords": ["DNA binding specificity", "basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family", "biophysically interpretable machine learning", "functional impact of missense mutations", "transcription factors"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shaoxun", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pilar", "Last Name": "Gomez-Alcala", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christ", "Last Name": "Leemans", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "William J", "Last Name": "Glassford", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard S", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harmen J", "Last Name": "Bussemaker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan29"}, {"PMID": "38168434", "Title": "Benchmarking DNA binding affinity models using allele-specific transcription factor binding data.", "Abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) bind to DNA in a highly sequence-specific manner.

To address this, we propose a framework for benchmarking sequence-to-affinity models for TF binding in terms of their ability to predict allelic imbalances in ChIP-seq counts. We show that a likelihood function based on an over-dispersed binomial distribution can aggregate evidence for allelic preference across the genome without requiring statistical significance for individual variants.

Here we analyse a cis regulatory module directly regulated by seven different Drosophila Hox proteins and uncover how different Hox class proteins differentially control its expression. We find that regulation by one or another Hox protein depends on the combination of three modes: Hox-cofactor dependent DNA-binding specificity; Hox-monomer binding sites; and interaction with positive and negative Hox-collaborator proteins. Additionally, we find that similar regulation can be achieved by Amphioxus orthologs, suggesting these three mechanisms are conserved from insects to chordates.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Embryonic Development", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genes, Homeobox", "Genes, Insect", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Protein Binding", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Higueras", "Affiliation": "Centro Andaluz de Biolog\u00eda del Desarrollo (CSIC/JA/UPO), Universidad Pablo de Olavide, 41013, Seville, Spain. csanhig@upo.es."}, {"First Name": "Chaitanya", "Last Name": "Rastogi", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biological Sciences and Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roumen", "Last Name": "Voutev", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Systems Biology, and Neuroscience, Mortimer B.

We developed an algorithm, SelexGLM, that quantifies binding specificity over a large (31-bp) binding site by iteratively fitting a feature-based generalized linear model to SELEX probe counts. This analysis revealed that the DNA-binding preferences of AR and GR homodimers differ significantly, both within and outside the 15-bp core binding site. The relative preference between the two factors can be tuned over a wide range by changing the DNA sequence, with AR more sensitive to sequence changes than GR. The specificity of AR extends to the regions flanking the core 15-bp site, where isothermal calorimetry measurements reveal that affinity is augmented by enthalpy-driven readout of poly(A) sequences associated with narrowed minor groove width.

The software identifies canonical and noncanonical base pairs, including those with modified nucleotides, in any tautomeric or protonation state. DSSR detects higher-order coplanar base associations, termed multiplets.

DSSR identifies coaxial stacking of multiple stems within a single helix and lists isolated canonical pairs that lie outside of a stem. The program characterizes 'closed' loops of various types (hairpin, bulge, internal, and junction loops) and pseudoknots of arbitrary complexity. Notably, DSSR employs isolated pairs and the ends of stems, whether pseudoknotted or not, to define junction loops. This new, inclusive definition provides a novel perspective on the spatial organization of RNA.

Traditionally, these models were built based on nucleotide sequence. Here, we integrated 3D DNA shape information derived with a high-throughput approach into the modeling of TF binding specificities.

Despite being only a small chemical change, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine can affect base readout via hydrophobic contacts in the major groove and shape readout via electrostatic contacts in the minor groove. We discuss the recent discovery that CpG methylation increases DNase I cleavage at adjacent positions by an order of magnitude through altering the local 3D DNA shape and the possible implications of this structural insight for understanding the methylation sensitivity of transcription factors (TFs). Additionally, 5-methylcytosines change the stability of nucleosomes and, thus, affect the local chromatin structure and access of TFs to genomic DNA.

Together, our data suggest an elegant mechanism for balancing stress response and development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Longevity", "Receptor, Insulin", "Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid", "Trans-Activators", "Transcription Factors", "Transcriptional Activation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ronald G", "Last Name": "Tepper", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jasmine", "Last Name": "Ashraf", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics and Dept. of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Kaletsky", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics and Dept. of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Kleemann", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics and Dept. of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Coleen T", "Last Name": "Murphy", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics and Dept. of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harmen J", "Last Name": "Bussemaker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Cell", "PubDate": "2013Aug01"}, {"PMID": "23576721", "Title": "Probing DNA shape and methylation state on a genomic scale with DNase I.", "Abstract": "DNA binding proteins find their cognate sequences within genomic DNA through recognition of specific chemical and structural features. Here we demonstrate that high-resolution DNase I cleavage profiles can provide detailed information about the shape and chemical modification status of genomic DNA. Analyzing millions of DNA backbone hydrolysis events on naked genomic DNA, we show that the intrinsic rate of cleavage by DNase I closely tracks the width of the minor groove. Integration of these DNase I cleavage data with bisulfite sequencing data for the same cell type's genome reveals that cleavage directly adjacent to cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides is enhanced at least eightfold by cytosine methylation. This phenomenon we show to be attributable to methylation-induced narrowing of the minor groove. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it enables simultaneous mapping of DNase I hypersensitivity and regional DNA methylation levels using dense in vivo cleavage data. Taken together, our results suggest a general mechanism by which CpG methylation can modulate protein-DNA interaction strength via the remodeling of DNA shape.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cells, Cultured", "CpG Islands", "DNA", "DNA Methylation", "Deoxyribonuclease I", "Genomics", "Humans", "Models, Genetic", "Models, Molecular", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Allan", "Last Name": "Lazarovici", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tianyin", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Shafer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ana Carolina", "Last Name": "Dantas Machado", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Todd R", "Last Name": "Riley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Sandstrom", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter J", "Last Name": "Sabo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Remo", "Last Name": "Rohs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Stamatoyannopoulos", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harmen J", "Last Name": "Bussemaker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Apr16"}, {"PMID": "23354101", "Title": "Evaluation of methods for modeling transcription factor sequence specificity.", "Abstract": "Genomic analyses often involve scanning for potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites using models of the sequence specificity of DNA binding proteins. Many approaches have been developed to model and learn a protein's DNA-binding specificity, but these methods have not been systematically compared. Here we applied 26 such approaches to in vitro protein binding microarray data for 66 mouse TFs belonging to various families. For nine TFs, we also scored the resulting motif models on in vivo data, and found that the best in vitro-derived motifs performed similarly to motifs derived from the in vivo data. Our results indicate that simple models based on mononucleotide position weight matrices trained by the best methods perform similarly to more complex models for most TFs examined, but fall short in specific cases (<10% of the TFs examined here). In addition, the best-performing motifs typically have relatively low information content, consistent with widespread degeneracy in eukaryotic TF sequence preferences.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Computational Biology", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Genome", "Mice", "Nucleotide Motifs", "Position-Specific Scoring Matrices", "Protein Array Analysis", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew T", "Last Name": "Weirauch", "Affiliation": "Banting and Best Department of Medical Research and Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Atina", "Last Name": "Cote", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Raquel", "Last Name": "Norel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matti", "Last Name": "Annala", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yue", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Todd R", "Last Name": "Riley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julio", "Last Name": "Saez-Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Cokelaer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anastasia", "Last Name": "Vedenko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shaheynoor", "Last Name": "Talukder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "DREAM5 Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harmen J", "Last Name": "Bussemaker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Quaid D", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martha L", "Last Name": "Bulyk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gustavo", "Last Name": "Stolovitzky", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy R", "Last Name": "Hughes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature biotechnology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
