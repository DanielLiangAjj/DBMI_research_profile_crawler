Its pharmacology and direct linkage to PLD activation are well established and indicate it is a highly atypical glutamate receptor. A receptor with the same pharmacology is present in spindle primary sensory terminals where its blockade can totally abolish, and its activation can double, the normal stretch-evoked firing. We report here the first identification of this PLD-mGluR protein, by capitalizing on its expression in primary mechanosensory terminals, developing an enriched source, pharmacological profiling to identify an optimal ligand, and then functionalizing it as a molecular tool. Evidence from immunofluorescence, western and far-western blotting indicates PLD-mGluR is homomeric GluK2, since GluK2 is the only glutamate receptor protein/receptor subunit present in spindle mechanosensory terminals. Its expression was also found in the lanceolate palisade ending of hair follicle, also known to contain the PLD-mGluR. Finally, in a mouse model with ionotropic function ablated in the GluK2 subunit, spindle glutamatergic responses were still present, confirming it acts purely metabotropically.

Although opioids are generally associated only with the control of pain, here we report that the opioid system in fact broadly regulates cutaneous mechanosensation, including touch. This function is predominantly subserved by the delta opioid receptor (DOR), which is expressed by myelinated mechanoreceptors that form Meissner corpuscles, Merkel cell-neurite complexes, and circumferential hair follicle endings. These afferents also include a small population of CGRP-expressing myelinated nociceptors that we now identify as the somatosensory neurons that coexpress mu and delta opioid receptors. We further demonstrate that DOR activation at the central terminals of myelinated mechanoreceptors depresses synaptic input to the spinal dorsal horn, via the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. Collectively our results uncover a molecular mechanism by which opioids modulate cutaneous mechanosensation and provide a rationale for targeting DOR to alleviate injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Analgesics, Opioid", "Animals", "Calcium Channels", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Mechanoreceptors", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "Nociceptors", "Pain", "Receptors, Opioid, delta", "Spinal Cord"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Bardoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Science, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41100 Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Vivianne L", "Last Name": "Tawfik", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amaury", "Last Name": "Fran\u00e7ois", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Solorzano", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Shuster", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA."}, {"First Name": "Papiya", "Last Name": "Choudhury", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Betelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Science, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41100 Modena, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Colleen", "Last Name": "Cassidy", "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071, USA; Department of Zoology and Physiology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Neuroscience, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071, USA; Department of Zoology and Physiology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joriene C", "Last Name": "de Nooij", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neuroscience and Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fran\u00e7oise", "Last Name": "Mennicken", "Affiliation": "AstraZeneca R&D Montreal, Department of Translational Science, Montreal, QC H4S 1Z9, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Dajan", "Last Name": "O'Donnell", "Affiliation": "AstraZeneca R&D Montreal, Department of Translational Science, Montreal, QC H4S 1Z9, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Brigitte L", "Last Name": "Kieffer", "Affiliation": "Institut de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique et de Biologie Mol\u00e9culaire et Cellulaire, UMR7104 CNRS/Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, U964 INSERM, 67400 Illkirch, France."}, {"First Name": "C Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Woodbury", "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology and Physiology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allan I", "Last Name": "Basbaum", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy B", "Last Name": "MacDermott", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gr\u00e9gory", "Last Name": "Scherrer", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.

We report here that pSNs supplying distinct skeletal muscles differ in their dependence on the ETS transcription factor Etv1 for their survival and differentiation. The status of Etv1-dependence is linked to the location of proprioceptor muscle targets: pSNs innervating hypaxial and axial muscles depend critically on Etv1 for survival, whereas those innervating certain limb muscles are resistant to Etv1 inactivation. The level of NT3 expression in individual muscles correlates with Etv1-dependence and the loss of pSNs triggered by Etv1 inactivation can be prevented by elevating the level of muscle-derived NT3-revealing a TrkC-activated Etv1-bypass pathway.
