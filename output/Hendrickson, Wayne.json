It also mediates diverse cellular processes not associated with Ca2+ balance3-5. The functional pleiotropy of CaSR arises in part from its ability to signal through several G-protein subtypes6. We determined structures of CaSR in complex with G proteins from three different subfamilies: Gq, Gi and Gs. We found that the homodimeric CaSR of each complex couples to a single G protein through a common mode. This involves the C-terminal helix of each G\u03b1 subunit binding to a shallow pocket that is formed in one CaSR subunit by all three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3), an extended transmembrane helix 3 and an ordered C-terminal region. G-protein binding expands the transmembrane dimer interface, which is further stabilized by phospholipid. The restraint imposed by the receptor dimer, in combination with ICL2, enables G-protein activation by facilitating conformational transition of G\u03b1. We identified a single G\u03b1 residue that determines Gq and Gs versus Gi selectivity. The length and flexibility of ICL2 allows CaSR to bind all three G\u03b1 subtypes, thereby conferring capacity for promiscuous G-protein coupling.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Calcium", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Receptors, Calcium-Sensing", "Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Substrate Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Zuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinseo", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aurel", "Last Name": "Frangaj", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianxiang", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guanqi", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jamie J", "Last Name": "Manning", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wesley B", "Last Name": "Asher", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhengyuan", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guo-Bin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for BioMolecular Structure, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liguo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for BioMolecular Structure, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Mendez", "Affiliation": "National Center for Cryo-EM Access and Training, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Eng", "Affiliation": "National Center for Cryo-EM Access and Training, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhening", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Grassucci", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wayne A", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Since these patterns record only amplitudes, phases for the diffracted waves must also be evaluated for systematic structure determination. Thus, we have the phase problem as a central complication, both intellectually for the field and practically so for many analyses. Here, I discuss how we - myself, my laboratory and the diffraction community - have faced the phase problem, considering the evolution of methods for phase evaluation as structural biology developed to the present day. During the explosive growth of macromolecular crystallography, practice in diffraction analysis evolved from a universal reliance on isomorphous replacement to the eventual domination of anomalous diffraction for de novo structure determination. As the Protein Data Bank (PDB) grew and familial relationships among proteins became clear, molecular replacement overtook all other phasing methods; however, experimental phasing remained essential for molecules without obvious precedents, with multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD and SAD) predominating. While the mathematics-based direct methods had proved to be inadequate for typical macromolecules, they returned to crack substantial selenium substructures in SAD analyses of selenomethionyl proteins. Native SAD, exploiting the intrinsic S and P atoms of biomolecules, has become routine. Selenomethionyl SAD and MAD were the mainstays of structural genomics efforts to populate the PDB with novel proteins. A recent dividend has been paid in the success of PDB-trained artificial intelligence approaches for protein structure prediction. Currently, molecular replacement with AlphaFold models often obviates the need for experimental phase evaluation. For multiple reasons, we are now unfazed by the phase problem. Cryo-EM analysis is an attractive alternative to crystallography for many applications faced by today's structural biologists. It simply finesses the phase problem; however, the principles and procedures of diffraction analysis remain pertinent and are adopted in single-particle cryo-EM studies of biomolecules.", "Keywords": ["anomalous diffraction", "density modification", "direct methods", "isomorphous replacement", "molecular replacement"], "MeSH terms": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Databases, Protein", "Explosive Agents", "Genomics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wayne A", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "IUCrJ", "PubDate": "2023Sep01"}, {"PMID": "37530628", "Title": "Heterobimetallic Base Pair Programming in Designer 3D DNA Crystals.", "Abstract": "Metal-mediated DNA (mmDNA) presents a pathway toward engineering bioinorganic and electronic behavior into DNA devices.

LGRs are present in all metazoan animals. In humans, the LGR ligands include glycoprotein hormones (GPHs) chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH). These hormones are \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers of cystine-knot protein chains. LGRs and their ligand chains have coevolved. Ancestral hormone homologs, present in both bilaterian animals and chordates, are identified as \u03b12\u03b25. We have used single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and molecular replacement to determine structures of the \u03b12\u03b25 hormone from Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce\u03b12\u03b25). Ce\u03b12\u03b25 is unglycosylated, as are many other \u03b12\u03b25 hormones. Both Hs\u03b12\u03b25, the human homolog of Ce\u03b12\u03b25, and hTSH activate the same receptor (hTSHR). Despite having little sequence similarity to vertebrate GPHs, apart from the cysteine patterns from core disulfide bridges, Ce\u03b12\u03b25 is generally similar in structure to these counterparts; however, its \u03b12 and \u03b25 subunits are more symmetric as compared with \u03b1 and \u03b2 of hCG and hFSH.

The native-SAD method is particularly attractive for membrane proteins, which are difficult to produce and often recalcitrant to grow into decent-sized crystals. Native-SAD uses lower-energy X-rays to enhance anomalous signals from sulfur or phospho-rus. However, at lower energies, the scattering and absorption of air contribute to the background noise, reduce the signals and are thus adverse to native-SAD phasing. We have previously demonstrated native-SAD phasing at an energy of 5\u2005keV in air at the NSLS-II FMX beamline. Here, the use of a helium path developed to reduce both the noise from background scattering and the air absorption of the diffracted X-ray beam are described. The helium path was used for collection of anomalous diffraction data at 5\u2005keV for two proteins: thaumatin and the membrane protein TehA. Although anomalous signals from each individual crystal are very weak, robust anomalous signals are obtained from data assembled from micrometre-sized crystals. The thaumatin structure was determined from 15 microcrystals and the TehA structure from 18 microcrystals.

Hsp70s are ubiquitous and highly conserved across all of life; they bind ATP at an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and client peptides in the substrate-binding domain (SBD). The NBD and SBD are connected by a highly conserved linker segment that is integrated into the NBD when ATP is bound but is flexible when the NBD is nucleotide-free or bound with ADP. Allosteric coupling is lost when the linker is flexible, and the freed SBD binds peptide clients with high affinity. It was recently discovered that Hsp70-ATP is in an equilibrium between a restraining state (R) with little affinity for peptides and a low ATPase activity, and a stimulating state (S) that binds peptides efficiently, but with rapid kinetics, and has a relatively high ATPase activity. While attempting to characterize the S state, crystal structures of DnaK-ATP were obtained that demonstrate intrinsic Hsp70 plasticity that affects binding interactions with substrate peptides.

member of the class C family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-mediates inhibitory neurotransmission and has been implicated in epilepsy, pain and addiction1. A unique GPCR that is known to require heterodimerization for function2-6, the GABAB receptor has two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, that are structurally homologous but perform distinct and complementary functions. GABAB1 recognizes orthosteric ligands7,8, while GABAB2 couples with G proteins9-14. Each subunit is characterized by an extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) module, a descending peptide linker, a seven-helix transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail15. Although the VFT heterodimer structure has been resolved16, the structure of the full-length receptor and its transmembrane signalling mechanism remain unknown. Here we present a near full-length structure of the GABAB receptor, captured in an inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique 'intersubunit latch' within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium",

The anomalous scattering from relevant native elements - primarily sulfur in proteins and phospho-rus in nucleic acids - increases as the X-ray energy decreases toward their K-edge transitions. Thus, measurements at a lowered X-ray energy are promising for making native SAD routine and robust. For microcrystals with sizes less than 10\u2005\u00b5m, native-SAD phasing at synchrotron microdiffraction beamlines is even more challenging because of difficulties in sample manipulation, diffraction data collection and data analysis. Native-SAD analysis from microcrystals by using X-ray free-electron lasers has been demonstrated but has required use of thousands of thousands of microcrystals to achieve the necessary accuracy. Here it is shown that by exploitation of anomalous microdiffraction signals obtained at 5\u2005keV, by the use of polyimide wellmounts, and by an iterative crystal and frame-rejection method, microcrystal native-SAD phasing is possible from as few as about 1\u2009200 crystals.

Expression of a L205R point mutant and a DnaJ-PKA fusion protein were found to be linked to Cushing's syndrome and FL-HCC, respectively. Here we reveal contrasting mechanisms for increased PKA signaling at the molecular level through structural determination and biochemical characterization of the aberrant enzymes.

In FL-HCC, the DnaJ-PKA chimera remains under regulatory subunit control; however, its overexpression from the DnaJ promoter leads to enhanced cAMP-dependent signaling.

Entry of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into target T-cells entails an interaction between CD4 on the host T-cell and gp120, a component of the trimeric envelope glycoprotein spike on the virion surface. The resultant interaction initiates a series of conformational changes within the envelope spike that permits binding to a chemokine receptor, formation of the gp41 fusion complex, and cell entry. A hydrophobic cavity at the CD4-gp120 interface, defined by X-ray crystallography, provided an initial site for small molecule antagonist design. This site however has evolved to facilitate viral entry. As such, the binding of prospective small molecule inhibitors within this gp120 cavity can inadvertently trigger an allosteric entry signal. Structural characterization of the CD4-gp120 interface, which provided the foundation for small molecule structure-based inhibitor design, will be presented first. An integrated approach combining biochemical, virological, structural, computational, and synthetic studies, along with a detailed analysis of ligand binding energetics, revealed that modestly active small molecule inhibitors of HIV entry can also promote viral entry into cells lacking the CD4 receptor protein; these competitive inhibitors were termed small molecule CD4 mimetics. Related congeners were subsequently identified with both improved binding affinity and more potent viral entry inhibition. Further assessment of the affinity-enhanced small molecule CD4 mimetics demonstrated that premature initiation of conformational change within the viral envelope spike, prior to cell encounter, can lead to irreversible deactivation of viral entry machinery. Related congeners, which bind the same gp120 site, possess different propensities to elicit the allosteric response that underlies the undesired enhancement of CD4-independent viral entry. Subsequently, key hotspots in the CD4-gp120 interface were categorized using mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry according to the capacity to increase binding affinity without triggering the allosteric signal. This analysis, combined with cocrystal structures of small molecule viral entry agonists with gp120, led to the development of fully functional antagonists of HIV-1 entry.

Currently, selenomethionyl proteins analyzed using single- or multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD or MAD) data predominate for such de novo analyses. Naturally occurring metal ions such as zinc or iron often suffice in MAD or SAD experiments, and sulfur SAD has been an option since it was first demonstrated using crambin 30 years ago; however, SAD analyses of structures containing only light atoms (Zmax \u2264 20) have not been common. Here, robust procedures for enhancing the signal to noise in measurements of anomalous diffraction by combining data collected from several crystals at a lower than usual X-ray energy are described. This multi-crystal native SAD method was applied in five structure determinations, using between five and 13 crystals to determine substructures of between four and 52 anomalous scatterers (Z \u2264 20) and then the full structures ranging from 127 to 1200 ordered residues per asymmetric unit at resolutions from 2.3 to 2.8\u2005\u00c5.

The task force includes experts in small-angle scattering (SAS), crystallography, data archiving, and molecular modeling who met to consider questions regarding the contributions of SAS to modern structural biology. Recognizing there is a rapidly growing community of structural biology researchers acquiring and interpreting SAS data in terms of increasingly sophisticated molecular models, the task force recommends that (1) a global repository is needed that holds standard format X-ray and neutron SAS data that is searchable and freely accessible for download; (2) a standard dictionary is required for definitions of terms for data collection and for managing the SAS data repository; (3) options should be provided for including in the repository SAS-derived shape and atomistic models based on rigid-body refinement against SAS data along with specific information regarding the uniqueness and uncertainty of the model, and the protocol used to obtain it; (4) criteria need to be agreed upon for assessment of the quality of deposited SAS data and the accuracy of SAS-derived models, and the extent to which a given model fits the SAS data; (5) with the increasing diversity of structural biology data and models being generated, archiving options for models derived from diverse data will be required; and (6) thought leaders from the various structural biology disciplines should jointly define what to archive in the PDB and what complementary archives might be needed, taking into account both scientific needs and funding.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Databases, Protein", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation", "Proteins", "Scattering, Small Angle"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jill", "Last Name": "Trewhella", "Affiliation": "School of Molecular Bioscience, The University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. jill.trewhella@sydney.edu.au"}, {"First Name": "Wayne A", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerard J", "Last Name": "Kleywegt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrej", "Last Name": "Sali", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mamoru", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Torsten", "Last Name": "Schwede", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dmitri I", "Last Name": "Svergun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Tainer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Westbrook", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Helen M", "Last Name": "Berman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Structure (London, England : 1993)", "PubDate": "2013Jun04"}, {"PMID": "23708608", "Title": "Allosteric opening of the polypeptide-binding site when an Hsp70 binds ATP.", "Abstract": "The 70-kilodalton (kDa) heat-shock proteins (Hsp70s) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones essential for cellular protein folding and proteostasis. Each Hsp70 has two functional domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), which binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and a substrate-binding domain (SBD), which binds extended polypeptides. NBD and SBD interact little when in the presence of ADP; however, ATP binding allosterically couples the polypeptide- and ATP-binding sites. ATP binding promotes polypeptide release; polypeptide rebinding stimulates ATP hydrolysis. This allosteric coupling is poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an intact ATP-bound Hsp70 from Escherichia coli at 1.96-\u00c5 resolution. The ATP-bound NBD adopts a unique conformation, forming extensive interfaces with an SBD that has changed radically, having its \u03b1-helical lid displaced and the polypeptide-binding channel of its \u03b2-subdomain restructured. These conformational changes, together with our biochemical assays, provide a structural explanation for allosteric coupling in Hsp70 activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Adenosine Triphosphate", "Allosteric Regulation", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Conserved Sequence", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Dimerization", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation, Missense", "Peptides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Folding", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Sequence Alignment", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruifeng", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Evans Boateng", "Last Name": "Sarbeng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qun", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katherine Quynh", "Last Name": "Le", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xinping", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hongya", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jiao", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer Li", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christina", "Last Name": "Vorvis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wayne A", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qinglian", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature structural & molecular biology", "PubDate": "2013Jul"}, {"PMID": "23667716", "Title": "Structure-Based Design and Synthesis of an HIV-1 Entry Inhibitor Exploiting X-Ray and Thermodynamic Characterization.", "Abstract": "The design, synthesis, thermodynamic and crystallographic characterization of a potent, broad spectrum, second-generation HIV-1 entry inhibitor that engages conserved carbonyl hydrogen bonds within gp120 has been achieved.

Previous studies indicate that the function of Aplysia CPEB can be modulated by conversion to a stable prion-like state, thus contributing to the stabilization of long-term memory on a molecular level. Here, we used biophysical methods to demonstrate that Aplysia CPEB, like other prions, undergoes a conformational switch from soluble \u03b1-helix-rich oligomer to \u03b2-sheet-rich fiber in vitro. Solid-state NMR analyses of the fibers indicated a relatively rigid N-terminal prion domain. The fiber form of Aplysia CPEB showed enhanced binding to target mRNAs as compared to the soluble form.
