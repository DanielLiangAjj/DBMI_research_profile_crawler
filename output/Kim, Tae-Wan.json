This work demonstrates the controlled formation of different types of defects and their comprehensive optical characterization using hyperspectral line imaging (HSLI). Distinct optical responses are observed in monolayer semiconductors grown under different stoichiometries using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. HSLI enables the simultaneous measurement of 400 spectra, allowing for statistical analysis of optical signatures at close to a centimeter scale. The study discovers that chalcogen-rich samples exhibit remarkable optical uniformity due to reduced precursor accumulation compared to the metal-rich case. The utilization of HSLI as a facile and reliable characterization tool pushes the boundaries of potential applications for atomically thin semiconductors in future devices.", "Keywords": ["atomically thin semiconductors", "defect", "hyperspectral imaging", "transition metal dichalcegenides"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seungjae", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Taejoon", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yoon Seong", "Last Name": "Heo", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Seonguk", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, 44919, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hosung", "Last Name": "Seo", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Joonki", "Last Name": "Suh", "Affiliation": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, 44919, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jae-Ung", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Department of Energy Systems Research, Ajou University, Suwon, 16499, South Korea."}], "Journal": "Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)", "PubDate": "2024Jun14"}, {"PMID": "38866017", "Title": "TNF-NF-\u03baB-p53 axis restricts in\u00a0vivo survival of hPSC-derived dopamine neurons.", "Abstract": "Ongoing, early-stage clinical trials illustrate the translational potential of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based cell therapies in Parkinson's disease (PD).

psychological dependence in certain users. However, little is known about the neurobehavioral effects of mexedrone in association with its potential for abuse. We investigated the abuse potential for mexedrone abuse through multiple behavioral tests. In addition, serotonin transporter (SERT) levels were measured in the synaptosome of the dorsal striatum, and serotonin (5-HT) levels were measured in the dorsal striatum of acute mexedreone (50\u00a0mg/kg)-treated mice. To clarify the neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying the locomotor response of mexedrone, the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 (0.5 or 1.0\u00a0mg/kg) was administered prior to the acute injection of mexedrone in the locomotor activity experiment in mice. Mexedrone (10-50\u00a0mg/kg) produced a significant place preference in mice and mexedrone (0.1-0.5\u00a0mg/kg/infusion) maintained self-administration behavior in rats in a dose-dependent manner. In the drug discrimination experiment, mexedrone (5.6-32\u00a0mg/kg) was fully substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine in rats. Mexedrone increased locomotor activity, and these effects were reversed by pretreatment with M100907. Acute mexedrone significantly increased c-Fos expression in the dorsal striatum and decreased SERT levels in the synaptosome of the dorsal striatum of mice, resulting in an elevation of 5-HT levels. Taken together, our results provide the possibility that mexedrone has abuse potential, which might be mediated, at least in part, by the activation of the serotonergic system in the dorsal striatum.", "Keywords": ["Abuse potential", "Dorsal striatum", "Mexedrone", "Reinforcing effects", "Serotonin", "Synthetic cathinone"], "MeSH terms": ["Rats", "Mice", "Male", "Animals", "Synthetic Cathinone", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Serotonin", "Cocaine", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Fluorobenzenes", "Methamphetamine", "Piperidines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyung Oh", "Last Name": "Jeon", "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Toxicology Research, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Daejeon, 34114, Republic of Korea; Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, 34134, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Oc-Hee", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Toxicology Research, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Daejeon, 34114, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Su Yeon", "Last Name": "Seo", "Affiliation": "Korean Medicine (KM) Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, 34054, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jaesuk", "Last Name": "Yun", "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Chungbuk National University, 194-31 Osongsaengmyeong 1-ro, Osong-eup, Heungdeok-gu, Cheongju-si, Chungcheongbuk-do, 28160, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Choon-Gon", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 16419, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Ri-Na", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Toxicology Research, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Daejeon, 34114, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Toxicology Research, Korea Institute of Toxicology, Daejeon, 34114, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Chae Ha", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Korean Medicine, Daegu Haany University, 136 Sincheondong-ro, Suseong-gu, Daegu, 42158, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Seong Shoon", "Last Name": "Yoon", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Korean Medicine, Daegu Haany University, 136 Sincheondong-ro, Suseong-gu, Daegu, 42158, Republic of Korea.

The underlying cause of PD and the concurrent neuroinflammation are not well understood. In this study, we utilize human and murine neuronal lines, stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons, and mice to demonstrate that three previously identified genetic risk factors for PD, namely SATB1, MIR22HG, and GBA, are components of a single gene regulatory pathway. Our findings indicate that dysregulation of this pathway leads to the upregulation of glucocerebrosides (GluCer), which triggers a cellular senescence-like phenotype in dopaminergic neurons. Specifically, we discovered that downregulation of the transcriptional repressor SATB1 results in the derepression of the microRNA miR-22-3p, leading to decreased GBA expression and subsequent accumulation of GluCer. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that an increase in GluCer alone is sufficient to impair lysosomal and mitochondrial function, thereby inducing cellular senescence. Dysregulation of the SATB1-MIR22-GBA pathway, observed in both PD patients and normal aging, leads to lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction due to the GluCer accumulation, ultimately resulting in a cellular senescence-like phenotype in dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, our study highlights a novel pathway involving three genetic risk factors for PD and provides a potential mechanism for the senescence-induced neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis observed in both PD and normal aging.", "Keywords": ["MicroRNAs", "Parkinson's disease", "gene expression regulation", "glucosylceramides", "lysosomes", "mitochondria", "neuroinflammation", "senescence"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins", "Glucosylceramides", "Gliosis", "Neuroinflammatory Diseases", "Parkinson Disease", "MicroRNAs", "Cellular Senescence", "Transcription Factors", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Taylor", "Last Name": "Russo", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Kolisnyk", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aswathy", "Last Name": "B S", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Plessis-Belair", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tae Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Center for Stem Cell Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Ni", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordan A", "Last Name": "Pearson", "Affiliation": "Medical Scientist Training Program, Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily J", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Dan L.

Currently, there is limited understanding of the role of CPNE7 (copine-7) in CRC progression and metastasis. The results of this study show that CPNE7 exerts an oncogenic effect in CRC. First, CPNE7 was shown to be significantly up-regulated in CRC patient tissues and CRC cell lines compared to normal tissues according to IHC staining, qRT-PCR, and western blotting. Next, this study used both systems of siRNA and shRNA to suppress CPNE7 gene expression to check the CPNE7 mechanism in CRC. The suppressed CPNE7 significantly inhibited the growth of CRC cells in in vitro experiments, including migration, invasion, and semisolid agar colony-forming assay. Moreover, the modified expression of CPNE7 led to a decrease in the levels of genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The epithelial genes E-cadherin (CDH1) and Collagen A1 were upregulated, and the levels of mesenchymal genes such as N-cadherin (CDH2), ZEB1, ZEB2, and SNAIL (SNAL1) were downregulated after CPNE7 inhibition.

The underlying cause of PD and the concurrent neuroinflammation are not well understood. In this study, we utilized human and murine neuronal lines, stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons, and mice to demonstrate that three previously identified genetic risk factors for PD, namely SATB1, MIR22HG, and GBA, are components of a single gene regulatory pathway. Our findings indicate that dysregulation of this pathway leads to the upregulation of glucocerebrosides (GluCer), which triggers a cellular senescence-like phenotype in dopaminergic neurons. Specifically, we discovered that downregulation of the transcriptional repressor SATB1 results in the derepression of the microRNA miR-22-3p, leading to decreased GBA expression and subsequent accumulation of GluCer. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that an increase in GluCer alone is sufficient to impair lysosomal and mitochondrial function, thereby inducing cellular senescence dependent on S100A9 and stress factors. Dysregulation of the SATB1-MIR22-GBA pathway, observed in both PD patients and normal aging, leads to lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction due to the GluCer accumulation, ultimately resulting in a cellular senescence-like phenotype in dopaminergic neurons.

PPAR\u03b3, a central metabolic regulator and primary drug target combatting insulin resistance, is hyperacetylated in both aging and obesity. By employing a unique adipocyte-specific PPAR\u03b3 acetylation-mimetic mutant knock-in mouse model, namely aKQ, we demonstrate that these mice develop worsened obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance as they age, and these metabolic deregulations are resistant to intervention by intermittent fasting. Interestingly, aKQ mice show a whitening phenotype of brown adipose tissue (BAT) manifested in lipid filling and suppressed BAT markers. Diet-induced obese aKQ mice retain an expected response to thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment, while BAT function remains impaired.

A. hemibapha subsp. javanica is often confused with A. subjunquillea, known as the East Asian death cap, which is potentially fatal when ingested. This study aimed to conduct the first chemical investigation of A. hemibapha subsp. javanica, which resulted in the isolation of seven fatty acid derivatives (1-7) and three steroids (8-10) from the MeOH extract of its fruiting bodies, and their structures were determined by comparing their NMR spectroscopic data with those previously reported, along with the data from LC/MS. Compound 1 was reported previously without the identification of its absolute configuration; its structure, including the absolute configuration was confirmed for the first time, in this study, by using 1H NMR and its fragmentation patterns in MS/MS data, and LC/MS analysis. A recently developed method using competing enantioselective acylation (CEA) coupled with LC/MS analysis was applied for determining the absolute configuration of compound 1, which revealed the 11S-configuration. In the anti-Helicobacter pylori activity test, compound 3 showed antibacterial activity against H. pylori strain 51 with 38.0% inhibition, comparable to that of quercetin (34.4% inhibition) as a positive control.

Much work has been done to develop methods for in vitro drug release testing, generally grouped into three major categories: sample and separate, dialysis membrane, and continuous flow (flow-through cell) methods.

In this work, an octaarginine CPP (RRRRRRRR) was conjugated with oxaliplatin via a specific heterobifunctional linker. The in vitro studies showed the conjugate had affinity toward mitochondria inside cells and the MTT assay confirmed that conjugate is active in low micromolar range against colon cancer cells, requiring much lower concentrations than the oxaliplatin alone to reach IC50.

RNA-seq analysis of human ventral midbrain tissue from COVID-19 patients, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded autopsy samples, confirmed the induction of an inflammatory and cellular senescence signature and identified low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts.

HERV-K(HML-2) has been associated with neurotoxicity, but there is no clear understanding of its role or mechanistic basis. We addressed the physiological functions of HERV-K(HML-2) in neuronal differentiation using CRISPR engineering to activate or repress its expression levels in a human-pluripotent-stem-cell-based system. We found that elevated HERV-K(HML-2) transcription is detrimental for the development and function of cortical neurons. These effects are cell-type-specific, as dopaminergic neurons are unaffected. Moreover, high HERV-K(HML-2) transcription alters cortical layer formation in forebrain organoids. HERV-K(HML-2) transcriptional activation leads to hyperactivation of NTRK3 expression and other neurodegeneration-related genes. Direct activation of NTRK3 phenotypically resembles HERV-K(HML-2) induction, and reducing NTRK3 levels in context of HERV-K(HML-2) induction restores cortical neuron differentiation.

ECP is a typical non-contact surface polishing process that has been used to improve surface quality without leaving any of the mechanical scratch marks that can arise when applying mechanical processes. ECP can polish work material via electrochemical dissolution between the surfaces of an anode and a cathode, and irregular defects are generated on the surface by impurities and bubbles generated during machining. This study confirms that our novel ECP method yields improved results over conventional ECP based on experiments using vibration electrochemical polishing (VECP) with ultrasonic vibrations. VECP minimizes nanoscale surface defects, improves surface roughness, makes it possible to quickly remove materials at nanoscale by increasing the material removal rate (MRR). Under high current density, where the electrochemical relatively reaction is active, value of the current is increased when ultrasonic vibration is added.

Conventional antimicrobial susceptibility tests (ASTs) are very time consuming. Thus, we developed a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for rapidly determining the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin-G in an animal-infection model. This technique will be able to detect those resistant strains whose resistance mechanism specifically controlled by penicillinase. The resistance status of S. aureus against penicillin-G was determined by conventional AST. Cultured S. aureus cells were inoculated to chicken for developing bacteraemia. The solution of penicillin-G was intravenously administered (10 mg/kg b.w.) to chickens just after infection detection. Blood samples were collected at different intervals after drug administration. The concentration of active penicillin-G and its metabolites were determined from the bacteria-free blood supernatant by utilizing the LC-MS/MS method. Evidence of infection in chicken was observed within 5 h of bacterial inoculation. The penicillinase enzyme generated by S. aureus transforms the active penicillin-G to an inactive metabolite by hydrolysis, which is evident by the mass shift from 335.10600 to 353.11579 Da as quantified using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF/MS). The signal intensity of inactive/hydrolysed penicillin-G is several-fold greater than that of the active penicillin-G in the blood sample of chicken infected with resistant strain and treated with penicillin-G. The antimicrobial resistance index (ARI) value of resistant S. aureus strain was more than 1, demonstrating the penicillin-G-resistance pattern of that strain.

High net primary productivity (NPP) and the annual variation in seasonal ice cover make the Amundsen Sea coastal polynya an ideal site in which to examine how zooplankton behavior responds to climate fluctuations. Our observations show that the timing of the seasonal vertical migration and abundance of zooplankton in the seasonally varying sea ice is correlated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Zooplankton in this region migrate seasonally and overwinter at depth, returning to the surface in spring. During +SAM/La Ni\u00f1a periods, the at-depth overwintering period is shorter compared to -SAM/El Ni\u00f1o periods, and return to the surface layers starts earlier in the year.

So far, the antisymmetric exchange interaction has been found to be rather short ranged and limited to a single magnetic layer.

A\u03b2 is derived from amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, A\u03b2PP is cleaved by \u03b1-secretase and \u03b3-secretase at the plasma membrane, excluding A\u03b2 production. Alternatively, A\u03b2PP in the plasma membrane is internalized via endocytosis, and delivered to early endosomes and lysosomes, where it is cleaved by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Recent studies have shown that insulin in the periphery crosses the blood-brain barrier, and plays important roles in the brain. Furthermore, impaired insulin signaling has been linked to the progression of AD, and intranasal insulin administration improves memory impairments and cognition. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of insulin treatment remain largely unknown. To investigate the effects of insulin on A\u03b2PP processing, we tested the effects of insulin on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing A\u03b2PP, and cultured rat cortical neurons. We found that insulin increased the level of cell surface A\u03b2PP, decreasing the endocytosis rate of A\u03b2PP. Insulin reduced A\u03b2 generation through upregulation of A\u03b2PP O-GlcNAcylation via Akt insulin signaling. Our present data suggest that insulin affects A\u03b2 production by regulating A\u03b2PP processing through A\u03b2PP O-GlcNAcylation.

Since cholesterol has been implicated in regulating A\u03b2 production, we investigated whether the FAD PS1-associated cholesterol elevation could influence APP processing. We found that in CHO cells stably expressing FAD-associated PS1 \u0394E9, total cholesterol levels are elevated compared to cells expressing wild-type PS1. We also found that localization of APP in cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts is substantially increased in the mutant cells.

We recently reported that Aurkb/PP1-mediated Oct4 resetting is important to cell cycle maintenance and pluripotency in mouse ESCs (mESCs). In this study, we show that Cdk1 is an upstream regulator of the Oct4 phosphorylation state during cell cycle progression, and it coordinates the chromatin associated state of Oct4 for pluripotency-related gene expression within the cell cycle. Upon entry into mitosis, Aurkb in the chromosome passenger complex becomes fully activated and PP1 activity is inhibited downstream of Cdk1 activation, leading to sustaining Oct4(S229) phosphorylation and dissociation of Oct4 from chromatin during the mitotic phase. Cdk1 inhibition at the mitotic phase abnormally results in Oct4 dephosphorylation, chromosome decondensation and chromatin association of Oct4, even in replicated chromosome.

Ctbp2 is revealed as a key factor involved in determining cell fate decisions by regulating the epigenetic state in active embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 have different roles remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that Ctbp isoform abundance is important for mouse embryonic ESCs (mESCs) to exit from pluripotency. Temporal expression patterns of Ctbp isoforms were quite different; Ctbp2 is more highly expressed in mESCs and decreases during differentiation, while Ctbp1 is constantly expressed at a lower level. Ctbp2 knockdown, but not Ctbp1 knockdown, in mESCs resulted in impaired exit from pluripotency. Interestingly, Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 overexpression in Ctbp2-knockdown mESCs leads to exiting from pluripotency in a manner similar to that of wild-type mESCs. Quantification of Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 revealed that differentiation ability correlates with abundance of Ctbp isoform in undifferentiated mESCs, suggesting that a sufficient amount of Ctbp isoform is a prerequisite for exiting from pluripotency. The results support the contention that 2 redundant Ctbp isoforms regulate elaborate differentiation via temporally distinctive regulatory patterns in mESCs.-Suh, M. Y., Kim, T.

However, the underlying mechanisms that link transcription factors to exit from pluripotency are yet to be identified. In this study, we show that the Ctbp2-interacting zinc finger proteins, Zfp217 and Zfp516, function as linkers for the chromatin regulators during ESC differentiation. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-outs of both Zfp217 and Zfp516 in ESCs prevent the exit from pluripotency. Both zinc finger proteins regulate the Ctbp2-mediated recruitment of the NuRD complex and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to active ESC genes, subsequently switching the H3K27ac to H3K27me3 during ESC differentiation for active gene silencing.

Although bulk TMDs materials have an indirect bandgap, an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition is observed in monolayers of TMDs (MoS2, WSe2, and MoSe2). Optical properties of TMD films can be improved by the introduction of structural defects.

ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) SBA-15 supports with different morphologies were prepared by different synthetic methods to investigate the effect of the characteristics of the morphology of OMS on the ethylene dimerization outcomes. After additions of Ni and Al species into the SBA-15 support, a dimerization reaction of ethylene was performed using a fixed-bed reactor. Rod-type Ni-Al-SBA-15 with a small micron size showed better catalytic performance compared to those of the other catalysts. From these catalytic results, the particle size and morphology of a SBA-15 support critically influenced the catalytic activities and lifetimes of the dimerization catalysts. The optimum reaction pathway in the Ni-Al-SBA-15 catalyst enhanced the overall catalytic performance due to the suppression of the further oligomerization of ethylene and butenes. Moreover, ethylene dimerization was investigated over the rod-type Ni-Al-SBA-15 catalyst to discover an optimum reaction condition.

Hence, maintaining the appropriate level of \u03b2-catenin is important for the decision to commit to the appropriate lineage. However, how \u03b2-catenin links to core transcription factors in ESCs remains elusive. C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) in Drosophila is essential for Wnt-mediated target gene expression. In addition, Ctbp acts as an antagonist of \u03b2-catenin/TCF activation in mammals. Recently, Ctbp2, a core Oct4-binding protein in ESCs, has been reported to play a key role in ESC pluripotency. However, the significance of the connection between Ctbp2 and \u03b2-catenin with regard to ESC pluripotency remains elusive.

Ctbp2 knockdown leads to stabilization of \u03b2-catenin, which then interacts with core pluripotency-maintaining factors that are occupied by Ctbp2, leading to incomplete exit from pluripotency.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression, resulting in livestock phenotypes such as disease resistance, milk production, and reproduction. We classified Berkshire pigs into two groups according to litter size and estimated breeding value: smaller (SLG) and larger (LLG) litter size groups. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression were analyzed using placenta genomic DNA and RNA to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with litter size. The methylation levels of CpG dinucleotides in different genomic regions were noticeably different between the groups, while global methylation pattern was similar, and excluding intergenic regions they were found the most frequently in gene body regions. Next, we analyzed RNA-Seq data to identify DEGs between the SLG and LLG groups. A total of 1591 DEGs were identified: 567 were downregulated and 1024 were upregulated in LLG compared to SLG. To identify genes that simultaneously exhibited changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, we integrated and analyzed the data from bisulfite-Seq and RNA-Seq. Nine DEGs positioned in DMRs were found. The expression of only three of these genes (PRKG2, CLCA4, and PCK1) was verified by RT-qPCR.

"Abstract": "Permanent dyeing of gray hair has become an increasingly active area in the cosmetics industry because of the increasingly aging population in developed countries. So far, p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and related diamine-based monomeric compounds have been widely used for the dyeing processes, but toxicological studies have revealed such compounds to be carcinogenic and allergenic. Here, we for the first time demonstrated that polydopamine, a mimic of human eumelanin, gives rise within a commercially acceptable period of time (i.e., 1 h) to deep black colors (i.e., natural Asian hair colors) in human keratin hairs in the presence of ferrous ions. The dyed hairs showed excellent resistance to conventional detergents, and the detailed color was readily varied by changing the kind of metal ion used. SEM images and FT-IR-ATR spectra suggested that the extent of polydopamine aggregation was crucial for the dyeing efficiency. High-resolution (15 T) FT-ICR mass spectrometry performed on the products detached from hairs with either 0.1 N HCl or NaOH indicated that similar polydopamine products were recruited into the hair matrices whether in the presence or absence of metal-based chelating. Polydopamine chains were determined using EPR and ICP-OES to use chelation of ferrous ions to self-assemble as well as to bind keratin surfaces in the dyeing conditions. Also, mice subjected to skin toxicity tests showed much greater viability and much less hair loss with our dyeing agents than with PPD. In conclusion, this study showed that a safe eumelanin mimic may be used to permanently dye gray hair, and showed three kinds of deposition mechanisms (i.e., innate binding ability of polydopamine, metal-assisted self-assembly of polydopamine, and metal-related bridging between keratin surface and polydopamine) to be involved.", "Keywords": ["permanent hair dyeing", "polydopamine", "polyphenol\u2212metal complex", "toxicity"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyung Min", "Last Name": "Im", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Food Science & Technology, \u2021Division of Applied Life Science (BK21Plus), and \u00a7Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52727, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae-Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Food Science & Technology, Division of Applied Life Science (BK21Plus), and \u00a7Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52727, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jong-Rok", "Last Name": "Jeon", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Food Science & Technology, Division of Applied Life Science (BK21Plus), and Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52727, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "PubDate": "2017Apr10"}, {"PMID": "28346218", "Title": "Wafer-scale production of highly uniform two-dimensional MoS2 by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.", "Abstract": "Semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly extremely thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films, are attracting considerable attention from academia and industry owing to their distinctive optical and electrical properties.

However, the variability of the ocean forcing of PIG has been poorly constrained due to a lack of multi-year observations. Here we show, using a unique record close to the Pine Island Ice Shelf (PIIS), that there is considerable oceanic variability at seasonal and interannual timescales, including a pronounced cold period from October 2011 to May 2013. This variability can be largely explained by two processes: cumulative ocean surface heat fluxes and sea ice formation close to PIIS; and interannual reversals in ocean currents and associated heat transport within Pine Island Bay, driven by a combination of local and remote forcing.

Here we demonstrate that fungal laccase-catalyzed oxidations can transform naturally occurring phenols into plant fertilizers with properties very similar to those of commercial humic acids. Treatments of Arabidopsis thaliana with highly cross-linked polyphenolic products obtained from a mixture of catechol and vanillic acid were able to enhance the germination and salt tolerance of this plant. These results revealed that humic-like organic fertilizers can be produced via in vitro enzymatic oxidation reactions. In particular, the root elongation pattern resulting from the laccase products was comparable to that resulting from an auxin-like compound. A detailed structural comparison of the phenol variants and commercial humic acids revealed their similarities and differences. Analyses based on SEM, EFM, ERP, and zeta-potential measurement showed that they both formed globular granules bearing various hydrophilic/polar groups in aqueous and solid conditions. Solid-phase 13C NMR, FT-IR-ATR, and elemental analyses showed that more nitrogen-based functional and aliphatic groups were present in the commercial humic acids. Significant differences were also identifiable with respect to particle size and specific surface area. High-resolution (15 T) FT-ICR mass spectrometry-based van Krevelen diagrams showed the compositional features of the variants to be a subset of those of the humic acids.

This difficulty disrupts the management of infections and exacerbates the development of antimicrobial resistance. Generally, antimicrobial resistance involves the chemical modification of an antimicrobial compound to an inactive form by an enzyme released by bacteria. This modification causes a structural change and is followed by a characteristic mass shift of the antimicrobials. Using this mechanism, we developed a new liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to rapidly determine the degree of resistance of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium), Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus to amoxicillin, ampicillin, and penicillin G, respectively. This method was successfully applied to 20 bacterial isolates from Korean slaughterhouses and farms. There were 18-Da mass shifts in resistant strains compared with susceptible strains of Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli, and S. aureus, and the intensities of the hydrolyzed penicillin mass spectra were much higher in resistant strains than those in susceptible strains, which together indicate the reliability of this method. A comparison of the mass spectrometry-derived results with that from conventional ASTs revealed an identical classification of the tested bacteria according to sensitivity and resistance. Notably, this assay method requires only 2\u00a0h for determining the susceptibility status of a strain. This newly developed method is able to determine the extent of antimicrobial resistance qualitatively and quantitatively within a very short time and could be used to replace conventional AST methods.

The goal of this study was to determine whether protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) A6 regulates migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells and the associated factors. METHODS U87MG cells were treated with either PDIA6 or ADAM17 small interfering RNA (siRNA) fragments or with both types of siRNA fragments, and expression was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Migration and invasion were assessed using a wound-healing assay, a Matrigel assay, and an organotypic culture system. After the U87MG cells were treated with siRNAs and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), membrane Type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), integrin, phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), and phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) was detected by Western blotting and zymography. RESULTS U87MG cell migration and invasion increased significantly after inhibition of PDIA6. The MMP-2 activation ratio and ADAM17 activity (as a sheddase of the proligand) increased, and expression of pEGFR, pFAK, integrin \u03b15\u03b23, and MT1-MMP was induced, compared with control levels. Furthermore, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGFR signaling ligand) was highly expressed in PDIA6-knockdown cells. After siPDIA6-transfected U87MG cells were treated with EGFR signaling inhibitors, expression of pFAK, MMP-2, and MT1-MMP decreased and invasion decreased significantly. Simultaneous double-knockdown of PDIA6 and ADAM17 reduced pEGFR and pFAK expression, compared with control levels. CONCLUSIONS The authors propose that inhibiting PDIA6 could transduce EGFR signaling by activating and inducing ADAM17 during migration and invasion of U87MG glioblastoma cells. The results of this study suggest that PDIA6 is an important component of EGFR-mediated migration and invasion of U87MG cells.

Recent studies have reported the increased number of IL-22 producing T cells in patients with autoimmune noninfectious uveitis; however, the correlation between IL-22 and uveitis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the specific role of IL-22 and its receptor in the pathogenesis of uveitis. Serum concentration of IL-22 was significantly increased in uveitis patients. IL-22R\u03b1 was expressed in the retinal pigment epithelial cell line, ARPE-19. To examine the effect of IL-22, ARPE-19 was treated with recombinant IL-22. The proliferation of ARPE-19 and the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 from ARPE-19 were clearly elevated. IL-22 induced MCP-1 which facilitated the migration of inflammatory cells. Moreover, IL-22 increased the IL-22R\u03b1 expression in ARPE-19 through the activation of PI3K/Akt. Experimental animal models of uveitis induced by interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein 1-20 (IRBP1-20) exhibited elevation of hyperplasia RPE and IL-22 production. When CD4+ T cells from the uveitis patients were stimulated with IRBP1-20, the production of IL-22 definitely increased. In addition, we examine the regulatory role of cysteamine, which has an anti-inflammatory role in the cornea, in uveitis through the down-regulation of IL-22R\u03b1 expression. Cysteamine effectively suppressed the IRBP1-20-induced IL-22R\u03b1 expression and prevented the development of IRBP1-20-induced uveitis in the experimental animal model. These finding suggest that IL-22 and its receptor have a crucial role in the development and pathogenesis of uveitis by facilitating inflammatory cell infiltration, and that cysteamine may be a useful therapeutic drug in treating uveitis by down-regulating IL-22R\u03b1 expression in RPE.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Case-Control Studies", "Cell Line", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Chemokine CCL2", "Cysteamine", "Down-Regulation", "Feedback, Physiological", "Female", "Humans", "Hyperplasia", "Interleukins", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Receptors, Interleukin", "Recombinant Proteins", "Uveitis", "Interleukin-22"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yejin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yun Seong", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Eui Man", "Last Name": "Jeong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Dong-Sup", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "In-Gyu", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hum", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Young-Il", "Last Name": "Hwang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Wang Jae", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hyeong Gon", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jae Seung", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27106591", "Title": "A biological process effective for the conversion of CO-containing industrial waste gas to acetate.", "Abstract": "Acetogens have often been observed to be inhibited by CO above an inhibition threshold concentration.

Improved reproduction has thus been achieved by elucidating the molecular functions of genes associated with fecundity. In the present study, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) via transcriptomic analysis using RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) in Berkshire pig placentas from larger (LLG, mean litter size >12) and smaller (SLG, mean litter size < 6.5) litter size groups. In total 588 DEGs were identified (p < 0.05, > 1.5-fold change), of which 98 were upregulated, while 490 were downregulated in the LLG compared with the SLG. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was also performed. We concluded that 129 of the 588 DEGs were closely related to litter size according to reproduction related genes selected based on previous reports, as 110 genes were downregulated and 19 upregulated in the LLG compared with the SLG. RT-qPCR utilizing specific primers targeting the early growth response 2 (EGR2), pheromaxein c subunit (PHEROC) and endothelial lipase (LIPG) genes showed high accordance with RNA-Seq results. Furthermore, we investigated the upstream regulators of these three genes in the placenta. We found that WNT9B, a Wnt signaling pathway molecule, and IL-6, known inducers of EGR2 and LIPG, respectively, were significantly increased in LLG compared with SLG. We believe that the induction of IL-6 and LIPG may play an important role in increasing nutrition supply through the placenta from the sow to the piglet during gestation.

In the present study, we examined whether orexin-A modulates primary afferent fiber-mediated or spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission using transverse spinal cord slices with attached dorsal root. Bath-application of orexin-A (100nM) reduced the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by electrical stimulation of A\u03b4- or C-primary afferent fibers. The magnitude of reduction was much larger for EPSCs evoked by polysynaptic C-fibers than polysynaptic A\u03b4-fibers, whereas it was similar in EPSCs evoked by monosynaptic A\u03b4- or C-fibers. SB674042, an orexin-1 receptor antagonist, but not EMPA, an orexin-2 receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited the orexin-A-induced reduction in EPSC amplitude from mono- or polysynaptic A\u03b4-fibers, as well as from mono- or polysynaptic C-fibers. Furthermore, orexin-A significantly increased the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs but not the amplitude. This increase was almost completely blocked by both SB674042 and EMPA.

Autophagy digests intracellular components, recycling material subsequently used for new protein synthesis. The Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-permeable transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channel underlies the constitutive Ca(2+) influx in some cells. Since autophagy is regulated by cytosolic Ca(2+) level, we set out to determine whether Ca(2+) influx through the TRPM7 channel regulates basal autophagy. When TRPM7 channel expression was induced from HEK293 cells in a nutrient-rich condition, LC3-II level increased indicating the increased level of basal autophagy. The effect of TRPM7 channel on basal autophagy was via Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase \u03b2, and AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, the level of basal autophagy was decreased when the endogenous TRPM7 channel in SH-SY5Y cells was down-regulated using short hairpin RNA. Similarly, an inhibitor for TRPM7 channel decreased the level of basal autophagy. In addition, the inhibitory effect of channel inhibitor on basal autophagy was reversed by increasing extracellular Ca(2+)concentration, suggesting that Ca(2+) influx through TRPM7 channel directly links to basal autophagy.

Due to its repeated use and high environmental residual property, CHL is frequently passed into aquatic environments by runoff. Consequently, there may be an adverse effect on aquatic vertebrate animals, including fish. Therefore, in this study, we assessed how CHL affected Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). The acute toxicity of CHL in adult fish after 96\u00a0h of exposure was determined to be 212.50, 266.79, and 412.28\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L(-1) (LC25, LC50, and LC95, respectively). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and carboxylesterase (CE) activities were obtained from the livers of dead or surviving fish, and the results showed 4.8-fold lower, 4.5-fold higher, and 18.6-fold lower activities for the AChE, GST, and CE, respectively, for 64-h exposure at a concentration of 400\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L(-1) of CHL. In the embryo toxicity test, curved spines were observed in embryos that were exposed to CHL for 48\u00a0h in a concentration-dependent manner. With identification of biomarkers for CHL in the fish, two protein peaks, 5550.86 and 5639.79 m/z, were found to be upregulated. These two proteins can be used as protein biomarkers for CHL contamination in aquatic systems. A phosphatidyl choline with an m/z ratio of 556.32 dramatically decreased after CHL exposure in the fish; thus, it may be considered as a lipid biomarker for CHL. It is assumed as the first report to identify a phospholipid biomarker using a lipidomics approach in fish toxicology.

However, how this choreographed epigenetic remodeling at active embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes occurs during differentiation is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that C-terminal binding protein 2 (Ctbp2) regulates nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD)-mediated deacetylation of H3K27 and facilitates recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 in active ESC genes for exit from pluripotency during differentiation. By genomewide analysis, we found that Ctbp2 resides in active ESC genes and co-occupies regions with ESC CTFs in undifferentiated ESCs. Furthermore, ablation of Ctbp2 effects inappropriate gene silencing in ESCs by sustaining high levels of H3K27ac and impeding H3K27me3 in active ESC genes, thereby sustaining ESC maintenance during differentiation. Thus, Ctbp2 preoccupies regions in active genes with the NuRD complex in undifferentiated ESCs that are directed toward H3K27me3 by PRC2 to induce stable silencing, which is pivotal for natural

We examined EPHX1 SNPs to analyze effect on increased expression of EPHX1 gene in Berkshire liver by total of 192 pigs of a pure Berkshire line (males\u00a0=\u00a097; females\u00a0=\u00a095).

The 70% ethanol extract showed more efficacy than the water extract. Pretreatment of the artery with L-NAME (100 \u00b5M), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, resulted in a significant reduction in the relaxation induced by PF extract. In addition, ODQ (10 \u00b5M), a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, also significantly reduced the effects of PF extracts. Hesperidin, a flavonoid present in PF, induced very weak relaxation of the porcine coronary artery at a high concentration (100 \u00b5M), while its aglycone, hesperetin, demonstrated a dose-dependent relaxation.

Drug development efforts for AD have been encumbered by largely unsuccessful clinical trials in the last decade. Drug repositioning, a process of discovering a new therapeutic use for existing drugs or drug candidates, is an attractive and timely drug development strategy especially for AD. Compared with traditional de novo drug development, time and cost are reduced as the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of most repositioning candidates have already been determined. A majority of drug repositioning efforts for AD have been based on positive clinical or epidemiological observations or in vivo efficacy found in mouse models of AD. More systematic, multidisciplinary approaches will further facilitate drug repositioning for AD. Some experimental approaches include unbiased phenotypic screening using the library of available drug collections in physiologically relevant model systems (e.g. stem cell-derived neurons or glial cells), computational prediction and selection approaches that leverage the accumulating data resulting from RNA expression profiles, and genome-wide association studies.

The regulatory system is composed of CorQ with a 4-vinyl reductase domain and CorR with a DNA-binding domain of the LysR-type transcriptional regulator family in close proximity to the CO dehydrogenase (CODH) gene cluster. Homologous genes of the CorQR pair were also found in the genomes of Thermococcus species and \"Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum\" OPF8. In-frame deletion of either corQ or corR caused a severe impairment in CO-dependent growth and H2 production. When corQ and corR deletion mutants were complemented by introducing the corQR genes under the control of a strong promoter, the mRNA and protein levels of the CODH gene were significantly increased in a \u0394CorR strain complemented with integrated corQR (\u0394CorR/corQR(\u2191)) compared with those in the wild-type strain. In addition, the \u0394CorR/corQR(\u2191) strain exhibited a much higher H2 production rate (5.8-fold) than the wild-type strain in a bioreactor culture. The H2 production rate (191.9 mmol liter(-1) h(-1)) and the specific H2 production rate (249.6 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) of this strain were extremely high compared with those of CO-dependent H2-producing prokaryotes reported so far.

This is called non-amyloidogenic pathway since it precludes the production of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), the main culprit of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alternatively, once A\u03b2PP undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis, it can be sequentially cleaved by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase at endosomes, producing A\u03b2 (amyloidogenic pathway). \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) can be attached to serine/threonine residues of the target proteins. This novel type of O-linked glycosylation is called O-GlcNAcylation mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). The removal of GlcNAc is mediated by O-GlcNAcase (OGN). Recently, it is shown that O-GlcNAcylation of A\u03b2PP increases the non-amyloidogenic pathway. To investigate the regulatory role for O-GlcNAcylation in A\u03b2PP processing, we first tested the effects of inhibitor for OGN, PUGNAc, on A\u03b2PP metabolism in HeLa cells stably transfected with Swedish mutant form of A\u03b2PP. Increasing O-GlcNAcylated A\u03b2PP level increased \u03b1-secretase product while decreased \u03b2-secretase products. We found that PUGNAc increased the trafficking rate of A\u03b2PP from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, and selectively decreased the endocytosis rate of A\u03b2PP. These events may contribute to the increased A\u03b2PP level in the plasma membrane by PUGNAc. Inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis prevented the effect of PUGNAc on A\u03b2, suggesting that the effect of PUGNAc was mainly mediated by decreasing A\u03b2PP endocytosis. These results strongly indicate that O-GlcNAcylation promotes the plasma membrane localization of A\u03b2PP, which enhances the non-amyloidogenic processing of A\u03b2PP. Thus, O-GlcNAcylation of A\u03b2PP can be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "O-GlcNAcylation", "amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor", "endocytosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylglucosamine", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cell Membrane", "Clathrin", "Cricetulus", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Endocytosis", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Mutation", "N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases", "Oximes", "Phenylcarbamates", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein Transport", "Time Factors", "Transfection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yoon Sun", "Last Name": "Chun", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Yurim", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Hyun Geun", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae-Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hyun Ok", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) Gangneung Institute, Gangneung, Gangwon-do, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Myoung Kyu", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sungkwon", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "25136147", "Title": "Intraperitoneal infusion of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells prevents experimental autoimmune uveitis in mice.", "Abstract": "Autoimmune uveitis is one of the leading causes of blindness.

An intraperitoneal injection of hMSCs at the time of immunization protected the retina from damage and suppressed the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the eye.

Although pathogenesis of BD is unclear, researches have revealed that immunological aberrations may be the cornerstone of BD development. General hypothesis of BD pathogenesis is that inflammatory response is initiated by infectious agents or autoantigens in patients with predisposing genetic factors and perpetuated by both innate and acquired immunity. In addition, a network of immune mediators plays a substantial role in the inflammatory cascade. Recently, we found that the immunopathogenesis of BU is distinct from other autoimmune uveitides regarding intraocular effector cell profiles, maturation markers of dendritic cells, and the cytokine/chemokine environment.

The authors investigated and analyzed subsidence and its effect on clinical and radiologic parameters after cervical reconstruction using a TMC for degenerative cervical disease. Thirty consecutive patients with degenerative cervical spine disorders underwent anterior cervical corpectomy followed by reconstruction with TMC. Twenty-four patients underwent a single-level corpectomy, and six patients underwent a two-level corpectomy. Clinical outcomes were assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score and the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Fusion status, anterior and posterior subsidence of the TMC, segmental angle (SA) and cervical sagittal angle (CSA) were assessed by lateral and flexion-extension radiographs of the neck. The mean follow-up period was 27.6 months (range, 24 to 49 months). The VAS, NDI and JOA scores were all significantly improved at the last follow-up. No instances of radiolucency or motion-related pseudoarthrosis were detected on radiographic analysis, yielding a fusion rate of 100%. Subsidence occurred in 28 of 30 patients (93.3%). The average anterior subsidence of the cage was 1.4 \u00b1 0.9 mm, and the average posterior subsidence was 2.9 \u00b1 1.2 mm. The SA and CSA at the final follow-up were significantly increased toward a lordotic angle. Anterior cervical reconstruction using TMC and plating in patients with cervical degenerative disease provides good clinical and radiologic outcomes.

To improve the understanding of microbial genomes and consequently of microbial processes it will be crucial to assign a function to this \"genomic dark matter.\" Due to the urgent need for additional carbohydrate-active enzymes for improved production of transportation fuels from lignocellulosic biomass, we screened the genomes of more than 5,500 microorganisms for hypothetical proteins that are located in the proximity of already known cellulases. We identified, synthesized and expressed a total of 17 putative cellulase genes with insufficient sequence similarity to currently known cellulases to be identified as such using traditional sequence annotation techniques that rely on significant sequence similarity. The recombinant proteins of the newly identified putative cellulases were subjected to enzymatic activity assays to verify their hydrolytic activity towards cellulose and lignocellulosic biomass. Eleven (65%) of the tested enzymes had significant activity towards at least one of the substrates. This high success rate highlights that a gene context-based approach can be used to assign function to genes that are otherwise categorized as \"genomic dark matter\" and to identify biomass-degrading enzymes that have little sequence similarity to already known cellulases.

Decreased visual acuity as well as impaired contrast sensitivity and color vision is known to be related to the appearance of VH in PD. However, these functional studies were also affected by cognitive or cortical dysfunctions; thus, structural imaging can more reliably reflect visual afferent dysfunction. Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans have been used to investigate the structural changes in the retina in vivo. Segmental measures of the vertical retinal layers by OCT provide structural evidence for retinal dopamine loss and foveal dysfunction in PD. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning in PD was shown to be significantly associated with VH and correlated with PD duration and severity.

We describe a case of successful rechallenge of imatinib in a patient with imatinib-induced interstitial pneumonitis and CML without a recurrence of the underlying disease after 3 months of follow-up.", "Keywords": ["Imatinib", "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive", "Lung Diseases, Interstitial"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seong Woo", "Last Name": "Go", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Boo Kyeong", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Sung Hak", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae-Jung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Joo Yeon", "Last Name": "Huh", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jong Min", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Jick Hwan", "Last Name": "Hah", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Dong Whi", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Min Jung", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Tae Wan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}, {"First Name": "Ji Young", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "Journal": "Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}, {"PMID": "24337253", "Title": "Comparison of CO-dependent H\u2082 production with strong promoters in Thermococcus onnurineus NA1.", "Abstract": "To overproduce biotechnologically valuable products, the expression level of target genes has been modulated by using strong promoters. In a hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus NA1, two promoters, P(TN0413) and P(TN0157), which drive expression of the genes encoding the S-layer protein and glutamate dehydrogenase were inserted in front of a gene cluster encoding a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, a hydrogenase and a Na\u207a/H\u207a antiporter. Two promoters exhibited strong activity by increasing the transcription and translation levels of the gene cluster in the mutant strains by 2.5- to 49-folds and 1.4- to 3.3-folds, respectively, than the native promoter in the wild-type strain. While KS0413 with P(TN0413) promoter exhibited 2.7 to 4.7 times higher transcript level than KS0157 with P(TN0157) promoter, the levels of proteins were a little different between them. The biomass concentrations and H\u2082 production rates of two mutants were 2- to 3-fold higher than those of the wild-type strain in a bioreactor where CO was supplied at a flow rate of 120 ml min\u207b\u00b9. Two mutants showed differential response to the higher CO flow rate, 240 ml min\u207b\u00b9, in terms of growth pattern and product formation, indicating two promoters were regulated by culture conditions.

Recent work implicates a lipid critical for neuronal function, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], in A\u03b2-induced synaptic and behavioral impairments. Synaptojanin 1 (Synj1), a lipid phosphatase mediating the breakdown of PI(4,5)P2, has been shown to play a role in synaptic vesicle recycling and receptor trafficking in neurons. Heterozygous deletion of Synj1 protected neurons from A\u03b2-induced synaptic loss and restored learning and memory in a mouse model of AD. Thus, inhibition of Synj1 may ameliorate A\u03b2-associated impairments, suggesting Synj1 as a potential therapeutic target.

Even though a number of cholesterol modulating agents have been shown to affect A\u03b2 generation, the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD is not clear yet. Recently, we have shown that increased membrane cholesterol levels downregulates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) via activation of phospholipase C (PLC). In this study, we tested whether membrane cholesterol levels may affect the A\u03b242 production via changing PIP2 levels. Increasing membrane cholesterol levels decreased PIP2 and increased secreted A\u03b242. Supplying PIP2, by using a PIP2-carrier system, blocked the effect of cholesterol on A\u03b242. We also found that cholesterol increased the expressions of \u03b21 and \u03b23 PLC isoforms (PLC\u03b21, PLC\u03b23). Silencing the expression of PLC\u03b21 prevented the effects of cholesterol on PIP2 levels as well as on A\u03b242 production, suggesting that increased membrane cholesterol levels increased secreted A\u03b242 by downregulating PIP2 via enhancing the expression of PLC\u03b21.
