[{"PMID": "38805330", "Title": "Circular Clustering With Polar Coordinate Reconstruction.", "Abstract": "There is a growing interest in characterizing circular data found in biological systems. Such data are wide-ranging and varied, from the signal phase in neural recordings to nucleotide sequences in round genomes. Traditional clustering algorithms are often inadequate due to their limited ability to distinguish differences in the periodic component \u03b8. Current clustering schemes for polar coordinate systems have limitations, such as being only angle-focused or lacking generality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new analysis framework that utilizes projections onto a cylindrical coordinate system to represent objects in a polar coordinate system optimally. Using the mathematical properties of circular data, we show that our approach always finds the correct clustering result within the reconstructed dataset, given sufficient periodic repetitions of the data. This framework is generally applicable and adaptable to most state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. We demonstrate on synthetic and real data that our method generates more appropriate and consistent clustering results than standard methods. In summary, our proposed analysis framework overcomes the limitations of existing polar coordinate-based clustering methods and provides an accurate and efficient way to cluster circular data. We provide the code as open-source on GitHub.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoxiao", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Sajda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics", "PubDate": "2024May28"}, {"PMID": "38798371", "Title": "Phase synchrony between prefrontal noradrenergic and cholinergic signals indexes inhibitory control.", "Abstract": "Inhibitory control is a critical executive function that allows animals to suppress their impulsive behavior in order to achieve certain goals or avoid punishment. We investigated norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) dynamics and population neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex during inhibitory control. Using fluorescent sensors to measure extracellular levels of NE and ACh, we simultaneously recorded the dynamics of prefrontal NE and ACh in mice performing an inhibitory control task. The prefrontal NE and ACh signals exhibited strong coherence at 0.4-0.8 Hz. Chemogenetic inhibition of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons that project to the basal forebrain region reduced inhibitory control performance to chance levels. However, this manipulation did not diminish the difference in NE/ACh signals between successful and failed trials; instead, it abolished the difference in NE-ACh phase synchrony between the successful and failed trials, indicating that NE-ACh phase synchrony is a task-relevant neuromodulatory feature. Chemogenetic inhibition of cholinergic neurons that project to the LC region did not impair the inhibitory control performance, nor did it abolish the difference in NE-ACh phase synchrony between successful or failed trials, further confirming the relevance of NE-ACh phase synchrony to inhibitory control. To understand the possible effect of NE-ACh synchrony on prefrontal population activity, we employed Neuropixels to record from the prefrontal cortex with and without inhibiting LC neurons that project to the basal forebrain during inhibitory control. The LC inhibition reduced the number of prefrontal neurons encoding inhibitory control. Demixed principal component analysis (dPCA) further revealed that population firing patterns representing inhibitory control were impaired by the LC inhibition. Disparities in NE-ACh phase synchrony relevant to inhibitory control occurred only in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the parietal cortex, somatosensory cortex, and the somatosensory thalamus. Taken together, these findings suggest that the LC modulates inhibitory control through its collective effect with cholinergic systems on population activity in the prefrontal cortex. Our results further revealed that NE-ACh phase synchrony is a critical neuromodulatory feature with important implications for cognitive control.", "Keywords": ["Locus coeruleus", "basal forebrain", "cholinergic system", "impulsivity", "inhibitory control", "noradrenergic system", "prefrontal cortex", "pupil"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuxiang Andy", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University ET 351, 500 W. 120 Street, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Yuhan", "Last Name": "Nong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University ET 351, 500 W. 120 Street, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Jiesi", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, School of Life Sciences Peking University."}, {"First Name": "Guochuan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, School of Life Sciences Peking University."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Sajda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University ET 351, 500 W. 120 Street, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Yulong", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, School of Life Sciences Peking University."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering Columbia University ET 351, 500 W. 120 Street, New York, NY 10027."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May17"}, {"PMID": "38106062", "Title": "Biomarkers predict the efficacy of closed-loop rTMS treatment for refractory depression.", "Abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive FDA-approved therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD), specifically for treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

When multitasking, we must dynamically reorient our attention between different tasks. Attention reorienting is thought to arise through interactions of physiological arousal and brain-wide network dynamics. In this study, we investigated the relationship between pupil-linked arousal and electroencephalography (EEG) brain dynamics in a multitask driving paradigm conducted in virtual reality. We hypothesized that there would be an interaction between arousal and EEG dynamics and that this interaction would correlate with multitasking performance.Approach. We collected EEG and eye tracking data while subjects drove a motorcycle through a simulated city environment, with the instructions to count the number of target images they observed while avoiding crashing into a lead vehicle. The paradigm required the subjects to continuously reorient their attention between the two tasks. Subjects performed the paradigm under two conditions, one more difficult than the other.Main results. We found that task difficulty did not strongly correlate with pupil-linked arousal, and overall task performance increased as arousal level increased. A single-trial analysis revealed several interesting relationships between pupil-linked arousal and task-relevant EEG dynamics. Employing exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, we found that higher pupil-linked arousal led to greater EEG oscillatory activity, especially in regions associated with the dorsal attention network and ventral attention network (VAN). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a relationship between EEG functional connectivity and pupil-linked arousal as a function of multitasking performance. Specifically, we found decreased functional connectivity between regions in the salience network (SN) and the VAN as pupil-linked arousal increased, suggesting that improved multitasking performance at high arousal levels may be due to a down-regulation in coupling between the VAN and the SN.

Multimodal data were used as input to 2D-3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Both for CNNs and experts, choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy were found to be important biomarkers for AMD. CNNs predict biomarkers with accuracy up to 90.2% (positive-predictive-value up to 75.8%).

However, our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this process is limited. Crucially, it remains elusive how different sensory representations interact in the formation of perceptual decisions. To answer these questions, we used an active sensing paradigm coupled with neuroimaging, multivariate analysis, and computational modeling to probe how the human brain processes multisensory information to make perceptual judgments. Participants of both sexes actively sensed to discriminate two texture stimuli using visual (V) or haptic (H) information or the two sensory cues together (VH). Crucially, information acquisition was under the participants' control, who could choose where to sample information from and for how long on each trial. To understand the neural underpinnings of this process, we first characterized where and when active sensory experience (movement patterns) is encoded in human brain activity (EEG) in the three sensory conditions. Then, to offer a neurocomputational account of active multisensory decision formation, we used these neural representations of active sensing to inform a drift diffusion model of decision-making behavior. This revealed a multisensory enhancement of the neural representation of active sensing, which led to faster and more accurate multisensory decisions. We then dissected the interactions between the V, H, and VH representations using a novel information-theoretic methodology. Ultimately, we identified a synergistic neural interaction between the two unisensory (V, H) representations over contralateral somatosensory and motor locations that predicted multisensory (VH) decision-making performance.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In real-world settings, perceptual decisions are made during active behaviors, such as crossing the road on a rainy night, and include information from different senses (e.g., car lights, slippery ground). Critically, it remains largely unknown how sensory evidence is combined and translated into perceptual decisions in such active scenarios. Here we address this knowledge gap. First, we show that the simultaneous exploration of information across senses (multi-sensing) enhances the neural encoding of active sensing movements. Second, the neural representation of active sensing modulates the evidence available for decision; and importantly, multi-sensing yields faster evidence accumulation. Finally, we identify a cross-modal interaction in the human brain that correlates with multisensory performance, constituting a putative neural mechanism for forging active multisensory perception.", "Keywords": ["EEG", "active sensing", "drift diffusion model", "multisensory processing", "partial information decomposition", "perceptual decision-making"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Decision Making", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ioannis", "Last Name": "Delis", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom i.delis@leeds.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Robin A A", "Last Name": "Ince", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Glasgow, G12 8QQ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Sajda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2022Mar16"}, {"PMID": "34937017", "Title": "Integrating neural and ocular attention reorienting signals in virtual reality.", "Abstract": "Objective.Reorienting is central to how humans direct attention to different stimuli in their environment. Previous studies typically employ well-controlled paradigms with limited eye and head movements to study the neural and physiological processes underlying attention reorienting. Here, we aim to better understand the relationship between gaze and attention reorienting using a naturalistic virtual reality (VR)-based target detection paradigm.Approach.Subjects were navigated through a city and instructed to count the number of targets that appeared on the street. Subjects performed the task in a fixed condition with no head movement and in a free condition where head movements were allowed. Electroencephalography (EEG), gaze and pupil data were collected. To investigate how neural and physiological reorienting signals are distributed across different gaze events, we used hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA) to identify EEG and pupil-based discriminating components. Mixed-effects general linear models (GLM) were used to determine the correlation between these discriminating components and the different gaze events time. HDCA was also used to combine EEG, pupil and dwell time signals to classify reorienting events.Main results.In both EEG and pupil, dwell time contributes most significantly to the reorienting signals. However, when dwell times were orthogonalized against other gaze events, the distributions of the reorienting signals were different across the two modalities, with EEG reorienting signals leading that of the pupil reorienting signals. We also found that the hybrid classifier that integrates EEG, pupil and dwell time features detects the reorienting signals in both the fixed (AUC\u2009=\u20090.79) and the free (AUC\u2009=\u20090.77) condition.Significance.We show that the neural and ocular reorienting signals are distributed differently across gaze events when a subject is immersed in VR, but nevertheless can be captured and integrated to classify target vs. distractor objects to which the human subject orients.", "Keywords": ["BCI", "EEG", "attention", "eyetracking"], "MeSH terms": ["Electroencephalography", "Eye", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Virtual Reality"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pawan", "Last Name": "Lapborisuth", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sharath", "Last Name": "Koorathota", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Sajda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "Journal of neural engineering", "PubDate": "2022Jan06"}, {"PMID": "34363958", "Title": "Spatiospectral brain networks reflective of improvisational experience.", "Abstract": "Musical improvisers are trained to categorize certain musical structures into functional classes, which is thought to facilitate improvisation.

Inter-network connectivity in the alpha band, for a time window leading up to the behavioural response, was strongly linked to improvisation experience, with the default mode network acting as a hub. Spatiospectral networks post response were substantially different between improvisers and classically trained musicians, with greater inter-network connectivity (specific to the alpha and beta bands) seen in improvisers whereas those with more classical training had largely reduced inter-network activity (mostly in the gamma band).

In human neuroimaging, for example, avalanches occurring during resting-state show scale-invariant dynamics, supporting the hypothesis that the brain operates near a critical point that enables long range spatial communication. In fact, it has been suggested that such scale-invariant dynamics, characterized by a power-law distribution in these avalanches, are universal in neural systems and emerge through a common mechanism. While the analysis of avalanches and subsequent criticality is increasingly seen as a framework for using complex systems theory to understand brain function, it is unclear how the framework would account for the omnipresent cognitive variability, whether across individuals or tasks. To address this, we analyzed avalanches in the EEG activity of healthy humans during rest as well as two distinct task conditions that varied in cognitive demands and produced behavioral measures unique to each individual. In both rest and task conditions we observed that avalanche dynamics demonstrate scale-invariant characteristics, but differ in their specific features, demonstrating individual variability. Using a new metric we call normalized engagement, which estimates the likelihood for a brain region to produce high-amplitude bursts, we also investigated regional features of avalanche dynamics. Normalized engagement showed not only the expected individual and task dependent variability, but also scale-specificity that correlated with individual behavior. Our results suggest that the study of avalanches in human brain activity provides a tool to assess cognitive variability. Our findings expand our understanding of avalanche features and are supportive of the emerging theoretical idea that the dynamics of an active human brain operate close to a critical-like region and not a singular critical-state.", "Keywords": ["Electroencephalography", "Emotional image viewing", "Neural avalanches", "Power-law", "Task-evoked functional reorganization"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Adult", "Brain", "Electroencephalography", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Rest"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kanika", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "Human Research and Engineering Directorate, US DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, USA; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

Problematic, however, is that pupil changes can be due to non-cognitive factors, for example luminance changes in the environment, accommodation and movement. In this paper we consider how by modeling the response of the pupil in real-world environments we can capture the non-cognitive related changes and remove these to extract a residual signal which is a better index of cognition and performance. Specifically, we utilize sequence measures such as fixation position, duration, saccades, and blink-related information as inputs to a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model for predicting subsequent pupil diameter. We build and evaluate the model for a task where subjects are watching educational videos and subsequently asked questions based on the content. Compared to commonly-used models for this task, the RNN had the lowest errors rates in predicting subsequent pupil dilation given sequence data. Most importantly was how the model output related to subjects' cognitive performance as assessed by a post-viewing test. Consistent with our hypothesis that the model captures non-cognitive pupil dynamics, we found (1) the model's root-mean square error was less for lower performing subjects than for those having better performance on the post-viewing test, (2) the residuals of the RNN (LSTM) model had the highest correlation with subject post-viewing test scores and (3) the residuals had the highest discriminability (assessed via area under the ROC curve, AUC) for classifying high and low test performers, compared to the true pupil size or the RNN model predictions.

In this study, we used machine learning techniques to decompose pupil-linked phasic arousal evoked by different components of information processing in rats performing a Go/No-Go perceptual decision-making task. We found that phasic arousal evoked by stimulus encoding was larger for the Go stimulus than the No-Go stimulus. For each session, the separation between distributions of phasic arousal evoked by the Go and by the No-Go stimulus was predictive of perceptual performance. The separation between distributions of decision-formation-evoked arousal on correct and incorrect trials was correlated with decision criterion but not perceptual performance. When a Go stimulus was presented, the action of go was primarily determined by the phasic arousal evoked by stimulus encoding. On the contrary, when a No-Go stimulus was presented, the action of go was determined by phasic arousal elicited by both stimulus encoding and decision formation.

In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): -200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at -200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement.

Secondly, we used the EEG single-trial variability to temporally identify brain regions modulated by the two sets of subject-wise bias parameters in the fMRI analysis.

Specifically, we use a brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses information in the EEG to generate a neurofeedback signal that dynamically adjusts an individual's arousal state when they are engaged in a boundary-avoidance task (BAT). The BAT is a demanding sensory-motor task paradigm that we implement as an aerial navigation task in virtual reality and which creates cognitive conditions that escalate arousal and quickly results in task failure (e.g., missing or crashing into the boundary). We demonstrate that task performance, measured as time and distance over which the subject can navigate before failure, is significantly increased when veridical neurofeedback is provided. Simultaneous measurements of pupil dilation and heart-rate variability show that the neurofeedback indeed reduces arousal.

In tactile perception, we often make decisions about an object/surface by actively exploring its shape/texture. Here we investigate the neural correlates of active tactile decision-making by simultaneously measuring electroencephalography (EEG) and finger kinematics while subjects interrogated a haptic surface to make perceptual judgments. Since sensorimotor behavior underlies decision formation in active sensing tasks, we hypothesized that the neural correlates of decision-related processes would be detectable by relating active sensing to neural activity. Novel brain-behavior correlation analysis revealed that three distinct EEG components, localizing to right-lateralized occipital cortex (LOC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and supplementary motor area (SMA), respectively, were coupled with active sensing as their activity significantly correlated with finger kinematics. To probe the functional role of these components, we fit their single-trial-couplings to decision-making performance using a hierarchical-drift-diffusion-model (HDDM), revealing that the LOC modulated the encoding of the tactile stimulus whereas the MFG predicted the rate of information integration towards a choice.

Specifically, high-level and perceptual regions must interact to balance pre-existing models of the environment with new incoming stimuli. Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG/fMRI) enables temporal characterization of brain-network interactions combined with improved anatomical localization of regional activity. In this paper, we use simultaneous EEG/fMRI and multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) analysis to characterize network relationships between constitute brain areas that reflect a subject's choice for a face versus nonface categorization task. Our simultaneous EEG and fMRI analysis on 21 human subjects (12 males, 9 females) identifies early perceptual and late frontal subsystems that are selective to the categorical choice of faces versus nonfaces. We analyze the interactions between these subsystems using an MDS in the space of the BOLD signal. Our main findings show that differences between face-choice and house-choice networks are seen in the network interactions between the early and late subsystems, and that the magnitude of the difference in network interaction positively correlates with the behavioral false-positive rate of face choices. We interpret this to reflect the role of saliency and expectations likely encoded in frontal \"late\" regions on perceptual processes occurring in \"early\" perceptual regions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our choices are affected by our biases. In visual perception and cognition such biases can be commonplace and quite curious-e.g., we see a human face when staring up at a cloud formation or down at a piece of toast at the breakfast table.

Advances in non-invasive neuroimaging target two capabilities; 1) increased spatial and temporal resolution of measured neural activity, and 2) innovative methodologies to extract brain-behavior relationships from evolving neuroimaging technology. We target the second. Our novel methodology integrated three neuroimaging methodologies and elucidated expertise-dependent differences in functional (fused EEG-fMRI) and structural (dMRI) brain networks for a perception-action coupling task. A set of baseball players and controls performed a Go/No-Go task designed to mimic the situation of hitting a baseball. In the functional analysis, our novel fusion methodology identifies 50ms windows with predictive EEG neural correlates of expertise and fuses these temporal windows with fMRI activity in a whole-brain 2mm voxel analysis, revealing time-localized correlations of expertise at a spatial scale of millimeters. The spatiotemporal cascade of brain activity reflecting expertise differences begins as early as 200ms after the pitch starts and lasting up to 700ms afterwards. Network differences are spatially localized to include motor and visual processing areas, providing evidence for differences in perception-action coupling between the groups. Furthermore, an analysis of structural connectivity revealed that the players have significantly more connections between cerebellar and left frontal/motor regions, and many of the functional activation differences between the groups are located within structurally defined network modules that differentiate expertise. In short, our novel method illustrates how multimodal neuroimaging can provide specific macro-scale insights into the functional and structural correlates of expertise development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jordan", "Last Name": "Muraskin", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Sherwin", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Human Research and Engineering Directorate, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, USA.

The technique is implemented via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) by temporally filtering the stimulus (encoding) and spatially filtering the neural responses (decoding) such that the resulting components are maximally correlated. In contrast to existing methods, this approach recovers multiple correlated stimulus-response pairs, and thus affords a richer, multidimensional analysis of neural representations. We first validated the technique's ability to recover multiple stimulus-driven components using electroencephalographic (EEG) data simulated with a finite element model of the head. We then applied the technique to real EEG responses to auditory and audiovisual narratives experienced identically across subjects, as well as uniquely experienced video game play. During narratives, both auditory and visual stimulus-response correlations (SRC) were modulated by attention and tracked inter-subject correlations. During video game play, SRC varied with game difficulty and the presence of a dual task. Interestingly, the strongest component extracted for visual and auditory features of film clips had nearly identical spatial distributions, suggesting that the predominant encephalographic response to naturalistic stimuli is supramodal.

Tasks that have intrinsic value for individuals are hypothesized to produce post-task resting state dynamics that promote learning. We measured simultaneous fMRI/EEG and DTI in Division-1 collegiate baseball players and compared to a group of controls, examining differences in both functional and structural connectivity. Participants performed a surrogate baseball pitch Go/No-Go task before a resting state scan, and we compared post-task resting state connectivity using a seed-based analysis from the supplementary motor area (SMA), an area whose activity discriminated players and controls in our previous results using this task. Although both groups were equally trained on the task, the experts showed differential activity in their post-task resting state consistent with motor learning. Specifically, we found (1) differences in bilateral SMA-L Insula functional connectivity between experts and controls that may reflect group differences in motor learning, (2) differences in BOLD-alpha oscillation correlations between groups suggests variability in modulatory attention in the post-task state, and (3) group differences between BOLD-beta oscillations that may indicate cognitive processing of motor inhibition. Structural connectivity analysis identified group differences in portions of the functionally derived network, suggesting that functional differences may also partially arise from variability in the underlying white matter pathways. Generally, we find that brain dynamics in the post-task resting state differ as a function of subject expertise and potentially result from differences in both functional and structural connectivity.

Two dimensions of decision making that substantially affect choice are the objective perceptual properties of the stimulus (e.g., salience) and its subjective value. Here we measure EEGs in human subjects to relate their feedback-evoked EEG responses to estimates of prediction error given a neurally derived expected value for each trial. Unlike in traditional reinforcement learning paradigms, in our experiment the reward itself is not probabilistic; rather, it is a fixed value, which, when combined with the variable stimulus salience, yields uncertainty in the choice. We find that feedback-evoked event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically those classically termed feedback-related negativity, are modulated by both the reward level and stimulus salience. Using single-trial analysis of the EEG, we show stimulus-locked EEG components reflecting perceived stimulus salience can be combined with the level of reward to create an estimate of expected reward. This expected reward is used to form a prediction error that correlates with the trial-by-trial variability of the feedback ERPs for negative, but not positive, feedback. This suggests that the valence of prediction error is more important than the valence of the actual feedback, since only positive rewards were delivered in the experiment (no penalty or loss). Finally, we show that these subjectively defined prediction errors are informative of the riskiness of the subject's choice on the subsequent trial. In summary, our work shows that neural correlates of stimulus salience interact with value information to yield neural representations of subjective expected reward. Significance statement: How we make perceptual decisions depends on sensory evidence and the value of our options. These two factors often interact to yield subjective decisions; i.e., individuals integrate sensory evidence and value to form their own estimates of expected reward. Here, we use electroencephelography to identify trial-by-trial neural activity of perceived stimulus salience, showing that this activity can be combined with the value of choice options to form a representation of expected reward. Our results provide insight into the neural processing governing the interaction between salience and value and the formation of subjective expected reward and prediction error.

We used an auditory oddball task with a data-driven approach to learn task-relevant projections of the EEG, for windows of data spanning the entire trial. We investigated linear and quadratic relationships between the evoked EEG along these projections and both prestimulus (baseline) and poststimulus (evoked dilation) pupil diameter measurements. We found that baseline pupil diameter correlates with early (175-200 ms) and late (350-400 ms) EEG component variability, suggesting a linear relationship between baseline (tonic) LC-NE activity and evoked EEG. We found no relationships between evoked EEG and evoked pupil dilation, which is often associated with evoked (phasic) LC activity. After regressing out reaction time (RT), the correlation between EEG variability and baseline pupil diameter remained, suggesting that such correlation is not explainable by RT variability. We also investigated the relationship between these pupil measures and prestimulus EEG alpha activity, which has been reported as a marker of attentional state, and found a negative linear relationship with evoked pupil dilation.

We focused on variability along task-relevant dimensions in the EEG for identical stimuli and then combined auditory and visual data at the subject level to spatially and temporally localize brain regions involved in endogenous attentional modulations.

These models are typically formulated to optimize an objective function that maximizes decoding accuracy. For decoding models trained on full-brain data, this can result in multiple models that yield the same classification accuracy, though some may be more reproducible than others--i.e. small changes to the training set may result in very different voxels being selected. This issue of reproducibility can be partially controlled by regularizing the decoding model. Regularization, along with the cross-validation used to estimate decoding accuracy, typically requires retraining many (often on the order of thousands) of related decoding models. In this paper we describe an approach that uses a combination of bootstrapping and permutation testing to construct both a measure of cross-validated prediction accuracy and model reproducibility of the learned brain maps. This requires re-training our classification method on many re-sampled versions of the fMRI data. Given the size of fMRI datasets, this is normally a time-consuming process. Our approach leverages an algorithm called fast simultaneous training of generalized linear models (FaSTGLZ) to create a family of classifiers in the space of accuracy vs. reproducibility. The convex hull of this family of classifiers can be used to identify a subset of Pareto optimal classifiers, with a single-optimal classifier selectable based on the relative cost of accuracy vs. reproducibility. We demonstrate our approach using full-brain analysis of elastic-net classifiers trained to discriminate stimulus type in an auditory and visual oddball event-related fMRI design.

For example, while listening to a piece of Western-style music, an anomalous key change or an out-of-key pitch is readily apparent, even to the non-musician. In this paper we investigate differences between musical experts and non-experts during musical anomaly detection. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalograms (EEG) of five expert cello players and five non-musicians while they listened to excerpts of J.S. Bach's Prelude from Cello Suite No. 1. All subjects were familiar with the piece, though experts also had extensive experience playing the piece. Subjects were told that anomalous musical events (AMEs) could occur at random within the excerpts of the piece and were told to report the number of AMEs after each excerpt. Furthermore, subjects were instructed to remain still while listening to the excerpts and their lack of movement was verified via visual and EEG monitoring. Experts had significantly better behavioral performance (i.e. correctly reporting AME counts) than non-experts, though both groups had mean accuracies greater than 80%. These group differences were also reflected in the EEG correlates of key-change detection post-stimulus, with experts showing more significant, greater magnitude, longer periods of, and earlier peaks in condition-discriminating EEG activity than novices. Using the timing of the maximum discriminating neural correlates, we performed source reconstruction and compared significant differences between cellists and non-musicians. We found significant differences that included a slightly right lateralized motor and frontal source distribution. The right lateralized motor activation is consistent with the cortical representation of the left hand - i.e. the hand a cellist would use, while playing, to generate the anomalous key-changes.
