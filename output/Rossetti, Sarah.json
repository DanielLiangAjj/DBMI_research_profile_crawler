The hemodynamic stability index (HSI) was found to have an AUC of 0.82 in predicting the need for hemodynamic intervention in the ICU. Future studies using this tool may benefit from targeting those outcomes that are more relevant to clinicians and most achievable. Methods A three-round Delphi study was conducted with a panel of 10 critical care physicians and three nurses in the United States to identify outcomes that may be most relevant and achievable with the HSI when evaluated for use in the ICU. To achieve criteria for relevance, at least 65% of panelists had to rate an outcome as a 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale. Results Nineteen of 24 outcomes that may be associated with the HSI achieved consensus for relevance. The Kemeny-Young approach was used to develop a matrix depicting the distribution of outcomes considering both relevance and achievability. \"Reduces time spent in hemodynamic instability\" and \"reduces times to recognition of hemodynamic instability\" were the highest-ranking outcomes considering both relevance and achievability. Conclusion This Delphi study was a feasible method to\u00a0identify relevant outcomes that may be associated with an appropriate predictive analytic tool in the ICU. These findings can provide insight to researchers looking to study such tools to impact outcomes relevant to critical care practitioners. Future studies should test these tools in the ICU that target the most clinically relevant and achievable outcomes, such as time spent hemodynamically unstable or time until actionable nursing assessment or treatment.", "Keywords": ["adult intensive care", "artificial intelligence and machine learning", "decision support system", "delphi method", "hemodynamic"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andre L", "Last Name": "Holder", "Affiliation": "Critical Care Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashish K", "Last Name": "Khanna", "Affiliation": "Anesthesiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Scott", "Affiliation": "Anesthesiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah C", "Last Name": "Rossetti", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Informatics and Nursing, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph B", "Last Name": "Rinehart", "Affiliation": "Anesthesiology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dustin D", "Last Name": "Linn", "Affiliation": "Hospital Patient Monitoring, Philips Research North America, Cambridge, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jochen", "Last Name": "Weichert", "Affiliation": "Clinical Development, Philips Research Netherlands BV, Eindhoven, NLD."}, {"First Name": "R Philip", "Last Name": "Dellinger", "Affiliation": "Critical Care Medicine, Cooper University Hospital, Camden, USA."}], "Journal": "Cureus", "PubDate": "2023Dec"}, {"PMID": "37644885", "Title": "Shifting Mindsets: The Impact of a Patient Portal on Functioning and Recovery in a Mental Health Setting.", "Abstract": "This study aims to understand whether higher use of a patient portal can have an impact on mental health functioning and recovery.", "Keywords": ["clinical informatics", "evaluation", "mental health", "nursing informatics", "patient portals"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mental Health", "Patient Portals", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Patient Satisfaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Lo", "Affiliation": "Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hwayeon Danielle", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Kemp", "Affiliation": "Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Mikayla", "Last Name": "Munnery", "Affiliation": "Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sheng", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Clement", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Damian", "Last Name": "Jankowicz", "Affiliation": "Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Rohan", "Last Name": "Mehta", "Affiliation": "Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Interprofessional Practice, Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Moshe", "Last Name": "Sakal", "Affiliation": "Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Pundit", "Affiliation": "Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Ontario Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Kuziemsky", "Affiliation": "Office of Research, MacEwan University, Edmonton, AB, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Rossetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gillian", "Last Name": "Strudwick", "Affiliation": "Information Management Group, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada."}], "Journal": "Canadian journal of psychiatry.

We performed a content analysis of 25X5 Symposium chat logs to identify themes about reducing clinician documentation burden.", "Keywords": ["burnout", "chat bot", "content analysis", "documentation burden", "nurses", "online chat", "physicians", "policy", "symposium", "topic modeling", "virtual conference"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Delivery of Health Care", "Electronic Health Records", "Burnout, Professional", "Documentation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda J", "Last Name": "Moy", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Withall", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mollie", "Last Name": "Hobensack", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Yeji Lee", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Deborah R", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sarah C", "Last Name": "Rossetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "S Trent", "Last Name": "Rosenbloom", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Kenrick", "Last Name": "Cato", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of medical Internet research", "PubDate": "2023May17"}, {"PMID": "37128367", "Title": "Using Time Series Clustering to Segment and Infer Emergency Department Nursing Shifts from Electronic Health Record Log Files.", "Abstract": "Few computational approaches exist for abstracting electronic health record (EHR) log files into clinically meaningful phenomena like clinician shifts. Because shifts are a fundamental unit of work recognized in clinical settings, shifts may serve as a primary unit of analysis in the study of documentation burden. We conducted a proof- of-concept study to investigate the feasibility of a novel approach using time series clustering to segment and infer clinician shifts from EHR log files. From 33,535,585 events captured between April-June 2021, we computationally identified 43,911 potential shifts among 2,285 (74.2%) emergency department nurses. On average, computationally-identified shifts were 10.6\u00b13.1 hours long. Based on data distributions, we classified these shifts based on type: day, evening, night; and length: 12-hour, 8-hour, other. We validated our method through manual chart review of computationally-identified 12-hour shifts achieving 92.0% accuracy. Preliminary results suggest unsupervised clustering methods may be a reasonable approach for rapidly identifying clinician shifts.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Electronic Health Records", "Time Factors", "Documentation", "Emergency Service, Hospital"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda J", "Last Name": "Moy", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics, NY, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenrick D", "Last Name": "Cato", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center Department of Emergency Medicine, NY, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Withall", "Affiliation": "Columbia University School of Nursing, NY, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eugene Y", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center Department of Emergency Medicine, NY, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Tatonetti", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics, NY, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah C", "Last Name": "Rossetti", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics, NY, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "AMIA ...

We then compared the distinct flowsheet measures documented in five flowsheet templates across the different facilities. We observed that each type of healthcare facility appeared to have distinct clinical care foci and flowsheet measures documented differed within the same template based on facility type.

The secondary objectives were to uncover: 1) barriers and facilitators to patient portal use; and, 2) desired functionality of the technology by psychiatric consumers. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using focus groups consisting of psychiatric consumers, their family members/caregivers, and Peer Support Workers. Two members of the research team independently performed a content analysis, and came to agreement on the identified coding hierarchy and themes. A total of twenty-three participants took part in one of five focus groups. Engagement and empowerment, consumer experience and satisfaction, and quality of care were identified as outcome indicators. Privacy and security, portal usage, and usability were identified as important process indicators. A number of barriers and facilitators were identified.
