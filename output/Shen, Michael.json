Here, we use a multi-omics approach on 229,794 single cells to create a mouse single-cell reference atlas for interpreting mouse prostate biology and castration response. Our reference atlas refines single-cell annotations and provides a chromatin context, which, when coupled with mouse lineage tracing, demonstrates that castration-resistant luminal cells are distinct from the pre-existent urethra-proximal stem/progenitor cells. Molecular pathway analysis and therapeutic studies further implicate AP1 (JUN/FOS), WNT/\u03b2-catenin, FOXQ1, NF-\u03baB, and JAK/STAT pathways as major drivers of castration-resistant luminal populations with relevance to human PCa. Our datasets, which can be explored through an interactive portal (https://visportal.roswellpark.org/data/tang/), can aid in developing combination treatments with ARSI for advanced PCa patients.", "Keywords": ["AP1", "castration resistance", "differentiation", "epigenetic", "plasticity", "progenitor cells", "prostate", "prostate cancer", "reprogramming", "single-cell analysis"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason S", "Last Name": "Kirk", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

However, a mechanistic understanding of how RA signaling promotes cell lineage identity in different tissues is often missing. Here, leveraging prostate organoid technology, we demonstrated that RA signaling orchestrates the commitment of adult mouse prostate progenitors to glandular identity, epithelial barrier integrity, and ultimately, proper specification of the prostatic lumen. Mechanistically, RA-dependent RAR\u03b3 activation promotes the expression of the pioneer factor Foxa1, which synergizes with the androgen pathway for proper luminal expansion, cytoarchitecture and function. FOXA1 nucleotide variants are common in human prostate and breast cancers and considered driver mutations, though their pathogenic mechanism is incompletely understood. Combining functional genetics experiments with structural modeling of FOXA1 folding and chromatin binding analyses, we discovered that FOXA1 F254E255 is a loss-of-function mutation leading to compromised transcriptional function and lack of luminal fate commitment of prostate progenitors. Overall, we define RA as a crucial instructive signal for glandular identity in adult prostate progenitors. We propose deregulation of vitamin A metabolism as a risk factor for benign and malignant prostate disease, and identified cancer associated FOXA1 indels affecting residue F254 as loss-of-function mutations promoting dedifferentiation of adult prostate progenitors.

Our analyses demonstrate transcriptomic similarities between epithelial cell states in the normal prostate, in the regressed prostate after androgen-deprivation, and in primary prostate tumors. During regression in the mouse prostate, all epithelial cells shift their expression profiles towards a proximal periurethral (PrU) state, demonstrating an androgen-dependent plasticity that is restored to normal during androgen restoration and regeneration. In the human prostate, we find progressive rewiring of transcriptional programs across epithelial cell types in benign prostate hyperplasia and treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer. Notably, we detect copy number variants predominantly within Luminal Acinar cells in prostate tumors, suggesting a bias in their cell type of origin, as well as a larger field of transcriptomic alterations in non-tumor cells. Finally, we observe that Luminal Acinar tumor cells in treatment-na\u00efve prostate cancer display heterogeneous androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity, including a split between high-AR and low-AR profiles with similarity to PrU-like states.

These mCRPC subtypes display increased lineage plasticity and often lack AR expression 2-5 . Here we show that neuroendocrine differentiation and castration-resistance in CRPC-NE are maintained by the activity of Nuclear Receptor Binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2) 6 , which catalyzes histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). We find that organoid lines established from genetically-engineered mice 7 recapitulate key features of human CRPC-NE, and can display transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states in culture. CRPC-NE organoids express elevated levels of NSD2 and H3K36me2 marks, but relatively low levels of H3K27me3, consistent with antagonism of EZH2 activity by H3K36me2. Human CRPC-NE but not primary NEPC tumors expresses high levels of NSD2, consistent with a key role for NSD2 in lineage plasticity, and high NSD2 expression in mCRPC correlates with poor survival outcomes. Notably, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of NSD2 or expression of a dominant-negative oncohistone H3.3K36M mutant results in loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes and restores responsiveness to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide in mouse and human CRPC-NE organoids and grafts.

PAR relaxes chromatin and recruits other DNA repair factors, including XRCC1 and DNA Ligase 3, to maintain genomic stability. Here we show that, in contrast to the normal development of Parp1-null mice, heterozygous expression of catalytically inactive Parp1 (E988A, Parp1+/A) acts in a dominant-negative manner to disrupt murine embryogenesis. As such, all the surviving F1 Parp1+/A mice are chimeras with mixed Parp1+/AN (neoR retention) cells that act similarly to Parp1+/-. Pure F2 Parp1+/A embryos were found at Mendelian ratios at the E3.5 blastocyst stage but died before E9.5. Compared to Parp1-/- cells, genotype and expression-validated pure Parp1+/A cells retain significant ADP-ribosylation and PARylation activities but accumulate markedly higher levels of sister chromatid exchange and mitotic bridges. Despite proficiency for homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining measured by reporter assays and supported by normal lymphocyte and germ cell development, Parp1+/A cells are hypersensitive to base damages, radiation, and Topoisomerase I and II inhibition. The sensitivity of Parp1+/A cells to base damages and Topo inhibitors exceed Parp1-/- controls. The findings show that the enzymatically inactive PARP1 dominant negatively blocks DNA repair in selective pathways beyond wild-type PARP1 and establishes a crucial physiological difference between PARP1 inactivation vs. deletion. As a result, the expression of enzymatically inactive PARP1 from one allele is sufficient to abrogate murine embryonic development, providing a mechanism for the on-target side effect of PARP inhibitors used for cancer therapy.", "Keywords": ["DNA damage", "PARP inhibitor", "PARP1", "embryonic", "inactivation"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Pregnancy", "Animals", "Mice", "Causality", "Alleles", "Genotype", "Genomic Instability", "ADP-Ribosylation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhengping", "Last Name": "Shao", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Brian J", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Hanwen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Xiaohui", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Wenxia", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Napon", "Last Name": "Chirathivat", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Gershik", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Shan", "Last Name": "Zha", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York City, NY 10032."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2023Aug"}, {"PMID": "37465146", "Title": "Unexpected lower level of oral periodontal pathogens in patients with high numbers of systemic diseases.", "Abstract": "Periodontal disease is associated with systemic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease, all diseases with large inflammatory components.

In more advanced and aggressive tumors, however, the multiclonal landscape develops into competing dominant and minor clones accompanied by a disordered microenvironment. We demonstrate that this dominant/minor landscape is associated with differential immunoediting, in which minor clones are marked by an increased expression of IFN\u03b3-response genes and the T\u00a0cell-activating chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl11. Furthermore, immunomodulation of the IFN\u03b3 pathway can rescue minor clones from elimination.

To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OncoLoop, a precision medicine framework that predicts drug sensitivity in human tumors and their preexisting high-fidelity (cognate) model(s) by leveraging drug perturbation profiles. As a proof of concept, we applied OncoLoop to prostate cancer using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that recapitulate a broad spectrum of disease states, including castration-resistant, metastatic, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Interrogation of human prostate cancer cohorts by Master Regulator (MR) conservation analysis revealed that most patients with advanced prostate cancer were represented by at least one cognate GEMM-derived tumor (GEMM-DT). Drugs predicted to invert MR activity in patients and their cognate GEMM-DTs were successfully validated in allograft, syngeneic, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of tumors and metastasis. Furthermore, OncoLoop-predicted drugs enhanced the efficacy of clinically relevant drugs, namely, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the AR inhibitor enzalutamide.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

suggesting their potential roles in cellular differentiation. Despite this expression pattern, little is known about how lncRNAs influence lineage commitment at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate that perturbation of an embryonic stem cell/early embryonic lncRNA, pluripotency-associated transcript 4 (Platr4), directly influences the specification of cardiac-mesoderm-lineage differentiation. We show that Platr4 acts as a molecular scaffold or chaperone interacting with the Hippo-signaling pathway molecules Yap and Tead4 to regulate the expression of a downstream target gene, Ctgf, which is crucial to the cardiac-lineage program. Importantly, Platr4 knockout mice exhibit myocardial atrophy and valve mucinous degeneration, which are both associated with reduced cardiac output and sudden heart failure. Together, our findings provide evidence that Platr4 is required in cardiac-lineage specification and adult heart function in mice.", "Keywords": ["Ctgf", "Hippo-signaling pathway", "Platr4", "Tead4", "cardiac function", "lncRNA", "mesendoderm lineage"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Mesoderm", "Cell Differentiation", "Transcription Factors", "Cell Lineage", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rasmani", "Last Name": "Hazra", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lily", "Last Name": "Brine", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA."}, {"First Name": "Libia", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Benz", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA."}, {"First Name": "Napon", "Last Name": "Chirathivat", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Genetics and Development, Urology, and Systems Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Genetics and Development, Urology, and Systems Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "John Erby", "Last Name": "Wilkinson", "Affiliation": "University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott K", "Last Name": "Lyons", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA."}, {"First Name": "David L", "Last Name": "Spector", "Affiliation": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.

While the evolutionary forces driving these polyphyletic deletion events are not well understood, the consequence is that extant metazoans are unable to produce nine essential amino acids (EAAs). Previous studies have highlighted that EAA biosynthesis tends to be more energetically costly, raising the possibility that these pathways were lost from organisms with access to abundant EAAs. It is unclear whether present-day metazoans can reaccept these pathways to resurrect biosynthetic capabilities that were lost long ago or whether evolution has rendered EAA pathways incompatible with metazoan metabolism. Here, we report progress on a large-scale synthetic genomics effort to reestablish EAA biosynthetic functionality in mammalian cells. We designed codon-optimized biosynthesis pathways based on genes mined from Escherichia coli. These pathways were de novo synthesized in 3 kilobase chunks, assembled in yeasto and genomically integrated into a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. One synthetic pathway produced valine at a sufficient level for cell viability and proliferation. 13C-tracing verified de novo biosynthesis of valine and further revealed build-up of pathway intermediate 2,3-dihydroxy-3-isovalerate. Increasing the dosage of downstream ilvD boosted pathway performance and allowed for long-term propagation of second-generation cells in valine-free medium at 3.2 days per doubling. This work demonstrates that mammalian metabolism is amenable to restoration of ancient core pathways, paving a path for genome-scale efforts to synthetically restore metabolic functions to the metazoan lineage.", "Keywords": ["Cricetulus griseus", "cell biology", "essential amino acids", "genetics", "genomics", "synthetic biology", "synthetic genomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Amino Acids, Essential", "Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Escherichia coli", "Genome", "Mammals", "Valine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Trolle", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ross M", "Last Name": "McBee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Kaufman", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sudarshan", "Last Name": "Pinglay", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Henri", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sergei", "Last Name": "German", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Liyuan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xinyi", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, New York University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "J Andrew", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Pacold", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Drew R", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jef D", "Last Name": "Boeke", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Genetics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Health, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Harris H", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2022Sep27"}, {"PMID": "36114082", "Title": "B7-H3 as a Therapeutic Target in Advanced Prostate Cancer.", "Abstract": "B7-H3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory glycoprotein overexpressed in prostate cancers (PCs).

Here, we report a class of bottlebrush polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for potent in\u00a0vivo KRAS depletion. Owing to their highly branched architecture, these molecular nanoconstructs suppress nearly all side effects associated with DNA-protein interactions and substantially enhance the pharmacological properties of the ASO, such as plasma pharmacokinetics and tumor uptake. Systemic delivery to mice bearing human non-small-cell lung carcinoma xenografts results in a significant reduction in both KRAS levels and tumor growth, and the antitumor performance well exceeds that of current popular ASO paradigms, such as chemically modified oligonucleotides and PEGylation using linear or slightly branched PEG. Importantly, these conjugates relax the requirement on the ASO chemistry, allowing unmodified, natural phosphodiester ASOs to achieve efficacy comparable to that of chemically modified ones. Both the bottlebrush polymer and its ASO conjugates appear to be safe and well tolerated in mice.

Yet, prostate epithelium overgrowth is a common condition during aging, associated with urinary dysfunction and tumorigenesis. For over thirty years, TGF-\u03b2 ligands have been known to induce cytostasis in a variety of epithelia, but the intracellular pathway mediating this signal in the prostate, and its relevance for quiescence, have remained elusive. Here, using mouse prostate organoids to model epithelial progenitors, we find that intra-epithelial non-canonical Activin A signaling inhibits cell proliferation in a Smad-independent manner. Mechanistically, Activin A triggers Tak1 and p38 \u039cAPK activity, leading to p16 and p21 nuclear import. Spontaneous evasion from this quiescent state occurs upon prolonged culture, due to reduced Activin A secretion, a condition associated with DNA replication stress and aneuploidy. Organoids capable to escape quiescence in vitro are also able to implant with increased frequency into immunocompetent mice. This study demonstrates that non-canonical Activin A signaling safeguards epithelial quiescence in the healthy prostate, with potential implications for the understanding of cancer initiation, and the development of therapies targeting quiescent tumor progenitors.", "Keywords": ["MAP3K7", "Activin A", "TGF-\u03b2", "organoids", "prostate"], "MeSH terms": ["Activins", "Animals", "Male", "Mice",

recognized for decades that ERBB signaling is important in prostate cancer, but targeting ERBB receptors as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer has been ineffective clinically. However, we show here that membranous HER3 protein is commonly highly expressed in lethal prostate cancer, associating with reduced time to castration resistance (CR) and survival. Multiplex immunofluorescence indicated that the HER3 ligand NRG1 is detectable primarily in tumor-infiltrating myelomonocytic cells in human prostate cancer; this observation was confirmed using single-cell RNA sequencing of human prostate cancer biopsies and murine transgenic prostate cancer models. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patient-derived xenograft organoids with high HER3 expression as well as mouse prostate cancer organoids, recombinant NRG1 enhanced proliferation and survival. Supernatant from murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells promoted murine prostate cancer organoid growth in vitro, which could be reversed by a neutralizing anti-NRG1 antibody and ERBB inhibition. Targeting HER3, especially with the HER3-directed antibody-drug conjugate U3-1402, exhibited antitumor activity against HER3-expressing prostate cancer. Overall, these data indicate that HER3 is commonly overexpressed in lethal prostate cancer and can be activated by NRG1 secreted by myelomonocytic cells in the tumor microenvironment, supporting HER3-targeted therapeutic strategies for treating HER3-expressing advanced CRPC.

One method is based on the delivery of adenoviruses that express Cre recombinase in selected cell types in the urothelium, and a second uses transgenic drivers in which activation of inducible Cre alleles can be limited to the bladder urothelium by intravesicular delivery of tamoxifen. Using both approaches, targeted deletion of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressor genes specifically in basal urothelial cells gave rise to muscle-invasive bladder tumors. Furthermore, preinvasive lesions arising in basal cells displayed upregulation of molecular pathways related to bladder tumorigenesis, including proinflammatory pathways. Cross-species analyses comparing a mouse gene signature of early bladder cancer with a human signature of bladder cancer progression identified a conserved 28-gene signature of early bladder cancer that is associated with poor prognosis for human bladder cancer and that outperforms comparable gene signatures. These findings demonstrate the relevance of these GEMMs for studying the biology of human bladder cancer and introduce a prognostic gene signature that may help to stratify patients at risk for progression to potentially lethal muscle-invasive disease.

Here we show that the prostate-specific homeoprotein NKX3.1 suppresses prostate cancer initiation by protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress. Integrating analyses of genetically engineered mouse models, human prostate cancer cells, and human prostate cancer organotypic cultures, we find that, in response to oxidative stress, NKX3.1 is imported to mitochondria via the chaperone protein HSPA9, where it regulates transcription of mitochondrial-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) genes, thereby restoring oxidative phosphorylation and preventing cancer initiation. Germline polymorphisms of NKX3.1 associated with increased cancer risk fail to protect from oxidative stress or suppress tumorigenicity. Low expression levels of NKX3.1 combined with low expression of mitochondrial ETC genes are associated with adverse clinical outcome, whereas high levels of mitochondrial NKX3.1 protein are associated with favorable outcome. This work reveals an extranuclear role for NKX3.1 in suppression of prostate cancer by protecting mitochondrial function. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings uncover a nonnuclear function for NKX3.1 that is a key mechanism for suppression of prostate cancer. Analyses of the expression levels and subcellular localization of NKX3.1 in patients at risk of cancer progression may improve risk assessment in a precision prevention paradigm, particularly for men

NKX3.1 is haploinsufficient, and pathogenic reduction in protein levels may result from genetic loss, decreased transcription, and increased protein degradation caused by inflammation or PTEN loss. NKX3.1 acts by retarding proliferation, activating antioxidants, and enhancing DNA repair. DYRK1B-mediated phosphorylation at serine 185 of NKX3.1 leads to its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Because NKX3.1 protein levels are reduced, but never entirely lost, in prostate adenocarcinoma, enhancement of NKX3.1 protein levels represents a potential therapeutic strategy. As a proof of principle, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing to engineer in vivo a point mutation in murine Nkx3.1 to code for a serine to alanine missense at amino acid 186, the target for Dyrk1b phosphorylation. Nkx3.1S186A/-, Nkx3.1+/- , and Nkx3.1+/+ mice were analyzed over one year to determine the levels of Nkx3.1 expression and effects of the mutant protein on the prostate. Allelic loss of Nkx3.1 caused reduced levels of Nkx3.1 protein, increased proliferation, and prostate hyperplasia and dysplasia, whereas Nkx3.1S186A/- mouse prostates had increased levels of Nkx3.1 protein, reduced prostate size, normal histology, reduced proliferation, and increased DNA end labeling. At 2 months of age, when all mice had normal prostate histology, Nkx3.1+/- mice demonstrated indices of metabolic activation, DNA damage response, and stress response. These data suggest that modulation of Nkx3.1 levels alone can exert long-term control over premalignant changes and susceptibility to DNA damage in the prostate. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that prolonging the half-life of Nkx3.1 reduces proliferation, enhances DNA end-labeling, and protects from DNA damage, ultimately blocking the proneoplastic effects of Nkx3.1 allelic loss.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Gene Editing", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Point Mutation", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cai", "Last Name": "Bowen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Genetics & Development, Urology and Systems Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Maho", "Last Name": "Shibata", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Genetics & Development, Urology and Systems Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Hailan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Arizona Medical Center, Tucson, Arizona."}, {"First Name": "Sarah K", "Last Name": "Bergren", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Genetics & Development, Urology and Systems Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine, Genetics & Development, Urology and Systems Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Edward P", "Last Name": "Gelmann", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Arizona Medical Center, Tucson, Arizona. gelmanne@arizona.edu."}], "Journal": "Cancer research", "PubDate": "2020Nov01"}, {"PMID": "32915138", "Title": "A single-cell atlas of the mouse and human prostate reveals heterogeneity and conservation of epithelial progenitors.", "Abstract": "Understanding the cellular constituents of the prostate is essential for identifying the cell of origin for prostate adenocarcinoma.

Treatment-refractory prostate cancers are increasingly associated with loss of luminal prostate markers, and in many cases induction of developmental programs, stem cell-like phenotypes, and neuroendocrine/neuronal features. Clinically, lineage plasticity may manifest as low PSA progression, resistance to androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, and sometimes small cell/neuroendocrine pathologic features observed on metastatic biopsy. This mechanism is not restricted to prostate cancer as other malignancies also demonstrate lineage plasticity during resistance to targeted therapies. At present, there is no established therapeutic approach for patients with advanced prostate cancer developing lineage plasticity or small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) due to knowledge gaps in the underlying biology. Few clinical trials address questions in this space, and the outlook for patients remains poor. To move forward, urgently needed are: (i) a fundamental understanding of how lineage plasticity occurs and how it can best be defined; (ii) the temporal contribution and cooperation of emerging drivers; (iii) preclinical models that recapitulate biology of the disease and the recognized phenotypes; (iv) identification of therapeutic targets; and (v) novel trial designs dedicated to the entity as it is defined.

Here, we present a modular, scalable, intercellular signaling language in yeast based on fungal mating peptide/G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pairs harnessed from nature. First, through genome-mining, we assemble 32 functional peptide-GPCR signaling interfaces with a range of dose-response characteristics. Next, we demonstrate that these interfaces can be combined into two-cell communication links, which serve as assembly units for higher-order communication topologies. Finally, we show 56 functional, two-cell links, which we use to assemble three- to six-member communication topologies and a three-member interdependent community.

Such cellular plasticity can be triggered by physiological or oncogenic stress, or it can be experimentally induced through cellular reprogramming. Notably, physiological stresses that promote plasticity, such as severe tissue damage, inflammation, or senescence, also represent hallmarks of cancer.

Here, we provide novel insights into treatment response for the antiandrogen abiraterone by analyses of a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model with combined inactivation of Trp53 and Pten, which are frequently comutated in human CRPC. These NPp53 mice fail to respond to abiraterone and display accelerated progression to tumors resembling treatment-related CRPC with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE) in humans. Cross-species computational analyses identify master regulators of adverse response that are conserved with human CRPC-NE, including the neural differentiation factor SOX11, which promotes neuroendocrine differentiation in cells derived from NPp53 tumors. Furthermore, abiraterone-treated NPp53 prostate tumors contain regions of focal and/or overt neuroendocrine differentiation, distinguished by their proliferative potential. Notably, lineage tracing in vivo provides definitive and quantitative evidence that focal and overt neuroendocrine regions arise by transdifferentiation of luminal adenocarcinoma cells. These findings underscore principal roles for TP53 and PTEN inactivation in abiraterone resistance and progression from adenocarcinoma to CRPC-NE by transdifferentiation.Significance: Understanding adverse treatment response and identifying patients likely to fail treatment represent fundamental clinical challenges. By integrating analyses of GEM models and human clinical data, we provide direct genetic evidence for transdifferentiation as a mechanism of drug resistance as well as for stratifying patients for treatment with antiandrogens.

The present study shows a novel mechanism for Cripto-1 regulation of mammary gland development through direct effects on progesterone receptor expression and pathways regulated by progesterone in the mammary gland. We demonstrate a strict temporal regulation of mouse Cripto-1 (mCripto-1) expression that occurs during mammary gland development and a stage-specific function of mCripto-1 signaling during mammary gland development. Our data suggest that Cripto-1, like the progesterone receptor, is not required for the initial ductal growth but is essential for subsequent side branching and alveologenesis during the initial stages of pregnancy.

Currently little is known about how Shh is regulated in prechordal tissue. Here we show that in the embryonic chick, Shh is expressed transiently in prechordal mesoderm, and is governed by unprocessed Nodal. Exposure of prechordal mesoderm microcultures to Nodal-conditioned medium, the Nodal inhibitor CerS, or to an ALK4/5/7 inhibitor reveals that Nodal is required to maintain both Shh and Gsc expression, but whereas Gsc is largely maintained through canonical signalling, Nodal signals through a non-canonical route to maintain Shh. Further, Shh expression can be maintained by a recombinant Nodal cleavage mutant, proNodal, but not by purified mature Nodal. A number of lines of evidence suggest that proNodal acts via FGFR3. ProNodal and FGFR3 co-immunoprecipitate and proNodal increases FGFR3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In microcultures, soluble FGFR3 abolishes Shh without affecting Gsc expression. Further, prechordal mesoderm cells in which Fgfr3 expression is reduced by Fgfr3 siRNA fail to bind to proNodal. Finally, targeted electroporation of Fgfr3 siRNA to prechordal mesoderm in vivo results in premature Shh downregulation without affecting Gsc.

Although the molecular mechanisms linking these noncoding variants with obesity are not immediately obvious, subsequent studies in mice demonstrated that FTO expression levels influence body mass and composition phenotypes. However, no direct connection between the obesity-associated variants and FTO expression or function has been made. Here we show that the obesity-associated noncoding sequences within FTO are functionally connected, at megabase distances, with the homeobox gene IRX3. The obesity-associated FTO region directly interacts with the promoters of IRX3 as well as FTO in the human, mouse and zebrafish genomes. Furthermore, long-range enhancers within this region recapitulate aspects of IRX3 expression, suggesting that the obesity-associated interval belongs to the regulatory landscape of IRX3. Consistent with this, obesity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with expression of IRX3, but not FTO, in human brains. A direct link between IRX3 expression and regulation of body mass and composition is demonstrated by a reduction in body weight of 25 to 30% in Irx3-deficient mice, primarily through the loss of fat mass and increase in basal metabolic rate with browning of white adipose tissue. Finally, hypothalamic expression of a dominant-negative form of Irx3 reproduces the metabolic phenotypes of Irx3-deficient mice. Our data suggest that IRX3 is a functional long-range target of obesity-associated variants within FTO and represents a novel determinant of body mass and composition.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

treatment of a variety of clinical disorders. One of the main barriers to the widespread clinical use of siRNAs, however, is their entrapment and degradation within the endolysosomal pathway of target cells. Here we report the trafficking and function of PP75, a non-toxic, biodegradable, lipid membrane disruptive anionic polymer composed of phenylalanine derivatized poly(L-lysine iso-phthalamide). PP75 is readily endocytosed by cells, safely permeabilizes endolysosomes in a pH dependent manner and facilitates the transfer of co-endocytosed materials directly into the cytoplasm. The covalent attachment of siRNAs to PP75 using disulfide linkages generates conjugates that effectively traffic siRNAs to the cytoplasm of target cells both in vitro and in vivo. In a subcutaneous malignant glioma tumor model, a locally delivered PP75-stathmin siRNA conjugate decreases stathmin expression in tumor cells and, in combination with the nitrosourea chemotherapy carmustine, is highly effective at inhibiting tumor growth.

Using gene set enrichment analysis, we identified a 19-gene signature enriched in indolent prostate tumors. We then further classified this signature with a decision tree learning model to identify three genes--FGFR1, PMP22, and CDKN1A--that together accurately predicted outcome of low Gleason score tumors. Validation of this three-gene panel on independent cohorts confirmed its independent prognostic value as well as its ability to improve prognosis with currently used clinical nomograms.

The pathophysiology involves injury to the myocyte membrane and/or altered energy production that results in increased intracellular calcium concentrations and initiation of destructive processes. Myoglobin has been identified as the primary muscle constituent contributing to renal damage in rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyolysis was first described with crush injuries and trauma, more common causes in hospitalized patients at present include prescription and over-the-counter medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels, but additional testing is needed to evaluate for potential causes, electrolyte abnormalities, and AKI. Treatment is aimed at discontinuation of further skeletal muscle damage, prevention of acute renal failure, and rapid identification of potentially life-threatening complications. Review of existing published data reveals a lack of high-quality evidence to support many interventions that are often recommended for treating rhabdomyolysis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore renal perfusion and increase urine flow is agreed on as the main intervention for preventing and treating AKI. There is little evidence other than from animal studies, retrospective observational studies, and case series to support the routine use of bicarbonate-containing fluids, mannitol, and loop diuretics.

Using an inducible Cre driver to simultaneously inactivate Pten while activating oncogenic Kras and a fluorescent reporter allele in the prostate epithelium, we performed lineage tracing in vivo to define the temporal and spatial occurrence of prostate tumors, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases. These analyses revealed that though disseminated tumors cells arise early following the initial occurrence of prostate tumors, there is a significant temporal lag in metastasis, which is temporally coincident with the up-regulation of Etv4 expression in primary tumors. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Etv4 in a metastatic cell line derived from the mouse model abrogates the metastatic phenotype but does not affect tumor growth. Notably, expression and activation of ETV4, but not other oncogenic ETS genes, is correlated with activation of both PI3-kinase and Ras signaling in human prostate tumors and metastases.

Our results reveal the inherent plasticity of basal cells, and support a model in which different cells of origin generate distinct molecular subtypes of prostate cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Blotting, Western", "Carcinoma, Basal Cell", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Cells, Cultured", "Epithelial Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genes, Reporter", "Humans", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Keratin-5", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Phosphorylation", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "RNA, Messenger", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Survival Rate"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhu A", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antonina", "Last Name": "Mitrofanova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarah K", "Last Name": "Bergren", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Abate-Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Cardiff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature cell biology", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "23201024", "Title": "Retrolisthesis and lumbar disc herniation: a postoperative assessment of patient function.", "Abstract": "The presence of retrolisthesis has been associated with the degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.

In this study, we used the TRAMP mouse model that develops NE prostate tumors to identify key factors that can lead to NED. We have previously reported that NE tumors express the forkhead transcription factor, Foxa2, Mash1 (mouse achaete scute homolog-1), as well as Synaptophysin. In TRAMP, the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) first expresses Foxa2 and Synaptophysin, which then progresses to NE cancer. In order to determine if Foxa2 is dispensable for development or maintenance of NE cancer, a conditional knock-out of Foxa2 in TRAMP mice was generated by breeding mice with two floxed alleles of Foxa2 and one copy of Nkx3.1-Cre. Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice showed loss of Foxa2 expression in embryonic prostatic buds. No expression of Foxa2 was seen in the adult prostate in either conditional null or control mice. Foxa2 is universally expressed in all wild type TRAMP NE tumors, but Mash1 expression is seen only in a few samples in a few cells. With the loss of Foxa2 in the NE tumors of the TRAMP/Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice, the expression of the pro-neuronal gene Mash1 is upregulated. NE tumors from both the TRAMP control and Foxa2-deficient TRAMP prostate express Synaptophysin and SV40 Large T-antigen, and both show a loss of androgen receptor expression in NE cells. These studies suggest that the TRAMP NE tumors can form in the absence of Foxa2 by an up regulation of Mash1.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Small Cell", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Phenotype", "Prognosis", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aparna", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiuping", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Case", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manik", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Klaus H", "Last Name": "Kaestner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Matusik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Prostate", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23027425", "Title": "The roots of cancer: stem cells and the basis for tumor heterogeneity.", "Abstract": "Recent studies of prostate cancer and other tumor types have revealed significant support, as well as unexpected complexities, for the application of concepts from normal stem cell biology to cancer. In particular, the cell of origin and cancer stem cell models have been proposed to explain the heterogeneity of tumors during the initiation, propagation, and evolution of cancer. Thus, a basis of intertumor heterogeneity has emerged from studies investigating whether stem cells and/or non-stem cells can serve as cells of origin for cancer and give rise to tumor subtypes that vary in disease outcome. Furthermore, analyses of putative cancer stem cells have revealed the genetically diverse nature of cancers and expanded our understanding of intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution.
