Adverse pregnancy outcomes, encompassing conditions such as gestational hypertension, eclampsia, preeclampsia, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, and gestational diabetes, may form part of an underrecognized pathway from early adulthood reproductive health factors to later-life vascular cognitive impairment and dementia in women. Adverse pregnancy outcomes are caused by dysregulated vascular and metabolic adaptations during pregnancy, and these pathophysiological changes may persist after delivery. Adverse pregnancy outcomes may contribute to the increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia directly through vascular and metabolic dysregulation and subsequent development of cardiovascular diseases, or other biological processes may be at play, such as shared maternal risk factors. Extensive epidemiologic evidence has shown that many cognitive impairment and dementia cases may be prevented or delayed by strategies targeting midlife cardiovascular health. Despite the recognized importance of adverse pregnancy outcomes for cardiovascular health, the literature on associated long-term health outcomes is limited. In this State of the Art review article, we summarize the current epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between adverse pregnancy outcomes and cognitive impairment and dementia and provide an overview of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms.

We hypothesized that higher parity would be associated with increased dementia risk. Materials and Methods: We utilized data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) community-based cohort study. Participants were recruited in 1987-1989 and followed through 2017. Participants, all born between 1921 and 1945, were from four U.S. communities in Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. We included all female participants seen at ARIC visit three or five for whom parity and dementia outcomes were available (N\u2009=\u20097,921). The primary exposure was self-reported number of live births. Our primary outcome was dementia, diagnosed via neurocognitive assessments, informant interviews, and expert adjudication. We created Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between parity and incident dementia, adjusting for demographic factors, education level, apolipoprotein E allele status, and vascular risk factors. We tested for interactions by race and birth cohort. Results: The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.82 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.69-0.99) for dementia in women with 0-1 births and 0.85 (95% CI 0.72-0.99) for women with 5+ births, compared to women with 2 births (reference group). This association was present in women born from 1924 to 1934, but not in women born in 1935 or later (p-interaction <0.001).

Few large U.S. population-based surveys included data on APOs. Methods: The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study is a nationally representative survey of 45,971 U.S. respondents. Female respondents \u226550 years old who reported pregnancy history at the 2013-2014 baseline interview were included in this cross-sectional analysis (n\u2009=\u20093,175; weighted n\u2009=\u200935,783,619). The primary exposure was a history of \u22651 APO, including preterm delivery, low birth weight, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and stillbirth. The primary outcomes were (1) stroke before age 60 and (2) any stroke. We used weighted logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between APO and stroke, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parity, and vascular risk factors. Results: Among stroke-free respondents, 15% reported \u22651 APO. Among women who reported a stroke before age 60, 39% reported \u22651 APO (p\u2009<\u20090.001); among women reporting stroke at any age, 25% reported \u22651 APO (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Controlling for covariates, women with APOs had increased odds of stroke before age 60 (adjusted OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.49, 4.75). The association of APOs with stroke at any age was not significant after controlling for covariates (adjusted OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93, 2.64). Conclusion: In this analysis of U.S. nationally representative survey data, APOs were independently associated with midlife stroke.

Goals of implementation were to consolidate in-person prenatal screening, surveillance, and examinations into fewer in-person visits while maintaining patient access to ongoing antenatal care and subspecialty consultations via telehealth virtual visits. The rationale for this change was to minimize patient travel and thus risk for COVID-19 exposure. Because a large portion of obstetric patients had underlying medical or fetal conditions placing them at increased risk for adverse outcomes, prenatal care telehealth regimens were tailored for increased surveillance and/or counseling. Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care. While telehealth virtual visits do not fully replace in-person encounters during prenatal care, they do offer a means of reducing potential patient and provider exposure to COVID-19 while providing consolidated in-person testing and services.

Hypertension is associated with poor maternal outcomes, including stroke. Disparities in hypertension might contribute to maternal strokes. Methods and Results Using billing data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample, we analyzed the effect of race/ethnicity on stroke during delivery admission in women aged 18 to 54 years delivering in US hospitals from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2014. We categorized hypertension as normotensive, chronic hypertension, or pregnancy-induced hypertension. Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using log-linear Poisson regression models, testing for interactions between race/ethnicity and hypertensive status. A total of 65\u00a0286\u00a0425 women were admitted for delivery during the study period, of whom 7764 were diagnosed with a stroke (11.9 per 100\u00a0000 deliveries). Hypertension modified the effect of race/ethnicity (P<0.0001 for interaction). Among women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, black and Hispanic women had higher stroke risk compared with non-Hispanic whites (blacks: aRR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.86-2.30; Hispanics: aRR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.98-2.43). Among women with chronic hypertension, all minority women had higher stroke risk (blacks: aRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.30-2.26; Hispanics: aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63; Asian/Pacific Islanders: aRR, 3.62; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63). Among normotensive women, only blacks had increased stroke risk (aRR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28).

The aims of the present study were to: (1) utilize the PWI information to automatically and optimally divide the artery into the segments with most homogeneous properties and (2) assess the feasibility of this method to provide arterial wall mechanical characterization in normal and atherosclerotic carotid arteries in vivo. A silicone phantom consisting of a soft and stiff segment along its longitudinal axis was scanned at the stiffness transition, and the PWV in each segment was estimated through static testing. The proposed algorithm detected the stiffness interface with an average error of 0.98\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u20090.49\u2009mm and 1.04\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u20090.27\u2009mm in the soft-to-stiff and stiff-to-soft pulse wave transmission direction, respectively.

Infections have been identified as a trigger for strokes in young people and have been associated with strokes during delivery hospitalizations, but a temporal relationship has been difficult to establish. We hypothesized that infections diagnosed during a delivery admission would be associated with an increased risk of readmission for postpartum stroke. Methods- We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Readmissions Database from 2010 to 2014. Using weighted survey design Poisson regression analysis, we calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CI for the association between infection during delivery admission and 30-day postpartum readmission for IS or HS. Results- Out of 17.2 million delivery admissions during the study period, 2128 were readmitted within 30 days for a stroke of any type. There were 1189 HS (intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage) and 720 IS, and the remainder unspecified pregnancy-related stroke. Adjusting for age and comorbidities, women with delivery infections were at higher risk of readmission for postpartum stroke of any type (aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.41). Women with infections had higher risk of readmission for postpartum IS (aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.22), but not for postpartum HS (aRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75-1.23). The effect of infection on 30-day IS readmission was larger in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (aRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.55-2.69 in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy versus aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.9-2.38 in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, P value for interaction=0.09). Conclusions- Infection during delivery hospitalization was associated with increased risk of readmission for IS, but not HS, within 30 days postpartum, particularly in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Infection may play a role in triggering postpartum IS even in the absence of other risk factors.", "Keywords": ["hospitalization", "infection", "postpartum period", "pregnancy", "stroke", "women"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Patient Readmission", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Puerperal Disorders", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Stroke"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eliza C", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (E.C.M., M.S.V.E., A.K.B.), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Wen", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (T.W., A.M.F.), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (E.C.M., M.S.V.E., A.K.B.), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Alexander M", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (T.W., A.M.F.), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Amelia K", "Last Name": "Boehme", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (E.C.M., M.S.V.E., A.K.B.), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Stroke", "PubDate": "2019Oct"}, {"PMID": "31326206", "Title": "Safety and Feasibility of a Rapid Outpatient Management Strategy for Transient Ischemic Attack and Minor Stroke: The Rapid Access Vascular Evaluation-Neurology (RAVEN) Approach.", "Abstract": "Although most transient ischemic attack and minor stroke patients in US emergency departments (EDs) are admitted, experience in other countries suggests that timely outpatient evaluation of transient ischemic attack and minor stroke can be safe.

IS or HS may present in young women with atypical symptoms including headache, seizure, extremity weakness, dizziness, nausea, behavioral changes, and visual symptoms. Obstetric anesthesiologists who recognize these signs and symptoms of pregnancy-related stroke are well positioned to facilitate timely care. Acute stroke of any type is an emergency that should prompt immediate coordination of care between obstetric anesthesiologists, stroke neurologists, high-risk obstetricians, nurses, and neonatologists. Historically, guidelines have not addressed the unique situation of maternal stroke, and pregnant women have been excluded from the large stroke trials. More recently, several publications and professional societies have highlighted that pregnant women suspected of having IS or HS should be evaluated for the same therapies as nonpregnant women. Vaginal delivery is generally preferred unless there are obstetric indications for cesarean delivery. Neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia are frequently safer than general anesthesia for cesarean delivery in the patient with a recent stroke.

Women aged 15-54 with a diagnosis of preeclampsia were included. Race and ethnicity were categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, Native American, other, and unknown. The overall risk for severe morbidity based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria was analyzed along with the risk for specific outcomes such as stroke, acute heart failure or pulmonary edema, eclampsia, and acute renal failure. The risk for severe morbidity was stratified by comorbid risk and compared by race. Log-linear regression models were created to assess risk for severe morbidity with risk ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals as measures of effect.Results: A total of 101,741 women with preeclampsia from 2012 to 2014 were included in this analysis. The risk for severe morbidity was significantly higher among non-Hispanic black women (9.8%) than non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and all other women, respectively (6.1, 7.7, and 7.5%, respectively, p\u2009<\u2009.01). For non-Hispanic black compared to non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and all other women, risk was higher for stroke (17.1 versus 6.5, 12.7, and 9.3 per 10,000 deliveries, respectively, p\u2009<\u2009.01) and pulmonary edema or heart failure (56.2 versus 32.7, 30.2, and 38.4 per 10,000 deliveries, respectively, p\u2009<\u2009.01).

To our knowledge, we present the first case of a patient treated concurrently with armodafinil and tranylcypromine. The patient developed an acute hypertensive crisis with severe headache, nausea, blurry vision, and neck stiffness. Her symptoms corresponded with the predicted pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response. She was also taking brexpiprazole, which could have contributed to her underlying symptoms.

One therapeutic strategy for SMA is to identify compounds that enhance the expression of the SMN2 gene, which normally only is a minor contributor to functional SMN protein production, but which is unaffected in SMA. A recent high-throughput screening campaign identified a 3,4-dihydro-4-phenyl-2(1H)-quinolinone derivative (2) that increases the expression of SMN2 by 2-fold with an EC50\u202f=\u202f8.3\u202f\u00b5M. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that the array of tolerated substituents, on either the benzo portion of the quinolinone or the 4-phenyl, was very narrow. However, the lactam ring of the quinolinone was more amenable to modifications. For example, the quinazolinone (9a) and the benzoxazepin-2(3H)-one (19) demonstrated improved potency and efficacy for increase in SMN2 expression as compared to 2.", "Keywords": ["Spinal muscular atrophy", "Survival motor neuron"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cyclization", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Mice", "Microsomes, Liver", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Quinolones", "RNA, Messenger", "Solubility", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Survival of Motor Neuron 2 Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sungwoon", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alyssa N", "Last Name": "Calder", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eliza H", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kierstyn P", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dawid K", "Last Name": "Fiejtek", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Rietz", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongxia", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan J", "Last Name": "Cherry", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin M", "Last Name": "Quist", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuechao", "Last Name": "Xing", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcie A", "Last Name": "Glicksman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregory D", "Last Name": "Cuny", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian L", "Last Name": "Lorson", "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elliot A", "Last Name": "Androphy", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Hodgetts", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 65 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, USA.

Over the last 5 years, investigators have made notable inroads in untangling this thorny topic. In this review, we examine these recent developments, concentrating on four aspects of the relationship between infection and stroke. We first discuss specific infectious agents as direct causes of stroke, focusing on recent work implicating herpesviruses and HIV in cerebral vasculopathy. We then discuss systemic infection of any type as a stroke trigger, focusing on the relationship of infection to timing of acute stroke, both in children and adults, as well as the role of vaccination in stroke prevention. We examine the evidence for chronic infection or \"infectious burden\" as a stroke risk factor. Finally, we discuss recent work on infection as a risk factor for increased morbidity after stroke, possible mechanisms mediating this effect, and the evidence for prophylactic antibiotics.", "Keywords": ["HIV", "Herpesvirus", "Infection", "Infectious burden", "Stroke", "Vaccination"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "HIV Infections", "Herpesviridae Infections", "Humans", "Risk Factors", "Stroke", "Vaccination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eliza C", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "The Neurological Institute of New York, 710 W. 168th St., 14th floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ecm2137@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "The Neurological Institute of New York, 710W. 168th St., Room 642, New York, NY, 10032, USA. mse13@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Current neurology and neuroscience reports", "PubDate": "2016Jan"}, {"PMID": "24362390", "Title": "Sounding narrative medicine: studying students' professional identity development at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.", "Abstract": "To learn what medical students derive from training in humanities, social sciences, and the arts in a narrative medicine curriculum and to explore narrative medicine's framework as it relates to students' professional development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Art", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Curriculum", "Education, Medical, Undergraduate", "Focus Groups", "Humanities", "Humans", "Narration", "Professional Competence", "Social Sciences", "Students, Medical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eliza", "Last Name": "Miller", "Affiliation": "Dr. Miller is a resident, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.
