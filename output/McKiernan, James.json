Pparg is a likely driver of LP BC and has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor in BASQ tumors, where it is likely suppressed by MEK-dependent phosphorylation. Here we tested the effects of rosiglitazone, a Pparg agonist, in a mouse model of BBN-induced muscle invasive BC. Rosiglitazone activated Pparg signaling in suprabasal epithelial layers of tumors but not in basal-most layers containing highly proliferative invasive cells, reducing proliferation but not affecting tumor survival. Addition of trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, induced Pparg signaling throughout all tumor layers, and eradicated 91% of tumors within 7-days of treatment. The 2-drug combination also activated a luminal differentiation program, reversing squamous metaplasia in the urothelium of tumor-bearing mice. Paired ATAC-RNA-seq analysis revealed that tumor apoptosis was most likely linked to down-regulation of Bcl-2 and other pro-survival genes, while the shift from BASQ to luminal differentiation was associated with activation of the retinoic acid pathway and upregulation of Kdm6a, a lysine demethylase that facilitates retinoid-signaling. Our data suggest that rosiglitazone, trametinib, and retinoids, which are all FDA approved, may be clinically active in BASQ tumors in patients. That muscle invasive tumors are populated by basal and suprabasal cell types with different responsiveness to PPARG agonists will be an important consideration when designing new treatments.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Tate", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sakina A", "Last Name": "Plumber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hikmat", "Last Name": "Al-Ahmadie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Woonyoung", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Viny", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ekatherina", "Last Name": "Batourina", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Krisjian", "Last Name": "Gartensson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Besmira", "Last Name": "Alija", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrei", "Last Name": "Molotkov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Wiessner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "McKiernan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "McConkey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Dinney", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bogdan", "Last Name": "Czerniak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cathy Lee", "Last Name": "Mendelsohn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Aug21"}, {"PMID": "37659962", "Title": "Metformin Overcomes the Consequences of NKX3.1 Loss to Suppress Prostate Cancer Progression.", "Abstract": "The antidiabetic drug metformin has known anticancer effects related to its antioxidant activity; however, its clinical benefit for prostate cancer (PCa) has thus far been inconclusive.

It is also the only bacterial cancer therapy approved by the US Food & Drug Administration for clinical use. BCG is delivered in the bladder, shortly after tumour resection, for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Modulating mucosal immunity by exposing the urothelium to intravesical BCG\u00a0has been the main therapeutic strategy for high-risk NMIBC over the last three decades. Thus, BCG provides a benchmark for the clinical development of bacteria-or other live attenuated pathogens-as cancer therapy. Currently, a myriad of immuno-oncology compounds is under clinical evaluation in BCG-unresponsive and BCG-na\u00efve patients as an alternative therapy in the context of worldwide BCG shortages. For patients with non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), studies investigating neoadjuvant immunotherapy with either anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in monotherapy or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have shown overall efficacy and acceptable safety profiles prior to radical cystectomy. Emerging clinical investigations are testing synergistic approaches by combining intravesical delivery of drugs with systemic immune checkpoint blockades in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with MIBC. Such novel strategy aims to prime a local anti-tumour immunity and reduce distant metastatic relapses by enhancing a systemic adaptive anti-tumour immune response.

We performed a first-of-kind evaluation of two transcriptome-based precision cancer medicine methodologies to predict tumor sensitivity to a comprehensive repertoire of clinically relevant oncology drugs, whose mechanism of action we experimentally assessed in cognate cell lines. We enrolled patients with histologically distinct, poor-prognosis malignancies who had progressed on multiple therapies, and developed low-passage, patient-derived xenograft models that were used to validate 35 patient-specific drug predictions. Both OncoTarget, which identifies high-affinity inhibitors of individual master regulator (MR) proteins, and OncoTreat, which identifies drugs that invert the transcriptional activity of hyperconnected MR modules, produced highly significant 30-day disease control rates (68% and 91%, respectively). Moreover, of 18 OncoTreat-predicted drugs, 15 induced the predicted MR-module activity inversion in vivo. Predicted drugs significantly outperformed antineoplastic drugs selected as unpredicted controls, suggesting these methods may substantively complement existing precision cancer medicine approaches,

One method is based on the delivery of adenoviruses that express Cre recombinase in selected cell types in the urothelium, and a second uses transgenic drivers in which activation of inducible Cre alleles can be limited to the bladder urothelium by intravesicular delivery of tamoxifen. Using both approaches, targeted deletion of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressor genes specifically in basal urothelial cells gave rise to muscle-invasive bladder tumors. Furthermore, preinvasive lesions arising in basal cells displayed upregulation of molecular pathways related to bladder tumorigenesis, including proinflammatory pathways. Cross-species analyses comparing a mouse gene signature of early bladder cancer with a human signature of bladder cancer progression identified a conserved 28-gene signature of early bladder cancer that is associated with poor prognosis for human bladder cancer and that outperforms comparable gene signatures. These findings demonstrate the relevance of these GEMMs for studying the biology of human bladder cancer and introduce a prognostic gene signature that may help to stratify patients at risk for progression to potentially lethal muscle-invasive disease.

Here we show that the prostate-specific homeoprotein NKX3.1 suppresses prostate cancer initiation by protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress. Integrating analyses of genetically engineered mouse models, human prostate cancer cells, and human prostate cancer organotypic cultures, we find that, in response to oxidative stress, NKX3.1 is imported to mitochondria via the chaperone protein HSPA9, where it regulates transcription of mitochondrial-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) genes, thereby restoring oxidative phosphorylation and preventing cancer initiation. Germline polymorphisms of NKX3.1 associated with increased cancer risk fail to protect from oxidative stress or suppress tumorigenicity. Low expression levels of NKX3.1 combined with low expression of mitochondrial ETC genes are associated with adverse clinical outcome, whereas high levels of mitochondrial NKX3.1 protein are associated with favorable outcome. This work reveals an extranuclear role for NKX3.1 in suppression of prostate cancer by protecting mitochondrial function. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings uncover a nonnuclear function for NKX3.1 that is a key mechanism for suppression of prostate cancer. Analyses of the expression levels and subcellular localization of NKX3.1 in patients at risk of cancer progression may improve risk assessment in a precision prevention paradigm, particularly for men undergoing active surveillance.See related commentary by Finch and Baena, p. 2132.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2113.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Line,

We analyzed 130 consecutive RO for karyotypic alterations. Clonal chromosome abnormalities were identified in 63 (49%) cases, which could be categorized into three classes of mutually exclusive cytogenetic categories. Class 1 (N = 20) RO had diploid karyotypes with characteristic 11q13 rearrangement in balanced translocations with 10 or more different chromosome partners in all cases. We identified recurrent translocation partners at 5q35, 6p21, 9p24, 11p13-14, and 11q23, and confirmed that CCND1 gene rearrangement at 11q13 utilizing fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Class 2 RO (N = 25) exhibited hypodiploid karyotypes with loss of chromosome 1 and/or losses of Y in males and X in females in all cases. The class 3 tumors comprising of 18 cases showed diverse types of abnormalities with the involvement of two or more chromosomes exclusive of abnormalities seen in classes 1 and 2 tumors. Furthermore, karyotypically uninformative cases were subjected to FISH analysis to identify classes 1 and 2 abnormalities. In this group, we found similar frequencies of CCND1 rearrangement, loss of chromosome 1 or Y as with karyotypically abnormal cases. We validated our results against 91 tumors from the Mitelman database. Correlation of clinical data with all the three classes of ROs showed no clear evidence of overall patient survival. Our findings support the hypothesis that RO exhibit three principal cytogenetic categories, which may have different roles in initiation and/or progression. These cytogenetic markers provide a key tool in the diagnostic evaluation of RO.", "Keywords": ["11q13 rearrangement", "cyclin D1", "cytogenetics", "loss of chromosome 1", "renal oncocytoma"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher B", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Lipsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Subhadra V", "Last Name": "Nandula", "Affiliation": "Cancer Genetics, Inc., Rutherford, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Freeman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Matthews", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Caitlin E", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gen", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Szabolcs", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mahesh M", "Last Name": "Mansukhani", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "McKiernan", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Vundavalli V", "Last Name": "Murty", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Genes, chromosomes & cancer", "PubDate": "2020Jan"}, {"PMID": "31102625", "Title": "Optimal Trial Design for Studying Urinary Markers in Bladder Cancer: A Collaborative Review.", "Abstract": "Urine-based tumor markers are not routinely used in the diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer.

Results of a phase III prospective multicentre study of blue light flexible cystoscopy (BLFC) in surveillance of intermediate-risk and high-risk NMIBC showed that 20.6% of malignancies were identified only by BLFC. Improved detection rates in the surveillance setting are anticipated to lead to improved clinical outcomes by reducing future recurrences and earlier identification of tumours that are unresponsive to therapy.

Organoid lines can be established efficiently from patient biopsies acquired before and after disease recurrence and are interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts. Notably, organoid lines often retain parental tumor heterogeneity and exhibit a spectrum of genomic changes that are consistent with tumor evolution in culture. Analyses of drug response using bladder tumor organoids show partial correlations with mutational profiles, as well as changes associated with treatment resistance, and specific responses can be validated using xenografts in\u00a0vivo.

Partial nephrectomy historically was restricted to cases of solitary kidney or bilateral tumors.

Although partial nephrectomy preserves kidney tissue and, therefore, delays or prevents the new onset of CKD and ESRD, radical nephrectomy is still overused even for the small tumors. Studies have shown that although this practice is driven by an easier complete removal of the kidney especially in the era of minimally invasive surgery, partial nephrectomy is successful in curing cancer and achieving excellent cancer-specific survival in addition to its benefits on cardiovascular health. Nowadays interest in preserving healthy kidney tissue is increasing to the level of studying the impact of larger volume removed around the kidney and the histopathology of that non-neoplastic tissue to predict kidney function behavior postoperatively.", "Keywords": ["CKD", "ESRD", "Partial nephrectomy", "Radical nephrectomy", "Renal cell carcinoma"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Neoplasm Staging", "Nephrectomy", "Nephrons", "Organ Sparing Treatments", "Postoperative Complications", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Assessment", "Tumor Burden"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rashed A", "Last Name": "Ghandour", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Herbert Irving Cancer Center, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY.

Recently, for small renal masses, the risk of ensuing chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease has largely favored nephron-sparing surgical techniques, mainly partial nephrectomy. In this review, we surveyed the literature on renal functional outcomes after partial nephrectomy for renal tumors. The largest randomized control trial comparing radical and partial nephrectomy failed to show a survival benefit for partial nephrectomy. With regards to overall survival, surgically induced chronic kidney disease (GFR < 60 ml/min/ 1.73m2) caused by nephrectomy might not be as deleterious as medically induced chronic kidney disease. In evaluating patients who underwent donor nephrectomy, transplant literature further validates that surgically induced reductions in GFR may not affect patient survival, unlike medically induced GFR declines. Yet, because patients who present with a renal mass tend to be elderly with multiple comorbidities, many develop a mixed picture of medically, and surgically-induced renal disease after extirpative renal surgery.

Lineage-tracing demonstrates that luminal cells are favoured for organoid formation and generate basal cells in culture. Furthermore, tumour organoids can initiate from CARNs after oncogenic transformation and from mouse models of prostate cancer, and can facilitate analyses of drug response.

heterogeneous disease that requires the practicing urologist to implement a variety of surgical and non-surgical treatment strategies. The disease course can range from recurrent low grade papillary disease to aggressive disease concerning for progression from initial presentation. Depending on the particular patient and goals of care, treatments similarly span the range from minimally invasive fulgurations to immediate radical cystectomy. For most patients some form of intravesical therapy will bridge the gap between transurethral resections (TUR) and radical surgery. Recent advances in the field continue to emphasize the importance of quality TUR and its strong impact on outcomes. In addition, continued research to optimize intravesical therapies has provided more information about how, when, and in whom these agents should be utilized to enhance their efficacy.

surgical removal of the bladder (cystectomy). In the current study, we have performed preclinical studies to investigate the efficacy of intravesical delivery of chemotherapy for preventing progression of bladder cancer. We evaluated three chemotherapy agents, namely cisplatin, gemcitabine, and docetaxel, which are currently in use clinically for systemic treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer and/or have been evaluated for intravesical therapy. These preclinical studies were done using a genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model that progresses from carcinoma in situ (CIS) to invasive, metastatic bladder cancer. We performed intravesical treatment in this GEM model using cisplatin, gemcitabine, and/or docetaxel, alone or by combining two agents, and evaluated whether such treatments inhibited progression to invasive, metastatic bladder cancer. Of the three single agents tested, gemcitabine was most effective for preventing progression to invasive disease, as assessed by several relevant endpoints. However, the combinations of two agents, and particularly those including gemcitabine, were more effective for reducing both tumor and metastatic burden.
