Similarly, as the risk of sperm competition increased, males produced a larger and more attractive spermatophylax (an important non-sperm component of the ejaculate) but these traits did not vary with the intensity of sperm competition.

While stretchable electronics technologies exist, none have been widely adopted.

A strip of flexible circuitry ('e-strip') is twisted to form a helical ribbon, transforming it from flexible to stretchable. A stretchable core-in this case rubber cord-supports the structure, preventing damage from buckling. Existing helical electronics have only extended to stretchable interconnects between circuit modules, and individual components such as printed helical transistors. Fully stretchable circuits have, until now, only been produced in planar form: flat circuits, either using curved geometry to enable them to stretch, or using inherently stretchable elastomer substrates. Helical e-strips can bend along multiple axes, and repeatedly stretch between 30 and 50%, depending on core material and diameter. LED and temperature sensing helical e-strips are demonstrated, along with design rules for helical e-strip fabrication.

This can prevent the stabilization and proliferation of microorganisms. The ever-increasing levels of microbial resistance to antimicrobials are urging the development of alternative types of compounds that are potent across broad spectra of microorganisms and target different pathways. This will help to slow down the development of resistance and ideally halt it. The development of composite antimicrobial coatings (CACs) that can host and protect various antimicrobial agents and release them on demand is an approach to address this urgent need. In this work, new CACs based on microsized hybrids of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were designed using a drop-casting technique. Polyvinylpyrrolidone and mucin were used as additives. The CaCO3/AgNPs hybrids contributed to endowing colloidal stability to the AgNPs and controlling their release, thereby ensuring the antibacterial activity of the coatings. Moreover, the additives PVP and mucin served as a matrix to (i) control the distribution of the hybrids, (ii) ensure mechanical integrity, and (iii) prevent the undesired release of AgNPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques were used to characterize the 15 \u03bcm thick CAC. The antibacterial activity was determined against Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three bacteria responsible for many healthcare infections. Antibacterial performance of the hybrids was demonstrated at concentrations between 15 and 30 \u03bcg/cm2. Unloaded CaCO3 also presented bactericidal properties against MRSA. In vitro cytotoxicity tests demonstrated that the hybrids at bactericidal concentrations did not affect human dermal fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cell viability.

The opposing effects of natural and sexual selection on cuticular hydrocarbons in male black field crickets.", "Abstract": "Although many theoretical models of male sexual trait evolution assume that sexual selection is countered by natural selection, direct empirical tests of this assumption are relatively uncommon. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are known to play an important role not only in restricting evaporative water loss but also in sexual signalling in most terrestrial arthropods. Insects adjusting their CHC layer for optimal desiccation resistance is often thought to come at the expense of successful sexual attraction, suggesting that natural and sexual selection are in opposition for this trait. In this study, we sampled the CHCs of male black field crickets (Teleogryllus commodus) using solid-phase microextraction and then either measured their evaporative water loss or mating success. We then used multivariate selection analysis to quantify the strength and form of natural and sexual selection targeting male CHCs. Both natural and sexual selection imposed significant linear and stabilizing selection on male CHCs, although for very different combinations. Natural selection largely favoured an increase in the total abundance of CHCs, especially those with a longer chain length. In contrast, mating success peaked at a lower total abundance of CHCs and declined as CHC abundance increased. However, mating success did improve with an increase in a number of specific CHC components that also increased evaporative water loss. Importantly, this resulted in the combination of male CHCs favoured by natural selection and sexual selection being strongly opposing. Our findings suggest that the balance between natural and sexual selection is likely to play an important role in the evolution of male CHCs in T. commodus and may help explain why CHCs are so divergent across populations and species.", "Keywords": ["cuticular hydrocarbons", "field cricket", "natural selection", "sexual selection"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Male", "Sexual Selection", "Mating Preference, Animal", "Gryllidae", "Beauty", "Hydrocarbons"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology & Conservation, School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, UK."}, {"First Name": "Zachariah", "Last Name": "Wylde", "Affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Hawkesbury Campus, Penrith, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Enrique", "Last Name": "Del Castillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering and Department of Statistics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Rapkin", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology & Conservation, School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, UK."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa M", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Hawkesbury Campus, Penrith, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology & Conservation, School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, UK."}], "Journal": "Journal of evolutionary biology", "PubDate": "2023Sep"}, {"PMID": "37398404", "Title": "Comparative genetic, biochemical, and biophysical analyses of the four E. coli ABCF paralogs support distinct functions related to mRNA translation.", "Abstract": "Multiple paralogous ABCF ATPases are encoded in most genomes, but the physiological functions remain unknown for most of them.

Furthermore, the prevalence of covert (i.e., asymptomatic) infections within insect populations is becoming increasingly apparent, yet we do not fully understand the mechanisms that maintain low viral loads. In the present study, we measured the expression of several genes across multiple immune pathways in Gryllodes sigillatus crickets with an overt or covert infection of cricket iridovirus (CrIV). Crickets with overt infections had higher relative expression of key pathway component genes across the Toll, Imd, Jak/STAT, and RNAi pathways.

A stress-recovery imbalance can lead to negative states of overtraining. Hormonal alterations associated with intensified training, such as blunted cortisol, may impair the immune response. Cortisol promotes the maturation and migration of dendritic cells which subsequently stimulate the T cell response. However, there are currently no clear reliable biomarkers to highlight the overtraining syndrome. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effect of intensified training on immune cells. Outcomes from this could provide insight into whether these markers may be used as an indicator of negative states of overtraining. Methods: SPORTDiscus, PUBMED, Academic Search Complete, Scopus and Web of Science were searched until June 2022. Included articles reported on immune biomarkers relating to lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and cytokines before and after a period of intensified training, in humans and rodents, at rest and in response to exercise. Results: 164 full texts were screened for eligibility. Across 57 eligible studies, 16 immune biomarkers were assessed. 7 were assessed at rest and in response to a bout of exercise, and 9 assessed at rest only. Included lymphocyte markers were CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell count, NK cell count, NK Cytolytic activity, lymphocyte proliferation and CD4/CD8 ratio. Dendritic cell markers examined were CD80, CD86, and MHC II expression. Cytokines included IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. A period of intensified training significantly decreased resting total lymphocyte (d= -0.57, 95% CI -0.30) and CD8+ T cell counts (d= -0.37, 95% CI -0.04), and unstimulated plasma IL-1\u03b2 levels (d= -0.63, 95% CI -0.17). Resting dendritic cell CD86 expression significantly increased (d = 2.18, 95% CI 4.07). All other biomarkers remained unchanged. Conclusion: Although some biomarkers alter after a period of intensified training, definitive immune biomarkers are limited.

While males often attempt to use these gifts to influence female behaviour to their own advantage, females can evolve counter mechanisms. In decorated crickets, the male's nuptial gift comprises part of the spermatophore, the spermatophylax, the feeding on which deters the female from prematurely terminating sperm transfer. However, ingested compounds in the spermatophylax and attachment of the sperm-containing ampulla could further influence female physiology and behaviour. We investigated how mating per se and these two distinct routes of potential male-mediated manipulation influence the female transcriptomic response. We conducted an RNA sequencing experiment on gut and head tissues from females for whom nuptial food gift consumption and receipt of an ejaculation were independently manipulated. In the gut tissue, we found that females not permitted to feed during mating exhibited decreased overall gene expression, possibly caused by a reduced gut function, but this was countered by feeding on the spermatophylax or a sham gift. In the head tissue, we found only low numbers of differentially expressed genes, but a gene co-expression network analysis revealed that ampulla attachment and spermatophylax consumption independently induce distinct gene expression patterns. This study provides evidence that spermatophylax feeding alters the female post-mating transcriptomic response in decorated crickets, highlighting its potential to mediate sexual conflict in this system.", "Keywords": ["Gryllodes sigillatus", "nuptial food gift", "sexual conflict", "sexual evolution", "transcriptomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Male", "Female", "Sexual Behavior, Animal", "Gryllidae", "Gift Giving", "Transcriptome", "Feeding Behavior", "Semen", "Reproduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bert", "Last Name": "Foquet", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution & Systematics Section, School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Rapkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall, UK."}, {"First Name": "Manmohan D", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Center for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ben M", "Last Name": "Sadd", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution & Systematics Section, School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott K", "Last Name": "Sakaluk", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution & Systematics Section, School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Center for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall, UK."}], "Journal": "Journal of evolutionary biology", "PubDate": "2023Jan"}, {"PMID": "36309083", "Title": "Ovarian apoptosis is regulated by carbohydrate intake but not by protein intake in speckled cockroaches.", "Abstract": "When the likelihood of reproducing successfully is low, any prior investment in developing oocytes may be wasted. One means of recouping this investment is oosorption - where ova are absorbed and resources salvaged so they can be re-allocated to other traits. Food-limited female speckled cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea) appear to use this strategy. However, it is unclear if total food intake or the availability of specific nutrients induces this process. Here, we used the geometric framework of nutrition to determine how protein, carbohydrate and energy intake affect levels of ovarian apoptosis and necrosis (controlled versus uncontrolled cell death) in the terminal oocytes of female N. cinerea. We then compare the effects of nutrient intake on apoptosis (a key step towards oosorption) and offspring production to better understand the relationship between diet, apoptosis and female fitness. We found that even when food was abundant, females experienced high levels of apoptosis if their diet lacked carbohydrate. Necrosis was reduced when energy intake was high, but largely irrespective of nutrient ratio. Offspring production peaked on a low protein, high carbohydrate nutrient ratio (1P:7.96C), similar to that which minimized apoptosis (1P:7.34C) but not in the region of nutrient space that minimized necrosis. Thus, females consuming an ideal nutrient blend for reproduction can invest heavily in their current brood without needing to salvage nutrients from developing ova. However, offspring production was more dependent on carbohydrate consumption than apoptosis was, suggesting that the importance of carbohydrate in reproduction goes beyond regulating oosorption.

For epidermolysis bullosa\u00a0(EB), a debilitating group of fragile skin disorders currently without a cure, skin blistering can often be severe and heal poorly, increasing susceptibility to life-threatening complications. To prevent these, investigational therapies have been exploring the use of tissue-engineered skin substitutes\u00a0(TESSs) aimed at replacing damaged skin and promoting long-term wound closure. These products have either been developed in house or commercially sourced and are composed of\u00a0allogeneic or autologous human skin cells, often with some form of bioscaffolding. They can be broadly classified based on their cellular composition: keratinocytes (epidermal substitutes), fibroblasts (dermal substitutes) or a combination of both (composite substitutes). Encouraging long-term wound healing has been achieved with epidermal substitutes. However, these substitutes have not demonstrated the same efficacy for all patients, which may be due to the molecular heterogeneity observed between EB\u00a0subtypes. Autologous composite\u00a0TESSs, which more closely resemble native human skin, are therefore being investigated and may hold promise for treating an extended range of patients. Additionally, future TESSs\u00a0for EB\u00a0are focused on using gene-corrected patient skin cells, which have already demonstrated remarkable long-term wound\u00a0healing capabilities. In this review, we provide an overview of the different TESSs\u00a0that have been investigated in clinical studies to treat patients with EB, as well as their long-term wound\u00a0healing results.

One patient succumbed to their injuries whereas three were able to clear their infection with medical and surgical intervention. The surviving patients all had an infection of their lower extremity whereas the deceased patient had more extensive disease involving the thorax. Conclusions: Mucormycosis is a rare but significant post-trauma complication with substantial morbidity and mortality. Surgeons should be aware of this complication and maintain a high clinical suspicion because afflicted patients may not match the traditional clinical picture of a mucormycosis-susceptible patient.

We use nine highly inbred lines to thoroughly examine the genetic relationships between a suite of commonly used immune assays (haemocyte count, implant encapsulation, total phenoloxidase activity, antibacterial zone of inhibition and pathogen clearance) and resistance to infection by three generalist insect pathogens (the gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens, the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus cereus and the fungus Metarhizium robertsii) in male and female Gryllodes sigillatus. There were consistent positive genetic correlations between haemocyte count, antibacterial and phenoloxidase activity and resistance to S. marcescens in both sexes, but these relationships were less consistent for resistance to B. cereus and M. robertsii. In addition, the clearance of S. marcescens was genetically correlated with the resistance to all three pathogens in both sexes. Genetic correlations between resistances to the different pathogen species were inconsistent, indicating that resistance to one pathogen does not necessarily mean resistance to another. Finally, while there is ample genetic (co)variance in immune assays and pathogen resistance, these genetic estimates differed across the sexes and many of these measures were not genetically correlated across the sexes, suggesting that these measures could evolve independently in the sexes. Our finding that the genetic architecture of immune function is sex and pathogen specific suggests that the evolution of immune function in male and female G. sigillatus is likely to be complex. Similar quantitative genetic studies that measure a large number of assays and resistance to multiple pathogens in both sexes are needed to ascertain if this complexity extends to other species.", "Keywords": ["disease resistance", "ecological immunity", "immune assay", "insect", "pathogen", "sexual dimorphism"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Female", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Gram-Positive Bacteria", "Gryllidae", "Male", "Monophenol Monooxygenase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Corinne", "Last Name": "Letendre", "Affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Richmond, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Kristin R", "Last Name": "Duffield", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ben M", "Last Name": "Sadd", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott K", "Last Name": "Sakaluk", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa M", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Richmond, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Richmond, NSW, Australia."}], "Journal": "The Journal of animal ecology", "PubDate": "2022Jul"}, {"PMID": "35435022", "Title": "Prehospital Tourniquets Placed on Limbs Without Major Vascular Injuries, Has the Pendulum Swung Too Far?", "Abstract": "Combat applications of tourniquets for extremity trauma have led to increased civilian prehospital tourniquet use.

Here, we investigate the reliability of design heuristics and a coarse-grain molecular simulation in predicting the optimum sites for covalent immobilization of TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase. We utilized Escherichia coli-lysate-based cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) to produce variants containing a site-specific incorporated unnatural amino acid with a unique moiety to facilitate site directed covalent immobilization. To constrain the number of potential immobilization sites, we investigated the predictive capability of several design heuristics. The suitability of immobilization sites was determined by analyzing expression yields, specific activity, immobilization efficiency, and stability of variants. These experimental findings are compared with coarse-grain simulation of TEM-1 domain stability and thermal stability and analyzed for a priori predictive capabilities. This work demonstrates that the design heuristics successfully identify a subset of locations for experimental validation. Specifically, the nucleotide following amber stop codon and domain stability correlate well with the expression yield and specific activity of the variants, respectively.

Although this relationship is likely to differ between the sexes, we lack data relating diet to male reproductive traits. One exception to this general pattern is Drosophila melanogaster, where male dietary intake was quantified using the CApillary FEeder (CAFE) method. However, CAFE feeding reduces D. melanogaster survival and reproduction, so may distort diet-fitness outcomes. Here, we use the Geometric Framework of Nutrition to create nutrient landscapes that map sex-specific relationships between protein, carbohydrate, lifespan and reproduction in D. melanogaster. Rather than creating landscapes with consumption data, we map traits onto the nutrient composition of forty agar-based diets, generating broad coverage of nutrient space. We find that male and female lifespan was maximised on low protein, high carbohydrate blends (~\u20091P:15.9C). This nutrient ratio also maximised male reproductive rates, but females required more protein to maximise daily fecundity (1P:1.22C). These results are consistent with CAFE assay outcomes. However, the approach employed here improved female fitness relative to CAFE assays, while effects of agar versus CAFE feeding on male fitness traits depended on the nutrient composition of experimental diets. We suggest that informative nutrient landscapes can be made without measuring individual nutrient intake and that in many cases, this may be preferable to using the CAFE approach. The most appropriate method will depend on the question and species being studied, but the approach adopted here has the advantage of creating nutritional landscapes when dietary intake is hard to quantify.", "Keywords": ["CAFE assays", "Caloric restriction", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Geometric framework of nutrition", "Longevity", "Reproduction"], "MeSH terms": ["Agar", "Animals", "Carbohydrates", "Diet", "Diet, Protein-Restricted", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Eating", "Female", "Longevity", "Male", "Proteins", "Reproduction", "Sex Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew R", "Last Name": "Carey", "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "C Ruth", "Last Name": "Archer", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Cornwall, UK."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Rapkin", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Cornwall, UK."}, {"First Name": "Meaghan", "Last Name": "Castledine", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Cornwall, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kim", "Last Name": "Jensen", "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science - ANIS Nutrition, Aarhus University, Tjele, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa M", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Hawkesbury Campus, Richmond, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Hosken", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Cornwall, UK."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Hawkesbury Campus, Richmond, NSW, Australia.

The order Clostridiales was also present at relatively high abundances in the lesion tissue of three species compared to healthy and unaffected tissues.

In this work, the advantages of CFPS are further leveraged and combined with kinetic analysis, autoradiography, and western blot to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this biosensor. Additionally, mathematical simulations of enzyme kinetics are used to optimize the biosensor assay, ultimately lengthening its readable window by five-fold and improving sensor signal strength by two-fold.

The direction and magnitude of this carbon-climate feedback are uncertain, largely due to lack of knowledge of the thermal adaptation of the physiology and composition of soil microbial communities. Here, we applied the macromolecular rate theory (MMRT) to describe the temperature response of the microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) in a natural long-term warming experiment in a geothermally active area in New Zealand. Our objective was to test whether microbial communities adapt to long-term warming with a shift in their composition and their temperature response that are consistent with evolutionary theory of trade-offs between enzyme structure and function. We characterized the microbial community composition (using metabarcoding) and the temperature response of microbial decomposition of SOM (using MMRT) of soils sampled along transects of increasing distance from a geothermally active zone comprising two biomes (a shrubland and a grassland) and sampled at two depths (0-50 and 50-100\u00a0mm), such that ambient soil temperature and soil carbon concentration varied widely and independently. We found that the different environments were hosting microbial communities with distinct compositions, with thermophile and thermotolerant genera increasing in relative abundance with increasing ambient temperature. However, the ambient temperature had no detectable influence on the MMRT parameters or the relative temperature sensitivity of decomposition (Q10 ). MMRT parameters were, however, strongly correlated with soil carbon concentration and carbon:nitrogen ratio. Our findings suggest that, while long-term warming selects for warm-adapted taxa, substrate quality and quantity exert a stronger influence than temperature in selecting for distinct thermal traits.

CKD has become a major health problem due to its challenging detection at early stages when clear symptoms are yet to be presented. Thus, CKD is likely to be identified when the substantive conditions of the disease\u00a0are manifest. In order to address the development of the disease and provide necessary treatments at the initial stage, the investigation of new biomarkers and metabolites associated with early detection of CKD are needed. Identified\u00a0metabolites could be used to confirm the presence of the disease, obtain information on its mechanism and facilitate the development of novel pharmaceutical treatments.

Both molecules contain quinolines that, while being present in successful medicines, are known to be potentially susceptible to oxidative metabolism. Efforts to swap this quinoline with an alternative aromatic system led to the discovery of 2,3-disubstituted pyridines as suitable replacements. Further optimization, which included lowering ClogP in combination with strategic fluorine incorporation, led to the discovery of compound 29, a potent, selective IDO1 inhibitor with robust

Here, we used an integrated approach including X-ray crystallography, genetics, and molecular biology to investigate the function and structure of YhcB. The Escherichia coli yhcB KO strain does not grow at 45 \u00b0C and is hypersensitive to cell wall-acting antibiotics, even in the stationary phase. The deletion of yhcB leads to filamentation, abnormal FtsZ ring formation, and aberrant septum development. The Z-ring is essential for the positioning of the septa and the initiation of cell division. We found that YhcB interacts with proteins of the divisome (e.g., FtsI, FtsQ) and elongasome (e.g., RodZ, RodA). Seven of these interactions are also conserved in Yersinia pestis and/or Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, we mapped the amino acid residues likely involved in the interactions of YhcB with FtsI and RodZ. The 2.8\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of the cytosolic domain of Haemophilus ducreyi YhcB shows a unique tetrameric \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure likely to be involved in linking the Z-ring to the septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing complexes. In summary, YhcB is a conserved and conditionally essential protein that plays a role in cell division and consequently affects envelope biogenesis. Based on these findings, we propose to rename YhcB to ZapG (Z-ring-associated protein G).

CFTR is composed of two membrane spanning domains, two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and a largely unstructured R-domain. Multiple CF-causing mutations reside in the NBDs and some are known to compromise the stability of these domains. The ability to predict the effect of mutations on the stability of the cytosolic domains of CFTR and to shed light on the mechanisms by which they exert their effect is therefore important in CF research. With this in mind, we have predicted the effect on domain stability of 59 mutations in NBD1 and NBD2 using 15 different algorithms and evaluated their performances via comparison to experimental data using several metrics including the correct classification rate (CCR), and the squared Pearson correlation (R2) and Spearman's correlation (\u03c1) calculated between the experimental \u0394Tm values and the computationally predicted \u0394\u0394G values. Overall, the best results were obtained with FoldX and Rosetta. For NBD1 (35 mutations), FoldX provided R2 and \u03c1 values of 0.64 and -0.71, respectively, with an 86% correct classification rate (CCR). For NBD2 (24 mutations), FoldX R2, \u03c1, and CCR were 0.51, -0.73, and 75%, respectively. Application of the Rosetta high-resolution protocol (Rosetta_hrp) to NBD1 yielded R2, \u03c1, and CCR of 0.64, -0.75, and 69%, respectively, and for NBD2 yielded R2, \u03c1, and CCR of 0.29, -0.27, and 50%, respectively. The corresponding numbers for the Rosetta's low-resolution protocol (Rosetta_lrp) were R2 = 0.47, \u03c1 = -0.69, and CCR = 69% for NBD1 and R2 = 0.27, \u03c1 = -0.24, and CCR = 63% for NBD2. For NBD1, both algorithms suggest that destabilizing mutations suffer from destabilizing vdW clashes, whereas stabilizing mutations benefit from favorable H-bond interactions. Two triple consensus approaches based on FoldX, Rosetta_lpr, and Rosetta_hpr were attempted using either \"majority-voting\" or \"all-voting\". The all-voting consensus outperformed the individual predictors, albeit on a smaller data set. In summary, our results suggest that the effect of mutations on the stability of CFTR's NBDs could be largely predicted. Since NBDs are common to all ABC transporters, these results may find use in predicting the effect and mechanism of the action of multiple disease-causing mutations in other proteins.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Binding Sites", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator", "Humans", "Ion Transport", "Mutation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Malkeet Singh", "Last Name": "Bahia", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 5290002, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Netaly", "Last Name": "Khazanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 5290002, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Qingxian", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhengrong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "702 Fairchild Center, MC3423, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jeong S", "Last Name": "Hong", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30303, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andras", "Last Name": "Rab", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30303, United States."}, {"First Name": "Eric J", "Last Name": "Sorscher", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30303, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christie G", "Last Name": "Brouillette", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, United States."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "702 Fairchild Center, MC3423, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hanoch", "Last Name": "Senderowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 5290002, Israel."}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "PubDate": "2021Apr26"}, {"PMID": "33603977", "Title": "Discovery and Preclinical Evaluation of BMS-986242, a Potent, Selective Inhibitor of Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1.", "Abstract": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a heme-containing dioxygenase enzyme implicated in cancer immune response.

irrigated and unirrigated pastures?", "Abstract": "Previous soil sampling from grazed pastures in New Zealand compared the changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) in adjacent irrigated and unirrigated portions of the same paddocks. It showed that irrigated portions had lower SOC stocks than unirrigated portions, with an average difference of 7.0 tC ha-1 or 0.6 tC ha-1\u00a0yr-1. These findings have formed the basis of an assessment for the net effect of conversion of New Zealand's grazed pastures to irrigation. However, since cattle could move freely between irrigated and unirrigated portions of the studied paddocks, there could have been different grazing intensities and/or excreta transfer between the irrigated and unirrigated portions of the same paddocks. Both these factors could have affected SOC stocks. In this study, we used the process-based model, CenW, to simulate the consequences of this possible carbon transfer via animal excreta and different grazing intensities. We found that the observed increase of 0.6 tC ha-1\u00a0yr-1 in SOC stock in the unirrigated portions could result from a transfer of 20% excreta from the irrigated to unirrigated portions (with an area ratio of 6:1) of a paddock and with the unirrigated portions being grazed only lightly with 2.0 tDM ha-1 in foliage biomass residuals remaining after grazing. That means that the observed higher SOC stocks in the unirrigated portions could potentially be attributable to the behaviour of grazing animals. We suggest that a realistic extent of carbon transfer and/or differences in grazing intensities could be sufficient to account for the observed differences in SOC stocks even if irrigation per se caused no differences in carbon stocks. It is therefore inappropriate to ascribe the change of SOC to irrigation effects based on experimental findings where SOC changes can be affected by the behaviour of grazing animals.", "Keywords": ["Carbon transfer", "CenW", "Grazed pastures", "Irrigation", "Modelling", "SOC stocks"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Biomass", "Carbon", "Cattle", "New Zealand", "Soil"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "L\u00ecy\u01d0n L", "Last Name": "Li\u00e1ng", "Affiliation": "Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, Private Bag 11052, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.

Females from three distinct genotypic backgrounds were left unmated or singly mated in a fully reciprocal design to males from the same three genotypic backgrounds. Hemocytes and hemocyte microaggregations were quantified for female cellular immunity, and phenoloxidase, involved in melanization, and antibacterial activity for humoral immunity. In this system, female cellular immunity was more reactive to mating, and mating effects were genotype-dependent. Specifically, for hemocytes, a genotype-by-mating status interaction mediated the effect of mating per se, and a significant male-female genotype-by-genotype interaction determined hemocyte depletion post mating. Microaggregations were influenced by the female's genotype or that of her mate. Female humoral immune measures were unaffected, indicating that the propensity for post-mating effects on females is dependent on the component of baseline immunity. The genotype-by-genotype effect on hemocytes supports a role of sexual conflict in post-mating immune suppression, suggesting divergence of male genotypes with respect to modification of female post-mating immunity, and divergence of female genotypes in resistance to these effects.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Genotype", "Gryllidae", "Immunity, Humoral", "Male", "Reproduction", "Sexual Behavior, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kylie J", "Last Name": "Hampton", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristin R", "Last Name": "Duffield", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Health and the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Scott K", "Last Name": "Sakaluk", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ben M", "Last Name": "Sadd", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, USA. bmsadd@ilstu.edu."}], "Journal": "Heredity", "PubDate": "2021Mar"}, {"PMID": "33176607", "Title": "Current Advances on the Regeneration of Musculoskeletal Interfaces.", "Abstract": "The regeneration of the musculoskeletal system has been widely investigated.

Their inability to regenerate can delay the tissue repair and regeneration process, leading to graft instability, high morbidity, and pain. Moreover, the knowledge of the mechanism of tissue interface development is not complete. This review presents an overview of the most recent approaches of the regeneration of musculoskeletal interfaces, including the latest in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies. Impact statement Interfaces between soft and hard tissues are ubiquitous within the body. These transition zones are crucial for joint motion, stabilisation and load transfer between tissues, but do not seem to regenerate well after injury or deterioration. The knowledge about their biology is vast, but little is known about their development. Various musculoskeletal disorders in combination with risk factors including aging and unhealthy lifestyle, can lead to local imbalances, misalignments, inflammation, pain and restricted mobility. Our manuscript reviews the current approaches taken to promote the regeneration of musculoskeletal interfaces through in vitro, pre-clinical and clinical studies.", "Keywords": ["clinical studies", "in vitro and in vivo", "musculoskeletal interfaces", "tissue regeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Musculoskeletal Diseases", "Musculoskeletal System", "Regeneration", "Tissue Engineering", "Wound Healing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Balestri", "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering and School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Mathematics, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Medical Technologies and Advanced Materials, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Yvonne", "Last Name": "Reinwald", "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering and School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Tissue engineering.

The pathogen is unknown, but its epizoology indicates that the disease, facilitated by water currents, has progressed linearly along the tract, affecting reefs at the scale of hundreds of kilometers. To inform ongoing disease mitigation efforts, we examined the small-scale spatial and temporal epidemiology of SCTLD. We established a series of sites in the middle Florida Keys at offshore and inshore locations that had not yet shown signs of SCTLD. We then conducted high-frequency monitoring from February 2018 through September 2019 and documented the onset of SCTLD and its progression through the sites. SCTLD was first observed at one site during early February 2018 and by early March 2018 all sites showed signs of the disease. A dynamic multistate model suggested that disease transmission was independent of coral density and found little evidence of a positive association between a colony showing signs of SCTLD and the condition or distance to its neighboring colonies. The model did, however, indicate that the probability of a colony showing signs of SCTLD increased with increasing colony surface area. These results are consistent with the water-borne transmission of a pathogen that progressed rapidly through the survey area. However, by the end of our survey the progression of SCTLD had slowed, particularly at inshore sites. Many affected colonies no longer exhibited progressive tissue mortality typical of the disease, suggesting the existence of differentially resilient colonies or coral communities, meriting their use for future coral rescue and propagation and disease research. These results are useful for refining ongoing SCTLD mitigation strategies, particularly by determining when disease rates are sufficiently low for direct intervention efforts designed to arrest disease progression on individual coral colonies will be most effective.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anthozoa", "Coral Reefs", "Environmental Monitoring", "Florida", "Population Dynamics", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William C", "Last Name": "Sharp", "Affiliation": "Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Marathon, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Colin P", "Last Name": "Shea", "Affiliation": "Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, St. Petersburg, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kerry E", "Last Name": "Maxwell", "Affiliation": "Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Marathon, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Erinn M", "Last Name": "Muller", "Affiliation": "Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium, Sarasota, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John H", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Marathon, Florida, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33144999", "Title": "Macronutrient intake and simulated infection threat independently affect life history traits of male decorated crickets.", "Abstract": "Nutritional geometry has advanced our understanding of how macronutrients (e.g., proteins and carbohydrates) influence the expression of life history traits and their corresponding trade-offs. For example, recent work has revealed that reproduction and immune function in male decorated crickets are optimized at very different protein:carbohydrate (P:C) dietary ratios. However, it is unclear how an individual's macronutrient intake interacts with its perceived infection status to determine investment in reproduction or other key life history traits. Here, we employed a fully factorial design in which calling effort and immune function were quantified for male crickets fed either diets previously demonstrated to maximize calling effort (P:C\u00a0=\u00a01:8) or immune function (P:C\u00a0=\u00a05:1), and then administered a treatment from a spectrum of increasing infection cue intensity using heat-killed bacteria. Both diet and a simulated infection threat independently influenced the survival, immunity, and reproductive effort of males. If they called, males increased calling effort at the low infection cue dose, consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis, but interpretation of responses at the higher threat levels was hampered by the differential mortality of males across infection cue and diet treatments. A high protein, low carbohydrate diet severely reduced the health, survival, and overall fitness of male crickets. There was, however, no evidence of an interaction between diet and infection cue dose on calling effort, suggesting that the threshold for terminal investment was not contingent on diet as investigated here.", "Keywords": ["cricket", "diet", "immunity", "life history theory", "reproductive effort", "terminal investment"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kristin R", "Last Name": "Duffield", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution and Systematics Section School of Biological Sciences Illinois State University Normal IL USA."}, {"First Name": "Kylie J", "Last Name": "Hampton", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution and Systematics Section School of Biological Sciences Illinois State University Normal IL USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas M", "Last Name": "Houslay", "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology University of Cambridge Cambridge UK."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Rapkin", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation University of Exeter Penryn UK."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation University of Exeter Penryn UK."}, {"First Name": "Ben M", "Last Name": "Sadd", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution and Systematics Section School of Biological Sciences Illinois State University Normal IL USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott K", "Last Name": "Sakaluk", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution and Systematics Section School of Biological Sciences Illinois State University Normal IL USA."}], "Journal": "Ecology and evolution", "PubDate": "2020Oct"}, {"PMID": "33135152", "Title": "ABC-F translation factors: from antibiotic resistance to immune response.", "Abstract": "Energy-dependent translational throttle A (EttA) from Escherichia coli is a paradigmatic ABC-F protein that controls the first step in polypeptide elongation on the ribosome according to the cellular energy status.

Accordingly, analytical techniques continue to evolve that address these challenges to reveal the characteristics of ecological systems and inform conservation actions. We applied multiple statistical learning algorithms (i.e., machine learning) with a range of information sources including fish tracking data, environmental data, and visual surveys to identify potential spawning aggregation sites for a marine fish species, permit (Trachinotus falcatus), in the Florida Keys. Recognizing the potential complementarity and some level of uncertainty in each information source, we applied supervised (classic and conditional random forests; RF) and unsupervised (fuzzy k-means; FKM) algorithms. The two RF models had similar predictive performance, but generated different predictor variable importance structures and spawning site predictions. Unsupervised clustering using FKM identified unique site groupings that were similar to the likely spawning sites identified with RF. The conservation of aggregate spawning fish species depends heavily on the protection of key spawning sites; many of these potential sites were identified here for permit in the Florida Keys, which consisted of relatively deep-water natural and artificial reefs with high mean permit residency periods.

However, the severity of the disease among the elderly as well as in individuals with underlying health conditions has caused significant mortality rates worldwide. Understanding this variance amongst different sectors of society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk to be determined to enable strategies to be applied to different groups. Long-established compartmental epidemiological models like SIR and SEIR do not account for the variability encountered in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups. The objective of this study is to investigate how a reduction in the exposure of vulnerable individuals to COVID-19 can minimise the number of deaths caused by the disease, using the UK as a case study. To overcome the limitation of long-established compartmental epidemiological models, it is proposed that a modified model, namely SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A Monte Carlo simulation (100,000 runs) along the proposed SEIR-v model is used to study the number of deaths which could be avoided as a function of the decrease in the exposure of vulnerable individuals to the disease. The results indicate a large number of deaths could be avoided by a slight realistic decrease in the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. The mean values across the simulations indicate 3681 and 7460 lives could be saved when such exposure is reduced by 10% and 20% respectively. From the encouraging results of the modelling a number of mechanisms are proposed to limit the exposure of vulnerable individuals to the disease. One option could be the provision of a wristband to vulnerable people and those without a smartphone and contact-tracing app, filling the gap created by systems relying on smartphone apps only. By combining very dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be protected and kept safer.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "contact tracing", "coronavirus", "epidemiological model", "infection spread modelling", "personal protective equipment"], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "Contact Tracing", "Coronavirus Infections", "Disease Outbreaks", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Health Planning Guidelines", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Infection Control", "Inventions", "Models, Theoretical", "Pandemics", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Preventive Health Services", "Public Health", "Public Health Administration", "Quarantine", "United Kingdom", "Vulnerable Populations"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dario Ortega", "Last Name": "Anderez", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham NG11 8NS, UK."}, {"First Name": "Eiman", "Last Name": "Kanjo", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham NG11 8NS, UK."}, {"First Name": "Ganna", "Last Name": "Pogrebna", "Affiliation": "Business School, The University of Sydney, Abercrombie Building H70, Darlington, NSW 2006, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Omprakash", "Last Name": "Kaiwartya", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham NG11 8NS, UK."}, {"First Name": "Shane D", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Jill Dando Institute, University College London (UCL), 35 Tavistock Square, London WC1H 9EZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "John Alan", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Medical Technologies Innovation Facility, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham NG11 8NS, UK."}], "Journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "PubDate": "2020Sep02"}, {"PMID": "32464589", "Title": "Twin-to-twin transmission of transient abnormal myelopoiesis without constitutional trisomy 21: A case report.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["AML (D015470)", "Diseases in twins (D004200)", "GATA1 (D050982)", "Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (C563551)", "Trisomy 21 (D004314)"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Diseases in Twins", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Leukemoid Reaction", "Prognosis", "Twins, Monozygotic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander S", "Last Name": "Roseman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Baystate Children's Hospital/University of Massachusetts Medical School, Springfield, MA, USA; Department of Medicine, Baystate Medical Center/University of Massachusetts Medical School, Springfield, MA, USA.

To examine this, we tested three predictions to explain geographic variation in long- versus short-range sexual signals across a 3,500\u00a0+\u00a0km transect of two related Australian field cricket species (Teleogryllus spp.): (a) selection for species recognition, (b) environmental adaptation and (c) stochastic divergence. We measured male calling song and male and female cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in offspring derived from wild populations, reared under common garden conditions. Song clearly differentiated the species, and no hybrids were observed suggesting that hybridization is rare or absent. Spatial variation in song was not predicted by geography, genetics or climatic factors in either species. In contrast, CHC divergence was strongly associated with an environmental gradient supporting the idea that the climatic environment selects more directly upon these chemical signals. In light of recently advocated models of diversification via ecological selection on secondary sexual traits, the different environmental associations we found for song and CHCs suggest that the impact of ecological selection on population divergence, and how that influences speciation, might be different for acoustic versus chemical signals.", "Keywords": ["Teleogryllus", "acoustic signalling", "character displacement", "chemical signalling", "ecological speciation", "environmental selection", "multi-modal signalling", "sexual selection"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Biological", "Animal Communication", "Animals", "Climate", "Female", "Gryllidae", "Hydrocarbons", "Male", "Reproductive Isolation", "Sexual Behavior, Animal", "Sexual Selection", "Species Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter A", "Last Name": "Moran", "Affiliation": "Centre for Biological Diversity, School of Biology, University of St Andrews, Fife, UK."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Health, Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Health, Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Michael G", "Last Name": "Ritchie", "Affiliation": "Centre for Biological Diversity, School of Biology, University of St Andrews, Fife, UK."}, {"First Name": "Nathan W", "Last Name": "Bailey", "Affiliation": "Centre for Biological Diversity, School of Biology, University of St Andrews, Fife, UK."}], "Journal": "Journal of evolutionary biology", "PubDate": "2020Jul"}, {"PMID": "32055408", "Title": "Field cricket genome reveals the footprint of recent, abrupt adaptation in the wild.", "Abstract": "Evolutionary adaptation is generally thought to occur through incremental mutational steps, but large mutational leaps can occur during its early stages.

Here, we report genomic consequences of recent, adaptive song loss in a Hawaiian population of field crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus). A discrete genetic variant, flatwing, appeared and spread approximately 15 years ago. Flatwing erases sound-producing veins on male wings. These silent flatwing males are protected from a lethal, eavesdropping parasitoid fly. We sequenced, assembled and annotated the cricket genome, produced a linkage map, and identified a flatwing quantitative trait locus covering a large region of the X chromosome. Gene expression profiling showed that flatwing is associated with extensive genome-wide effects on embryonic gene expression. We found that flatwing male crickets express feminized chemical pheromones. This male feminizing effect, on a different sexual signaling modality, is genetically associated with the flatwing genotype.

Most studies attempting to explain this diversity have focused on testing the major hypotheses of genital evolution (the lock-and-key, pleiotropy, and sexual selection hypotheses), and quantifying the form of selection targeting male genitals has played an important role in this endeavor. However, we currently know far less about selection targeting female genitals or how male and female genitals interact during mating. Here, we use formal selection analysis to show that genital size and shape is subject to strong multivariate stabilizing sexual selection in both sexes of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Moreover, we show significant sexual selection on the covariance between the sexes for specific aspects of genital shape suggesting that male and female genitalia also interact to determine the successful transfer of a spermatophore during mating. Our work therefore highlights the important role that both male and female genital morphologies play in determining mating success and that these effects can occur independently, as well as through their interaction. Moreover, it cautions against the overly simplistic view that the sexual selection targeting genital morphology will always be directional in form and restricted primarily to males.", "Keywords": ["Fitness peak", "genitals", "lock-and-key hypothesis", "selection analysis"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Female", "Genitalia, Female", "Genitalia, Male", "Male", "Sexual Selection", "Tribolium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Clarissa", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Health and Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Richmond, NSW, 2753, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Tunstall", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall, TR10 9EZ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Rapkin", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall, TR10 9EZ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Mathilda J", "Last Name": "Bale", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall, TR10 9EZ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Gage", "Affiliation": "School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Enrique", "Last Name": "Del Castillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering and Department of Statistics, Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania, 16802."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "School of Science and Health and Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Richmond, NSW, 2753, Australia."}], "Journal": "Evolution; international journal of organic evolution", "PubDate": "2020May"}, {"PMID": "31881342", "Title": "The Impact of Drug and Alcohol Intoxication on Glasgow Coma Scale Assessment in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.", "Abstract": "The effect of intoxicating substances on assessment of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in the trauma setting has not been completely elucidated.", "Keywords": ["Glasgow coma scale", "Intoxication", "Traumatic brain injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alcoholic Intoxication", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Glasgow Coma Scale", "Head Injuries, Closed", "Hematoma, Subdural", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "Substance-Related Disorders", "United States", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anthony M", "Last Name": "DiGiorgio", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.

There was a high level of connectivity between nearshore flats (i.e., <3 m water depth) and the Florida reef tract (FRT; 15-40\u2009m water depth), with 75% of individuals detected in both habitats. These locations probably function primarily as foraging and spawning habitats, respectively. Permit occupancy on the FRT peaked during the months of March-September, with the highest number of individuals occurring there in April and May. Specific sites on the FRT were identified as potentially important spawning locations, as they attracted a high proportion of individuals that exhibited frequent visits with high residency durations. There were also significant positive relationships between seasonal habitat-use metrics on the FRT and an empirical permit gonadosomatic index. Large aggregations of permit at spawning sites on the FRT are potentially vulnerable to the effects of fishing (including predation during catch and release) at a critical point in their life cycle.

It is usually described, using Arrhenius kinetics, as increasing with the stability of the substrate in laboratory conditions, where substrate availability is non-limiting and where chemical recalcitrance, therefore, predominantly regulates stability. However, conditions of non-limiting subtrate availability are rare in the undisturbed soil, where physicochemical protection of substrates may control their stability. The aim of this study was to assess the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of SOM with contrasting stability in the field. Our conceptual approach was based on in situ measurements of soil CO2 efflux at a range of temperatures from root exclusion plots of increasing age (1\u00a0month and three decades) and, therefore, with SOM of increasing stability. From a set of short-term measurements in spring, using diurnal temperature variation, the relative temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition decreased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with increasing SOM stability, and was weak (Q10\u00a0<\u00a01.3) in long-term root exclusion plots. This result was confirmed in a similar set of short-term measurements repeated later in the year, in summer, as well as from an analysis perfomed at the seasonal timscale. We provide direct field evidence that the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition decreases with increasing stability, in direct contrast with Arrhenius kinetics prediction, and therefore show that stability of SOM in the field cannot be the sole result of chemical recalcitrance.

Particularly important is their N-terminal polypeptide segment (NTPS), which is required for secretion and proper folding but is removed in the process of enzyme maturation. A second common feature of this class of lipases is the \u03b1-helical \"lid\", which regulates the accessibility of the substrate to the enzyme active site. Some Rhizopus lipases also exhibit \"interfacial activation\" by micelle and/or aggregate surfaces. While it has long been recognized that the NTPS is critical for function, its dynamic features have frustrated efforts to characterize its structure by X-ray crystallography. Here, we combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to determine the structure and dynamics of Rhizopus chinensis lipase (RCL) with its 27-residue NTPS prosequence (r27RCL). Both r27RCL and the truncated mature form of RCL (mRCL) exhibit biphasic interfacial activation kinetics with p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB). r27RCL exhibits a substrate binding affinity significantly lower than that of mRCL due to stabilization of the closed lid conformation by the NTPS. In contrast to previous predictions, the NTPS does not enhance lipase activity by increasing surface hydrophobicity but rather inhibits activity by forming conserved interactions with both the closed lid and the core protein structure. Single-site mutations and kinetic studies were used to confirm that the NTPS serves as internal competitive inhibitor and to develop a model of the associated process of interfacial activation.

We measured the C and water exchange of two neighbouring lucerne fields on stony, well-drained soil for 3\u202fyears, following conversion from grassland. One field received irrigation and effluent; the other received neither. Net CO2 exchange and evaporation were measured by eddy covariance, drainage and leaching with lysimeters, and water inputs with rain gauges. Biomass removal from harvesting and grazing was recorded by direct sampling. In the conversion year, irrigated lucerne was C-neutral despite two harvests and losses from the conversion process. In the 2nd and 3rd years combined, the biomass-C removal exceeded net CO2 uptake, causing net losses of 450\u202fg C m-2 and 210\u202fg C m-2 for irrigated and non-irrigated lucerne, respectively. Leaching losses accounted for 1 to 9\u202f% of annual net C uptake from the atmosphere. The ratio of ecosystem respiration to gross photosynthetic productivity (GPP) increased from <0.7 in spring to \u2248 1 in autumn. Consequently, the net C balance for both lucerne crops showed gains in the first two growth periods of each year and losses in the subsequent two to four growth periods. Irrigation made no difference to the photosynthetic water-use efficiency at field scale (GPP/evaporation), but enhanced production water-use efficiency (biomass/water input). Irrigation increased both the absolute amount of drainage and the fraction of water inputs lost by drainage. In one year, significant summer drainage occurred for the irrigated lucerne. To prevent that, soil-water content should be kept well below field capacity but above the crop's water-stress level. Such practice would likely also help retain soil carbon.", "Keywords": ["Alfalfa", "Eddy covariance", "Lysimeters", "Net ecosystem carbon balance", "Soil carbon", "Water budget"], "MeSH terms": ["Agricultural Irrigation", "Carbon Cycle", "Crop Production", "Ecosystem", "Fertilizers", "Medicago sativa", "New Zealand", "Soil", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Johannes", "Last Name": "Laubach", "Affiliation": "Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, PO Box 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.

The mitochondria possess their own genome, and previous studies have shown that mitochondrial genetic variation affects longevity in insects. Furthermore, the mitochondria are the sites in which dietary nutrients are oxidized to produce adenosine triphosphate, suggesting a capacity for dietary quality to mediate the link between mitochondrial genotype and longevity. Here, we measured longevity of male and female fruit flies, across a panel of genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster, which vary only in their mitochondrial haplotype, when fed one of the two isocaloric diets that differed in their protein-to-carbohydrate ratio. The mitochondrial haplotype affected the longevity of flies, but the pattern of these effects differed across the two diets in males, but not in females.

Infected individuals are expected to increase investment in defence (e.g., by increasing immune function) and, due to trade-offs, investment in other traits (e.g., current reproduction) should decrease. However, the terminal investment hypothesis postulates that decreased lifespan due to infection and the associated reduction in the expectation for future offspring will favour increased investment towards current reproduction. Variation in intrinsic condition will likely influence shifts in reproductive investment post-infection, but this is often not considered in such assessments. For example, the extent of inbreeding can significantly impact an individual's lifetime fitness and may influence its reproductive behaviour following a threat of infection. Here, we investigated the effects of inbreeding status on an individual's reproductive investment upon infection, including the propensity to terminally invest. Male crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) from four genetically distinct inbred lines and one outbred line were subjected to a treatment from an increasing spectrum of simulated infection cue intensities, using heat-killed bacteria. We then measured reproductive effort (calling effort), survival and immune function (antibacterial activity, circulating haemocytes and haemocyte microaggregations). Inbred and outbred males diverged in how they responded to a low-dose infection cue: relative to unmanipulated males, outbred males decreased calling effort, whereas inbred males increased calling effort. Moreover, we found that inbred males exhibited higher antibacterial activity and numbers of circulating haemocytes compared with outbred males.

While HPK1 gene knockout (KO) studies suggest its role in anti-tumor immune responses, the involvement of kinase activity and thereof its therapeutic potential remain unknown. To investigate the potential of pharmacological intervention using inhibitors of HPK1, we generated HPK1 kinase dead (KD) mice which carry a single loss-of-function point mutation in the kinase domain and interrogated the role of kinase activity in immune cells in the context of suppressive factors or the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our data provide novel findings that HKP1 kinase activity is critical in conferring suppressive functions of HPK1 in a wide range of immune cells including CD4+, CD8+, DC, NK to Tregs, and inactivation of kinase domain was sufficient to elicit robust anti-tumor immune responses.

These properties allow biochar to retain soil nutrients, yet the effects of biochar on bacterial growth remain poorly understood. To examine how biochar influences microbial metabolism, Escherichia coli was grown in a complex, well-defined media and treated with either biochar or activated carbon. The concentration of metabolites in the media were then quantified at several time points using NMR spectroscopy. Several metabolites were immediately adsorbed by the char, including l-asparagine, l-glutamine, and l-arginine. However, we find that biochar quantitatively adsorbs less of these metabolic precursors when compared to activated carbon. Electron microscopy reveals differences in surface morphology after cell culture, suggesting that Escherichia coli can form biofilms on the surfaces of the biochar. An examination of significant compounds in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis reveals that treatment with biochar is less disruptive than activated carbon throughout metabolism. While both biochar and activated carbon slowed growth compared to untreated media, Escherichia coli in biochar-treated media grew more efficiently, as indicated by a longer logarithmic growth phase and a higher final cell density. This work suggests that biochar can serve as a beneficial soil amendment while minimizing the impact on bacterial viability. In addition, the experiments identify a mechanism for biochar's effectiveness in soil conditioning and reveal how biochar can alter specific bacterial metabolic pathways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Charcoal", "Escherichia coli", "Metabolomics", "Soil"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Hill", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Mississippi State University , Mississippi State , Mississippi 39762 , United States."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Mississippi State University , Mississippi State , Mississippi 39762 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Sanders", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Mississippi State University , Mississippi State , Mississippi 39762 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Tran", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Mississippi State University , Mississippi State , Mississippi 39762 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Griffin A", "Last Name": "Burk", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Mississippi State University , Mississippi State , Mississippi 39762 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Todd E", "Last Name": "Mlsna", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Mississippi State University , Mississippi State , Mississippi 39762 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas C", "Last Name": "Fitzkee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Mississippi State University , Mississippi State , Mississippi 39762 , United States."}], "Journal": "Environmental science & technology", "PubDate": "2019Mar05"}, {"PMID": "30573874", "Title": "Brian Mouatt.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John M G", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "British dental journal", "PubDate": "2018Dec21"}, {"PMID": "30485577", "Title": "Behavioural mechanisms of sexual isolation involving multiple modalities and their inheritance.", "Abstract": "Speciation research dissects the genetics and evolution of reproductive barriers between parental species.

We tested the role of multiple behavioural barriers in reproductive isolation among closely related field crickets and their hybrids (Teleogryllus oceanicus and Teleogryllus commodus). These species hybridize in the laboratory, but the behaviour of hybrids is unusual and there is little evidence for gene flow in the wild. We found that heterospecific pairs exhibited reduced rates of courtship behaviour due to discrimination by both sexes, and that this behavioural isolation was symmetrical. However, hybrids were not sexually selected against and exhibited high rates of courtship behaviour even though hybrid females are sterile. Using reciprocal hybrid crosses, we characterized patterns of interspecific divergence and inheritance in key sexual traits that might underlie the mating patterns we found: calling song, courtship song and cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). Song traits exhibited both sex linkage and transgressive segregation, whereas CHCs exhibited only the latter. Calculations of the strength of isolation exerted by these sexual traits suggest that close-range signals are as important as long-distance signals in contributing to interspecific sexual isolation.

Cellular therapies require a smart biomaterial to deliver and localise the cell population; protecting and guiding the stem cells toward predetermined lineage-specific pathways. The cells, in turn, can provide protection to biomaterials and increase its longevity. The right combination of stem cells and biomaterials can significantly increase the therapeutic efficacy. Adult stem cells are utilised to target many changes that negatively impact tissue functions with age. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to changes brought about by the ageing process is imperative as ageing leads to many detrimental effects on stem cell activation, maintenance and differentiation. The circadian clock is an evolutionarily conserved timing mechanism that coordinates physiology, metabolism and behavior with the 24\u00a0h solar day to provide temporal tissue homeostasis with the external environment. Circadian rhythms deteriorate with age at both the behavioural and molecular levels, leading to age-associated changes in downstream rhythmic tissue physiology in humans and rodent models. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our knowledge of the role of circadian clocks in adult stem cell maintenance, driven by both cell-autonomous and tissue-specific factors, and the mechanisms by which they co-opt various cellular signaling pathways to impose temporal control on stem cell function.

Here we explore the effect of a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of serine/threonine protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) on modulating myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. Although inhibition of CK2 caused only a modest effect on dendritic cells in tumor-bearing mice, it substantially reduced the amount of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages. This effect was not caused by the induction of apoptosis, but rather by a block of differentiation. Our results implicated downregulation of CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 in this effect. Although CK2 inhibition did not directly affect tumor cells, it dramatically enhanced the antitumor activity of immune checkpoint receptor blockade using anti-CTLA-4 antibody. These results suggest a potential role of CK2 inhibitors in combination therapies against cancer.Significance: These findings demonstrate the modulatory effects of casein kinase 2 inhibitors on myeloid cell differentiation in the tumor microenvironment, which subsequently synergize with the antitumor effects of checkpoint inhibitor CTLA4.

E. coli-based cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), which has emerged as a promising platform for the development and production of enhanced protein therapeutics, provides a unique opportunity to remove endotoxins prior to protein expression due to its open environment and the absence of live cells. Pre-expression endotoxin removal from CFPS reagents could simplify downstream processing, potentially enabling on-demand production of unique protein therapeutics. Herein, three strategies for removing endotoxins from E. coli cell lysate are evaluated: Triton X-114 two-phase extraction, polylysine affinity chromatography, and extract preparation from genetically engineered, endotoxin-free ClearColi cells. It is demonstrated that current protocols for endotoxin removal treatments insufficiently reduce endotoxin and significantly reduce protein synthesis yields.

Here, we explore a thermodynamic strategy to correct the disease-causing F508del mutation in the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR). F508del destabilizes nucleotide-binding domain 1 (hNBD1) in hCFTR relative to an aggregation-prone intermediate. We developed a fluorescence self-quenching assay for compounds that prevent aggregation of hNBD1 by stabilizing its native conformation. Unexpectedly, we found that dTTP and nucleotide analogs with exocyclic methyl groups bind to hNBD1 more strongly than ATP and preserve electrophysiological function of full-length F508del-hCFTR channels at temperatures up to 37 \u00b0C. Furthermore, nucleotides that increase open-channel probability, which reflects stabilization of an interdomain interface to hNBD1, thermally protect full-length F508del-hCFTR even when they do not stabilize isolated hNBD1. Therefore, stabilization of hNBD1 itself or of one of its interdomain interfaces by a small molecule indirectly offsets the destabilizing effect of the F508del mutation on full-length hCFTR. These results indicate that high-affinity binding of a small molecule to a remote site can correct a disease-causing mutation.

The most commonly manipulated resource in empirical studies is the quantity or quality of diet. Recent studies using the geometric framework for nutrition, however, suggest that trade-offs are often regulated by the intake of specific nutrients, but a formal approach to identify and quantify the strength of such trade-offs is lacking. We posit that trade-offs occur whenever life-history traits are maximized in different regions of nutrient space, as evidenced by nonoverlapping 95% confidence regions of the global maximum for each trait and large angles (\u03b8) between linear nutritional vectors and Euclidean distances (d) between global maxima. We then examined the effects of protein and carbohydrate intake on the trade-off between reproduction and aspects of immune function in male and female Gryllodes sigillatus. Female encapsulation ability and egg production increased with the intake of both nutrients, whereas male encapsulation ability increased with protein intake but calling effort increased with carbohydrate intake. The trade-offs between traits was therefore larger in males than in females, as demonstrated by significant negative correlations between the traits in males, nonoverlapping 95% confidence regions, and larger estimates of \u03b8 and d.

An inter-species co-culture model was developed to examine interactions between these cells. Equine FLS and the canine macrophage line DH82 were differentially labeled using fluorescent markers and results from direct co-culture compared with those from both indirect co-culture, and conditioned media experiments. The transcript expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS5 in each cell type were determined using species-specific qPCR assays. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of EFLS rapidly increased IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS5 mRNAs. The induction of ADAMTS5 was significantly reduced when equine FLS were cultured with DH82 cells directly or indirectly. Exposure of equine FLS to denatured conditioned media also significantly reduced ADAMTS5 induction. DH82 cells increased interleukin-1\u03b2 expression substantially following LPS stimulation. However, knockdown of interleukin-1\u03b2 in DH82 cells, or inhibition of NF-\u03baB in equine FLS prior to co-culture did not change the inhibitory effect on equine FLS ADAMTS5 gene expression.

This is the first comprehensive investigation into the effect of silane chain length on the resultant properties of -NH2 silane monolayers and the associated osteoinductive properties of the surface. A range of -NH2 presenting silanes, chain length 3-11, were introduced to glass coverslips and characterized using water contact angles, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Ninhydrin assays. The ability of the variation in chain length to form a homogenous layer across the entirety of the surfaces was also assessed. The osteoinductive potential of the resultant surfaces was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and von Kossa staining. Control of surface chemistry and topography was directly associated with changes in chain length. This resulted in the identification of a specific, chain length 11 (CL11) which significantly increased the osteoinductive properties of the modified materials. Only CL11 surfaces had a highly regular nano-topography/roughness which resulted in the formation of an appetite-like layer on the surface that induced a significantly enhanced osteoinductive response (increased expression of osteocalcin, CBFA1, sclerostin, and the production of a calcified matrix) across the entirety of the surface. \u00a9 2018 The Authors Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Time-resolved analysis of cell morphology showed characteristic cell spreading and increased aspect ratios in response to greater substrate stiffness.

The level at which a cue of decreased survival is sufficient to trigger terminal investment (i.e., the terminal investment threshold) may vary according to other factors that influence expectation for future reproduction. We test whether the terminal investment threshold varies with age in male crickets, using heat-killed bacteria to simulate an immune-inducing infection. We measured calling effort (a behavior essential for mating) and hemolymph antimicrobial activity in young and old males across a gradient of increasing infection cue intensity. There was a significant interaction between the infection cue and age in their effect on calling effort, confirming the existence of a dynamic terminal investment threshold: young males reduced effort at all infection levels, whereas old males increased effort at the highest levels relative to na\u00efve individuals. A lack of a corresponding decrease in antibacterial activity suggests that altered reproductive effort is not traded against investment in this component of immunity.

To do this, adult stem cells are frequently utilised, but there are many aspects of their environment in vivo that are not completely understood. There is evidence to suggest that circadian rhythms and daily circadian temporal cues have substantial effects on stem cell activation, cell cycle, and differentiation. It was hypothesised that the circadian rhythm in human adult stem cells differs depending on the source of tissue and that different entraining signals exert differential effects depending on the anatomical source. Dexamethasone and rhythmic mechanical stretch were used to synchronise stem cells derived from the bone marrow, tooth dental pulp, and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, and it was experimentally evidenced that these different stem cells differed in their circadian clock properties in response to different synchronisation mechanisms. The more primitive dental pulp-derived stem cells did not respond as well to the chemical synchronisation but showed temporal clock gene oscillations following rhythmic mechanical stretch, suggesting that incorporating temporal circadian information of different human adult stem cells will have profound implications in optimising tissue engineering approaches and stem cell therapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eve H", "Last Name": "Rogers", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, 6 West Derby Street, Liverpool L7 8TX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sandra A", "Last Name": "Fawcett", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, 6 West Derby Street, Liverpool L7 8TX, UK."}, {"First Name": "Vanja", "Last Name": "Pekovic-Vaughan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, 6 West Derby Street, Liverpool L7 8TX, UK."}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, 6 West Derby Street, Liverpool L7 8TX, UK."}], "Journal": "Stem cells international", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "29194092", "Title": "Clinicopathologic Features and Prognostic Impact of Lymph Node Involvement in Patients With Breast Implant-associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma.", "Abstract": "Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) is a rare T-cell lymphoma that arises around breast implants. Most patients manifest with periprosthetic effusion, whereas a subset of patients develops a tumor mass or lymph node involvement (LNI). The aim of this study is to describe the pathologic features of lymph nodes from patients with BI-ALCL and assess the prognostic impact of LNI. Clinical findings and histopathologic features of lymph nodes were assessed in 70 patients with BI-ALCL. LNI was defined by the histologic demonstration of ALCL in lymph nodes. Fourteen (20%) patients with BI-ALCL had LNI, all lymph nodes involved were regional, the most frequent were axillary (93%). The pattern of involvement was sinusoidal in 13 (92.9%) cases, often associated with perifollicular, interfollicular, and diffuse patterns. Two cases had Hodgkin-like patterns. The 5-year overall survival was 75% for patients with LNI and 97.9% for patients without LNI at presentation (P=0.003). Six of 49 (12.2%) of patients with tumor confined by the capsule had LNI, compared with LNI in 8/21 (38%) patients with tumor beyond the capsule. Most patients with LNI achieved complete remission after various therapeutic approaches. Two of 14 (14.3%) patients with LNI died of disease compared with 0/56 (0%) patients without LNI. Twenty percent of patients with BI-ALCL had LNI by lymphoma, most often in a sinusoidal pattern. We conclude that BI-ALCL beyond capsule is associated with a higher risk of LNI.

The ratio and amount of nutrients individuals consume affect their life expectancy and reproductive investment. The geometric framework (GF) enables us to explore how animals regulate their intake of multiple nutrients simultaneously and determine how these nutrients interact to affect life-history traits of interest. Studies using the GF on host-generalist tephritid flies have highlighted trade-offs between longevity and reproductive effort in females, mediated by the protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio that individuals consume. Here, we tested how P and C intake affect lifespan (LS) in both sexes, and female lifetime (LEP), and daily (DEP) egg production, in Ceratitis cosyra, a host-specialist tephritid fly. We then determined the P:C ratio that C.\u00a0cosyra defends when offered a choice of foods. Female LS was optimized at a 0:1 P:C ratio, whereas to maximize their fecundity, females needed to consume a higher P:C ratio (LEP = 1:6 P:C; DEP = 1:2.5 P:C). In males, LS was also optimized at a low P:C ratio of 1:10. However, when given the opportunity to regulate their intake, both sexes actively defended a 1:3 P:C ratio, which is closer to the target for DEP than either LS or LEP.

Demographers have suggested that decoupling the tempo and the magnitude of changing mortality risk may facilitate comparative analyses\u00a0of mortality trajectories, but it is unclear what biologically meaningful information this approach offers. Here, we determine how the amount and ratio of protein and carbohydrate ingested by female Drosophila melanogaster affects how much mortality risk increases over a time-standardised life-course (the shape of aging) and the tempo at which animals live and die (the pace of aging). We find that pace values increased as flies consumed more carbohydrate but declined with increasing protein consumption. Shape values were independent of protein intake but were lowest in flies consuming ~90\u00a0\u03bcg of carbohydrate daily. As protein intake only affected the pace of aging, varying protein intake rescaled mortality trajectories (i.e. stretched or compressed survival curves), while varying carbohydrate consumption caused deviation from temporal rescaling (i.e. changed the topography of time-standardised survival curves), by affecting pace and shape. Clearly, the pace and shape of aging may vary independently in response to dietary manipulation. This suggests that there is the potential for pace and shape to evolve independently of one another and respond to different physiological processes. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for independent variation in pace and shape, may offer insight into the factors underlying diverse mortality trajectories.", "Keywords": ["Dietary restriction", "Fruit flies", "Geometric framework of nutrition", "Gompertz", "Pace", "Shape"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Animals", "Diet", "Dietary Carbohydrates", "Dietary Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Life Expectancy", "Longevity", "Models, Biological", "Mortality", "Nutritional Requirements"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "C", "Last Name": "Ruth Archer", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Treliever Road, Penryn, Cornwall, TR10 9FE, UK. c.archer@exeter.ac.uk."}, {"First Name": "Ugofilippo", "Last Name": "Basellini", "Affiliation": "MaxNetAging Research School, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Konrad-Zuse-Stra\u00dfe 1, 18057, Rostock, Germany."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Treliever Road, Penryn, Cornwall, TR10 9FE, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stephen J", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Charles Perkins Centre and School of Life and Environmental Sciences, D17, Charles Perkins Centre Research and Education Hub, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2006, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Kwang Pum", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea."}, {"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "Baudisch", "Affiliation": "Max-Planck Odense Center on the Biodemography of Aging, Department of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, J.B.

Cells were grown in aerobic batch cultures containing (a) only glucose, (b) glucose along with the precursors, or (c) glucose and Val. The study provided the following new insights. First, 13 C flux ratio analyses of central metabolism reveal an unexpectedly high anaplerotic supply of the tricarboxylic acid cycle for a Crabtree-negative yeast, and show that a substantial fraction of glucose catabolism proceeds through the pentose phosphate pathway. A comparison with previous flux ratio analyses for batch cultures of Crabtree-negative Pichia stipitis and Crabtree-positive Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the overall regulation of central carbon metabolism in P. pastoris is intermediate in between P. stipitis and S. cerevisiae. Second, excess \u03b1-ketoisovalerate in the medium is not transported into the cytoplasm indicating that P. pastoris lacks a suitable transporter. In contrast, excess Val is efficiently taken up and largely fulfills demands for both Val and Leu for protein synthesis. Third, excess \u03b1-ketobutyrate is transported into the mitochondria for Ile biosynthesis. However, the import does not efficiently inhibit the synthesis of \u03b1-ketobutyrate from pyruvate indicating that P. pastoris has not been optimized evolutionarily to take full advantage of this carbon source.

This paper presents mainly the dose estimations received by industrial gamma radiography workers, during planned or accidental exposure to the eye lens, Hp(10) and effective dose. A Brazilian Visual Monte Carlo Dose Calculation program was used and two relevant scenarios were considered. For the planned exposure situation, twelve radiographic exposures per day for 250 days per year, which leads to a direct exposure of 10 h per year, were considered. The simulation was carried out using a 192Ir source with 1.0 TBq of activity; a source/operator distance between 5 and 10 m and placed at heights of 0.02 m, 1 m and 2 m, and an exposure time of 12 s. Using a standard height of 1 m, the eye lens doses were estimated as being between 16.3 and 60.3 mGy per year. For the accidental exposure situation, the same radionuclide and activity were used, but in this case the doses were calculated with and without a collimator. The heights above ground considered were 1.0 m, 1.5 m and 2.0 m; the source/operator distance was 40 cm, and the exposure time 74 s. The eye lens doses at 1.5 m were 12.3 and 0.28 mGy without and with a collimator, respectively. The conclusions were that: (1) the estimated doses show that the 20 mSv annual limit for eye lens equivalent dose can directly impact industrial gamma radiography activities, mainly in industries with high number of radiographic exposures per year; (2) the risk of lens opacity has a low probability for a single accident, but depending on the number of accidental exposures and the dose levels found in planned exposures, the threshold dose can easily be exceeded during the professional career of an industrial radiography operator, and; (3) in a first approximation, Hp(10) can be used to estimate the equivalent dose to the eye lens.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Computer Simulation", "Gamma Rays", "Humans", "Lens, Crystalline", "Male", "Models, Anatomic", "Monte Carlo Method", "Occupational Exposure", "Radiation Dosage", "Radioactive Hazard Release", "Radiometry", "Software"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandre Roza", "Last Name": "de Lima", "Affiliation": "Institute of Radiation Protection and Dosimetry, Av.

However, the relative influence of different sexually selected traits during evolutionary divergence is poorly understood. We used the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus to quantify and compare how five traits from each of three sexual signal modalities and components diverge among allopatric populations: male advertisement song, cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles and forewing morphology. Population divergence was unexpectedly consistent: we estimated the among-population (genetic) variance-covariance matrix, D, for all 15 traits, and Dmax explained nearly two-thirds of its variation. CHC and wing traits were most tightly integrated, whereas song varied more independently. We modeled the dependence of among-population trait divergence on genetic distance estimated from neutral markers to test for signatures of selection versus neutral divergence. For all three sexual trait types, phenotypic variation among populations was largely explained by a neutral model of divergence. Our findings illustrate how phenotypic integration across different types of sexual traits might impose constraints on the evolution of mating isolation and divergence via sexual selection.", "Keywords": ["acoustic communication", "cuticular hydrocarbons", "eigendecomposition", "geometric morphometrics", "multimodal signaling", "sexual selection"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Genetic Variation", "Gryllidae", "Hydrocarbons", "Male", "Phenotype", "Selection, Genetic", "Wings, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sonia", "Last Name": "Pascoal", "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 3EJ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Magdalena", "Last Name": "Mendrok", "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagellonian University, Gronostajova 7, 30-387, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Alastair J", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, TR10 9EZ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, TR10 9EZ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nathan W", "Last Name": "Bailey", "Affiliation": "Centre for Biological Diversity, University of St Andrews, St. Andrews, KY16 9TH, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "Evolution; international journal of organic evolution", "PubDate": "2017Jun"}, {"PMID": "28321991", "Title": "Atomic Layer Deposition of a Silver Nanolayer on Advanced Titanium Orthopedic Implants Inhibits Bacterial Colonization and Supports Vascularized de Novo Bone Ingrowth.", "Abstract": "Joint replacement surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality following infection with either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Currently, an autologous bone graft is the gold standard method for the treatment of complicated non-union fractures, but it is not always possible to harvest such a graft. A proactive highly inductive so-called smart material approach is pertinent in these cases. In this study, the surface chemistry of a previously approved material with desirable bulk material properties was modified to investigate its potential as an economical and effective alternative. The objective was to create stable synthetic chemical coatings that could guide cells along the osteogenic lineage required to generate mineralised tissue that would induce and accelerate bone healing. Primary human osteoblast-like cells were cultured in vitro for 7, 14 and 28\u00a0days on amine-terminated (chain length in the range 3-11) silane-modified glass surfaces with controlled nanotopography, to determine how surface chemistry and nanotopography change osteoblast function. The materials were characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle (WCA) and a novel ninhydrin assay. The cells were analysed using qRT-PCR, von Kossa tinctural staining for mineralisation, and visualised using both transmitted white light and electron microscopy. Bone-like nodules, quantified using microscopy, only formed on the short-chain (chain length 3 and 4) amines after 7\u00a0days, as did the up-regulation of sclerostin, suggestive of a more mature osteoblast phenotype. In this paper, we report more rapid nodule formation than has previously been observed, without the addition of exogenous factors in the culture medium.

However, our understanding of how the sexes regulate their nutrition and the effects that this has on sex-specific fitness is limited. We quantified how protein (P) and carbohydrate (C) intakes affect reproductive traits in male (pheromone expression) and female (clutch size and gestation time) cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea). We then determined how the sexes regulate their intake of nutrients when restricted to a single diet and when given dietary choice and how this affected expression of these important reproductive traits. Pheromone levels that improve male attractiveness, female clutch size and gestation time all peaked at a high daily intake of P:C in a 1:8 ratio. This is surprising because female insects typically require more P than males to maximize reproduction. The relatively low P requirement of females may reflect the action of cockroach endosymbionts that help recycle stored nitrogen for protein synthesis. When constrained to a single diet, both sexes prioritized regulating their daily intake of P over C, although this prioritization was stronger in females than males. When given the choice between diets, both sexes actively regulated their intake of nutrients at a 1:4.8 P:C ratio. The P:C ratio did not overlap exactly with the intake of nutrients that optimized reproductive trait expression. Despite this, cockroaches of both sexes that were given dietary choice generally improved the mean and reduced the variance in all reproductive traits we measured relative to animals fed a single diet from the diet choice pair.

It was hypothesized that increased irrigation frequency would result in lower NO emissions by increasing soil moisture and decreasing soil O concentrations. This would favor more NO reduction to dinitrogen (N). We examined effects of high (3-d) versus low (6-d) irrigation frequency with and without bovine urine addition to pasture. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured daily for 35 d. Soil O, temperature, and water content were continuously measured at multiple depths. Inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil pH were measured at 6-d intervals. Measurements of denitrification enzyme activity with and without acetylene inhibition were used to infer the NO/(NO + N) ratio. The NO/(NO + N) ratio was lower under high- compared with low-frequency irrigation, suggesting greater potential for NO reduction to N with more frequent irrigation. Although NO fluxes were increased by urine addition, they were not affected by irrigation frequency. Soil O decreased temporarily after urine deposition, but O dynamics did not explain NO dynamics.

This provides an alternative route to PLP from the toxic antimetabolite 4HT that can be directly generated from the toxic intermediate glycolaldehyde.

It has a modulus of elasticity that is close to bone and a high yield and ultimate strength allowing it to be used to form large, weight-bearing constructs with a high volumetric porosity conducive to osseointegration. However, its role in soft tissue re-attachment remains undefined due to variable clinical outcomes. Successful re-attachment of tendons to tantalum mega-prostheses, in tumour and revision surgery, has been reported but several authors report almost universal failure of long term soft tissue re-attachment with tantalum patella augments when no residual bone stock is present. It is postulated that these failures are due to a lack of stability of the implants and an inhibitory effect of tantalum on soft tissue integration. Tantalum has previously been considered an excellent biomaterial for soft tissue integration based on animal studies where implants were retrieved and subjected to mechanical testing. However, clinical studies suggest that this soft tissue in-growth does not reliably tolerate the high mechanical loads that are generated in the clinical setting. Furthermore, recent laboratory evidence suggests that tantalum may in fact directly inhibit fibroblasts, limiting the potential for mature collagen fibrillogenesis.

To better understand the life-history consequences of oxidative damage, we fed male and female Australian field crickets (Teleogryllus commodus) four diets differing in their protein and carbohydrate content, which have sex-specific effects on reproductive effort and lifespan. We supplemented half of these crickets with the vitamin E isoform DL-alpha-tocopherol and measured the effects of nutrient intake on lifespan, reproduction, oxidative damage and antioxidant protection. We found a clear trade-off between reproductive effort and lifespan in females but not in males. In direct contrast to the oxidative stress theory, crickets fed diets that improved their lifespan had high levels of oxidative damage to proteins. Supplementation with DL-alpha-tocopherol did not significantly improve lifespan or reproductive effort. However, males fed diets that increased their reproductive investment experienced high oxidative damage to proteins.

Based on accumulating literature on the life-history, phenotypic and ecological aspects of fecundity, we (i) suggest a re-arrangement of the concepts of fecundity, whereby we coin the term 'transient fecundity' to refer to brood size per reproductive episode, while 'annual' and 'lifetime fecundity' should not be used interchangeably with 'transient fecundity' as they represent different life-history parameters; (ii) provide a generalized re-definition of the concept of fecundity selection as a mechanism that encompasses any traits that influence fecundity in any direction (from high to low) and in either sex; (iii) review the (macro)ecological basis of fecundity selection (e.g. ecological pressures that influence predictable spatial variation in fecundity); (iv) suggest that most ecological theories of fecundity selection should be tested in organisms other than birds; (v) argue that the longstanding fecundity selection hypothesis of female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) has gained inconsistent support, that strong fecundity selection does not necessarily drive female-biased SSD, and that this form of SSD can be driven by other selective pressures; and (vi) discuss cases in which fecundity selection operates on males. This conceptual analysis of the theory of fecundity selection promises to help illuminate one of the central components of fitness and its contribution to adaptive evolution.", "Keywords": ["brood size", "fecundity", "fecundity selection", "fitness", "life history", "polyandry", "reproductive success", "sexual dimorphism", "trade-offs"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Birds", "Reproduction", "Selection, Genetic", "Sex Characteristics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Pincheira-Donoso", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Evolutionary Ecology of Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, Brayford Campus, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, LN6 7DL, U.K."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, TR10 9EZ, U.K."}], "Journal": "Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society", "PubDate": "2017Feb"}, {"PMID": "26439494", "Title": "What's in the Gift? Towards a Molecular Dissection of Nuptial Feeding in a Cricket.", "Abstract": "Nuptial gifts produced by males and transferred to females during copulation are common in insects. Yet, their precise composition and subsequent physiological effects on the female recipient remain unresolved. Male decorated crickets Gryllodes sigillatus transfer a spermatophore to the female during copulation that is composed of an edible gift, the spermatophylax, and the ampulla that contains the ejaculate. After transfer of the spermatophore, the female detaches the spermatophylax and starts to eat it while sperm from the ampulla are evacuated into the female reproductive tract. When the female has finished consuming the spermatophylax, she detaches the ampulla and terminates sperm transfer. Hence, one simple function of the spermatophylax is to ensure complete sperm transfer by distracting the female from prematurely removing the ampulla. However, the majority of orally active components of the spermatophylax itself and their subsequent effects on female behavior have not been identified. Here, we report the first analysis of the proteome of the G. sigillatus spermatophylax and the transcriptome of the male accessory glands that make these proteins. The accessory gland transcriptome was assembled into 17,691 transcripts whilst about 30 proteins were detected within the mature spermatophylax itself. Of these 30 proteins, 18 were encoded by accessory gland encoded messages. Most spermatophylax proteins show no similarity to proteins with known biological functions and are therefore largely novel. A spermatophylax protein shows similarity to protease inhibitors suggesting that it may protect the biologically active components from digestion within the gut of the female recipient. Another protein shares similarity with previously characterized insect polypeptide growth factors suggesting that it may play a role in altering female reproductive physiology concurrent with fertilization. Characterization of the spermatophylax proteome provides the first step in identifying the genes encoding these proteins in males and in understanding their biological functions in the female recipient.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Carbonic Anhydrases", "Copulation", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Gift Giving", "Gryllidae", "Insect Proteins", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Reproduction", "Sequence Alignment", "Sexual Behavior, Animal", "Spermatogonia", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yannick", "Last Name": "Pauchet", "Affiliation": "Entomology, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Wielsch", "Affiliation": "Mass spectrometry, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Paul A", "Last Name": "Wilkinson", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Scott K", "Last Name": "Sakaluk", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution & Systematics Section, School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ale\u0161", "Last Name": "Svato\u0161", "Affiliation": "Mass spectrometry, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Richard H", "Last Name": "ffrench-Constant", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, Penryn, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "David G", "Last Name": "Heckel", "Affiliation": "Entomology, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "26333431", "Title": "The effects of lung recruitment maneuvers on exhaled breath condensate pH.", "Abstract": "Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH serves as a surrogate marker of airway lining fluid (ALF) pH and can be used to evaluate airway acidification (AA).

Lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) are utilized in the treatment of ARDS, however, their impact on EBC pH has never been explored. Here we described the acute effects of two commonly used LRMs on EBC pH. In a prospective, non-randomized, serial exposure study, 10 intubated pediatric subjects with acute respiratory distress syndrome sequentially underwent: a period of baseline ventilation, sustained inflation (SI) maneuver of 40\u2009cm H2O for 40 s, open lung ventilation, staircase recruitment strategy (SRS) (which involves a systematic ramping of plateau pressures in 5\u2009cm H2O increments, starting at 30\u2009cm H2O), and PEEP titration. Maximum lung recruitment during the SRS is defined as a PaO2 + PaCO2 of\u2009\u2009>400 mmHg.

Recent studies have implicated chemosensory cues, for instance cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in insects, as a key source of this information. Here, using the broad-horned flour beetle (Gnatocerus cornutus), we investigated the importance of contact-derived rival male CHCs in informing male perception of sperm competition risk and intensity. We experimentally perfumed virgin females with male CHCs via direct intersexual contact and measured male pre- and post-copulatory investment in response to this manipulation. Using chemical analysis, we verified that this treatment engendered changes to perfumed female CHC profiles, but did not make perfumed females \"smell\" mated. Despite this, males responded to these chemical changes. Males increased courtship effort under low levels of perceived competition (from 1-3 rivals), but significantly decreased courtship effort as perceived competition rose (from 3-5 rivals). Furthermore, our measurement of ejaculate investment showed that males allocated significantly more sperm to perfumed females than to control females. Together, these results suggest that changes in female chemical profile elicited by contact with rival males do not provide males with information on female mating status, but rather inform males of the presence of rivals within the population and thus provide a means for males to indirectly assess the risk of sperm competition.", "Keywords": ["Gnatocerus cornutus", "chemical cues", "cuticular hydrocarbons", "ejaculate expenditure", "sperm competition risk."], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah M", "Last Name": "Lane", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus , Cornwall TR10 9EZ , UK ."}, {"First Name": "Joanna H", "Last Name": "Solino", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus , Cornwall TR10 9EZ , UK , ; Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Vector Control Department , Pembroke Place, Liverpool L3 5QA , UK ."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus , Cornwall TR10 9EZ , UK , ; Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, University of Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Campus , Penrith, New South Wales 2751 , Australia , and."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Blount", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus , Cornwall TR10 9EZ , UK ."}, {"First Name": "Kensuke", "Last Name": "Okada", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Evolutionary Ecology, Graduate School of Environmental Science, Okayama University , Tsushima-naka 1-1-1, Okayama , Japan."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus , Cornwall TR10 9EZ , UK ."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa M", "Last Name": "House", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, College of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus , Cornwall TR10 9EZ , UK ."}], "Journal": "Behavioral ecology : official journal of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology", "PubDate": "2015Jul-Aug"}, {"PMID": "26150061", "Title": "Understanding the link between sexual selection, sexual conflict and aging using crickets as a model.", "Abstract": "Aging evolved because the strength of natural selection declines over the lifetime of most organisms. Weak natural selection late in life allows the accumulation of deleterious mutations and may favor alleles that have positive effects on fitness early in life, but costly pleiotropic effects expressed later on. While this decline in natural selection is central to longstanding evolutionary explanations for aging, a role for sexual selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of lifespan and aging has only been identified recently. Testing how sexual selection and sexual conflict affect lifespan and aging is challenging as it requires quantifying male age-dependent reproductive success. This is difficult in the invertebrate model organisms traditionally used in aging research. Research using crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), where reproductive investment can be easily measured in both sexes, has offered exciting and novel insights into how sexual selection and sexual conflict affect the evolution of aging, both in the laboratory and in the wild. Here we discuss how sexual selection and sexual conflict can be integrated alongside evolutionary and mechanistic theories of aging using crickets as a model. We then highlight the potential for research using crickets to further advance our understanding of lifespan and aging.", "Keywords": ["Geometric Framework of Nutrition", "Intralocus sexual conflict", "Orthoptera", "Oxidative damage", "Quantitative genetics", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Animals", "Conflict, Psychological", "Female", "Gryllidae", "Longevity", "Male", "Models, Animal", "Reproduction", "Selection, Genetic", "Sexual Behavior, Animal", "Species Specificity", "Vocalization, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "C Ruth", "Last Name": "Archer", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Research Group, Modelling the Evolution of Aging, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Konrad-Zuse-Str. 1, 18057 Rostock, Germany; MaxNetAging School, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Konrad-Zuse-Str. 1, 18057 Rostock, Germany.

One ubiquitous form of provisioning is in the makeup of egg. However, only a few studies examine the role of specific egg constituents in maternal effects, especially as they relate to maternal selection (a standardized selection gradient reflecting the covariance between maternal traits and offspring fitness). Here, we report on the evolutionary consequences of differences in maternal acquisition and allocation of amino acids to eggs. We manipulated acquisition by varying maternal diet (milkweed or sunflower) in the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. Variation in allocation was detected by examining two source populations with different evolutionary histories and life-history response to sunflower as food. We measured amino acids composition in eggs in this 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 design and found significant effects of source population and maternal diet on egg and nymph mass and of source population, maternal diet, and their interaction on amino acid composition of eggs. We measured significant linear and quadratic maternal selection on offspring mass associated with variation in amino acid allocation. Visualizing the performance surface along the major axes of nonlinear selection and plotting the mean amino acid profile of eggs from each treatment onto the surface revealed a saddle-shaped fitness surface. While maternal selection appears to have influenced how females allocate amino acids, this maternal effect did not evolve equally in the two populations. Furthermore, none of the population means coincided with peak performance. Thus, we found that the composition of free amino acids in eggs was due to variation in both acquisition and allocation, which had significant fitness effects and created selection. However, although there can be an evolutionary response to novel food resources, females may be constrained from reaching phenotypic optima with regard to allocation of free amino acids.", "Keywords": ["Free amino acids", "Oncopeltus fasciatus", "linear selection gradients", "maternal effects", "maternal selection", "offspring performance", "performance surface", "quadratic selection gradients"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Devi", "Last Name": "Newcombe", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter Cornwall Campus, Penryn, TR10 9EZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter Cornwall Campus, Penryn, TR10 9EZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter Cornwall Campus, Penryn, TR10 9EZ, UK."}, {"First Name": "Allen J", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter Cornwall Campus, Penryn, TR10 9EZ, UK ; Department of Genetics, University of Georgia Athens, Georgia, 30602."}], "Journal": "Ecology and evolution", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "26073476", "Title": "Thinking it through: mental rehearsal and performance on 2 types of laparoscopic cholecystectomy simulators.", "Abstract": "Simulation-based training (SBT) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCCY) provides an opportunity for junior residents to learn the procedure in a safe, nonthreatening environment.

Traditionally, this has been attributed to a stronger trade-off between LS and reproduction in females than in males that is mediated by the intake of calories. Recent studies, however, suggest that it is the intake of specific nutrients that extends LS and mediates this trade-off. Here, we used the geometric framework (GF) to examine the sex-specific effects of protein (P) and carbohydrate (C) intake on LS and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that LS was maximized at a high intake of C and a low intake of P in both sexes, whereas nutrient intake had divergent effects on reproduction. Male offspring production rate and LS were maximized at the same intake of nutrients, whereas female egg production rate was maximized at a high intake of diets with a P:C ratio of 1:2. This resulted in larger differences in nutrient-dependent optima for LS and reproduction in females than in males, as well as an optimal intake of nutrients for lifetime reproduction that differed between the sexes. Under dietary choice, the sexes followed similar feeding trajectories regulated around a P:C ratio of 1:4. Consequently, neither sex reached their nutritional optimum for lifetime reproduction, suggesting intralocus sexual conflict over nutrient optimization.

The calibration of the counting device is usually done by using anthropomorphic physical phantoms representing the human body. Due to such a challenge of constructing representative physical phantoms a virtual calibration has been introduced. The use of computational phantoms and the Monte Carlo method to simulate radiation transport have been demonstrated to be a worthy alternative. In this study we introduce a methodology developed for the creation of realistic computational voxel phantoms with adjustable posture for WBC calibration. The methodology makes use of different software packages to enable the creation and modification of computational voxel phantoms. This allows voxel phantoms to be developed on demand for the calibration of different WBC configurations. This in turn helps to study the major source of uncertainty associated with the in vivo measurement routine which is the difference between the calibration phantoms and the real persons being counted. The use of realistic computational phantoms also helps the optimization of the counting measurement. Open source codes such as MakeHuman and Blender software packages have been used for the creation and modelling of 3D humanoid characters based on polygonal mesh surfaces. Also, a home-made software was developed whose goal is to convert the binary 3D voxel grid into a MCNPX input file. This paper summarizes the development of a library of phantoms of the human body that uses two basic phantoms called MaMP and FeMP (Male and Female Mesh Phantoms) to create a set of male and female phantoms that vary both in height and in weight.

In the present study, we determined whether American mink (Neovison vison) would compensate for dietary nutritional imbalances by foraging for complementary macronutrients (protein, lipid and carbohydrate) when subsequently given a dietary choice. We used three food pairings, within which two macronutrients differed relative to each other (high v. low concentration), while the third was kept at a constant level. The mink were first restricted to a single nutritionally imbalanced food for 7\u00a0d and then given a free choice to feed from the same food or a nutritionally complementary food for three consecutive days. When restricted to nutritionally imbalanced foods, the mink were willing to overingest protein only to a certain level ('ceiling'). When subsequently given a choice, the mink compensated for the period of nutritional imbalance by selecting the nutritionally complementary food in the food choice pairing. Notably, this rebalancing occurred for all the three macronutrients, including carbohydrate, which is particularly interesting as carbohydrate is not a major macronutrient for obligate carnivores in nature. However, there was also a ceiling to carbohydrate intake, as has been demonstrated previously in domestic cats.

Recent methodological advances enable the contribution of protein dynamics to enzyme efficiency to be explored more deeply. Here, we utilize enzymological and biophysical studies, including NMR measurements of conformational dynamics, to develop a quantitative mechanistic scheme for the DNA repair enzyme AlkB. Like other iron/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, AlkB employs a two-step mechanism in which oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate generates a highly reactive enzyme-bound oxyferryl intermediate that, in the case of AlkB, slowly hydroxylates an alkylated nucleobase. Our results demonstrate that a microsecond-to-millisecond time scale conformational transition facilitates the proper sequential order of substrate binding to AlkB. Mutations altering the dynamics of this transition allow generation of the oxyferryl intermediate but promote its premature quenching by solvent, which uncouples 2-oxoglutarate turnover from nucleobase oxidation. Therefore, efficient catalysis by AlkB depends upon the dynamics of a specific conformational transition, establishing another paradigm for the control of enzyme function by protein dynamics.", "Keywords": ["AlkB", "Catalytic Efficiency", "DNA Repair", "Enzyme Mechanism", "Fe-2OG Dioxygenase", "Fluorescence Spectroscopy", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)", "Protein Dynamic", "X-ray Crystallography"], "MeSH terms": ["Alkylation", "Biocatalysis", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Circular Dichroism", "DNA Repair", "DNA, Bacterial", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Ketoglutaric Acids", "Kinetics", "Ligands", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Mixed Function Oxygenases", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Protein Conformation", "Substrate Specificity", "Sucrose"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bur\u00e7e", "Last Name": "Ergel", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and."}, {"First Name": "Michelle L", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032-3702."}, {"First Name": "Lewis", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and."}, {"First Name": "Bomina", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and."}, {"First Name": "Arthur G", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032-3702 agp6@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and jfhunt@biology.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2014Oct24"}, {"PMID": "25014715", "Title": "Salvage of the thiamin pyrimidine moiety by plant TenA proteins lacking an active-site cysteine.", "Abstract": "The TenA protein family occurs in prokaryotes, plants and fungi; it has two subfamilies, one (TenA_C) having an active-site cysteine, the other (TenA_E) not.

Comparative analysis of prokaryote and plant genomes predicted that (i) TenA_E has a salvage role similar to, but not identical with, that of TenA_C and (ii) that TenA_E and TenA_C also have non-salvage roles since they occur in organisms that cannot make thiamin. Recombinant Arabidopsis and maize TenA_E proteins (At3g16990, GRMZM2G080501) hydrolysed amino-HMP to HMP and, far more actively, hydrolysed the N-formyl derivative of amino-HMP to amino-HMP. Ablating the At3g16990 gene in a line with a null mutation in the HMP biosynthesis gene ThiC prevented its rescue by amino-HMP. Ablating At3g16990 in the wild-type increased sensitivity to paraquat-induced oxidative stress; HMP overcame this increased sensitivity. Furthermore, the expression of TenA_E and ThiC genes in Arabidopsis and maize was inversely correlated.

The analysis of these becomes tedious without a degree of automation. Crystallization, a rate limiting step in biological X-ray crystallography, is one of these fields. Screening of multiple potential crystallization conditions (cocktails) is the most effective method of probing a proteins phase diagram and guiding crystallization but the interpretation of results can be time-consuming. To aid this empirical approach a cocktail distance coefficient was developed to quantitatively compare macromolecule crystallization conditions and outcome. These coefficients were evaluated against an existing similarity metric developed for crystallization, the C6 metric, using both virtual crystallization screens and by comparison of two related 1,536-cocktail high-throughput crystallization screens. Hierarchical clustering was employed to visualize one of these screens and the crystallization results from an exopolyphosphatase-related protein from Bacteroides fragilis, (BfR192) overlaid on this clustering. This demonstrated a strong correlation between certain chemically related clusters and crystal lead conditions. While this analysis was not used to guide the initial crystallization optimization, it led to the re-evaluation of unexplained peaks in the electron density map of the protein and to the insertion and correct placement of sodium, potassium and phosphate atoms in the structure. With these in place, the resulting structure of the putative active site demonstrated features consistent with active sites of other phosphatases which are involved in binding the phosphoryl moieties of nucleotide triphosphates. The new distance coefficient, CDcoeff, appears to be robust in this application, and coupled with hierarchical clustering and the overlay of crystallization outcome, reveals information of biological relevance. While tested with a single example the potential applications related to crystallography appear promising and the distance coefficient, clustering, and hierarchal visualization of results undoubtedly have applications in wider fields.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Bacteroides fragilis", "Catalytic Domain", "Cluster Analysis", "Crystallization", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Macromolecular Substances", "Models, Theoretical", "Phosphates", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Potassium", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Bruno", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Research, State University of New York (SUNY), Buffalo, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Amanda M", "Last Name": "Ruby", "Affiliation": "Center for Computational Research, State University of New York (SUNY), Buffalo, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joseph R", "Last Name": "Luft", "Affiliation": "Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Buffalo, New York, United States of America; SUNY Buffalo Dept. of Structural Biology, Buffalo, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Thomas D", "Last Name": "Grant", "Affiliation": "Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Buffalo, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jayaraman", "Last Name": "Seetharaman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gaetano T", "Last Name": "Montelione", "Affiliation": "Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine and Department of Biochemistry, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, The Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Edward H", "Last Name": "Snell", "Affiliation": "Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Buffalo, New York, United States of America; SUNY Buffalo Dept. of Structural Biology, Buffalo, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24961839", "Title": "The impact of computed tomographic screening for lung cancer on the thoracic surgery workforce.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to predict variation in the thoracic surgery workforce requirements with the introduction of a national chest computed tomographic (CT) screening program for individuals at high risk of lung cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Incidence", "Lung Neoplasms", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Thoracic Surgery", "Time Factors", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Workforce"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janet P", "Last Name": "Edwards", "Affiliation": "Division of Thoracic Surgery, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Although Q is present in most eukaryotes and bacteria, only bacteria can synthesize Q de novo. Eukaryotes acquire queuine (q), the free base of Q, from diet and/or microflora, making q an important but under-recognized micronutrient for plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotic type tRNA-guanine transglycosylases (eTGTs) are composed of a catalytic subunit (QTRT1) and a homologous accessory subunit (QTRTD1) forming a complex that catalyzes q insertion into target tRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of eTGT subunits revealed a patchy distribution pattern in which gene losses occurred independently in different clades. Searches for genes co-distributing with eTGT family members identified DUF2419 as a potential Q salvage protein family. This prediction was experimentally validated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by confirming that Q was present by analyzing tRNA(Asp) with anticodon GUC purified from wild-type cells and by showing that Q was absent from strains carrying deletions in the QTRT1 or DUF2419 encoding genes. DUF2419 proteins occur in most Eukarya with a few possible cases of horizontal gene transfer to bacteria. The universality of the DUF2419 function was confirmed by complementing the S. pombe mutant with the Zea mays (maize), human, and Sphaerobacter thermophilus homologues.

The scaffolds were designed specifically for the repair of complex incisional abdominal wall hernias and the repair of defects within planar muscular tissues, such as the bladder. The chemical composition of the collagen matrix and the percentage of scaffold infiltration were compared for the different scaffold compositions. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of the collagen sponge within the PLLA scaffold facilitated bladder smooth muscle cell (bSMC) adhesion and proliferation. The highest dose of oxidized collagen (Oxicol) demonstrated better cell adhesion, resulting in the largest cell densities and most uniform distribution throughout the 3D collagen sponge. This formulation promoted the greatest \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) expression detected through immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. For abdominal wall repair applications, the proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and myotube formation were studied. Following 7 days of myogenic induction, the greatest expression of mRNA of the myogenic markers myogenin and MRF4 was observed within the scaffolds with the highest dose of oxidized collagen, 1.5- and 3.85-fold greater expressions, respectively, compared to PLLA with unmodified collagen. Furthermore, in vitro myotube formation and MyMC expression were enhanced in the Oxicol scaffolds. We conclude that the Oxicol scaffold formulation with a high-dose oxidized collagen ratio provides enhanced myogenesis and \u03b1SMA, and the biological induction cues necessary to achieve better tissue integration, than standard PLLA scaffolds in the treatment of complex abdominal wall hernias.

We infer three thermodynamic mechanisms from the observed thermal destabilization by monomer or micelle: (i) binding to the unfolded state with no change in the native structure (all detergent classes); (ii) native state binding that alters thermodynamic properties and perhaps conformation (nonionic detergents); and (iii) detergent binding that directly leads to denaturation of the native state (anionic and zwitterionic).

While toxic concentrations of these pesticides have been found in freshwater systems, there has been little research into their impacts in marine receiving waters. Our study investigated pesticide impacts in the Santa Maria River estuary, which provides critical habitat to numerous aquatic, terrestrial, and avian species on the central California coast. Runoff from irrigated agriculture constitutes a significant portion of Santa Maria River flow during most of the year, and a number of studies have documented pesticide occurrence and biological impacts in this watershed. Our study extended into the Santa Maria watershed coastal zone and measured pesticide concentrations throughout the estuary, including the water column and sediments. Biological effects were measured at the organism and community levels. Results of this study suggest the Santa Maria River estuary is impacted by current-use pesticides. The majority of water samples were highly toxic to invertebrates (Ceriodaphnia dubia and Hyalella azteca), and chemistry evidence suggests toxicity was associated with the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos, pyrethroid pesticides, or mixtures of both classes of pesticides. A high percentage of sediment samples were also toxic in this estuary, and sediment toxicity occurred when mixtures of chlorpyrifos and pyrethroid pesticides exceeded established toxicity thresholds. Based on a Relative Benthic Index, Santa Maria estuary stations where benthic macroinvertebrate communities were assessed were degraded. Impacts in the Santa Maria River estuary were likely due to the proximity of this system to Orcutt Creek, the tributary which accounts for most of the flow to the lower Santa Maria River. Water and sediment samples from Orcutt Creek were highly toxic to invertebrates due to mixtures of the same pesticides measured in the estuary. This study suggests that the same pyrethroid and organophosphate pesticides that have been shown to cause water and sediment toxicity in urban and agriculture water bodies throughout California, have the potential to affect estuarine habitats. The results establish baseline data in the Santa Maria River estuary to allow evaluation of ecosystem improvement as management initiatives to reduce pesticide runoff are implemented in this watershed.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amphipoda", "Animals", "California", "Cladocera", "Ecosystem", "Environmental Monitoring", "Estuaries", "Pesticides", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "University of California, Davis, CA, USA, Anderson@ucdavis.edu."}, {"First Name": "Bryn", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katie", "Last Name": "Siegler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Voorhees", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "Smalling", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kathy", "Last Name": "Kuivila", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Hamilton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Ananda", "Last Name": "Ranasinghe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Tjeerdema", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Environmental monitoring and assessment", "PubDate": "2014Mar"}, {"PMID": "24393850", "Title": "S-Nitrosothiols increases cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator expression and maturation in the cell surface.", "Abstract": "S-nitrosothiols (SNOs) are endogenous signaling molecules with a broad spectrum of beneficial airway effects.

As the frequency of operation is scanned, different subsets of metamaterial elements become active, in turn varying the field patterns at the scene. Scene information can thus be indexed by frequency, with the overall effectiveness of the imaging scheme tied to the diversity of the generated field patterns. As the quality (Q-) factor of the metamaterial resonators increases, the number of distinct field patterns that can be generated increases-improving scene estimation.

Therefore, implanting materials with well-characterized tissue responses provides the greatest chance of 'one-hit' surgical successes, without repeated interventions to replace, repair or remove non-compliant biomaterials. Six synthetic meshes were implanted subcutaneously in a rat model to deduce and quantify modulations in host response, based on material fabrication variables. The materials consisted of knitting variations of polypropylene (PP), polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) yarns and were implanted for 2, 5, 7, 14 and 28\u2009days before fixation and both semi- and fully quantitative histopathology. In a subcutaneous niche, material weight did not influence foreign body response. PET stimulated earlier inflammation than PP and PGA, which normalized over 28\u2009days. Multifilament meshes recruited foreign body giant cells, which were largely absent from monofilaments. Using CD68, PGA was demonstrated to be the greatest leukocyte-activating polymer at a number of the time points analysed. This research therefore highlights that underlying polymer composition may be more over-arching in deciding the inflammatory properties of surgical meshes, based on increased macrophagic responses to PGA vs alternative base polymers of comparable weights and porosities.

The triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells (TREM-1) is a key mediator in the activation of the local inflammatory response during lung infections. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a functionally relevant TREM-1 single nucleotide polymorphism within the exon 2 (A\u2192T) on the development of pneumonia in burn patients. Objective. To determine whether a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the exon 2 (A\u2192T) in the TREM-1 gene is associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in burn-injured patients. Methods. 540 patients with \u226510% total body surface area (TBSA) burn injuries or inhalation injury were prospectively enrolled. The influence of a polymorphism (A\u2192T) in exon 2 of the TREM-1 gene was evaluated for association with increased risk of pneumonia by logistic regression analysis. Measurements and Main Results. 209 patients met criteria for VAP. Multivariate regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for potential confounders, we found that carriage of the TREM-1 T allele is associated with more than a 3-fold increased risk of VAP (OR 6.3, 95% CI 4-9).

In northern Europe, the slug Arion lusitanicus has spread rapidly as an invasive species and a serious horticultural and agricultural pest. We used nutritional geometry to analyze nutrient balancing capabilities and consequences for performance in A. lusitanicus when provided with one of three nutritionally fixed diets or when given dietary choice. The slugs over-ingested high amounts of the most abundant nutrient in order to get more of the limited nutrient. However, they regulated protein intake more tightly than carbohydrate intake resulting in a very high food intake when fed a protein-poor diet. Growth and body composition were highly affected by the nutrient balance of their diet. When given the choice to feed from two nutritionally different diets, the slugs selected an intake balance of protein and carbohydrate with sufficient precision to maximize growth. Nutrient utilization efficiency increased with increasing deficiency of the specific nutrient in the diet. Ingested carbohydrate was more efficiently stored as lipid in slugs fed more carbohydrate-poor diets, and ingested nitrogen was more efficiently incorporated into slug bodies in slugs fed more protein-poor diets. Our experiments suggest that the evolved behavioral and physiological regulatory capacities of A. lusitanicus may explain some of the success that this slug experiences as an invasive species.

We hypothesized that the combination of ipilimumab with chemotherapeutic agents, such as ixabepilone, paclitaxel, etoposide, and gemcitabine, may produce therapeutic synergy based on distinct but complementary mechanisms of action for each drug and unique cellular targets. This concept was investigated using a mouse homolog of ipilimumab in preclinical murine tumor models, including SA1N fibrosarcoma, EMT-6 mammary carcinoma, M109 lung carcinoma, and CT-26 colon carcinoma. Results of CTLA-4 blockade in combination with one of various chemotherapeutic agents demonstrate that synergy occurs in settings where either agent alone was not effective in inducing tumor regression. Furthermore, when combined with CTLA-4 blockade, ixabepilone, etoposide, and gemcitabine elicited prolonged antitumor effects in some murine models with induction of a memory immune response.

Realising the biomedical potential of human adult stem cells (hASCs) however will require delivery in an ultra- purified format, without competing cells which may mediate inflammation, fibrosis or tumorigenesis. Purifying ASCs involves exhuming cells from primary tissue using immunoaffinity; which isolates pure populations with the complication of retained immunoglobulin (Ig); the clinical impact of which is currently not known. One of the negative outcomes of retained surface Ig is exacerbation of inflammation by leucocyte Fc receptor (FcR) activation, with consequences ranging from inflammatory cytokine and ROS release to chronic inflammation. The balance of ROS within a tissue will impact the efficacy of a stem cell therapy as ROS play an important role in stem cell self renewal and differentiation. In this study we utilised a chemiluminescent monitoring technique based on a ROS excitable photoprotein Pholasin, to quantify leucocyte ROS production in response to xenogeneic and recombinant human Ig of varying class and isotype with applications in stem cell selection. We were able to demonstrate inter-class differences in leucocyte ROS response to Ig which also varied between donors.

We conducted an experimental evolution study to investigate the combined effects of natural and sexual selection on the genital-arch lobes of male Drosophila simulans. Replicate populations were forced to evolve under lifetime monogamy (relaxed sexual selection) or lifetime polyandry (elevated sexual selection) and two temperature regimes, 25\u00b0C (relaxed natural selection) or 27\u00b0C (elevated natural selection) in a fully factorial design.

Natural selection caused some aspects of genital form to evolve away from their sexually selected shape, whereas natural and sexual selection operated in the same direction for other shape components.

Long time series of monitoring data since the 1960s were employed.Cs-137 in sea water and fish shows peaks in concentrations normalised to discharge rate (NACs) from 1985 to 1989. This is consistent with the time needed for dispersion in sea water following the preceding reductions in discharges; continuing enhancements of NACs above pre-1970s levels follow, consistent with the effect of activity remobilised from sediment. It is estimated that about 300 TBq of Cs-137 was remobilised from the immediate tidal area around Sellafield from 1989 to 2009. The enhancements in concentrations continue to this day, with the effect of remobilisation at present being \u223c6\u00a0TBq y(-1), approximately doubling the effect of direct discharges. To provide an indication for the future, the rate of Cs-137 remobilisation is decreasing with a half-time of \u223c6\u00a0years.The data for tritium and Tc-99 were examined in view of the interest in these radionuclides. The concentrations broadly reflect the levels of discharges and the need for dispersion. As expected, there is no evidence of sustained remobilisation of tritium, due to its mobility (or low Kd). The same lack of evidence was found to apply for Tc-99 despite known sorption of a small proportion of the discharged activity by Irish Sea sediments.Pu-239+240, by contrast, shows much evidence of the effect of remobilisation; concentrations in sea water near Sellafield have reduced much more slowly than discharges. At Southerness, \u223c50\u00a0km away, there was no significant reduction in sea water concentrations from 1985 to 1996, and winkles showed an increase then decrease in concentrations over this period, consistent with a spreading of activity. This effect was replicated in mud at Garlieston, \u223c70 km from Sellafield.For Am-241, the rate of grow-in from Pu-241 has dominated direct discharges since the late 1970s. Grow-in continues today in the Irish Sea at the rate of \u223c8 TBq y(-1), \u223c200 times the rate of direct discharge. Winkles at Southerness show evidence of a spreading effect of Am-241, with an increase then decrease from 1985 to 1996. At Garlieston there was an increase in concentrations in mud from 1985 to 1997, and at Carlingford in Northern Ireland the concentration of Am-241 in mud appears to be increasing still.

The FRTA predicts that oxidative damage should accumulate with age and negatively correlate with life span. We find that protein oxidation is greater in the shorter lived sex (females) and negatively genetically correlated with life span in both sexes. However, oxidative damage did not accumulate with age in either sex. Previously we have shown antagonistic pleiotropy between the genes for early-life reproductive effort and ageing rate in both sexes, although this was stronger in females. In females, we find that elevated fecundity early in life is associated with greater protein oxidation later in life, which is in turn positively correlated with the rate of ageing.

To set the context for these studies, we will start by reviewing structural information on model proteins from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, to which CFTR belongs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Carrier Proteins", "Crystallization", "Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator", "GTP-Binding Proteins", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation", "Protein Folding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA. jfhunt@biology.columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Chi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert C", "Last Name": "Ford", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine", "PubDate": "2013Feb01"}, {"PMID": "23349768", "Title": "Evaluation of a novel non-destructive catch and release technology for harvesting autologous adult stem cells.", "Abstract": "Cell based therapies are required now to meet the critical care needs of paediatrics and healthy ageing in an increasingly long-lived human population.

Opsonization was utilised to understand the influence of serum proteins on particle-induced cytokine production and release. Different metal compositions were used in the particulate format, Titanium (Ti), Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), and Stainless Steel 316L (SS), and were cultured in vitro with a mixed population of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes. The cells were also exposed to an exogenous stimulant mixture of phytohemagglutinin-P and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and opsonized particles with human serum. Interleukins, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as they are an indicator of the inflammation evoked by particulate metals. It has been experimentally evidenced that metal particles induced higher amounts of IL-6 and IL-1 but very low amounts of TNF-\u03b1.

We used Rosetta to design 48 proteins containing active sites predicted to carry out this mechanism, of which two show catalytic activity by mass spectrometry (MS). Substrate labeling measured by MS and site-directed mutagenesis experiments show that the designed active-site residues are responsible for activity, although rate acceleration over background is modest.

However, how do females recognise previous mates, particularly in the face of cognitive constraints? Female crickets appear to have evolved a simple but effective solution: females imbue males with their own cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) at mating and utilise chemosensory self-referencing to recognise recent mates. Female CHC profiles exhibited significant additive genetic variation, demonstrating that genetically unique chemical cues are available to support chemosensory self-referencing. CHC profiles of males became more similar to those of females after mating, indicating physical transfer of CHCs between individuals during copulation. Experimental perfuming of males with female CHCs resulted in a female aversion to males bearing chemical cues similar to their own. Chemosensory self-referencing, therefore, could be a widespread mechanism by which females increase the diversity of their mating partners.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry", "Gryllidae", "Hydrocarbons", "Male", "Mating Preference, Animal", "Solid Phase Microextraction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carie B", "Last Name": "Weddle", "Affiliation": "Behavior, Ecology, Evolution and Systematics Section, School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University, Normal, IL 61790-4120, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Steiger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher G", "Last Name": "Hamaker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey D", "Last Name": "Ower", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott K", "Last Name": "Sakaluk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Ecology letters", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "23258576", "Title": "Safety of an alkalinizing buffer designed for inhaled medications in humans.", "Abstract": "Airway acidification plays a role in disorders of the pulmonary tract.

We investigated if apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and transverse relaxation (T(2)) predict symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS), or merely indicate the AMS phenotype irrespective of symptoms. Fourteen normal subjects were studied in two groups; unambiguous AMS and no-AMS at 3,800\u2009m altitude (intermediate AMS scores were excluded). T(2) relaxation was estimated from a T(2) index of T(2)-weighted signal normalized by cerebrospinal fluid signal. Measurements were made in normoxia and repeated after 2\u2009days sustained hypoxia (AMS group symptomatic and no-AMS group asymptomatic) and after 7\u2009days hypoxia (both groups asymptomatic). Decreased ADC directly predicted AMS symptoms (P<0.05). Apparent diffusion coefficient increased in asymptomatic subjects, or as symptoms abated with acclimatization. This pattern was similar in basal ganglia, white matter, and gray matter. Corpus callosum behaved differently; restricted diffusion was absent (or rapidly reversed) in the splenium, and was sustained in the genu. In symptomatic subjects, T(2,index) decreased after 2\u2009days hypoxia and further decreased after 7 days. In asymptomatic subjects, T(2,index) initially increased after 2 days, but decreased after 7 days. T(2,index) changes were not predictive of AMS symptoms.

The ATPase motor of SecA is strongly homologous to that in DEAD-box RNA helicases. It remains unclear how local chemical events in its ATPase active site control the overall conformation of an ~100 kDa multidomain enzyme and drive protein transport. In this paper, we use biophysical methods to establish that a single electrostatic charge in the ATPase active site controls the global conformation of SecA. The enzyme undergoes an ATP-modulated endothermic conformational transition (ECT) believed to involve similar structural mechanics to the protein transport reaction. We have characterized the effects of an isosteric glutamate-to-glutamine mutation in the catalytic base, a mutation which mimics the immediate electrostatic consequences of ATP hydrolysis in the active site. Calorimetric studies demonstrate that this mutation facilitates the ECT in Escherichia coli SecA and triggers it completely in Bacillus subtilis SecA. Consistent with the substantial increase in entropy observed in the course of the ECT, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry demonstrates that it increases protein backbone dynamics in domain-domain interfaces at remote locations from the ATPase active site. The catalytic glutamate is one of ~250 charged amino acids in SecA, and yet neutralization of its side chain charge is sufficient to trigger a global order-disorder transition in this 100 kDa enzyme. The intricate network of structural interactions mediating this effect couples local electrostatic changes during ATP hydrolysis to global conformational and dynamic changes in SecA. This network forms the foundation of the allosteric mechanochemistry that efficiently harnesses the chemical energy stored in ATP to drive complex mechanical processes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Bacterial Proteins", "Catalytic Domain", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation", "SEC Translocation Channels", "SecA Proteins", "Static Electricity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dorothy M", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, 702A Fairchild Center, MC2434, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haiyan", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuanpeng J", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gaetano T", "Last Name": "Montelione", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2013Feb27"}, {"PMID": "22438176", "Title": "The use of acoustic force capture to ultra-purify lymphocyte subpopulations from human adult whole blood.", "Abstract": "Pre-analytical enrichment of cell populations prior to therapeutic delivery is of paramount interest throughout the fields of regenerative medicine and clinical interventional therapies.

In this research, leukocyte populations were obtained from erythrocyte-depleted primary whole blood from human adults and subjected to flow through acoustic fields within the ultrasound range to remove cellular debris. It was possible to demonstrate aggregation and holding of leukocytes by using ultrasound within the frequency range 11.448-11.483\u2009MHz, which facilitated removal of cellular debris by washing under continuous perfusion. The T-lymphocyte population were phenotypically characterized using CD4/CD8 (T(h)/T(c)) immunocytochemistry by flow cytometry and demonstrated a significant decrease in 'false-positive' events during cellular analysis, due to the efficient eradication of non-specifically reactive cells and tissue debris from the cell populations of interest.
