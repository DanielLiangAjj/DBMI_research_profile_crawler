It also mediates diverse cellular processes not associated with Ca2+ balance3-5. The functional pleiotropy of CaSR arises in part from its ability to signal through several G-protein subtypes6. We determined structures of CaSR in complex with G proteins from three different subfamilies: Gq, Gi and Gs. We found that the homodimeric CaSR of each complex couples to a single G protein through a common mode. This involves the C-terminal helix of each G\u03b1 subunit binding to a shallow pocket that is formed in one CaSR subunit by all three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3), an extended transmembrane helix 3 and an ordered C-terminal region. G-protein binding expands the transmembrane dimer interface, which is further stabilized by phospholipid. The restraint imposed by the receptor dimer, in combination with ICL2, enables G-protein activation by facilitating conformational transition of G\u03b1. We identified a single G\u03b1 residue that determines Gq and Gs versus Gi selectivity. The length and flexibility of ICL2 allows CaSR to bind all three G\u03b1 subtypes, thereby conferring capacity for promiscuous G-protein coupling.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Calcium", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Multimerization", "Receptors, Calcium-Sensing", "Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Substrate Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Zuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinseo", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aurel", "Last Name": "Frangaj", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianxiang", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guanqi", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jamie J", "Last Name": "Manning", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wesley B", "Last Name": "Asher", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhengyuan", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guo-Bin", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for BioMolecular Structure, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Liguo", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for BioMolecular Structure, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Mendez", "Affiliation": "National Center for Cryo-EM Access and Training, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Eng", "Affiliation": "National Center for Cryo-EM Access and Training, Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhening", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Grassucci", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wayne A", "Last Name": "Hendrickson", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

We introduce a novel small molecule fluorescent agent, termed SERTlight, that specifically labels serotonergic neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and axonal projections as a serotonin transporter (SERT) fluorescent substrate. SERTlight was developed by an iterative molecular design process, based on an aminoethyl-quinolone system, to integrate structural elements that impart SERT substrate activity, sufficient fluorescent brightness, and a broad absence of pharmacological activity, including at serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) receptors, other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and monoamine transporters. The high labeling selectivity is not achieved by high affinity binding to SERT itself but rather by a sufficient rate of SERT-mediated transport of SERTlight, resulting in accumulation of these molecules in 5HT neurons and yielding a robust and selective optical signal in the mammalian brain. SERTlight provides a stable signal, as it is not released via exocytosis nor by reverse SERT transport induced by 5HT releasers such as MDMA. SERTlight is optically, pharmacologically, and operationally orthogonal to a wide range of genetically encoded sensors, enabling multiplexed imaging. SERTlight enables labeling of distal 5HT axonal projections and simultaneous imaging of the release of endogenous 5HT using the GRAB5HT sensor, providing a new versatile molecular tool for the study of the serotonergic system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Serotonin", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Neurons", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Brain", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei-Li", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xavier", "Last Name": "Westergaard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Hwu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Hwu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Fiala", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Clay", "Last Name": "Lacefield", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Umed", "Last Name": "Boltaev", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Adriana M", "Last Name": "Mendieta", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mark S", "Last Name": "Sonders", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Keaon R", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Keer", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Wesley B", "Last Name": "Asher", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dalibor", "Last Name": "Sames", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2024Apr10"}, {"PMID": "38345920", "Title": "In Vitro Functional Profiling of Fentanyl and Nitazene Analogs at the \u03bc-Opioid Receptor Reveals High Efficacy for Gi Protein Signaling.", "Abstract": "Novel synthetic opioids (NSOs), including both fentanyl and non-fentanyl analogs that act as \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists, are associated with serious intoxication and fatal overdose.

Given that functionally selective or biased ligands preferentially activate one of these two groups of pathways, they may be superior medications for certain disease states. The identification of such ligands requires robust drug screening assays for both G protein and arrestin activity. This unit describes protocols for assays that monitor reversible arrestin recruitment to GPCRs in living cells using either bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) or nanoluciferase complementation (NanoLuc).

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsal striatum (dStr) encode action sequences through changes in firing at the start and/or stop of action sequences or sustained changes in firing throughout the sequence. Acetylcholine (ACh), released from cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), regulates striatal function by modulating MSN and interneuron excitability, dopamine and glutamate release, and synaptic plasticity. Cholinergic neurons in dStr pause their tonic firing during the performance of learned action sequences. Activation of dopamine type-2 receptors (D2Rs) on ChIs is one mechanism of ChI pausing. In this study we show that deleting D2Rs from ChIs by crossing D2-floxed with ChAT-Cre mice (D2Flox-ChATCre), which inhibits dopamine-mediated ChI pausing and leads to deficits in an operant action sequence task and lower breakpoints in a progressive ratio task. These data suggest that D2Flox-ChATCre mice have reduced motivation to work for sucrose reward, but show no generalized motor skill deficits. D2Flox-ChATCre mice perform similarly to controls in a simple reversal learning task, indicating normal behavioral flexibility, a cognitive function associated with ChIs. In vivo electrophysiological recordings show that D2Flox-ChatCre mice have deficits in sequence encoding, with fewer dStr MSNs encoding entire action sequences compared to controls. Thus, ChI D2R deletion appears to impair a neural substrate of action chunking. Virally replacing D2Rs in dStr ChIs in adult mice improves action sequence learning, but not the lower breakpoints, further suggesting that D2Rs on ChIs in the dStr are critical for sequence learning, but not for driving the motivational aspects of the task.", "Keywords": ["D2 receptors", "acetylcholine", "action sequence", "cholinergic interneuron", "medium spiny neuron", "operant conditioning"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jessica Hotard", "Last Name": "Chancey", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA, 20852."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Kellendonk", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Lovinger", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA, 20852."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Aug29"}, {"PMID": "37655158", "Title": "Methods for automating the analysis of live-cell single-molecule FRET data.", "Abstract": "Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) is a powerful imaging platform capable of revealing dynamic changes in the conformation and proximity of biological molecules.

"Abstract": "Aminergic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that transduce signals from small endogenous biogenic amines to regulate intracellular signaling pathways. Agonist binding in the ligand binding pocket on the extracellular side opens and prepares a cavity on the intracellular face of the receptors to interact with and activate G proteins and \u03b2-arrestins. Here, by reviewing and analyzing all available aminergic receptor structures, we seek to identify activation-related conformational changes that are independent of the specific scaffold of the bound agonist, which we define as \"activation conformational changes\" (ACCs). While some common intracellular ACCs have been well-documented, identifying common extracellular ACCs, including those in the ligand binding pocket, is complicated by local adjustments to different ligand scaffolds. Our analysis shows no common ACCs at the extracellular ends of the transmembrane helices. Furthermore, the restricted access to the ligand binding pocket identified previously in some receptors is not universal. Notably, the Trp6.48 toggle switch and the Pro5.50-Ile3.40-Phe6.44 (PIF) motif at the bottom of the ligand binding pocket have previously been proposed to mediate the conformational consequences of ligand binding to the intracellular side of the receptors. Our analysis shows that common ACCs in the ligand binding pocket are associated with the PIF motif and nearby residues, including Trp6.48, but fails to support a shared rotamer toggle associated with activation. However, we identify two common rearrangements between the extracellular and middle subsegments, and propose a novel \"activation switch\" motif common to all aminergic receptors. This motif includes the middle subsegments of transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6 and integrates both the PIF motif and Trp6.48.", "Keywords": ["aminergic receptors", "conformational analysis", "cryo-EM structures", "crystal structures", "ligand binding pocket", "receptor activation"], "MeSH terms": ["Protein Conformation", "Ligands", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Signal Transduction", "GTP-Binding Proteins", "Binding Sites"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kuo Hao", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Computational Chemistry and Molecular Biophysics Section, Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse\u2500Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jamie J", "Last Name": "Manning", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Computational Chemistry and Molecular Biophysics Section, Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse\u2500Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21224, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of chemical information and modeling", "PubDate": "2023Aug28"}, {"PMID": "37489013", "Title": "Assessment of the potential of novel and classical opioids to induce respiratory depression in mice.", "Abstract": "Opioid-induced respiratory depression limits the use of \u03bc-opioid receptor agonists in clinical settings and is the main cause of opioid overdose fatalities.

Our bioinformatic analysis revealed distinct transcriptomic signatures between the two drugs, with TIAN more directly reversing SNI-induced differentially expressed genes, and further predicted several upstream regulators that may be implicated in onset of action.

Lphn2 acts as a repulsive receptor in distal CA1 neurons to direct their axons to the proximal subiculum, and as a repulsive ligand in the proximal subiculum to direct proximal CA1 axons to the distal subiculum. It remains unclear if Lphn2-mediated intracellular signaling is required for its role in either context. Here, we show that Lphn2 couples to G\u03b112/13 in heterologous cells; this coupling is increased by constitutive exposure of the tethered agonist. Specific mutations of Lphn2's tethered agonist region disrupt its G protein coupling and autoproteolytic cleavage, whereas mutating the autoproteolytic cleavage site alone prevents cleavage but preserves a functional tethered agonist. Using an in vivo misexpression assay, we demonstrate that wild-type Lphn2 misdirects proximal CA1 axons to the proximal subiculum and that Lphn2 tethered agonist activity is required for its role as a repulsive receptor in axons. By contrast, neither tethered agonist activity nor autoproteolysis were necessary for Lphn2's role as a repulsive ligand in the subiculum target neurons.

Recent findings highlight a direct association between brain PUFA levels and dopamine transmission, a major neuromodulatory system implicated in the etiology of psychiatric symptoms. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that membrane enrichment in the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), potentiates ligand binding to the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), suggesting that DHA acts as an allosteric modulator of this receptor. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that DHA has a high preference for interaction with the D2R and show that membrane unsaturation selectively enhances the conformational dynamics of the receptor around its second intracellular loop. We find that membrane unsaturation spares G protein activity but potentiates the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin in cells. Furthermore, in vivo n-3 PUFA deficiency blunts the behavioral effects of two D2R ligands, quinpirole and aripiprazole.

latrophilin 3 (ADGRL3), a cell adhesion molecule highly expressed in the central nervous system, acts in synapse formation through trans interactions with its ligands. It is largely unknown if these interactions serve a purely adhesive function or can modulate G protein signaling. To assess how different structural elements of ADGRL3 (e.g., the adhesive domains, autoproteolytic cleavage site, or tethered agonist (TA)) impact receptor function, we require constructs that disrupt specific receptor features without impacting others. While we showed previously that mutating conserved Phe and Met residues in the TA of ADGRL3-C-terminal fragment (CTF), a CTF truncated to the G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site, abolishes receptor-mediated G protein activation, we now find that autoproteolytic cleavage is disrupted in the full-length version of this construct. To identify a construct that disrupts TA-dependent activity without impacting proteolysis, we explored other mutations in the TA. We found that mutating the sixth and seventh residues of the TA, Leu and Met, to Ala impaired activity in a serum response element activity assay for both full-length and CTF constructs. We confirmed this activity loss results from impaired G protein coupling using an assay that acutely exposes the TA through controlled proteolysis. The ADGRL3 mutant expresses normally at the cell surface, and immunoblotting shows that it undergoes normal autoproteolysis. Thus, we found a construct that disrupts tethered agonism while retaining autoproteolytic cleavage, providing a tool to disentangle these functions in\u00a0vivo.

Recent evidence indicates that specific mGlu receptor protomers can heterodimerize and that these heterodimers can exhibit different pharmacology when compared to their homodimeric counterparts.

Taken together with our electrophysiology observations, these results suggest that a receptor with pharmacology consistent with an mGlu7/8 heterodimer modulates the activity of SC-CA1 synapses. Building on this hypothesis, we identified two additional structurally related mGlu7 NAMs that also differ in their activity at mGlu7/8 heterodimers, in a manner consistent with their ability to inhibit synaptic transmission and plasticity at SC-CA1.

The early phase of illness represents a unique opportunity to provide effective and individualized interventions that can alter illness trajectories. Developmental age and illness stage, including temporal variation in neurobiology, can be targeted to develop phase-specific clinical assessment, biomarkers, and interventions. We review an earlier model whereby an initial glutamate signaling deficit progresses through different phases of allostatic adaptation, moving from potentially reversible functional abnormalities associated with early psychosis and working memory dysfunction, and ending with difficult-to-reverse structural changes after chronic illness. We integrate this model with evidence of dopaminergic abnormalities, including cortical D1 dysfunction, which develop during adolescence. We discuss how this model and a focus on a potential critical window of intervention in the early stages of schizophrenia impact the approach to research design and clinical care.

The actions of these drugs at the dopamine transporter (DAT) play a critical role in their therapeutic efficacy as well as their liability for abuse and dependence. To date, however, the mechanisms that mediate these actions are not well-understood, and therapeutic interventions for AMPH abuse have been limited. Drug exposure can induce broad changes in gene expression that can contribute to neuroplasticity and effect long-lasting changes in neuronal function. Identifying genes and gene pathways perturbed by drug exposure is essential to our understanding of the molecular basis of drug addiction. In this study, we used Drosophila as a model to examine AMPH-induced transcriptional changes that are DAT-dependent, as those would be the most relevant to the stimulatory effects of the drug. Using this approach, we found genes involved in the control of mRNA translation to be significantly upregulated in response to AMPH in a DAT-dependent manner. To further prioritize genes for validation, we explored functional convergence between these genes and genes we identified in a genome-wide association study of AMPH sensitivity using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. We validated a number of these genes by showing that they act specifically in dopamine neurons to mediate the behavioral effects of AMPH.

Using temporally controlled inhibition of D1R-NMDAR heteromerization, we unraveled their selective implication in early phases of cocaine-mediated synaptic, morphological, and behavioral responses. In contrast, preventing D2R-NMDAR heteromerization blocked the persistence of these adaptations. Interfering with these heteromers spared natural reward processing. Notably, we established that D2R-NMDAR complexes exist in human samples and showed that, despite a decreased D2R protein expression in the NAc, individuals with psychostimulant use disorder display a higher proportion of D2R forming heteromers with NMDAR.

The recent discovery that tianeptine is a mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist has provided a potential avenue for expanding our understanding of antidepressant treatment beyond the monoamine hypothesis. Thus, our studies aim to understand the neural circuits underlying tianeptine's antidepressant effects. We show that tianeptine induces rapid antidepressant-like effects in mice after as little as one week of treatment. Critically, we also demonstrate that tianeptine's mechanism of action is distinct from fluoxetine in two important aspects: (1) tianeptine requires MORs for its chronic antidepressant-like effect, while fluoxetine does not, and (2) unlike fluoxetine, tianeptine does not promote hippocampal neurogenesis. Using cell-type specific MOR knockouts we further show that MOR expression on GABAergic cells-specifically somatostatin-positive neurons-is necessary for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like responses to tianeptine. Using central infusion of tianeptine, we also implicate the ventral hippocampus as a potential site of antidepressant action. Moreover, we show a dissociation between the antidepressant-like phenotype and other opioid-like phenotypes resulting from acute tianeptine administration such as analgesia, conditioned place preference, and hyperlocomotion.

This mechanism is particularly relevant to the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, given the abnormalities in cortical dopamine (DA) neurotransmission and in the expression of D1R. Despite the critical need for D1R-based therapeutics, many factors have complicated their development and prevented this important therapeutic target from being adequately interrogated. Challenges include determination of the optimal level of D1R stimulation needed to improve cognitive performance, especially when D1R expression levels, affinity states, DA levels, and the resulting D1R occupancy by DA, are not clearly known in schizophrenia, and may display great interindividual and intraindividual variability related to cognitive states and other physiological variables. These directly affect the selection of the level of stimulation necessary to correct the underlying neurobiology. The optimal mechanism for stimulation is also unknown and could include partial or full agonism, biased agonism, or positive allosteric modulation. Furthermore, the development of D1R targeting drugs has been complicated by complexities in extrapolating from in vitro affinity determinations to in vivo use. Prior D1R-targeted drugs have been unsuccessful due to poor bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and insufficient target engagement at tolerable doses. Newer drugs have recently become available, and these must be tested in the context of carefully designed paradigms that address methodological challenges.

Since then, advanced clinical research methods, including brain imaging, have refined our understanding of the relationship between striatal dopamine and clinical phenotypes as well as disease trajectory. These studies point to striatal dopamine D2 receptors, the main target for all current antipsychotic medications, as being involved in both positive and negative symptoms. Simultaneously, animal models have been central to investigating causal relationships between striatal dopamine D2 receptors and behavioral phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia. We begin this article by reviewing the circuit, cell-type and subcellular locations of dopamine D2 receptors and their downstream signaling pathways. We then summarize results from several mouse models in which D2 receptor levels were altered in various brain regions, cell-types and developmental periods.

This has led to great interest in the identification of biased ligands that favor either G protein or \u03b2-arrestin-signaling pathways. However, nearly all screening techniques for measuring \u03b2-arrestin recruitment have required C-terminal receptor modifications that can in principle alter protein interactions and thus signaling. Here, we have developed a novel luminescence-based assay to measure \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the membrane or early endosomes by unmodified receptors. Our strategy uses NanoLuc, an engineered luciferase from Oplophorus gracilirostris (deep-sea shrimp) that is smaller and brighter than other well-established luciferases. Recently, several publications have explored functional NanoLuc split sites for use in complementation assays. We have identified a unique split site within NanoLuc and fused the corresponding N-terminal fragment to either a plasma membrane or early endosome tether and the C-terminal fragment to \u03b2-arrestins, which form the basis for the MeNArC and EeNArC assays, respectively. Upon receptor activation, \u03b2-arrestin is recruited to the membrane and subsequently internalized in an agonist concentration-dependent manner. This recruitment promotes complementation of the two NanoLuc fragments, thereby reconstituting functional NanoLuc, allowing for quantification of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment with a single luminescence signal.

Here, we report six new substrate-bound structures of MhsT, which, in conjunction with functional studies, reveal how the flexibility of a Gly-Met-Gly (GMG) motif in the unwound region of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) is central for the recognition of substrates of different size by tailoring the binding site shape and volume. MhsT mutants, harboring substitutions within the unwound GMG loop and substrate binding pocket that mimick the binding sites of eukaryotic SLC6A18/B0AT3 and SLC6A19/B0AT1 transporters of neutral amino acids, exhibited impaired transport of aromatic amino acids that require a large binding site volume. Conservation of a general (G/A/C)\u03a6G motif among eukaryotic members of SLC6 family suggests a role for this loop in a common mechanism for substrate recognition and translocation by SLC6 transporters of broad substrate specificity.", "Keywords": ["MhsT", "X-ray crystallography", "amino acids uptake", "neurotransmitter", "sodium symporters", "substrate recognition"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Transport Systems", "Amino Acids", "Bacillus", "Bacterial Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Membrane Proteins", "Protein Conformation", "Substrate Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dorota", "Last Name": "Focht", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience-DANDRITE, Nordic-EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Neumann", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience-DANDRITE, Nordic-EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Lyons", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience-DANDRITE, Nordic-EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Ander", "Last Name": "Eguskiza Bilbao", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience-DANDRITE, Nordic-EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Rickard", "Last Name": "Blunck", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Malinauskaite", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience-DANDRITE, Nordic-EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Ilona O", "Last Name": "Schwarz", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Poul", "Last Name": "Nissen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Danish Research Institute of Translational Neuroscience-DANDRITE, Nordic-EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."}], "Journal": "The EMBO journal", "PubDate": "2021Jan04"}, {"PMID": "32926777", "Title": "Novel Fluorescent Ligands Enable Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy of the Dopamine Transporter.", "Abstract": "The dopamine transporter (DAT) is critical for spatiotemporal control of dopaminergic neurotransmission and is the target for therapeutic agents, including ADHD medications, and abused substances, such as cocaine.

The cocaine analogue MFZ2-12 (1) was conjugated to novel rhodamine-based Janelia Fluorophores (JF549 and JF646). High affinity binding of the resulting ligands to DAT was demonstrated by potent inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake in DAT transfected CAD cells and by competition radioligand binding experiments on rat striatal membranes.

It is generally thought that agonist-induced receptor-G protein association necessarily promotes G protein activation and, conversely, that activated GPCRs do not interact with G proteins that they do not activate. Here we show that GPCRs can form agonist-dependent complexes with G proteins that they do not activate. Using cell-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and luminescence assays we find that vasopressin V2 receptors (V2R) associate with both Gs and G12 heterotrimers when stimulated with the agonist arginine vasopressin (AVP). However, unlike V2R-Gs complexes, V2R-G12 complexes are not destabilized by guanine nucleotides and do not promote G12 activation. Activating V2R does not lead to signaling responses downstream of G12 activation, but instead inhibits basal G12-mediated signaling, presumably by sequestering G12 heterotrimers. Overexpressing G12 inhibits G protein receptor kinase (GRK) and arrestin recruitment to V2R and receptor internalization. Formyl peptide (FPR1 and FPR2) and Smoothened (Smo) receptors also form complexes with G12 that are insensitive to nucleotides, suggesting that unproductive GPCR-G12 complexes are not unique to V2R.

Thus, ADGRL3 is a potential target for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve dopamine dysfunction, but its basic signaling properties are poorly understood. Identification of adhesion GPCR signaling partners has been limited by a lack of tools to acutely activate these receptors in living cells. Here, we design a novel acute activation strategy to characterize ADGRL3 signaling by engineering a receptor construct in which we could trigger acute activation enzymatically.

Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique 'intersubunit latch' within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium",

our ongoing efforts to develop selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the mGlu2/4 heterodimeric receptor that exists in the CNS and may represent a novel drug target to modulate the glutamatergic system. As multiple hit-to-lead campaigns from HTS hits failed to produce selective small molecule mGlu2/4 heterodimer PAMs, we were inspired by the work of Portoghese to synthesize and evaluate a set of nine bivalent tethered ligands (possessing an mGlu2 PAM at one terminus and an mGlu4 PAM at the other). Utilizing G protein-Inwardly Rectifying Potassium (GIRK) channel functional assays, we found that the tethered ligands displayed PAM activity in a cell line co-expressing both mGlu2 and mGlu4 but also in cells expressing mGlu2 or mGlu4 alone. In a CODA-RET assay, one of the tethered ligands potentiated mGlu2/4 heterodimers; however, another compound displayed 75-fold preference for the mGlu2/2 homodimer over heterodimeric mGlu2/4 or homomeric mGlu4/4.

substances\". SCRAs offer unregulated alternatives to cannabis that evade routine drug tests, but their use is increasingly associated with severe toxicity and death worldwide. Little is currently known about SCRA molecular pharmacology, or the mechanisms underpinning their toxicity, although the effects are believed to be primarily mediated by the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1). In this study, we aimed to characterise the signalling profiles of a structurally diverse panel of novel SCRAs at CB1. We compare SCRAs to traditional reference cannabinoids CP55,940, WIN55,212-2, and THC. The activity of the SCRAs was assessed in key receptor signalling and regulatory pathways, including cAMP production, translocation of \u03b2-arrestin 1 and 2, and receptor internalisation. The activity profiles of the ligands were also evaluated using operational analysis to identify ligand bias. Results revealed that SCRAs activities were relatively balanced in the pathways evaluated (compared to WIN55,212-2), although 5F-CUMYL-P7AICA and XLR-11 possessed partial efficacy in cAMP stimulation and \u03b2-arrestin translocation. Notably, the SCRAs showed distinct potency and efficacy profiles compared to THC. In particular, while the majority of SCRAs demonstrated robust \u03b2-arrestin translocation, cAMP stimulation, and internalisation, THC failed to elicit high efficacy responses in any of these assays. Further study is required to delineate if these pathways could contribute to SCRA toxicity in humans.", "Keywords": ["Cannabinoid receptor", "Ligand bias", "Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist", "THC", "\u03b2-Arrestin"], "MeSH terms": ["Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists", "Cannabinoids", "Cyclic AMP", "Designer Drugs", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Indoles", "Ligands", "Protein Transport", "Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1", "Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2", "Signal Transduction", "Transfection", "beta-Arrestins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Monica", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Jamie J", "Last Name": "Manning", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Finlay", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Pharmacology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States; Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samuel D", "Last Name": "Banister", "Affiliation": "Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia; School of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Natasha L", "Last Name": "Grimsey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Glass", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.

In addition, risperidone occupies a sub-pocket near the Na+ binding site, whereas eticlopride does not. Based on these findings and our experimental results, we propose that the divergent receptor conformations stabilized by Na+-sensitive eticlopride and Na+-insensitive risperidone correspond to different degrees of inverse agonism.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies are associated with a decay of circadian rhythms, disruption of sleep patterns, and impaired cognitive function but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are still unclear. Traditional approaches in neurodegeneration research have focused on understanding how pathology impinges on circadian function. Since in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies tau proteostasis is compromised, here we sought to understand the role of tau protein in neuronal circadian biology and related behavior. Considering molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are conserved from Drosophila to humans, here we took advantage of a recently developed tau-deficient Drosophila line to show that loss of tau promotes dysregulation of daily circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Strikingly, tau deficiency dysregulates the structural plasticity of the small ventral lateral circadian pacemaker neurons by disrupting the temporal cytoskeletal remodeling of its dorsal axonal projections and by inducing a slight increase in the cytoplasmic accumulation of core clock proteins.

AMB-FUBINACA is a member of this class of drugs and is responsible for a large proportion of SCRA-related toxicity both in New Zealand and internationally. Strikingly, little is currently known about the mechanisms by which SCRAs exert toxic effects or whether their activity through the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (the mediator of cannabinoid-related psychoactivity) is sufficient to explain clinical observations. The current study therefore set out to perform a basic molecular pharmacology characterization of AMB-FUBINACA (in comparison to traditional research cannabinoids CP55,940, WIN55,212-2, and \u03949-THC) in fundamental pathways of receptor activity, including cAMP inhibition, pERK activation, ability to drive CB1 internalization, and ability to induce translocation of \u03b2-arrestins-1 and -2. Activity pathways were then compared by operational analysis to indicate whether AMB-FUBINACA may be a biased ligand. Results revealed that AMB-FUBINACA is highly efficacious and potent in all pathways assayed. However, surprisingly, bias analysis suggested that \u03949-THC, not AMB-FUBINACA, may be a biased ligand, with it being less active in both arrestin pathways than predicted by the activity of the other ligands tested.

Nonetheless, these tools are based on engineered non-native proteins that may (i) express at nonphysiological levels, (ii) localize and turnover incorrectly, and/or (iii) fail to interact with endogenous partners. Alternatively, membrane-anchored ligands (t-toxins, DARTs) target endogenous receptors with molecular and cell type specificity but cannot be turned on and off. In this study, we used a combination of chemistry, biology, and light to control endogenous metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2), a Family C GPCR, in primary cortical neurons. mGluR2 was rapidly, reversibly, and selectively activated with photoswitchable glutamate tethered to a genetically targeted-plasma membrane anchor (membrane anchored Photoswitchable Orthogonal Remotely Tethered Ligand; maPORTL). Photoactivation was tuned by adjusting the length of the PORTL as well as the expression level and geometry of the membrane anchor.

Recently, growing use of the plant in the United States and concerns that kratom represents an uncontrolled drug with potential abuse liability, have highlighted the need for more careful study of its pharmacological activity. The major active alkaloid found in kratom, mitragynine, has been reported to have opioid agonist and analgesic activity in vitro and in animal models, consistent with the purported effects of kratom leaf in humans. However, preliminary research has provided some evidence that mitragynine and related compounds may act as atypical opioid agonists, inducing therapeutic effects such as analgesia, while limiting the negative side effects typical of classical opioids. Here we report evidence that an active metabolite plays an important role in mediating the analgesic effects of mitragynine. We find that mitragynine is converted in vitro in both mouse and human liver preparations to the much more potent mu-opioid receptor agonist 7-hydroxymitragynine and that this conversion is mediated by cytochrome P450 3A isoforms. Further, we show that 7-hydroxymitragynine is formed from mitragynine in mice and that brain concentrations of this metabolite are sufficient to explain most or all of the opioid-receptor-mediated analgesic activity of mitragynine. At the same time, mitragynine is found in the brains of mice at very high concentrations relative to its opioid receptor binding affinity, suggesting that it does not directly activate opioid receptors. The results presented here provide a metabolism-dependent mechanism for the analgesic effects of mitragynine and clarify the importance of route of administration for determining the activity of this compound. Further, they raise important questions about the interpretation of existing data on mitragynine and highlight critical areas for further research in animals and humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew C", "Last Name": "Kruegel", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rajendra", "Last Name": "Uprety", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Grinnell", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Langreck", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth A", "Last Name": "Pekarskaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Valerie", "Last Name": "Le Rouzic", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Ansonoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Cell Biology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, United States."}, {"First Name": "Madalee M", "Last Name": "Gassaway", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "John E", "Last Name": "Pintar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Cell Biology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gavril W", "Last Name": "Pasternak", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Susruta", "Last Name": "Majumdar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dalibor", "Last Name": "Sames", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Pharmacology, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS central science", "PubDate": "2019Jun26"}, {"PMID": "31219669", "Title": "Come Fly with Me: An overview of dopamine receptors in Drosophila melanogaster.", "Abstract": "Dopamine (DA) receptors play critical roles in a wide range of behaviours, including sensory processing, motor function, reward and arousal.

Some receptor-arrestin interactions are relatively well understood and considered responsible for specific therapeutic or adverse outcomes. Coupling of arrestins with cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2) has been reported, though the majority of studies have not systematically characterized the differential ligand dependence of this activity. In addition, many prior studies have utilized bovine (rather than human) arrestins, and the most widely applied assays require reporter-tagged receptors, which prevent meaningful comparison between receptor types. We have employed a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) method that does not require the use of tagged receptors and thereby allows comparisons of arrestin translocation between receptor types, as well as with cells lacking the receptor of interest - an important control. The ability of a selection of CB1 and CB2 agonists to stimulate cell surface translocation of human and bovine \u03b2-arrestin-1 and -2 was assessed. We find that some CB1 ligands induce moderate \u03b2-arrestin-2 translocation in comparison with vasopressin V2 receptor (a robust arrestin recruiter); however, CB1 coupling with \u03b2-arrestin-1 and CB2 with either arrestin elicited low relative efficacies. A range of efficacies between ligands was evident for both receptors and arrestins. Endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol stood out as a high efficacy ligand for translocation of \u03b2-arrestin-2 via CB1. \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol was generally unable to elicit translocation of either arrestin subtype via CB1 or CB2; however, control experiments revealed translocation in cells not expressing CB1/CB2, which may assist in explaining some discrepancy with the literature. Overexpression of GRK2 had modest influence on CB1/CB2-induced arrestin translocation. Results with bovine and human arrestins were largely analogous, but a few instances of inconsistent rank order potencies/efficacies between bovine and human arrestins raise the possibility that subtle differences in receptor conformation stabilized by these ligands manifest in disparate affinities for the two arrestin species, with important potential consequences for interpretation in ligand bias studies.

Insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2-cells express the machinery for DA synthesis and catabolism, as well as all five DA receptors. In these cells, DA functions as a negative regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), which is mediated by DA D2-like receptors including D2 (D2R) and D3 (D3R) receptors. However, the fundamental mechanisms of DA synthesis, storage, release, and signaling in pancreatic \u03b2-cells and their functional relevance in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the roles of the DA precursor L-DOPA in \u03b2-cell DA synthesis and release in conjunction with the signaling mechanisms underlying DA's inhibition of GSIS. Our results show that the uptake of L-DOPA is essential for establishing intracellular DA stores in \u03b2-cells. Glucose stimulation significantly enhances L-DOPA uptake, leading to increased DA release and GSIS reduction in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Furthermore, D2R and D3R act in combination to mediate dopaminergic inhibition of GSIS. Transgenic knockout mice in which \u03b2-cell D2R or D3R expression is eliminated exhibit diminished DA secretion during glucose stimulation, suggesting a new mechanism where D2-like receptors modify DA release to modulate GSIS. Lastly, \u03b2-cell-selective D2R knockout mice exhibit marked postprandial hyperinsulinemia in vivo. These results reveal that peripheral D2R and D3R receptors play important roles in metabolism through their inhibitory effects on GSIS. This opens the possibility that blockade of peripheral D2-like receptors by drugs including antipsychotic medications may significantly contribute to the metabolic disturbances observed clinically.",

Their actions at dopaminergic neurons are thought to mediate their therapeutic efficacy as well as their liability for abuse and dependence. AMPHs target the dopamine transporter (DAT), the plasmalemmal membrane protein that mediates the inactivation of released dopamine (DA) through its reuptake. AMPHs act as substrates for DAT and are known to cause mobilization of dopamine (DA) to the cell exterior via DAT-mediated reverse transport (efflux). It has become increasingly evident that the mechanisms that regulate AMPH-induced DA efflux are distinct from those that regulate DA uptake. Central to these mechanisms is the phosphorylation of the DAT amino (N)-terminus, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to facilitate DAT-mediated DA efflux, without impacting other aspects of DAT physiology. This review aims to summarize the current status of knowledge regarding DAT N-terminal phosphorylation and its regulation by protein modulators and the membrane microenvironment.

SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu2.65 in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E2.65A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu2.65 and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E2.65A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of ~77 \u03bcs of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E2.65A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu2.65. Our results also indicate that the E2.65A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu2.65 in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Allosteric Regulation", "Allosteric Site", "Bayes Theorem", "Carboxylic Acids", "Cluster Analysis", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Indoles", "Isoquinolines", "Ligands", "Markov Chains", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Receptors, Dopamine D3", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ravi Kumar", "Last Name": "Verma", "Affiliation": "Computational Chemistry and Molecular Biophysics Unit, Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse-Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ara M", "Last Name": "Abramyan", "Affiliation": "Computational Chemistry and Molecular Biophysics Unit, Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse-Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mayako", "Last Name": "Michino", "Affiliation": "Computational Chemistry and Molecular Biophysics Unit, Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse-Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "R Benjamin", "Last Name": "Free", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neuropharmacology Section, National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Sibley", "Affiliation": "Molecular Neuropharmacology Section, National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Departments of Psychiatry and Pharmacology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "J Robert", "Last Name": "Lane", "Affiliation": "Drug Discovery Biology, Department of Pharmacology and Medicinal Chemistry, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University (Parkville campus), Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Computational Chemistry and Molecular Biophysics Unit, Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse-Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2018Jan"}, {"PMID": "29335402", "Title": "A partially-open inward-facing intermediate conformation of LeuT is associated with Na+ release and substrate transport.", "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS), targets of antidepressants and psychostimulants, clear neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft through sodium (Na+)-coupled transport.

We sought to impart the logic of rhodopsin to light-insensitive Family A GPCRs in order to enable their remote control in a receptor-specific, cell-type-specific, and spatiotemporally precise manner. Dopamine receptors (DARs) are of particular interest for their roles in motor coordination, appetitive, and aversive behavior, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Using an azobenzene derivative of the well-known DAR ligand 2-(N-phenethyl-N-propyl)amino-5-hydroxytetralin (PPHT), we were able to rapidly, reversibly, and selectively block dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R and D2R) when the PTL was conjugated to an engineered cysteine near the dopamine binding site.

Within the PVT, D2Rs are inhibitory as their activation inhibits neuronal action potentials in brain slices.

We measured the kinetic binding properties of a series of typical and atypical APDs in a novel time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, and correlated these properties with their EPS and prolactin-elevating liabilities at therapeutic doses. EPS are robustly predicted by a rebinding model that considers the microenvironment of postsynaptic D2 receptors and integrates association and dissociation rates to calculate the net rate of reversal of receptor blockade. Thus, optimizing binding kinetics at the D2 receptor may result in APDs with improved therapeutic profile.Atypical antipsychotics show reduced extrapyramidal side effects compared to first generation drugs.

However, the self-healing strategy has yet to achieve its predicted potential, particularly in the presence of ambient oxygen where live-cell imaging studies must often be performed. To identify key bottlenecks in this technology that can be used to guide further engineering developments, we synthesized a series of Cy5 derivatives linked to the protective agent cyclooctatetraene (COT) and examined the photophysical mechanisms curtailing their performance. The data obtained reveal that the photostability of self-healing fluorophores is limited by reactivity of the COT protective agent. The addition of electron withdrawing substituents to COT reduced its susceptibility to reactions with molecular oxygen and the fluorophore to which it is attached and increased its capacity to participate in triplet energy transfer. Exploiting these insights, we designed and synthesized a suite of modified COT-fluorophores spanning the visible spectrum that exhibited markedly increased intra-molecular photostabilization. Under ambient oxygen conditions, the photostability of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophore derivatives increased by 3- and 9-fold in vitro and by 2- and 6-fold in living cells, respectively.

This active accumulation of substrate against its concentration gradient is driven by the transmembrane Na+ gradient and requires that the transporter traverses several conformational states. LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homolog, has been crystallized in outward-open, outward-occluded, and inward-open states. Two crystal structures of another prokaryotic NSS homolog, the multihydrophobic amino acid transporter (MhsT) from Bacillus halodurans, have been resolved in novel inward-occluded states, with the extracellular vestibule closed and the intracellular portion of transmembrane segment 5 (TM5i) in either an unwound or a helical conformation. We have investigated the potential involvement of TM5i in binding and unbinding of Na2, i.e. the Na+ bound in the Na2 site, by carrying out comparative molecular dynamics simulations of the models derived from the two MhsT structures. We find that the helical TM5i conformation is associated with a higher propensity for Na2 release, which leads to the repositioning of the N terminus and transition to an inward-open state. By using comparative interaction network analysis, we also identify allosteric pathways connecting TM5i and the Na2 binding site to the extracellular and intracellular regions.

Here we demonstrate that the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice require MOR. Interestingly, while tianeptine also produces many opiate-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it does not lead to tolerance or withdrawal. Furthermore, the primary metabolite of tianeptine (MC5), which has a longer half-life, mimics the behavioral effects of tianeptine in a MOR-dependent fashion.

Regulation of transport across membranes of essential chemicals, including water, nutrients, hormones and many drugs, is therefore key to cellular homeostasis and physiological processes. The two main transporter superfamilies are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that primarily function as efflux transporters, and the solute carrier (SLC) transporters. SLC transporters encompass 52 gene families with almost 400 different human transporter genes. Although long under-explored, SLC transporters are an emerging drug target class and the molecular target of several approved inhibitor drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression and sodium/glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitors for diabetes. Interestingly though, although loss-of-function mutations in numerous human SLC transporters are linked to Mendelian diseases, few reports of SLC transporter activators have appeared, and only inhibitors have been advanced to clinical studies. In this commentary, we discuss several strategies for potentiating SLC transporter function, from direct acting potentiators to modulators of transcription, translation or trafficking. We review the progress made in recent years toward the understanding of the structural and molecular basis of SLC transporter function and the pathways and mechanisms that regulate SLC expression, and describe the opportunities these new insights present for discovery of SLC transporter potentiators.

To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations.

As the glutamate binding sites among the eight mGlu receptors are highly conserved, modulation of receptor activity via allosteric sites within the receptor transmembrane domains using positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs, respectively) has become a common strategy. We and others have used PAMs targeting mGlu4 to show that potentiation of receptor signaling induces antiparkinsonian activity in a variety of PD animal models, including haloperidol-induced catalepsy and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion. Recently, mGlu4 has been reported to form heteromeric complexes with other mGlu receptor subtypes, such as mGlu2, and the resulting heteromer exhibits a distinct pharmacological profile in response to allosteric modulators. For example, some mGlu4 PAMs do not appear to potentiate glutamate activity when mGlu2 and mGlu4 are coexpressed, whereas other compounds potentiate mGlu4 responses regardless of mGlu2 coexpression. We report here the discovery and characterization of VU0418506, a novel mGlu4 PAM with activity in rodent PD models. Using pharmacological approaches and Complemented Donor-Acceptor resonance energy transfer (CODA-RET) technology, we find that VU0418506 does not potentiate agonist-induced activity when mGlu2 and mGlu4 are heterodimerized, suggesting that the antiparkinsonian action of mGlu4 PAMs can be induced by compounds without activity at mGlu2/4 heteromers.", "Keywords": ["Allosteric modulator", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "metabotropic glutamate receptor"], "MeSH terms": ["Allosteric Regulation", "Animals", "Antiparkinson Agents", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Apomorphine", "Brain", "Catalepsy", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dopamine Agonists", "Forelimb", "Glutamic Acid", "HEK293 Cells", "Haloperidol", "Humans", "Oxidopamine", "Parkinson Disease", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate", "Transfection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Colleen M", "Last Name": "Niswender", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carrie K", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute , New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Bubser", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Analisa", "Last Name": "Thompson Gray", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anna L", "Last Name": "Blobaum", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Darren W", "Last Name": "Engers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alice L", "Last Name": "Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthew T", "Last Name": "Loch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J Scott", "Last Name": "Daniels", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Craig W", "Last Name": "Lindsley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Corey R", "Last Name": "Hopkins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute , New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "P Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Conn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS chemical neuroscience", "PubDate": "2016Sep21"}, {"PMID": "27192616", "Title": "Synthetic and Receptor Signaling Explorations of the Mitragyna Alkaloids: Mitragynine as an Atypical Molecular Framework for Opioid Receptor Modulators.", "Abstract": "Mu-opioid receptor agonists represent mainstays of pain management. However, the therapeutic use of these agents is associated with serious side effects, including potentially lethal respiratory depression. Accordingly, there is a longstanding interest in the development of new opioid analgesics with improved therapeutic profiles. The alkaloids of the Southeast Asian plant Mitragyna speciosa, represented by the prototypical member mitragynine, are an unusual class of opioid receptor modulators with distinct pharmacological properties. Here we describe the first receptor-level functional characterization of mitragynine and related natural alkaloids at the human mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors. These results show that mitragynine and the oxidized analogue 7-hydroxymitragynine, are partial agonists of the human mu-opioid receptor and competitive antagonists at the kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. We also show that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are G-protein-biased agonists of the mu-opioid receptor, which do not recruit \u03b2-arrestin following receptor activation. Therefore, the Mitragyna alkaloid scaffold represents a novel framework for the development of functionally biased opioid modulators, which may exhibit improved therapeutic profiles. Also presented is an enantioselective total synthesis of both (-)-mitragynine and its unnatural enantiomer, (+)-mitragynine, employing a proline-catalyzed Mannich-Michael reaction sequence as the key transformation. Pharmacological evaluation of (+)-mitragynine revealed its much weaker opioid activity. Likewise, the intermediates and chemical transformations developed in the total synthesis allowed the elucidation of previously unexplored structure-activity relationships (SAR) within the Mitragyna scaffold.

In an ex vivo whole-brain preparation, fluorescent reporters of vesicular cargo and of vesicular pH reveal that amphetamine redistributes vesicle contents and diminishes the vesicle pH-gradient responsible for dopamine uptake and retention. This amphetamine-induced deacidification requires VMAT function and results from net H(+) antiport by VMAT out of the vesicle lumen coupled to inward amphetamine transport.

Because annular lipids can be retained during solubilization, we performed MD simulations of LeuT proteomicelles at various stages of the solubilization process. We find that at low DDM concentrations, lipids are retained around the protein and penetration of detergent into the S2 site does not occur, whereas at high concentrations, lipids are displaced and the probability of DDM binding in the S2 site is increased.

The findings were supported by simulations predicting disruption of an intracellular interaction network leading to a discrete rotation of transmembrane segment 5 and the adjacent intracellular loop 2. The magnitude of the spectroscopic response correlated inversely with the transport rate for different substrates, suggesting that stability of the intermediate represents an unrecognized rate-limiting barrier in the NSS transport mechanism.", "Keywords": ["amino acid transport", "conformational change", "dopamine transporter", "fluorescence quenching", "fluorescence spectroscopy", "gating", "mechanisms of membrane transport", "membrane protein", "monoamine transporter", "neurotransmitter transport"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Bacterial Proteins", "Biological Transport", "Catalytic Domain", "Cloning, Molecular", "Escherichia coli", "Gene Expression", "Liposomes", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Norepinephrine", "Plasma Membrane Neurotransmitter Transport Proteins", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Recombinant Proteins", "Rhodamines", "Sodium", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian B", "Last Name": "Billesb\u00f8lle", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Mie B", "Last Name": "Kr\u00fcger", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics and The HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, New York 10065."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular Recognition and Departments of Psychiatry and Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Zheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics and."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Stolzenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics and."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Kniazeff", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Kamil", "Last Name": "Gotfryd", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Jonas S", "Last Name": "Mortensen", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular Recognition and Departments of Psychiatry and Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032 Pharmacology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, and."}, {"First Name": "Harel", "Last Name": "Weinstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics and The HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, New York 10065."}, {"First Name": "Claus J", "Last Name": "Loland", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Ulrik", "Last Name": "Gether", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, gether@sund.ku.dk."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2015Oct30"}, {"PMID": "26331887", "Title": "Using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) to Characterize Agonist-Induced Arrestin Recruitment to Modified and Unmodified G Protein-Coupled Receptors.", "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent \u223c25% of current drug targets.

Previous studies suggested that Na(+)-binding reconfigures dynamically coupled structural elements in an allosteric interaction network (AIN) responsible for function-related conformational changes, but the intramolecular pathway of this mechanism has remained uncharted. We describe a new approach for the modeling and analysis of intramolecular dynamics in the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT. From microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations and cognate experimental verifications in both LeuT and human dopamine transporter (hDAT), we apply the novel method to identify the composition and the dynamic properties of their conserved AIN. In LeuT, two different perturbations disrupting Na(+) binding and transport (i.e. replacing Na(+) with Li(+) or the Y268A mutation at the intracellular gate) affect the AIN in strikingly similar ways. In contrast, other mutations that affect the intracellular gate (i.e. R5A and D369A) do not significantly impair Na(+) cooperativity and transport. Our analysis shows these perturbations to have much lesser effects on the AIN, underscoring the sensitivity of this novel method to the mechanistic nature of the perturbation. Notably, this set of observations holds as well for hDAT, where the aligned Y335A, R60A, and D436A mutations also produce different impacts on Na(+) dependence. Thus, the detailed AIN generated from our method is shown to connect Na(+) binding with global conformational changes that are critical for the transport mechanism.

To assess for potential molecular interactions between D1R and D2R we also employed a recently developed proximity-ligation assay (PLA). Limited coexpression and colocalization of the D1R and D2R proteins was found in clusters of neurons endemic to the \"patch\" compartment as identified by costaining with tyrosine hydroxylase, but not outside these clusters. Moreover, in contrast to our recent findings where we failed to detect a D1R-D2R PLA signal in the adult striatum, in PD0 striatum we did identify a clear PLA signal for this pair of receptors.

Within the brains of drug abusers, macrophages are exposed to increased levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates the addictive and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine and methamphetamine. In this study we examined the effects of dopamine on HIV entry into primary human macrophages. Exposure to dopamine during infection increased the entry of R5 tropic HIV into macrophages, irrespective of the concentration of the viral inoculum. The entry pathway affected was CCR5 dependent, as antagonizing CCR5 with the small molecule inhibitor TAK779 completely blocked entry. The effect was dose-dependent and had a steep threshold, only occurring above 108 M dopamine. The dopamine-mediated increase in entry required dopamine receptor activation, as it was abrogated by the pan-dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol, and could be mediated through both subtypes of dopamine receptors. These findings indicate that the effects of dopamine on macrophages may have a significant impact on HIV pathogenesis.

Active agonist compounds from the primary screen were examined for orthogonal D2 dopamine receptor signaling activities including cAMP modulation and \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Although the majority of the subsequently confirmed hits activated all signaling pathways tested, several compounds showed a diminished ability to stimulate \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. One such compound (MLS1547; 5-chloro-7-[(4-pyridin-2-ylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]quinolin-8-ol) is a highly efficacious agonist at D2 receptor-mediated G protein-linked signaling, but does not recruit \u03b2-arrestin as demonstrated using two different assays. This compound does, however, antagonize dopamine-stimulated \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the D2 receptor. In an effort to investigate the chemical scaffold of MLS1547 further, we characterized a set of 24 analogs of MLS1547 with respect to their ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation or stimulate \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. A number of the analogs were similar to MLS1547 in that they displayed agonist activity for inhibiting cAMP accumulation, but did not stimulate \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (i.e., they were highly biased). In contrast, other analogs displayed various degrees of G protein signaling bias. These results provided the basis to use pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking analyses to build a preliminary structure-activity relationship of the functionally selective properties of this series of compounds.

DAT is the primary target for psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. We previously demonstrated that cocaine binding and dopamine transport alter the accessibility of Cys342 in the third intracellular loop (IL3). To study the conformational changes associated with the functional mechanism of the transporter, we made cysteine substitution mutants, one at a time, from Phe332 to Ser351 in IL3 of the background DAT construct, X7C, in which 7 endogenous cysteines were mutated. The accessibility of the 20 engineered cysteines to polar charged sulfhydryl reagents was studied in the absence and presence of cocaine or dopamine. Of the 11 positions that reacted with methanethiosulfonate ethyl ammonium, as evidenced by inhibition of ligand binding, 5 were protected against this inhibition by cocaine and dopamine (S333C, S334C, N336C, M342C and T349C), indicating that reagent accessibility is affected by conformational changes associated with inhibitor and substrate binding. In some of the cysteine mutants, transport activity is disrupted, but can be rescued by the presence of zinc, most likely because the distribution between inward- and outward-facing conformations is restored by zinc binding. The experimental data were interpreted in the context of molecular models of DAT in both the inward- and outward-facing conformations. Differences in the solvent accessible surface area for individual IL3 residues calculated for these states correlate well with the experimental accessibility data, and suggest that protection by ligand binding results from the stabilization of the outward-facing configuration. Changes in the residue interaction networks observed from the molecular dynamics simulations also revealed the critical roles of several positions during the conformational transitions. We conclude that the IL3 region of DAT undergoes significant conformational changes in transitions necessary for both cocaine binding and substrate transport.", "Keywords": ["Cocaine binding", "Cysteine accessibility", "Dopamine transport", "Dopamine transporter (DAT)", "Molecular dynamics simulations"], "MeSH terms": ["Cloning, Molecular", "Cocaine", "Cysteine", "Dopamine", "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Transport", "Sulfhydryl Reagents", "Tropanes", "Tyramine", "Zinc"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yvette", "Last Name": "Dehnes", "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular Recognition, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 W. 168th, New York, NY 10032, USA; Center for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience, Department of Anatomy, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, PO Box 1105 Blindern, N 0317 Oslo, Norway.

KOR agonists exhibit analgesic effects, although the adverse effects produced by some KOR agonists, including sedation, dysphoria, and hallucinations, have limited their clinical use. Interestingly, KOR-mediated dysphoria, assessed in rodents as aversion, has recently been attributed to the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway following arrestin recruitment to the activated KOR. Therefore, KOR-selective G protein-biased agonists, which do not recruit arrestin, have been proposed to be more effective analgesics, without the adverse effects triggered by the arrestin pathway. As an initial step toward identifying novel biased KOR agonists, we applied a multifaceted screening strategy utilizing both in silico and parallel screening approaches. We identified several KOR-selective ligand scaffolds with a range of signaling bias in vitro. The arylacetamide-based scaffold includes both G protein- and \u03b2-arrestin-biased ligands, while the endogenous peptides and the diterpene scaffolds are G protein biased.

Medicinal chemistry efforts have led to the discovery of 4-phenylpiperazine derivatives that are >100-fold selective for the dopamine D3 receptor over dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), despite high sequence identity (78% in the transmembrane domain). Based on the recent crystal structure of D3R, we demonstrated that the 4-phenylpiperazine moiety in this class of D3R-selective compounds binds to the conserved orthosteric binding site, whereas the extended aryl amide moiety is oriented toward a divergent secondary binding pocket (SBP). In an effort to further characterize molecular determinants of the selectivity of these compounds, we modeled their binding modes in D3R and D2R by comparative ligand docking and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the aryl amide moiety in the SBP differentially induces conformational changes in transmembrane segment 2 and extracellular loop 1 (EL1), which amplify the divergence of the SBP in D3R and D2R. Receptor chimera and site-directed mutagenesis studies were used to validate these binding modes and to identify a divergent glycine in EL1 as critical to D3R over D2R subtype selectivity. A better understanding of drug-dependent receptor conformations such as these is key to the rational design of compounds targeting a specific receptor among closely related homologs, and may also lead to discovery of novel chemotypes that exploit subtle differences in protein conformations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Binding Sites", "Binding, Competitive", "Glycine", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Ligands", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Piperazines", "Protein Conformation", "Radioligand Assay", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Receptors, Dopamine D3", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mayako", "Last Name": "Michino", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York (M.M., L.S.); Departments of Psychiatry and Pharmacology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York (P.D., L.D., Y.H., J.A.J.); Division of Molecular Therapeutics, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York (P.D., L.D., Y.H., J.A.J.); Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc., New York, New York (T.B.); Medicinal Chemistry Section, Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch, Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health National Institute on Drug Abuse, Baltimore, Maryland (A.B., A.H.N.); and Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France (T.R., E.T.)."}, {"First Name": "Prashant", "Last Name": "Donthamsetti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thijs", "Last Name": "Beuming", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashwini", "Last Name": "Banala", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lihua", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Roux", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Trinquet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amy Hauck", "Last Name": "Newman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}, {"PMID": "23980525", "Title": "The membrane protein LeuT in micellar systems: aggregation dynamics and detergent binding to the S2 site.", "Abstract": "Structural and functional properties of integral membrane proteins are often studied in detergent micellar environments (proteomicelles), but how such proteomicelles form and organize is not well understood. This makes it difficult to evaluate the relationship between the properties of the proteins measured in such a detergent-solubilized form and under native conditions. To obtain mechanistic information about this relationship for the leucine transporter (LeuT), a prokaryotic homologue of the mammalian neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs), we studied the properties of proteomicelles formed by n-dodecyl-\u03b2,D-maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent. Extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of different protein/detergent/water number ratios revealed the formation of a proteomicelle characterized by a constant-sized shell of detergents surrounding LeuT protecting its transmembrane segments from unfavorable hydrophobic/hydrophilic exposure. Regardless of the DDM content in the simulated system, this shell consisted of a constant number of DDM molecules (\u223c120 measured at a 4 \u00c5 cutoff distance from LeuT). In contrast, the overall number of DDMs in the proteomicelle (aggregation number) was found to depend on the detergent concentration, reaching a saturation value of 226\u00b117 DDMs in the highest concentration regime simulated. Remarkably, we found that at high detergent-to-protein ratios we observed two independent ways of DDM penetration into LeuT, both leading to a positioning of the DDM molecule in the second substrate (S2) binding site of LeuT. Consonant with several recent experimental studies demonstrating changes in functional properties of membrane proteins due to detergent, our findings highlight how the environment in which the membrane proteins are examined may affect the outcome and interpretation of their mechanistic features.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Transport Systems", "Bacterial Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Leucine", "Maltose", "Micelles", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Surface-Active Agents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Khelashvili", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University (WCMC) , New York, New York 10065, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael V", "Last Name": "LeVine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harel", "Last Name": "Weinstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2013Sep25"}, {"PMID": "23840933", "Title": "Getting to grips with ammonium.", "Abstract": "A fluorescent sensor that can monitor levels of extracellular ammonium has been made by using a fused green fluorescent protein to detect conformational changes in ammonium transport proteins.", "Keywords": ["Arabidopsis", "GFP", "ammonium", "biosensor", "fluorescent probes", "transport", "transport proteins"], "MeSH terms": ["Ammonium Compounds", "Biosensing Techniques", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Receptors, Cell Surface"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "is in the Department of Psychiatry and the Center for Molecular Recognition , Columbia University , New York , United States , and the Division of Molecular Therapeutics , New York State Psychiatric Institute , New York , United States yw2483@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2013Jul02"}, {"PMID": "23778362", "Title": "Segregation of family A G protein-coupled receptor protomers in the plasma membrane.", "Abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce many important physiological signals and are targets for a large fraction of therapeutic drugs. Members of the largest family of GPCRs (family A) are thought to self-associate as dimers and higher-order oligomers, although the significance of such quaternary structures for signaling or receptor trafficking is known for only a few examples. One outstanding question is the physical stability of family A oligomers in cell membranes. Stable oligomers would be expected to move through cellular compartments and membrane domains as intact groups of protomers. Here, we test this prediction by recruiting subsets of affinity-tagged family A protomers into artificial microdomains on the surface of living cells and asking if untagged protomers move into these domains (are corecruited) at the same time. We find that tagged \u03b2\u2082 adrenergic and \u03bc-opioid protomers are unable to corecruit untagged protomers into microdomains. In contrast, tagged metabotropic glutamate receptor protomers do corecruit untagged protomers into such microdomains, which is consistent with the known covalent mechanism whereby these family C receptors dimerize. These observations suggest that interactions between these family A protomers are too weak to directly influence subcellular location, and that mechanisms that move these receptors between subcellular compartments and domains must operate on individual protomers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CHO Cells", "COS Cells", "Cell Membrane", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Membrane Microdomains", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Transport", "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2", "Receptors, Opioid, mu"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Gavalas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia 30912-2300, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tien-Hung", "Last Name": "Lan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qiuju", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivan R", "Last Name": "Corr\u00eaa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan A", "Last Name": "Javitch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nevin A", "Last Name": "Lambert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular pharmacology", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23641004", "Title": "Chloride binding site of neurotransmitter sodium symporters.", "Abstract": "Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) play a critical role in signaling by reuptake of neurotransmitters.
