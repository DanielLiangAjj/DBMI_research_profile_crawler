The B0 dependence of the 2H spin relaxation rates is represented by a linear relationship between the spectral density function at three discrete frequencies J(0), J(\u03c9D) and J(2\u03c9D). In this study, the linear relation between 2H relaxation rates at B0 fields separated by a factor of two and the interpolation of rates at intermediate frequencies are combined for a more robust approach for spectral density mapping. The general usefulness of the approach is demonstrated on a fractionally deuterated (55%) and alternate 13C-12C labeled sample of E. coli RNase H. Deuterium relaxation rate constants (R1, R1\u03c1, RQ, RAP) were measured for 57 well-resolved 13CH2D moieties in RNase H at 1H frequencies of 475\u00a0MHz, 500\u00a0MHz, 900\u00a0MHz, and 950\u00a0MHz. The spectral density mapping of the 475/950\u00a0MHz data combination was performed independently and jointly to validate the expected relationship between data recorded at B0 fields separated by a factor of two. The final analysis was performed by jointly analyzing 475/950\u00a0MHz rates with 700\u00a0MHz rates interpolated from 500/900\u00a0MHz data to yield six J(\u03c9D) values for each methyl peak.

The dynamic process of chemical exchange strongly affects the sensitivity and resolution of NMR experiments, and increasingly provides a powerful probe of the inter-conversion between chemical and conformational states of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological macromolecules. A simple and often used theoretical description of chemical exchange in NMR spectroscopy is based on an idealized two-state jump model (the random-phase or telegraph signal). However, chemical exchange can also be represented as a barrier-crossing event that can be modeled using chemical reaction rate theory. The time scale of crossing is determined by the barrier height, the temperature, and the dissipation modeled as collisional or frictional damping. This tutorial explores the connection between the NMR theory of chemical exchange line-broadening and strong-collision models for chemical kinetics in statistical mechanics. Theoretical modeling and numerical simulation are used to map the rate of barrier-crossing dynamics of a particle on a potential energy surface to the chemical exchange relaxation rate constant.

Probability distribution functions for overall or internal correlation times have been used previously to model spectral density functions central to spin-relaxation theory. Applications to biological macromolecules rely on transverse relaxation rate constants, and when studying nanosecond timescale motions, sampling at ultralow frequencies is often necessary. Consequently, appropriate distribution functions necessitate spectral density functions that are accurate and convergent as frequencies approach zero. In this work, the inverse Gaussian probability distribution function is derived from general properties of spectral density functions at low and high frequencies for macromolecules in solution, using the principle of maximal entropy. This normalized distribution function is first used to calculate the correlation function, followed by the spectral density function.

Herein, we present a generalized approximation to the chemical exchange, Rex, component of R1\u03c1 for arbitrary kinetic schemes, assuming the presence of a dominant major site population, derived from the negative reciprocal trace of the inverse Bloch-McConnell evolution matrix. This approximation is equivalent to first-order truncation of the characteristic polynomial derived from the Bloch-McConnell evolution matrix. For three- and four-site chemical exchange, the first-order approximations are sufficient to distinguish different kinetic schemes. We also introduce an approach to calculate R1\u03c1 for linear N-site schemes, using the matrix determinant lemma to reduce the corresponding 3N\u00d73N Bloch-McConnell evolution matrix to a 3\u00d73 matrix. The first- and second order-expansions of the determinant of this 3\u00d73 matrix are closely related to previously derived equations for two-site exchange. The second-order approximations for linear N-site schemes can be used to obtain more accurate approximations for non-linear N-site schemes, such as triangular three-site or star four-site topologies. The expressions presented herein provide powerful means for the estimation of Rex contributions for both low (CEST-limit) and high (R1\u03c1-limit) radiofrequency field strengths, provided that the population of one state is dominant.

Exchange of more open or flexible conformational states with more closed or constrained states can influence inhibition, allosteric regulation, substrate recognition, formation of the Michaelis complex, side reactions, and product release. NMR spectroscopy has long been applied to the study of conformational dynamic processes in enzymes because these phenomena can be characterized over multiple time scales with atomic site resolution. Laboratory-frame spin-relaxation measurements, sensitive to reorientational motions on picosecond-nanosecond time scales, and rotating-frame relaxation-dispersion measurements, sensitive to chemical exchange processes on microsecond-millisecond time scales, provide information on both conformational distributions and kinetics. This Account reviews NMR spin relaxation studies of the enzymes ribonuclease HI from mesophilic (Escherichia coli) and thermophilic (Thermus thermophilus) bacteria, E. coli AlkB, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae triosephosphate isomerase to illustrate the contributions of conformational flexibility and dynamics to diverse steps in enzyme mechanism. Spin relaxation measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the bacterial ribonuclease H enzymes show that the handle region, one of three loop regions that interact with substrates, interconverts between two conformations. Comparison of these conformations with the structure of the complex between Homo sapiens ribonuclease H and a DNA:RNA substrate suggests that the more closed state is inhibitory to binding. The large population of the closed conformation in T. thermophilus ribonuclease H contributes to the increased Michaelis constant compared with the E. coli enzyme. NMR spin relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy have characterized a conformational transition in AlkB between an open state, in which the side chains of methionine residues in the active site are disordered, and a closed state, in which these residues are ordered. The open state is highly populated in the AlkB/Zn(II) complex, and the closed state is highly populated in the AlkB/Zn(II)/2OG/substrate complex, in which 2OG is the 2-oxoglutarate cosubstrate and the substrate is a methylated DNA oligonucleotide. The equilibrium is shifted to approximately equal populations of the two conformations in the AlkB/Zn(II)/2OG complex. The conformational shift induced by 2OG ensures that 2OG binds to AlkB/Zn(II) prior to the substrate. In addition, the opening rate of the closed conformation limits premature release of substrate, preventing generation of toxic side products by reaction with water. Closure of active site loop 6 in triosephosphate isomerase is critical for forming the Michaelis complex, but reopening of the loop after the reaction is (partially) rate limiting. NMR spin relaxation and MD simulations of triosephosphate isomerase in complex with glycerol 3-phosphate demonstrate that closure of loop 6 is a highly correlated rigid-body motion. The MD simulations also indicate that motions of Gly173 in the most flexible region of loop 6 contribute to opening of the active site loop for product release. Considered together, these three enzyme systems illustrate the power of NMR spin relaxation investigations in providing global insights into the role of conformational dynamic processes in the mechanisms of enzymes from initial activation to final product release.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Coenzymes", "Enzymes", "Humans", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Protein Binding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Arthur G", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University , 701 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, United States."}], "Journal": "Accounts of chemical research", "PubDate": "2015Feb17"}, {"PMID": "25550198", "Title": "Conformational preferences underlying reduced activity of a thermophilic ribonuclease H.", "Abstract": "The conformational basis for reduced activity of the thermophilic ribonuclease HI enzyme from Thermus thermophilus, compared to its mesophilic homolog from Escherichia coli, is elucidated using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

The Euler-angle representation of the propagator also is useful in iterative reduction of pulse-interrupted-free precession schemes.

Although ShK is rigid on the ps to ns timescale, increased linewidths observed for 11 backbone-amide (15)N resonances identify chemical or conformational exchange contributions to the spin relaxation. Relaxation dispersion profiles indicate that exchange between major and minor conformers occurs on the sub-millisecond timescale.

Recent methodological advances enable the contribution of protein dynamics to enzyme efficiency to be explored more deeply. Here, we utilize enzymological and biophysical studies, including NMR measurements of conformational dynamics, to develop a quantitative mechanistic scheme for the DNA repair enzyme AlkB. Like other iron/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, AlkB employs a two-step mechanism in which oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate generates a highly reactive enzyme-bound oxyferryl intermediate that, in the case of AlkB, slowly hydroxylates an alkylated nucleobase. Our results demonstrate that a microsecond-to-millisecond time scale conformational transition facilitates the proper sequential order of substrate binding to AlkB. Mutations altering the dynamics of this transition allow generation of the oxyferryl intermediate but promote its premature quenching by solvent, which uncouples 2-oxoglutarate turnover from nucleobase oxidation. Therefore, efficient catalysis by AlkB depends upon the dynamics of a specific conformational transition, establishing another paradigm for the control of enzyme function by protein dynamics.", "Keywords": ["AlkB", "Catalytic Efficiency", "DNA Repair", "Enzyme Mechanism", "Fe-2OG Dioxygenase", "Fluorescence Spectroscopy", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)", "Protein Dynamic", "X-ray Crystallography"], "MeSH terms": ["Alkylation", "Biocatalysis", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Circular Dichroism", "DNA Repair", "DNA, Bacterial", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Ketoglutaric Acids", "Kinetics", "Ligands", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Mixed Function Oxygenases", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Protein Conformation", "Substrate Specificity", "Sucrose"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bur\u00e7e", "Last Name": "Ergel", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and."}, {"First Name": "Michelle L", "Last Name": "Gill", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032-3702."}, {"First Name": "Lewis", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and."}, {"First Name": "Bomina", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and."}, {"First Name": "Arthur G", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032-3702 agp6@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Hunt", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027-6601 and jfhunt@biology.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2014Oct24"}, {"PMID": "24656076", "Title": "Chemical exchange in biomacromolecules: past, present, and future.", "Abstract": "The perspective reviews quantitative investigations of chemical exchange phenomena in proteins and other biological macromolecules using NMR spectroscopy, particularly relaxation dispersion methods.

In particular, back-calculated chemical shifts provide a sensitive probe of the populations of residual secondary structure elements and helix capping interactions, while spin-relaxation calculations are sensitive to a combination of dynamic and structural factors. Back calculated chemical shift and spin-relaxation data can be used to evaluate the populations of specific interactions in disordered states and identify regions of the phase space that are inconsistent with experimental measurements. The structural interactions that favor and disfavor helical conformations in the disordered basic region of the GCN4 bZip domain were analyzed in order to assess the implications of the structure and dynamics of the apo form for the DNA binding mechanism.

Herein, molecular dynamics simulations are reported for five homologous RNase H proteins of varying thermostabilities and enzymatic activities from organisms of markedly different preferred growth temperatures. For the E. coli and T. thermophilus proteins, strong agreement is obtained between simulated and experimental values for NMR order parameters and for dynamically averaged chemical shifts, suggesting that these simulations can be a productive platform for predicting the effects of individual amino acid residues on dynamic behavior.

Crystal structures of classical cadherins reveal an adhesive dimer interface featuring reciprocal exchange of N-terminal \u03b2-strands between two protomers. Previous work has identified a putative intermediate (called the \"X-dimer\") in the dimerization pathway of wild-type E-cadherin EC1-EC2 domains, based on crystal structures of mutants not capable of strand swapping and on deceleration of binding kinetics by mutations at the X-dimer interface. In the present work, NMR relaxation dispersion spectroscopy is used to directly observe and characterize intermediate states without the need to disrupt the strand-swapped binding interface by mutagenesis. The results indicate that E-cadherin forms strand-swapped dimers predominantly by a mechanism in which formation of a weak and short-lived X-dimer-like state precedes the conformational changes required for formation of the mature strand-swapped dimeric structure. Disruption of this intermediate state through mutation reduces both association and dissociation rates by factors of ~10(4), while minimally perturbing affinity. The X-dimer interface lowers the energy barrier associated with strand swapping and enables E-cadherins to form strand-swapped dimers at a rate consistent with residence times in adherens junctions.", "Keywords": ["binding mechanism", "domain swapping", "protein-protein interaction"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion", "Dimerization", "Fluorescence", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Edward S.

Choices for many parameters of the simulations, such as buffer volume, water model, or salt concentration, have only minor influences on the resulting order parameters. In contrast, seemingly minor conformational differences in starting structures, such as orientations of sidechain hydroxyl groups, resulting from applying different protonation algorithms to the same structure, have major effects on backbone dynamics. Some, but not all, of these effects are mitigated by increased sampling in simulations. Most discrepancies between simulated and experimental results occur for residues located at the ends of secondary structures and involve large amplitude nanosecond timescale transitions between distinct conformational substates. These transitions result in autocorrelation functions for bond vector reorientation that do not converge when calculated over individual simulation blocks, typically of length similar to the overall rotational diffusion time. A test for convergence before averaging the order parameters from different blocks results in better agreement between order parameters calculated from different sets of simulations and with NMR-derived order parameters.
