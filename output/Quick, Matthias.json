[{"PMID": "38693257", "Title": "Structural and molecular basis of choline uptake into the brain by FLVCR2.", "Abstract": "Choline is an essential nutrient that the human body needs in vast quantities for cell membrane synthesis, epigenetic modification and neurotransmission. The brain has a particularly high demand for choline, but how it enters the brain remains unknown1-3. The major facilitator superfamily transporter FLVCR1 (also known as MFSD7B or SLC49A1) was recently determined to be a choline transporter but is not highly expressed at the blood-brain barrier, whereas the related protein FLVCR2 (also known as MFSD7C or SLC49A2) is expressed in endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier4-7. Previous studies have shown that mutations in human Flvcr2 cause cerebral vascular abnormalities, hydrocephalus and embryonic lethality, but the physiological role of FLVCR2 is unknown4,5. Here we demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that FLVCR2 is a BBB choline transporter and is responsible for the majority of choline uptake into the brain. We also determine the structures of choline-bound FLVCR2 in both inward-facing and outward-facing states using cryo-electron microscopy. These results reveal how the brain obtains choline and provide molecular-level insights into how FLVCR2 binds choline in an aromatic cage and mediates its uptake.

Inhibition of pendrin is a validated approach for attenuating airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma and for treating hypertension.

We applied cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of pendrin from Sus scrofa in the presence of either Cl-, I-, HCO3- or in the apo-state. The structures reveal two anion-binding sites in each protomer, and functional analyses show both sites are involved in anion exchange. The structures also show interactions between the Sulfate Transporter and Anti-Sigma factor antagonist (STAS) and transmembrane domains, and mutational studies suggest a regulatory role. We also determine the structure of pendrin in a complex with niflumic acid (NFA), which uncovers a mechanism of inhibition by competing with anion binding and impeding the structural changes necessary for anion exchange.

In mammals, the concentrative uptake of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) by members of the NAT family is driven by the Na+ gradient, while the uptake of nucleobases in bacteria is powered by the H+ gradient. Here, we report the structure and function of PurTCp, a NAT family member from Colwellia psychrerythraea. The structure of PurTCp was determined to 2.80 \u00c5 resolution by X-ray crystallography. PurTCp forms a homodimer, and each protomer has 14 transmembrane segments folded into a transport domain (core domain) and a scaffold domain (gate domain). A purine base is present in the structure and defines the location of the substrate binding site.

Mutation of a conserved aspartate residue close to the substrate binding site reveals the critical role of this residue in H+-dependent transport of purines.

Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine (PPQ) treatment failure rates have risen to as high as 50% in some areas in this region. For PPQ, resistance is driven primarily by a series of mutant alleles of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT). PPQ resistance was reported in China three decades earlier, but the molecular driver remained unknown. Herein, we identify a PPQ-resistant pfcrt allele (China C) from Yunnan Province, China, whose genotypic lineage is distinct from the PPQ-resistant pfcrt alleles currently observed in Cambodia. Combining gene editing and competitive growth assays, we report that PfCRT China C confers moderate PPQ resistance while re-sensitizing parasites to chloroquine (CQ) and incurring a fitness cost that manifests as a reduced rate of parasite growth. PPQ transport assays using purified PfCRT isoforms, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, highlight differences in drug transport kinetics and in this transporter's central cavity conformation between China C and the current Southeast Asian PPQ-resistant isoforms. We also report a novel computational model that incorporates empirically determined fitness landscapes at varying drug concentrations, combined with antimalarial susceptibility profiles, mutation rates, and drug pharmacokinetics. Our simulations with PPQ-resistant or -sensitive parasite lines predict that a three-day regimen of PPQ combined with CQ can effectively clear infections and prevent the evolution of PfCRT variants.

neurotransmission and has been implicated in epilepsy, pain and addiction1. A unique GPCR that is known to require heterodimerization for function2-6, the GABAB receptor has two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, that are structurally homologous but perform distinct and complementary functions. GABAB1 recognizes orthosteric ligands7,8, while GABAB2 couples with G proteins9-14. Each subunit is characterized by an extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) module, a descending peptide linker, a seven-helix transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail15. Although the VFT heterodimer structure has been resolved16, the structure of the full-length receptor and its transmembrane signalling mechanism remain unknown. Here we present a near full-length structure of the GABAB receptor, captured in an inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique 'intersubunit latch' within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium",

For decades, treatment of malaria has relied on chloroquine (CQ), a safe and affordable 4-aminoquinoline that was highly effective against intra-erythrocytic asexual blood-stage parasites, until resistance arose in Southeast Asia and South America and spread worldwide1. Clinical resistance to the chemically related current first-line combination drug piperaquine (PPQ) has now emerged regionally, reducing its efficacy2. Resistance to CQ and PPQ has been associated with distinct sets of point mutations in the P. falciparum CQ-resistance transporter PfCRT, a 49-kDa member of the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily that traverses the membrane of the acidic digestive vacuole of the parasite3-9. Here we present the structure, at 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, of the PfCRT isoform of CQ-resistant, PPQ-sensitive South American 7G8 parasites, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and antigen-binding fragment technology. Mutations that contribute to CQ and PPQ resistance localize primarily to moderately conserved sites on distinct helices that line a central negatively charged cavity, indicating that this cavity is the principal site of interaction with the positively charged CQ and PPQ. Binding and transport studies reveal that the 7G8 isoform binds both drugs with comparable affinities, and that these drugs are mutually competitive. The 7G8 isoform transports CQ in a membrane\u00a0potential- and pH-dependent manner, consistent with an active efflux mechanism that drives CQ resistance5, but does not transport PPQ. Functional studies on the newly emerging PfCRT F145I and C350R mutations, associated with decreased PPQ susceptibility in Asia and South America, respectively6,9, reveal their ability to mediate PPQ transport in 7G8 variant proteins and to confer resistance in gene-edited parasites. Structural, functional and in silico analyses suggest that distinct mechanistic features mediate the resistance to CQ and PPQ in PfCRT variants.

Insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2-cells express the machinery for DA synthesis and catabolism, as well as all five DA receptors. In these cells, DA functions as a negative regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), which is mediated by DA D2-like receptors including D2 (D2R) and D3 (D3R) receptors. However, the fundamental mechanisms of DA synthesis, storage, release, and signaling in pancreatic \u03b2-cells and their functional relevance in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the roles of the DA precursor L-DOPA in \u03b2-cell DA synthesis and release in conjunction with the signaling mechanisms underlying DA's inhibition of GSIS. Our results show that the uptake of L-DOPA is essential for establishing intracellular DA stores in \u03b2-cells. Glucose stimulation significantly enhances L-DOPA uptake, leading to increased DA release and GSIS reduction in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Furthermore, D2R and D3R act in combination to mediate dopaminergic inhibition of GSIS. Transgenic knockout mice in which \u03b2-cell D2R or D3R expression is eliminated exhibit diminished DA secretion during glucose stimulation, suggesting a new mechanism where D2-like receptors modify DA release to modulate GSIS.

For this reason, a deeper understanding of the pharmacodynamics of ATS is required. The present study seeks to determine amphetamine (AMPH) enantiomers' effects on the homomeric \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17 nAChR). Here we have shown that AMPH enantiomers bind to the \u03b17 nAChR and competitively inhibit acetylcholine responses. Our in silico docking analysis suggests that AMPH binds close to the \u03b27 strand of the B-loop of a chimera comprising of the human \u03b17 nAChR and the acetylcholine binding protein from Lymnaea stagnalis. This may inhibit the required movement of the C-loop for channel opening, due to steric hindrance, providing a structural mechanism for its antagonist effect. Finally, we have shown that, in \u03b17 nAChR full knockout mice, the behavioral response to D-AMPH is attenuated, providing direct evidence for the role of \u03b17 nAChRs on the physiological response to D-AMPH. Importantly, D-AMPH exerts these effects at concentrations predicted to be pharmacologically relevant for chronic methamphetamine users and during binges. In conclusion, our data present new findings that implicate the \u03b17 nAChR on the pharmacodynamics of ATS, which may be important for behavioral responses to these drugs, indicating a potential role for \u03b17 nAChRs in ATS substance-use disorders.", "Keywords": ["Alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor", "Alpha 7 upregulation", "Amphetamine-induced locomotion", "Amphetamine-type stimulant", "In silico docking analysis", "Pharmacological characterization"], "MeSH terms": ["Amphetamine", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "Binding, Competitive", "CA1 Region, Hippocampal", "Cells, Cultured", "Central Nervous System Stimulants", "Cholinergic Antagonists", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Humans", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Lymnaea", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Motor Activity", "Neurons", "Oocytes", "Xenopus laevis", "alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel R", "Last Name": "Garton", "Affiliation": "Columbia College of Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sharmaine G", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Department of Biobehavioral Sciences, Teachers College Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Maldonado-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico, R\u00edo Piedras Campus, San Juan, PR, 00931, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Quick", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Molecular Therapeutics Division, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 A", "Last Name": "Lasalde-Dominicci", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biology and Chemistry, University of Puerto Rico, R\u00edo Piedras Campus, San Juan, PR, 00931, USA; Molecular Sciences Research Center, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, 00927, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 E", "Last Name": "Lizardi-Ortiz", "Affiliation": "Molecular Sciences Research Center, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, 00927, USA; Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA.

In particular, the amino acid transporter LeuT can bind two substrate molecules in low concentrations of n-dodecyl \u03b2-d-maltopyranoside (DDM), whereas high concentrations reduce the molar binding stoichiometry to 1:1. Subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LeuT in DDM proteomicelles revealed that DDM can penetrate to the extracellular vestibule and make stable contacts in the functionally important secondary substrate binding site (S2), suggesting a potential competitive mechanism for the reduction in binding stoichiometry. Because annular lipids can be retained during solubilization, we performed MD simulations of LeuT proteomicelles at various stages of the solubilization process. We find that at low DDM concentrations, lipids are retained around the protein and penetration of detergent into the S2 site does not occur, whereas at high concentrations, lipids are displaced and the probability of DDM binding in the S2 site is increased. This behavior is dependent on the type of detergent, however, as we find in the simulations that the detergent lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol, which is approximately twice the size of DDM and structurally more closely resembles lipids, does not penetrate the protein even at very high concentrations.

When more than one Na(+) is involved, Na(+)-binding data are usually analyzed using the Hill equation with a non-integer exponent n. The results of this analysis are an overall Kd-like constant equal to the concentration of ligand that produces half saturation and n, a measure of cooperativity. This information is usually insufficient to provide the basis for mechanistic models. In the case of transport using two Na(+) ions, an n < 2 indicates that molecules with only one of the two sites occupied are present at low saturation. Here, we propose a new way of analyzing Na(+)-binding data for the case of two Na(+) ions that, by taking into account binding to individual sites, provides far more information than can be obtained by using the Hill equation with a non-integer coefficient: it yields pairs of possible values for the Na(+) affinities of the individual sites that can only vary within narrowly bounded ranges. To illustrate the advantages of the method, we present experimental scintillation proximity assay (SPA) data on binding of Na(+) to the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS). SPA is a method widely used to study the binding of Na(+) to Na(+)-driven transporters. NIS is the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active I(-) transport in the thyroid gland, the first step in the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones, of which iodine is an essential constituent. NIS activity is electrogenic, with a 2:1 Na(+)/I(-) transport stoichiometry.

Here, we expressed recombinant hSMVT in Pichia pastoris and used affinity chromatography to purify the detergent-solubilized protein followed by reconstitution of hSMVT in lipid bilayers. Using a combined approach encompassing radiolabeled LA transport and equilibrium binding studies in conjunction with the stabilized R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers and the R,S-(+/-) racemic mixture of LA or lipoamide, we identified the biologically active form of LA, R-LA, to be the physiological substrate of hSMVT. Interaction of R-LA with hSMVT is strictly dependent on Na(+). Under equilibrium conditions, hSMVT can simultaneously bind ~2 molecules of R-LA in a biphasic binding isotherm with dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.9 and 7.4 \u03bcm. Transport of R-LA in the oocyte and reconstituted system is exclusively dependent on Na(+) and exhibits an affinity of ~3 \u03bcm.

Previous studies suggested that Na(+)-binding reconfigures dynamically coupled structural elements in an allosteric interaction network (AIN) responsible for function-related conformational changes, but the intramolecular pathway of this mechanism has remained uncharted. We describe a new approach for the modeling and analysis of intramolecular dynamics in the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT. From microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations and cognate experimental verifications in both LeuT and human dopamine transporter (hDAT), we apply the novel method to identify the composition and the dynamic properties of their conserved AIN. In LeuT, two different perturbations disrupting Na(+) binding and transport (i.e. replacing Na(+) with Li(+) or the Y268A mutation at the intracellular gate) affect the AIN in strikingly similar ways. In contrast, other mutations that affect the intracellular gate (i.e. R5A and D369A) do not significantly impair Na(+) cooperativity and transport. Our analysis shows these perturbations to have much lesser effects on the AIN, underscoring the sensitivity of this novel method to the mechanistic nature of the perturbation. Notably, this set of observations holds as well for hDAT, where the aligned Y335A, R60A, and D436A mutations also produce different impacts on Na(+) dependence. Thus, the detailed AIN generated from our method is shown to connect Na(+) binding with global conformational changes that are critical for the transport mechanism.

Here, the molecular basis of proline transport in H. pylori by HpPutP was investigated experimentally for the first time. Measuring radiolabeled substrate transport in H. pylori and E. coli heterologously expressing HpputP as well as in proteoliposomes reconstituted with HpPutP, we demonstrate that the observed proline transport in H. pylori is mediated by HpPutP. HpPutP is specific and exhibits a high affinity for L-proline. Notably, L-proline transport is exclusively dependent on Na(+) as coupling ion, i.e., Na(+)/L-proline symport, reminiscent to the properties of PutP of E. coli even though H. pylori lives in a more acidic environment.

Through a process known as enterohepatic recirculation, more than 90% of secreted bile acids are then retrieved from the intestine and returned to the liver for resecretion. In humans, there are two Na(+)-dependent bile acid transporters involved in enterohepatic recirculation, the Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; also known as SLC10A1) expressed in hepatocytes, and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT; also known as SLC10A2) expressed on enterocytes in the terminal ileum. In recent years, ASBT has attracted much interest as a potential drug target for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, because inhibition of ASBT reduces reabsorption of bile acids, thus increasing bile acid synthesis and consequently cholesterol consumption. However, a lack of three-dimensional structures of bile acid transporters hampers our ability to understand the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and transport, and to interpret the wealth of existing functional data. The crystal structure of an ASBT homologue from Neisseria meningitidis (ASBT(NM)) in detergent was reported recently, showing the protein in an inward-open conformation bound to two Na(+) and a taurocholic acid. However, the structural changes that bring bile acid and Na(+) across the membrane are difficult to infer from a single structure. To understand the structural changes associated with the coupled transport of Na(+) and bile acids, here we solved two structures of an ASBT homologue from Yersinia frederiksenii (ASBTYf) in a lipid environment, which reveal that a large rigid-body rotation of a substrate-binding domain gives the conserved 'crossover' region, where two discontinuous helices cross each other, alternating accessibility from either side of the cell membrane.

This makes it difficult to evaluate the relationship between the properties of the proteins measured in such a detergent-solubilized form and under native conditions. To obtain mechanistic information about this relationship for the leucine transporter (LeuT), a prokaryotic homologue of the mammalian neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs), we studied the properties of proteomicelles formed by n-dodecyl-\u03b2,D-maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent. Extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of different protein/detergent/water number ratios revealed the formation of a proteomicelle characterized by a constant-sized shell of detergents surrounding LeuT protecting its transmembrane segments from unfavorable hydrophobic/hydrophilic exposure. Regardless of the DDM content in the simulated system, this shell consisted of a constant number of DDM molecules (\u223c120 measured at a 4 \u00c5 cutoff distance from LeuT). In contrast, the overall number of DDMs in the proteomicelle (aggregation number) was found to depend on the detergent concentration, reaching a saturation value of 226\u00b117 DDMs in the highest concentration regime simulated. Remarkably, we found that at high detergent-to-protein ratios we observed two independent ways of DDM penetration into LeuT, both leading to a positioning of the DDM molecule in the second substrate (S2) binding site of LeuT.
