[{"PMID": "34549600", "Title": "Ginger metabolites and metabolite-inspired synthetic products modulate intracellular calcium and relax airway smooth muscle.", "Abstract": "Asthma affects millions of people worldwide and its prevalence is increasing. It is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway remodeling, and pathologic bronchoconstriction, and it poses a continuous treatment challenge with very few new therapeutics available. Thus, many asthmatics turn to plant-based complementary products, including ginger, for better symptom control, indicating an unmet need for novel therapies. Previously, we demonstrated that 6-shogaol (6S), the primary bioactive component of ginger, relaxes human airway smooth muscle (hASM) likely by inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the \u03b2-adrenergic (cyclic nucleotide PDEs), and muscarinic (phospholipase C, PLC) receptor pathways. However, oral 6S is extensively metabolized and it is unknown if the resulting metabolites remain bioactive. Here, we screened all the known human metabolites of 6S and several metabolite-based synthetic derivatives to better understand their mechanism of action and structure-function relationships. We demonstrate that several metabolites and metabolite-based synthetic derivatives are able to prevent Gq-coupled stimulation of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) synthesis by inhibiting PLC, similar to the parent compound 6S. We also show that these compounds prevent recontraction of ASM after \u03b2-agonist relaxation likely by inhibiting PDEs. Furthermore, they potentiate isoproterenol-induced relaxation. Importantly, moving beyond cell-based assays, metabolites also retain the functional ability to relax Gq-coupled-contractions in upper (human) and lower (murine) airways. The current study indicates that, although oral ginger may be metabolized rapidly, it retains physiological activity through its metabolites. Moreover, we are able to use naturally occurring metabolites as inspiration to develop novel therapeutics for brochoconstrictive diseases.", "Keywords": ["6-Shogaol metabolites", "airway smooth muscle relaxation", "inositol trisphosphate", "intracellular calcium", "phospholipase C"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asthma", "Bronchoconstriction", "Calcium", "Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4", "Zingiber officinale", "Humans", "Isoproterenol", "Lung", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Muscle Relaxation", "Muscle, Smooth", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Mice"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elvedin", "Last Name": "Lukovi\u0107", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jose F", "Last Name": "Perez-Zoghbi", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Yingdong", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Foods and Human Health, Center for Excellence in Post-Harvest Technologies, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Shengmin", "Last Name": "Sang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Functional Foods and Human Health, Center for Excellence in Post-Harvest Technologies, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, North Carolina Research Campus, Kannapolis, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Emala", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of physiology.

Because COVID-19 is extremely transmissible and can progress to a severe form of respiratory failure, the potential to overwhelm available critical care resources is high and critical care management of COVID-19 patients has been thrust into the spotlight. COVID-19 arrived in the United States in January and, as anticipated, has dramatically increased the usage of critical care resources. Three of the hardest-hit cities have been Seattle, New York City, and Chicago with a combined total of over 14,000 cases as of March 23, 2020.In this special article, we describe initial clinical impressions of critical care of COVID-19 in these areas, with attention to clinical presentation, laboratory values, organ system effects, treatment strategies, and resource management. We highlight clinical observations that align with or differ from already published reports. These impressions represent only the early empiric experience of the authors and are not intended to serve as recommendations or guidelines for practice, but rather as a starting point for intensivists preparing to address COVID-19 when it arrives in their community.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["COVID-19", "COVID-19 Testing", "Chicago", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Coronavirus Infections", "Critical Care", "Health Resources", "Humans", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional", "Laboratories", "New York City", "Pandemics", "Personnel, Hospital", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Reference Values", "Washington"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Phillip", "Last Name": "Sommer", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Anesthesiology, New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elvedin", "Last Name": "Lukovic", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eliot", "Last Name": "Fagley", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Virginia Mason Hospital and Medical Center, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Dustin R", "Last Name": "Long", "Affiliation": "University of Washington Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, UW Medicine, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Julia B", "Last Name": "Sobol", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Heller", "Affiliation": "University of Washington Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, UW Medicine, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Vivek K", "Last Name": "Moitra", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Pauldine", "Affiliation": "University of Washington Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, UW Medicine, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Michael F", "Last Name": "O'Connor", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Sajid", "Last Name": "Shahul", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Mark E", "Last Name": "Nunnally", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Anesthesiology, New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Avery", "Last Name": "Tung", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois."}], "Journal": "Anesthesia and analgesia", "PubDate": "2020Jul"}, {"PMID": "30925514", "Title": "The microbiome: implications for perioperative and critical care.", "Abstract": "The host-microbiota relationship is integral in human health and can be rapidly disrupted in ways that may contribute to poor recovery from surgery or acute illness.
