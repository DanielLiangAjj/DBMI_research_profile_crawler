Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is challenging, however, because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, to learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations, and to combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of \u223c300 autism-affected family trios across five studies and discovered several autism risk genes.

ASD risk genes are co-expressed in human midfetal cortex, suggesting that ASD risk genes converge in specific regulatory networks during neurodevelopment. To elucidate such networks, we identify genes targeted by CHD8, a chromodomain helicase strongly associated with ASD, in human midfetal brain, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and embryonic mouse cortex. CHD8 targets are strongly enriched for other ASD risk genes in both human and mouse neurodevelopment, and converge in ASD-associated co-expression networks in human midfetal cortex. CHD8 knockdown in hNSCs results in dysregulation of ASD risk genes directly targeted by CHD8. Integration of CHD8-binding data into ASD risk models improves detection of risk genes. These results suggest loss of CHD8 contributes to ASD by perturbing an ancient gene regulatory network during human brain development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Mice", "Models, Neurological", "Nervous System", "Neural Stem Cells", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Justin", "Last Name": "Cotney", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA [2] Kavli Institute for Neuroscience, Yale School of Medicine, PO Box 208001, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca A", "Last Name": "Muhle", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA [2] Kavli Institute for Neuroscience, Yale School of Medicine, PO Box 208001, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA [3] Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine, 230S.

We have investigated the organization and development of the exomembrane system that is used for PfEMP1 trafficking.

The tether/Maurer's cleft complex docks onto the RBC membrane at ~20 h post invasion via a process that is not affected by cytochalasin D treatment. We have examined the trafficking of a GFP chimera of PfEMP1 expressed in transfected parasites. PfEMP1B-GFP accumulates near the parasite surface, within membranous structures exhibiting a defined ultrastructure, before being transferred to pre-formed mobile Maurer's clefts.
