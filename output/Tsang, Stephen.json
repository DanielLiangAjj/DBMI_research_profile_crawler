RP affects other retinal cells, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). MicroRNAs (miRs) are implicated in RP pathogenesis, and downregulating miR-181a/b has shown therapeutic benefit in RP mouse models by improving mitochondrial function. This study investigates the expression profile of miR-181a/b in RPE cells and the neural retina during RP disease progression.

A retrospective chart review was conducted on ten patients demonstrating one or two of the top ten most prevalent CRB1 mutations and receiving care at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. Patient phenotypes were consistent with previously published data for individual CRB1 mutations. To identify the optimal gene editing strategy for these ten mutations, base and prime editing designs were evaluated. For base editing, we adopted the use of a near-PAMless Cas9 (SpRY Cas9), whereas for prime editing, we evaluated the canonical NGG and NGA prime editors. We demonstrate that for the correction of c.2843G>A, p.(Cys948Tyr), the most prevalent CRB1 mutation, base editing has the potential to generate harmful bystanders.

The damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) triggered by oxidative stress plays a central role in the onset and progression of AMD and results from the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced mainly by mitochondria. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) is a mitochondrial molecular chaperone that contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity by decreasing the production and accumulation of ROS. The present study aimed to evaluate the presence and the role of TRAP1 in the RPE. Here, we report that TRAP1 is expressed in human adult retinal pigment epithelial cells and is located mainly in the mitochondria. Exposure of RPE cells to hydrogen peroxide decreases the levels of TRAP1. Furthermore, TRAP1 silencing increases intracellular ROS production and decreases mitochondrial respiratory capacity without affecting cell proliferation. Together, these findings offer novel insights into TRAP1 functions in RPE cells, opening possibilities to develop new treatment options for AMD.", "Keywords": ["age-related macular degeneration

There are more than 300 disease entities, and together this group of disorders affects millions of people globally and is a frequent cause of blindness or low-vision certification. However, each type is rare or ultra-rare. Characteristically, the impaired vision in IRDs is due to retinal photoreceptor dysfunction and loss resulting from mutation in a gene that codes for a retinal protein. Historically, IRDs have been considered incurable and individuals living with these blinding conditions could be offered only supportive care. However, the treatment landscape for IRDs is beginning to evolve. Progress is being made, driven by improvements in understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships, through advances in molecular genetic testing and retinal imaging. Alongside this expanding knowledge of IRDs, the current era of precision medicine is fueling a growth in targeted therapies. This has resulted in the first treatment for an IRD being approved. Several other therapies are currently in development in the IRD space, including RNA-based therapies, gene-based therapies (such as augmentation therapy and gene editing), cell therapy, visual prosthetics, and optogenetics. RNA-based therapies are a novel approach within precision medicine that have demonstrated success, particularly in rare diseases. Three antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) are currently in development for the treatment of specific IRD subtypes. These RNA-based therapies bring several key advantages in the setting of IRDs, and the potential to bring meaningful vision benefit to individuals living with inherited blinding disorders. This review will examine the increasing breadth and relevance of RNA-based therapies in clinical medicine, explore the key features that make AONs suitable for treating genetic eye diseases, and provide an overview of the three-leading investigational AONs in clinical trials.", "Keywords": ["QR-1123", "RNA therapies", "antisense oligonucleotides", "genetic eye diseases", "inherited retinal diseases", "sepofarsen", "ultevursen"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aniz", "Last Name": "Girach", "Affiliation": "ProQR Therapeutics, Zernikedreef 9, 2333 CK Leiden, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Isabelle", "Last Name": "Audo", "Affiliation": "Centre Hospitalier National d'Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts, Centre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence maladies rares REFERET and INSERM-DHOS CIC 1423, CHNO des Quinze-Vingts, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "David G", "Last Name": "Birch", "Affiliation": "Retina Foundation of the Southwest, Dallas, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel M", "Last Name": "Huckfeldt", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Byron L", "Last Name": "Lam", "Affiliation": "Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bart P", "Last Name": "Leroy", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology & Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital & Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Michel", "Last Name": "Michaelides", "Affiliation": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London and Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Stephen R", "Last Name": "Russell", "Affiliation": "The University of Iowa Institute for Vision Research, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juliana M F", "Last Name": "Sallum", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Katarina", "Last Name": "Stingl", "Affiliation": "Center for Ophthalmology, University Eye Hospital, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA."}], "Journal": "Therapeutic advances in ophthalmology", "PubDate": "2022Jan-Dec"}, {"PMID": "36264634", "Title": "A pathogenic in-frame deletion-insertion variant in BEST1 phenocopies Stargardt disease.", "Abstract": "Here, we describe affected members of a 2-generation family with a Stargardt disease-like phenotype caused by a 2-base pair deletion insertion, c.1014_1015delGAinsCT;p.(Trp338_Asn339delinsCysTyr), in BEST1.

The resulting ABCA4/Stargardt disease is the most prevalent Mendelian eye disorder, although its underlying clinical heterogeneity, including penetrance of many alleles, are not well-understood. We hypothesized that a share of this complexity is explained by trans-modifiers, i.e., variants in unlinked loci, which are currently unknown. We sought to identify these by performing exome sequencing in a large cohort for a rare disease of 622 cases and compared variation in seven genes known to clinically phenocopy ABCA4 disease to cohorts of ethnically matched controls. We identified a significant enrichment of variants in 2 out of the 7 genes. Moderately rare, likely functional, variants, at the minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.005 and CADD>25, were enriched in ROM1, where 1.3% of 622 patients harbored a ROM1 variant compared to 0.3% of 10,865 controls (p = 2.41E04; OR 3.81 95% CI [1.77; 8.22]). More importantly, analysis of common variants (MAF>0.1) identified a frequent haplotype in PRPH2, tagged by the p.Asp338 variant with MAF = 0.21 in the matched general population that was significantly increased in the patient cohort, MAF 0.25, p = 0.0014. Significant differences were also observed between ABCA4 disease subgroups. In the late-onset subgroup, defined by the hypomorphic p.Asn1868Ile variant and including c.4253+43G>A, the allele frequency for the PRPH2 p.Asp338 variant was 0.15 vs 0.27 in the remaining cohort, p = 0.00057. Known functional data allowed suggesting a mechanism by which the PRPH2 haplotype influences the ABCA4 disease penetrance. These associations were replicated in an independent cohort of 408 patients. The association was highly statistically significant in the combined cohorts of 1,030 cases, p = 4.00E-05 for all patients and p = 0.00014 for the hypomorph subgroup, suggesting a substantial trans-modifying role in ABCA4 disease for both rare and common variants in two unlinked loci.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Eye Proteins", "Gene Frequency", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Stargardt Disease", "Tetraspanins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jana", "Last Name": "Zernant", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kerry", "Last Name": "Goetz", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ehsan", "Last Name": "Ullah", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Nagasaki", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pei-Yin", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gerald A", "Last Name": "Fishman", "Affiliation": "The Pangere Center for Inherited Retinal Diseases, The Chicago Lighthouse, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Santa J", "Last Name": "Tumminia", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Brian P", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert B", "Last Name": "Hufnagel", "Affiliation": "National Eye Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "35332618", "Title": "Comprehensive variant spectrum of the CNGA3 gene in patients affected by achromatopsia.", "Abstract": "Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a congenital cone photoreceptor disorder characterized by impaired color discrimination, low visual acuity, photosensitivity, and nystagmus.

In addition, in a water maze test, the performance of mice treated at 16\u00a0weeks of age or earlier was indistinguishable from wild type. In contrast, no efficacy was apparent in mice treated at 24\u00a0weeks of age, suggesting the photoreceptors had reached a point of no return. Further, remodeling in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal vasculature was not halted at 16 or 24\u00a0weeks of age, although there appeared to be some slowing of blood vessel degradation. These data suggest a novel working model in which restoration of clinically significant visual function requires only modest threshold numbers of resilient photoreceptors, halting of destructive remodeling and sustained constructive remodeling.

We investigated the effects of vitamin A treatment strategy on RP caused by the p.D190N mutation in RHO by exposing Rhodopsin p.D190N (RhoD190N/+) and wild-type (WT) mice to experimental vitamin A-supplemented and standard control diets. The patient's case suggests that the vitamin A treatment strategy should be further studied to determine its effect on RP caused by p.D190N mutation in RHO and other mutations. Our mouse experiments revealed that RhoD190N/+ mice on the vitamin A diet exhibited higher levels of autofluorescence and lipofuscin metabolites compared to WT mice on the same diet and isogenic controls on the standard control diet. Vitamin A supplementation diminished photoreceptor function in RhoD190N/+ mice while preserving cone response in WT mice. Our findings highlight the importance of more investigations into the efficacy of clinical treatments like vitamin A for patients with certain genetic subtypes of disease and of genotyping in the precision care of inherited retinal degenerations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Dietary Supplements", "Mice", "Mutation", "Retinal Degeneration", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Rhodopsin", "Vitamin A"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, and the Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hye Jin", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

Genotype-phenotype correlation studies have been limited in clinical applicability as patient cohorts are typically small and seldom capture the full natural history of individual genotypes. To overcome these limitations, we constructed a genotype-phenotype correlation matrix that provides quantifiable probabilities of long-term disease outcomes associated with specific ABCA4 genotypes from a large, age-restricted patient cohort.MethodsThe study included 112 unrelated patients at least 50 years of age in whom 2 pathogenic variants were identified after sequencing of the ABCA4 locus. Clinical characterization was performed using the results of best corrected visual acuity, retinal imaging, and full-field electroretinogram testing.ResultsFour distinct prognostic groups were defined according to the spatial severity of disease features across the fundus. Recurring genotypes were observed in milder prognoses, including a newly defined class of rare hypomorphic alleles. PVS1 (predicted null) variants were enriched in the most severe prognoses; however, missense variants were present in a larger-than-expected fraction of these patients. Analysis of allele combinations and their respective prognostic severity showed that certain variants, such as p.(Gly1961Glu), and both rare and frequent hypomorphic alleles, were \"clinically dominant\" with respect to patient phenotypes irrespective of the allele in trans.ConclusionThese results provide much-needed structure to the complex genetic and clinical landscape of ABCA4 disease and add a tool to the clinical repertoire to quantitatively assess individual genotype-specific prognoses in patients.FUNDINGNational Eye Institute, NIH, grants R01 EY028203, R01 EY028954, R01 EY029315, P30 19007 (Core Grant for Vision Research); the Foundation Fighting Blindness USA, grant no.

While the exact mechanisms underlying these conditions remain unclear, there has been a growing body of evidence demonstrating the pathological contributions of oxidative stress across different cell types within the eye. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf2), a transcriptional activator of antioxidative genes, and its regulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. The purpose of this review is to understand the protective role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in different retinal tissues and shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying these processes. In the photoreceptors, we highlight that Nrf2 preserves their survival and function by maintaining oxidation homeostasis. In the retinal pigment epithelium, Nrf2 similarly plays a critical role in oxidative stabilization but also maintains mitochondrial motility and autophagy-related lipid metabolic processes. In endothelial cells, Nrf2 seems to promote proper vascularization and revascularization through concurrent activation of antioxidative and angiogenic factors as well as inhibition of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, Nrf2 protects retinal ganglion cells against apoptotic cell death. Importantly, we show that Nrf2-mediated protection of the various retinal tissues corresponds to a preservation of functional vision. Altogether, this review underscores the potential of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway as a powerful tool against retinal degeneration.

As these trials pave the way toward halting the progression of such devastating diseases, we will begin to see the exciting development of newer, cutting-edge strategies including base editing and prime editing, ushering in a new era of precision medicine.", "Keywords": ["AAV", "CRISPR", "base editing", "gene therapy", "precision medicine", "prime editing"], "MeSH terms": ["Gene Editing", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Precision Medicine", "Retinal Degeneration", "Retinitis Pigmentosa"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah R", "Last Name": "Levi", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York 10032, USA; email: srl2183@cumc.columbia.edu, jr4000@cumc.columbia.edu, pl2758@cumc.columbia.edu, sht2@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Ryu", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York 10032, USA; email: srl2183@cumc.columbia.edu, jr4000@cumc.columbia.edu, pl2758@cumc.columbia.edu, sht2@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Pei-Kang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York 10032, USA; email: srl2183@cumc.columbia.edu, jr4000@cumc.columbia.edu, pl2758@cumc.columbia.edu, sht2@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, Department of Ophthalmology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York 10032, USA; email: srl2183@cumc.columbia.edu, jr4000@cumc.columbia.edu, pl2758@cumc.columbia.edu, sht2@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Annual review of vision science", "PubDate": "2021Sep15"}, {"PMID": "34360834", "Title": "Mouse Models of Achromatopsia in Addressing Temporal \"Point of No Return\" in Gene-Therapy.", "Abstract": "Achromatopsia is characterized by amblyopia, photophobia, nystagmus, and color blindness. Previous animal models of achromatopsia have shown promising results using gene augmentation to restore cone function. However, the optimal therapeutic window to elicit recovery remains unknown. Here, we attempted two rounds of gene augmentation to generate recoverable mouse models of achromatopsia including a Cnga3 model with a knock-in stop cassette in intron 5 using Easi-CRISPR (Efficient additions with ssDNA inserts-CRISPR) and targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells. This model demonstrated that only 20% of CNGA3 levels in homozygotes derived from target ES cells remained, as compared to normal CNGA3 levels. Despite the low percentage of remaining protein, the knock-in mouse model continued to generate normal cone phototransduction. Our results showed that a small amount of normal CNGA3 protein is sufficient to form \"functional\" CNG channels and achieve physiological demand for proper cone phototransduction. Thus, it can be concluded that mutating the Cnga3 locus to disrupt the functional tetrameric CNG channels may ultimately require more potent STOP cassettes to generate a reversible achromatopsia mouse model. Our data also possess implications for future CNGA3-associated achromatopsia clinical trials, whereby restoration of only 20% functional CNGA3 protein may be sufficient to form functional CNG channels and thus rescue cone response.", "Keywords": ["CNGA3", "CRISPR", "achromatopsia"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats", "Color Vision Defects", "Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Editing", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Mice", "Mutation", "Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Edward S.

Abnormal intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets and pericellular deposits of lipid-rich material in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) called drusen are clinical hallmarks of different forms of MD including Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (DHRD) and age-related MD (AMD). However, the appropriate molecular therapeutic target underlying these disorder phenotypes remains elusive. Here, we address this knowledge gap by comparing the proteomic profiles of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPEs (iRPE) from individuals with DHRD and their isogenic controls. Our analysis and follow-up studies elucidated the mechanism of lipid accumulation in DHRD iRPE cells. Specifically, we detected significant downregulation of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), an enzyme that converts cholesteryl ester to free cholesterol, an indispensable process in cholesterol export. CES1 knockdown or overexpression of EFEMP1R345W, a variant of EGF-containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 that is associated with DHRD and attenuated cholesterol efflux and led to lipid droplet accumulation. In iRPE cells, we also found that EFEMP1R345W has a hyper-inhibitory effect on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling when compared to EFEMP1WT and may suppress CES1 expression via the downregulation of transcription factor SP1. Taken together, these results highlight the homeostatic role of cholesterol efflux in iRPE cells and identify CES1 as a mediator of cholesterol efflux in MD.", "Keywords": ["age-related macular degeneration, Doyne honeycomb destrophy, DHRD, cholesterol efflux, drusen, RPE, CRISPR, isogenic, EGFR signaling, unfolded protein response, lipid accumulation"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases", "Cell Differentiation", "Cholesterol", "Cytokines", "ErbB Receptors", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Lipid Metabolism", "Macular Degeneration", "Middle Aged", "Optic Disk Drusen", "Proteomics", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Signal Transduction", "Sp1 Transcription Factor", "Transcription, Genetic", "Unfolded Protein Response"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi-Ting", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care and the Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Edward S.

Disease-causing variation encompasses all mutation categories, from large copy number variants to very mild, hypomorphic missense variants. The most prevalent disease-causing ABCA4 variant, present in ~\u200920% of cases of European descent, c.5882G\u2009>\u2009A p.(Gly1961Glu), has been a subject of controversy since its minor allele frequency (MAF) is as high as ~\u20090.1 in certain populations, questioning its pathogenicity, especially in homozygous individuals. We sequenced the entire ~140Kb ABCA4 genomic locus in an extensive cohort of 644 bi-allelic, i.e. genetically confirmed, patients with ABCA4 disease and analyzed all variants in 140 compound heterozygous and 10 homozygous cases for the p.(Gly1961Glu) variant. A total of 23 patients in this cohort additionally harbored the deep intronic c.769-784C\u2009>\u2009T variant on the p.(Gly1961Glu) allele, which appears on a specific haplotype in ~\u200915% of p.(Gly1961Glu) alleles. This haplotype was present in 5/7 of homozygous cases, where the p.(Gly1961Glu) was the only known pathogenic variant. Three cases had an exonic variant on the same allele with the p.(Gly1961Glu).

A deficiency in photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) causes vision loss in inherited retinal diseases and possibly age-related macular degeneration.

Here, we developed a high-throughput screening assay based on RPE derived from human embryonic stem cells (hRPE) to reveal enhancers of POS phagocytosis. One of the hits, ramoplanin (RM), reproducibly enhanced POS phagocytosis and ensheathment in hRPE, and enhanced the expression of proteins known to regulate membrane dynamics and ensheathment in other cell systems. Additionally, RM rescued POS internalization defect in Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) mutant hRPE, derived from retinitis pigmentosa patient induced pluripotent stem cells.

D190N-rhodopsin (D190N-Rho) is a well-known inherited human mutation causing retinitis pigmentosa. Both higher-than-normal spontaneous-isomerization activity and misfolding/mistargeting of the mutant protein have been proposed as causes of the disease, but neither explanation has been thoroughly examined. We replaced wild-type rhodopsin (WT-Rho) in RhoD190N/WT mouse rods with a largely \"functionally silenced\" rhodopsin mutant to isolate electrical responses triggered by D190N-Rho activity, and found that D190N-Rho at the single-molecule level indeed isomerizes more frequently than WT-Rho by over an order of magnitude. Importantly, however, this higher molecular dark activity does not translate into an overall higher cellular dark noise, owing to diminished D190N-Rho content in the rod outer segment. Separately, we found that much of the degeneration and shortened outer-segment length of RhoD190N/WT mouse rods was not averted by ablating rod transducin in phototransduction-also consistent with D190N-Rho's higher isomerization activity not being the primary cause of disease. Instead, the low pigment content, shortened outer-segment length, and a moderate unfolded protein response implicate protein misfolding as the major pathogenic problem.

Preventing the secondary loss of cone photoreceptors would preserve central visual acuity and substantially improve patients' quality of life.

With the advent of gene therapy and the numerous ongoing clinical trials for inherited retinal degenerations, quantifiable and reliable outcome measurements continually need to be identified. In this retrospective analysis, normalized and non-normalized short-wavelength (SW-AF) and near-infrared (NIR-AF) autofluorescence images of ten patients with mutations in visual cycle (VC) genes and nineteen patients with mutations in phototransduction (PT) genes were analyzed. Normalized SW-AF and NIR-AF images appeared darker in all patients with mutations in the VC as compared to patients with mutations in PT despite the use of significantly higher detector settings for image acquisition in the former group. These findings were corroborated by quantitative analysis of non-normalized SW-AF and NIR-AF images; signal intensities were significantly lower in all patients with mutations in VC genes as compared to those with mutations in PT genes. We conclude that qualitative and quantitative SW-AF and NIR-AF images can serve as biomarkers of deficiencies specific to the VC.

Recombinant ATF6 proteins bearing these exon deletions showed markedly impaired transcriptional activity by qPCR and RNA-Seq analysis compared with WT-ATF6.

CRALBP also maintains the 11-cis configuration and protects against unwanted retinaldehyde activity. Studying a sibling pair that is compound heterozygous for mutations in RLBP1/CRALBP, here we expand the phenotype of affected individuals, elucidate a previously unreported phenotype in RLBP1/CRALBP carriers, and demonstrate consistencies between the affected individuals and Rlbp1/Cralbp-/- mice.

Serial measurements of peripheral retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy area with SW-AF, as well as the ellipsoid zone (EZ) width using SD-OCT were performed.Results: Two homozygous variants in KIZ-a c.226C>T mutation as well as a previously unreported c.119_122delAACT mutation-were identified in four unrelated patients. Fundus examination and ERG revealed classic rod-cone dysfunction, and SD-OCT demonstrated outer retinal atrophy with centrally preserved EZ line. SW-AF imaging revealed hyperautofluorescent rings with surrounding parafoveal, mid-peripheral and widespread loss of autofluorescence. The RPE atrophy area increased annually by 4.9%. Mean annual exponential rates of decline for KIZ patients were 8.5% for visual acuity and 15.9% for 30 Hz Flicker amplitude. The average annual reduction distance of the EZ distance was 66.5 \u03bcm per year.Conclusions: RPE atrophy progresses along with a loss of photoreceptors, and parafoveal RPE hypoautofluorescence is commonly seen in KIZ-associated RP patients.

This reports describes the discordant clinical manifestation of a family segregating mutations in ABCA4 and PROM1. Methods: Three patients across a two generation family underwent multimodal imaging and functional testing of the retina including color photography, fundus autofluorescence (AF), spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and full-field electroretinography (ffERG). Genetic characterization was carried out by direct Sanger and whole exome sequencing. Results: Clinical examination revealed similar retinal degenerative phenotypes in the proband and her mother. Despite being younger, the proband's phenotype was more advanced and exhibited additional features related to Stargardt disease not found in the mother. Whole exome sequencing identified a pathogenic missense variant in PROM1, c.400C\u00a0>\u00a0T, p.(Arg134Cys), as the underlying cause of retinal disease in both the proband and mother.

The matrix degradative activity, but not the assembly, of the focal adhesion is regulated by chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4). CLIC4 is co-localized with MMP14 in the late endosome. CLIC4 regulates the proper sorting of MMP14 into the lumen of the late endosome and its proteolytic activation in lipid rafts. CLIC4 has the newly-identified \"late domain\" motif that binds to MMP14 and to Tsg101, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complex. Unlike the late domain mutant CLIC4, wild-type CLIC4 can rescue the late endosomal sorting defect of MMP14. Finally, CLIC4 knockdown inhibits the apical secretion of MMP2 in polarized human RPE monolayers. These results, taken together, demonstrate that CLIC4 is a novel matrix microenvironment modulator and a novel regulator for late endosomal cargo sorting.

Patients may also have foveal schisis. (Goldmann-Favre syndrome consists of foveal schisis plus peripheral degeneration.) Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) shows a decrease or lack of AF outside the arcades, possibly due to loss of photoreceptors in this region; a ring of hyperautofluorescence (hyperAF) is seen in the transition zone between the region of absent AF beyond the arcade and the central zone of spoke-like, relatively increased AF, centered on the fovea; increased AF may be related to lipofuscin accumulation secondary to RPE-photoreceptor dysfunction in that area. Electroretinograms (ERGs) in ESCS are pathognomonic and show extinguished rod response and a similar wave form in both scotopic and photopic conditions. The 30 Hz flicker responses are markedly delayed and are of lower amplitude. (Normally, flicker amplitude lies between that of the photopic a- and b-waves, but in ESCS, it is less than that of the photopic a-wave.)

In this retrospective cohort study of 28 patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), we used OCT-A to quantify changes in perfusion density, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, and choriocapillaris blood flow over time and correlated these variables with ellipsoid zone (EZ) line width and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Perfusion density decreased by 2.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62% per year at the superior capillary plexus (SCP) (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and 2.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.76% per year at the deep capillary plexus (DCP) (P\u2009=\u20090.004). FAZ area increased by 0.078\u2009\u00b1\u20090.021 mm2 per year (P\u2009=\u20090.001) at the SCP and 0.152\u2009\u00b1\u20090.039 mm2 per year (P\u2009=\u20090.001) at the DCP. No changes were observed in the choriocapillaris blood flow. EZ line width had the strongest correlation to perfusion density at the SCP (r\u2009=\u20090.660 and 0.635, first and second visit, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.001), while BCVA most strongly correlated with FAZ area at the SCP (r\u2009=\u20090.679 and 0.548, P\u2009=\u20090.001 and 0.003).

Here, we explored the role of MGCs in the context of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) by using four independent preclinical mouse models. For therapeutic modeling, tamoxifen-inducible CreER was introduced to explore changes in MGCs when RP progression halted. The phenotypes of the MGCs were observed using live optical coherence tomography, live autofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. We found that, regardless of genetic background, MGCs were activated in neurodegenerative conditions and migrated beyond the layers where they are typically found to the inner and outer segments, where degeneration was ongoing. Genetic rescue not only halted degeneration but also deactivated MGCs, regardless of whether the intervention occurred at the early, middle, or late stage of the disease. These findings suggest that halting long-term disease progression may be more successful by downregulating MGC activity while co-administering the therapeutic intervention.", "Keywords": ["Cre recombinase", "Pde6 mutation", "genetic diseases", "microglia cells", "retinitis pigmentosa"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CX3C Chemokine Receptor 1", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Mice", "Microglia", "Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Tamoxifen", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lijuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Shanxi Eye Hospital, affiliated with Shanxi Medical University, 100 Fudong St., Xinghualing, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.

Complete sequencing of the ABCA4 locus in STGD1 patients identifies two expected disease-causing alleles in \u223c75% of patients and only one mutation in \u223c15% of patients. Recently, many possibly pathogenic variants in deep intronic sequences of ABCA4 have been identified in the latter group. We extended our analyses of deep intronic ABCA4 variants and determined that one of these, c.4253+43G>A (rs61754045), is present in 29/1155 (2.6%) of STGD1 patients. The variant is found at statistically significantly higher frequency in patients with only one pathogenic ABCA4 allele, 23/160 (14.38%), MAF = 0.072, compared to MAF = 0.013 in all STGD1 cases and MAF = 0.006 in the matching general population (P < 1 \u00d7 10-7). The variant, which is not predicted to have any effect on splicing, is the first reported intronic \"extremely hypomorphic allele\" in the ABCA4 locus; that is, it is pathogenic only when in trans with a loss-of-function ABCA4 allele. It results in a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by late onset of symptoms and foveal sparing. In \u223c70% of cases the variant was allelic with the c.6006-609T>A (rs575968112) variant, which was deemed nonpathogenic. Another rare deep intronic variant, c.5196+1056A>G (rs886044749), found in 5/834 (0.6%) of STGD1 cases is, conversely, a severe allele.

The short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF) of fundus flecks in recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) suggests a connection to these fluorophores. Through multimodal imaging, we sought to elucidate this link. Flecks observed in SW-AF images often colocalized with foci exhibiting reduced or absent near-infrared autofluorescence signal, the source of which is melanin in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. With serial imaging, changes in near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) preceded the onset of fleck hyperautofluorescence in SW-AF images and fleck profiles in NIR-AF images tended to be larger. Flecks in SW-AF and NIR-AF images also corresponded to hyperreflective lesions traversing photoreceptor-attributable bands in horizontal SD-OCT scans. The hyperreflective lesions interrupted adjacent OCT reflectivity bands and were associated with thinning of the outer nuclear layer. These SD-OCT findings are attributable to photoreceptor cell degeneration. Progressive increases and decreases in the SW-AF intensity of flecks were evident in color-coded quantitative fundus autofluorescence maps. In some cases, flecks appeared to spread radially from the fovea to approximately 8\u00b0 of eccentricity, beyond which a circumferential spread characterized the distribution. Since the NIR-AF signal is derived from melanin and loss of this autofluorescence is indicative of RPE atrophy, the SW-AF of flecks cannot be accounted for by bisretinoid lipofuscin in RPE.

To quantify protein levels in the human retina and identify patterns of differentially-expressed proteins, we collected foveomacular, juxta-macular, and peripheral retina punch biopsies from healthy donor eyes and analyzed protein content by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Protein expression was analyzed with 1-way ANOVA, gene ontology, pathway representation, and network analysis. We identified a mean of 1,974 proteins in the foveomacular retina, 1,999 in the juxta-macular retina, and 1,779 in the peripheral retina. Six hundred ninety-seven differentially-expressed proteins included those unique to and abundant in each anatomic region. Proteins with higher expression in each region include: heat-shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90AA1), and pyruvate kinase (PKM) in the foveomacular retina; vimentin (VIM) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C (ALDOC); and guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-1 (GNB1) and guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-1 (GNAT1) in the peripheral retina. Pathway analysis identified downstream mediators of the integrin signaling pathway to be highly represented in the foveomacular region (P = 6.48 e-06). Metabolic pathways were differentially expressed among all retinal regions. Gene ontology analysis showed that proteins related to antioxidant activity were higher in the juxta-macular and the peripheral retina, but present in lower amounts in the foveomacular retina.

Studies involving mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have shown that individuals suffering from retinal diseases exhibit metabolic profiles that markedly differ from those of control individuals, supporting the notion that metabolites may serve as easily identifiable biomarkers for specific conditions. An emerging branch of metabolomics resulting from biomarker studies, however, involves the study of retinal metabolic dysfunction as causes of degeneration. Recent publications have identified a number of metabolic processes-including but not limited to glucose and oxygen metabolism-that, when perturbed, play a role in the degeneration of photoreceptor cells. As a result, such studies have led to further research elucidating methods for prolonging photoreceptor survival in an effort to halt degeneration in its early stages. This review will explore the ways in which metabolomics has deepened our understanding of the causes of retinal degeneration and discuss how metabolomics can be used to prevent retinal degeneration from progressing to its later disease stages.", "Keywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Biomarkers", "Metabolomics", "Photoreceptors", "Retinal degeneration", "Retinitis pigmentosa"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Glucose", "Humans", "Metabolome", "Metabolomics", "Oxygen", "Retinal Degeneration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Karen Sophia", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care and Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine L", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care and Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Cui", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care and Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care and Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. sht2@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS", "PubDate": "2018May"}, {"PMID": "29263305", "Title": "Therapeutic drug repositioning using personalized proteomics of liquid biopsies.", "Abstract": "In patients with limited response to conventional therapeutics, repositioning of already approved drugs can bring new, more effective options.

Our results revealed that the disease-causing mechanism of BEST1 mutations is centered on the indispensable role of BESTROPHIN1 in mediating the long speculated Ca2+-dependent Cl- current in RPE, and demonstrate that the pathological potential of BEST1 mutations can be evaluated and predicted with our iPSC-based 'disease-in-a-dish' approach. Moreover, we demonstrated that patient RPE is rescuable with viral gene supplementation, providing a proof-of-concept for curing BEST1-associated diseases.", "Keywords": ["BEST1", "BESTROPHIN1", "biophysics", "calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC)", "human", "patient-specific iPSC-RPE", "retinal diseases", "retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)", "structural biology"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Bestrophins", "Calcium", "Cells, Cultured", "Child", "Chlorides", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Humans", "Ions", "Male", "Models, Molecular", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation, Missense", "Protein Conformation", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Jonas Children's Vision Care, and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology and Pathology & Cell Biology, Edward S.

Mutations in Usherin 2A (USH2A) are not only a frequent cause of Usher syndrome, but also nonsyndromic RP. Although gene- and cell-based therapies are on the horizon for RP and Usher syndrome, studies characterizing natural disease are lacking. In this retrospective analysis, retinal function of USH2A patients was quantified with electroretinography. Both groups had markedly reduced rod and cone responses, but nonsyndromic USH2A patients had 30\u2009Hz-flicker electroretinogram amplitudes that were significantly higher than syndromic patients, suggesting superior residual cone function. There was a tendency for Usher syndrome patients to have a higher distribution of severe mutations, and alleles in this group had a higher odds of containing nonsense or frame-shift mutations. These data suggest that the previously reported severe visual phenotype seen in syndromic USH2A patients could relate to a greater extent of cone dysfunction. Additionally, a genetic threshold may exist where mutation burden relates to visual phenotype and the presence of hearing deficits.

In this study, we created two RP mouse models to test whether dying, untreated rods negatively impact treated, rescued rods. In one model, treated and untreated rods were segregated. In the second model, treated and untreated rods were diffusely intermixed, and their ratio was controlled to achieve low-, medium-, or high-efficiency rescue. Analysis of these mosaic retinas demonstrated that rescued rods (and cones) survive, even when they are greatly outnumbered by dying photoreceptors. On the other hand, the rescued photoreceptors did exhibit long-term defects in their outer segments (OSs), which were less severe when more photoreceptors were treated.

Basal cGMP level is strictly controlled by the opposing actions of phosphodiesterase (PDE6) and retinal guanylyl cyclases (GCs), and mutations in genes that disrupt cGMP homeostasis leads to retinal degeneration in humans through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study is to examine two distinct cellular targets of cGMP: the cGMP-gated (CNG) channels and protein kinase G (PRKG), and how each may contribute to rod cell death. Using a mouse genetic approach, we found that abolishing expression of CNG channels prolongs rod survival caused by elevated cGMP in a PDE6 mutant mouse model. This observation supports the use of channel blockers to delay rod death, which is expected to prolong useful vision through enhanced cone survival. However, the absence of CNG channel alone also caused abnormal cGMP accumulation. In a mouse model of CNG channel loss-of-function, abolishing PRKG1 expression had a long-lasting effect in promoting rod cell survival. Our data strongly implicate two distinct cGMP-mediated cell death pathways, and suggest that therapeutic designs targeting both pathways will be more effective at slowing photoreceptor cell death

While human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have provided the precedent for regenerative medicine, the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) revolutionized this field. iPSCs allow for the development of many types of retinal cells, including those of the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, and ganglion cells, and can model polygenic diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. Cellular programming and reprogramming technology is especially useful in retinal diseases, as it allows for the study of living cells that have genetic variants that are specific to patients' diseases. Since iPSCs are a self-renewing resource, scientists can experiment with an unlimited number of pluripotent cells to perfect the process of targeted differentiation, transplantation, and more, for personalized medicine.

We recently identified activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) as a genetic cause of achromatopsia. ATF6 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response. In response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ATF6 migrates from the ER to Golgi to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis to release a cytosolic domain containing a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcriptional activator. The cleaved ATF6 fragment migrates to the nucleus to transcriptionally up-regulate protein-folding enzymes and chaperones. ATF6 mutations in patients with achromatopsia include missense, nonsense, splice site, and single-nucleotide deletion or duplication changes found across the entire gene. Here, we comprehensively tested the function of achromatopsia-associated ATF6 mutations and found that they group into three distinct molecular pathomechanisms: class 1 ATF6 mutants show impaired ER-to-Golgi trafficking and diminished regulated intramembrane proteolysis and transcriptional activity; class 2 ATF6 mutants bear the entire ATF6 cytosolic domain with fully intact transcriptional activity and constitutive induction of downstream target genes, even in the absence of ER stress; and class 3 ATF6 mutants have complete loss of transcriptional activity because of absent or defective bZIP domains. Primary fibroblasts from patients with class 1 or class 3 ATF6 mutations show increased cell death in response to ER stress. Our findings reveal that human ATF6 mutations interrupt distinct sequential steps of the ATF6 activation mechanism.

For reasons that remain unclear, diseased RP photoreceptors begin to deteriorate, eventually leading to cell death and, consequently, loss of vision. Here, we have hypothesized that RP associated with mutations in phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) provokes a metabolic aberration in rod cells that promotes the pathological consequences of elevated cGMP and Ca2+, which are induced by the Pde6 mutation. Inhibition of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a histone deacetylase repressor of glycolytic flux, reprogrammed rods into perpetual glycolysis, thereby driving the accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates, improving outer segment (OS) length, enhancing photoreceptor survival, and preserving vision. In mouse retinae lacking Sirt6, effectors of glycolytic flux were dramatically increased, leading to upregulation of key intermediates in glycolysis, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis. Both transgenic and AAV2/8 gene therapy-mediated ablation of Sirt6 in rods provided electrophysiological and anatomic rescue of both rod and cone photoreceptors in a preclinical model of RP. Due to the extensive network of downstream effectors of Sirt6, this study motivates further research into the role that these pathways play in retinal degeneration.

Currently, there is no approved therapeutic for photoreceptor degenerative conditions like RP and atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there are promising results in human gene therapy, RP is a genetically diverse disorder, such that gene-specific therapies would be practical in a small fraction of patients with RP. Here, we explore a non-gene-specific strategy that entails reprogramming photoreceptors towards anabolism by upregulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. We conditionally ablated the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) gene, an mTOR inhibitor, in the rods of the Pde6bH620Q/H620Q preclinical RP mouse model and observed, functionally and morphologically, an improvement in the survival of rods and cones at early and late disease stages. These results elucidate the ability of reprogramming the metabolome to slow photoreceptor degeneration. This strategy may also be applicable to a wider range of neurodegenerative diseases, as enhancement of nutrient uptake is not gene-specific and is implicated in multiple pathologies.

Since TSC effectors are largely unknown in the human brain, TSC patient cortical tubers were used to uncover hyperphosphorylation unique to TSC primary astrocytes, the cell type affected in the brain. We found abnormal hyperphosphorylation of catenin delta-1 S268, which was reversible by mTOR-specific inhibitors. In contrast, in three metastatic astrocytoma cell lines, S268 was under phosphorylated, suggesting S268 phosphorylation controls metastasis. TSC astrocytes appeared epithelial (i.e. tightly adherent, less motile, and epithelial (E)-cadherin positive), whereas wild-type astrocytes were mesenchymal (i.e. E-cadherin negative and highly motile). Despite their epithelial phenotype, TSC astrocytes outgrew contact inhibition, and monolayers sporadically generated tuberous foci, a phenotype blocked by the mTOR inhibitor, Torin1. Also, mTOR-regulated phosphokinase C epsilon (PKCe) activity induced phosphorylation of catenin delta-1 S268, which in turn mediated cell-cell adhesion in astrocytes. The mTOR-dependent, epithelial phenotype of TSC astrocytes suggests TSC1/2 and mTOR tune the phosphorylation level of catenin delta-1 by controlling PKCe activity, thereby regulating the mesenchymal-epithelial-transition (MET). Thus, some forms of TSC could be treated with PKCe inhibitors, while metastasis of astrocytomas might be blocked by PKCe stimulators.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Astrocytes", "Catenins", "Cell

"Title": "Small-angle X-ray scattering of calpain-5 reveals a highly open conformation among calpains.", "Abstract": "Calpain-5 is a calcium-activated protease expressed in the retina. Mutations in calpain-5 cause autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV, OMIM#193235). The structure of calpain-5 has not been determined, thus hindering the investigation of its proteolytic targets and pathological role in ADNIV. Herein, we report models of the proteolytic core of calpain-5 (mini-calpain-5) containing two globular domains (termed DIIa-IIb) connected by a short, flexible linker, consistent with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. Structural modeling in the absence of calcium suggests that mini-calpain-5 adopts a more open conformation when compared to previously determined structures of other calpain cores. This open conformation, achieved by a rotation of DIIa and DIIb with respect to each other, prevents formation of the active site and constrains the enzyme in an inactivated form. The relative domain rotation of 60-100\u00b0 we found for mini-calpain-5 (a non-classical calpain) is significantly greater than the largest rotation previously observed for a classical calpain (i.e., 55.0\u00b0 for mini-calpain-9). Together with our prediction that, in the full-length form, a long loop in DIIb (loop C1), a few residues downstream of the inter-domain linker, likely interacts with the shorter, acidic, inactivating loop on domain-III (DIII), these structural insights illuminate the complexity of calpain regulation. Moreover, our studies argue that pursuing higher resolution structural studies are necessary to understand the complex activity regulation prevalent in the calpain family and for the design of specific calpain inhibitors.", "Keywords": ["ADNIV", "CAPN5", "Protease", "SAXS", "Uveitis"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Calcium", "Calpain", "Catalytic Domain", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Retina", "Scattering, Small Angle", "Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative", "X-Rays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lokesh", "Last Name": "Gakhar", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA; Protein Crystallography Facility, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander G", "Last Name": "Bassuk", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA; Omics Lab, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Velez", "Affiliation": "Omics Lab, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA; Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saif", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Protein Crystallography Facility, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Protein Crystallography Facility, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Laboratory of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine and Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Edward S.

The most commonly studied preclinical model of retinitis pigmentosa called the \"rodless\" (rd1) mouse is homozygous for two mutations: a nonsense point mutation (Y347X) and an intronic insertion of a leukemia virus (Xmv-28). Distinguishing which mutation causes retinal degeneration is still under debate nearly a century after the discovery of this model organism. Here, we performed gene editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and demonstrated that the Y347X mutation is the causative variant of disease. Genome editing in the first generation produced animals that were mosaic for the corrected allele but still showed neurofunction preservation despite low repair frequencies. Furthermore, second-generation CRISPR-repaired mice showed an even more robust rescue and amelioration of the disease. This predicts excellent outcomes for gene editing in diseased human tissue, as Pde6b, the mutated gene in rd1 mice, has an orthologous intron-exon relationship comparable with the human PDE6B gene. Not only do these findings resolve the debate surrounding the source of neurodegeneration in the rd1 model, but they also provide the first example of homology-directed recombination-mediated gene correction in the visual system.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats", "Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 6", "DNA Repair", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroretinography", "Exons", "Gene Editing", "Genetic Loci", "Homologous Recombination", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate", "RNA, Guide, CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Retinal Degeneration", "Retinitis Pigmentosa"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wen-Hsuan", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yi-Ting", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sally", "Last Name": "Justus", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ting-Ting", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lijuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chyuan-Sheng", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander G", "Last Name": "Bassuk", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vinit B", "Last Name": "Mahajan", "Affiliation": "Omics Laboratory, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and Bernard and Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Human Nutrition, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy", "PubDate": "2016Aug"}, {"PMID": "27195131", "Title": "Neuroretinal hypoxic signaling in a new preclinical murine model for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.", "Abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects approximately one-third of diabetic patients and, if left untreated, progresses to proliferative DR (PDR) with associated vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, iris neovascularization, glaucoma and irreversible blindness.

HIFs are transcription factors that promote hypoxia adaptation and have important functional roles in a wide range of ischemic and inflammatory diseases. To recreate the human PDR phenotype for a preclinical animal model, we generated a mouse with neuroretinal-specific loss of the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein, a protein that targets HIF1\u03b1 for ubiquitination. We found that the neuroretinal cells in these mice overexpressed HIF1\u03b1 and developed severe, irreversible ischemic retinopathy that has features of human PDR.

By analyzing metabolic flux in mouse retinas, we also found that phototransduction slows metabolic flux through glycolysis and through intermediates of the citric acid cycle.

Due to extensive genetic heterogeneity, observed variant-associated phenotypes can manifest tremendous variability of expression. Furthermore, the high carrier frequency of pathogenic ABCA4 alleles in the general population (~1:20) often results in pseudo-dominant inheritance patterns further complicating the diagnosis and characterization of affected individuals. This study describes a genotype/phenotype analysis of an unusual family with multiple macular disease phenotypes spanning across two generations and segregating four distinct ABCA4 mutant alleles. Complete sequencing of ABCA4 discovered two known missense mutations, p.C54Y and p.G1961E. Array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a large novel deletion combined with a small insertion, c.6148-698_c.6670del/insTGTGCACCTCCCTAG, and complete sequencing of the entire ABCA4 genomic locus uncovered a new deep intronic variant, c.302+68C>T. Patients with the p.G1961E mutation had the mildest, confined maculopathy phenotype with peripheral flecks while those with all other mutant allele combinations exhibited a more advanced stage of generalized retinal and choriocapillaris atrophy. This family epitomizes the clinical and genetic complexity of ABCA4-associated diseases. It contained variants from all classes of mutations, in the coding region, deep intronic, both single nucleotide variants and copy number variants that accounted for varying phenotypes segregating in an apparent dominant fashion.

In this review, we will discuss the current literature pertaining to iPSC modeling of retinal disease, gene therapy of iPSC-derived retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells, and retinal transplantation. We will focus on the use of iPSCs created from patients with inherited eye diseases for testing the efficacy of gene or drug-based therapies, elucidating previously unknown mechanisms and pathways of disease, and as a source of autologous cells for cell replacement.", "Keywords": ["gene therapy", "induced pluripotent stem cells", "retinal disease"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huy V", "Last Name": "Nguyen", "Affiliation": "College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 100 Haven Ave, Apt 14B, New York, NY 10032, USA. hvnguyen10@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Yao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, 635 W 165th St, New York, NY 10032, USA. yl2635@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, 635 W 165th St, New York, NY 10032, USA. sht2@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "PubDate": "2015Mar31"}, {"PMID": "26230768", "Title": "Flecks in Recessive Stargardt Disease: Short-Wavelength Autofluorescence, Near-Infrared Autofluorescence, and Optical Coherence Tomography.", "Abstract": "We evaluated the incongruous observation whereby flecks in recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) can exhibit increased short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF) that originates from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lipofuscin, while near-infrared AF (NIR-AF), emitted primarily from RPE melanin, is usually reduced or absent at fleck positions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Electroretinography", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Stargardt Disease", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Janet R", "Last Name": "Sparrow", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University, New York, New York, United States 2Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marcela", "Last Name": "Marsiglia", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rando", "Last Name": "Allikmets", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University, New York, New York, United States 2Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University, New York, New York, United States 2Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Duncker", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jana", "Last Name": "Zernant", "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "Investigative ophthalmology & visual science", "PubDate": "2015Jul"}, {"PMID": "26164827", "Title": "Multimodal Imaging of Central Retinal Disease Progression in a 2-Year Mean Follow-up of Retinitis Pigmentosa.", "Abstract": "To determine the rate of progression and optimal follow-up time in patients with advanced-stage retinitis pigmentosa (RP) comparing the use of fundus autofluorescence imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Disease Progression", "Electroretinography", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Retina", "Retinal Photoreceptor Cell Outer Segment", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tharikarn", "Last Name": "Sujirakul", "Affiliation": "Bernard & Shirlee Brown Glaucoma Laboratory and Barbara & Donald Jonas Stem Cell Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University, New York, New York;

Here, we link a new CAPN5 mutation to ADNIV and model the three-dimensional structure of the resulting mutant protein. In our study, a kindred with inflammatory vitreoretinopathy was evaluated by clinical eye examinations, DNA sequencing, and protein structural modeling to investigate the disease-causing mutation. Two daughters of an affected mother demonstrated symptoms of stage III ADNIV, with posterior uveitis, cystoid macular edema, intraocular fibrosis, retinal neovascularization, retinal degeneration, and cataract. The women also harbored a novel guanine to thymine (c.750G>T, p.Lys250Asn) missense mutation in exon 6 of CAPN5, a gene that encodes a calcium-activated cysteine protease, calpain-5. Modeling based on the structures of all known calpains revealed the mutation falls within a calcium-sensitive flexible gating loop that controls access to the catalytic groove.

Combined early activation of sonic hedgehog signaling followed by timed NOTCH inhibition in human ESCs/iPSCs resulted in efficient conversion into hypothalamic NKX2.1+ precursors. Application of a NOTCH inhibitor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) further directed the cells into arcuate nucleus hypothalamic-like neurons that express hypothalamic neuron markers proopiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), somatostatin, and dopamine. These hypothalamic-like neurons accounted for over 90% of differentiated cells and exhibited transcriptional profiles defined by a hypothalamic-specific gene expression signature that lacked pituitary markers. Importantly, these cells displayed hypothalamic neuron characteristics, including production and secretion of neuropeptides and increased p-AKT and p-STAT3 in response to insulin and leptin.

S1P is a biologically active lysophospholipid with multiple roles in signalling. The mechanism of action of Spns2 is still elusive in mammals. Here, we report that Spns2-deficient mice rapidly lost auditory sensitivity and endocochlear potential (EP) from 2 to 3 weeks old. We found progressive degeneration of sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti, but the earliest defect was a decline in the EP, suggesting that dysfunction of the lateral wall was the primary lesion. In the lateral wall of adult mutants, we observed structural changes of marginal cell boundaries and of strial capillaries, and reduced expression of several key proteins involved in the generation of the EP (Kcnj10, Kcnq1, Gjb2 and Gjb6), but these changes were likely to be secondary. Permeability of the boundaries of the stria vascularis and of the strial capillaries appeared normal. We also found focal retinal degeneration and anomalies of retinal capillaries together with anterior eye defects in Spns2 mutant mice. Targeted inactivation of Spns2 in red blood cells, platelets, or lymphatic or vascular endothelial cells did not affect hearing, but targeted ablation of Spns2 in the cochlea using a Sox10-Cre allele produced a similar auditory phenotype to the original mutation, suggesting that local Spns2 expression is critical for hearing in mammals.

We conducted a mosaic genetic screen of lethal mutations on the Drosophila X chromosome to identify genes required for the development, function, and maintenance of the nervous system. We identified 165 genes, most of whose function has not been studied in vivo. In parallel, we investigated rare variant alleles in 1,929 human exomes from families with unsolved Mendelian disease.

Overexpression of CTRP5 in na\u00efve human RPE cells phenocopied behavior of MFRP-deficient patient RPE (iPS-RPE) cells. AAV8 (Y733F) vector expressing human MFRP rescued the actin disorganization phenotype and restored apical microvilli in patient-specific iPS-RPE cell lines. As a result, AAV-treated MFRP mutant iPS-RPE recovered pigmentation and transepithelial resistance.

Additionally, the activation of apoptosis by CCAAT/-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), after activation of the unfolded protein response pathway, may be responsible for cell death, although the mechanism remains unknown.

OBJECTIVES To categorize achromatopsia into clinically identifiable stages using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and to describe fundus autofluorescence imaging in this condition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective observational study was performed between 2010 and 2012 at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Participants included 17 patients (aged 10-62 years) with full-field electroretinography-confirmed achromatopsia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography features and staging system, fundus autofluorescence and near-infrared reflectance features and their correlation to optical coherence tomography, and genetic mutations served as the outcomes and measures. RESULTS Achromatopsia was categorized into 5 stages on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography: stage 1 (2 patients [12%]), intact outer retina; stage 2 (2 patients [12%]), inner segment ellipsoid line disruption; stage 3 (5 patients [29%]), presence of an optically empty space; stage 4 (5 patients [29%]), optically empty space with partial retinal pigment epithelium disruption; and stage 5 (3 patients [18%]), complete retinal pigment epithelium disruption and/or loss of the outer nuclear layer. Stage 1 patients showed isolated hyperreflectivity of the external limiting membrane in the fovea, and the external limiting membrane was hyperreflective above each optically empty space. On near infrared reflectance imaging, the fovea was normal, hyporeflective, or showed both hyporeflective and hyperreflective features. All patients demonstrated autofluorescence abnormalities in the fovea and/or parafovea: 9 participants (53%) had reduced or absent autofluorescence surrounded by increased autofluorescence, 4 individuals (24%) showed only reduced or absent autofluorescence, 3 patients (18%) displayed only increased autofluorescence, and 1 individual (6%) exhibited decreased macular pigment contrast. Inner segment ellipsoid line loss generally correlated with the area of reduced autofluorescence, but hyperautofluorescence extended into this region in 2 patients (12%). Bilateral coloboma-like atrophic macular lesions were observed in 1 patient (6%). Five novel mutations were identified (4 in the CNGA3 gene and 1 in the CNGB3 gene).

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 9 million older Americans, and is characterized by the loss of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although the closely linked genome-wide association studies ARMS2/HTRA1 genes, located at the chromosome 10q26 locus, are strongly associated with the risk of AMD, their downstream targets are unknown. Low population frequencies of risk alleles in tissue banks make it impractical to study their function in cells derived from autopsied tissue. Moreover, autopsy eyes from end-stage AMD patients, where age-related RPE atrophy and fibrosis are already present, cannot be used to determine how abnormal ARMS2/HTRA1 expression can initiate RPE pathology. Instead, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived RPE from patients provides us with earlier stage AMD patient-specific cells and allows us to analyze the underlying mechanisms at this critical time point. An unbiased proteome screen of A2E-aged patient-specific iPS-derived RPE cell lines identified superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-mediated antioxidative defense in the genetic allele's susceptibility of AMD. The AMD-associated risk haplotype (T-in/del-A) impairs the ability of the RPE to defend against aging-related oxidative stress. SOD2 defense is impaired in RPE homozygous for the risk haplotype (T-in/del-A; T-in/del-A), while the effect was less pronounced in RPE homozygous for the protective haplotype (G-Wt-G; G-Wt-G). ARMS2/HTRA1 risk alleles decrease SOD2 defense, making RPE more susceptible to oxidative damage and thereby contributing to AMD pathogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Cell Line", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Haplotypes", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Barbara and Donald Jonas Laboratory of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA, Edward S.

To explore the mechanism of ADNIV, a human CAPN5 disease allele was expressed in mouse retinas with a lentiviral vector created to express either the wild-type human (h) CAPN5 or the ADNIV mutant hCAPN5-R243L allele under a rhodopsin promoter with tandem green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. Vectors were injected into the subretinal space of perinatal mice. Mouse phenotypes were analyzed using electroretinography, histology and inflammatory gene expression profiling. Mouse calpain-5 showed high homology to its human ortholog with >98% sequence identity that includes the ADNIV mutant residue. Calpain-5 protein was expressed in the inner and outer segments of the photoreceptors and in the outer plexiform layer. Expression of the hCAPN5-R243L allele caused loss of the electroretinogram b-wave, photoreceptor degeneration and induction of immune cell infiltration and inflammatory genes in the retina, recapitulating major features of the ADNIV phenotype. Intraocular neovascularization and fibrosis were not observed during the study period. Our study shows that expression of the hCAPN5-R243L disease allele elicits an ADNIV-like disease in mice. It further suggests that ADNIV is due to CAPN5 gain-of-function rather than haploinsufficiency, and retinal expression may be sufficient to generate an autoimmune response.

This is a clinically important question, as newly diagnosed patients exhibit considerable loss of rods and cones in their peripheral retinas. We have generated and characterized a tamoxifen inducible Cre-loxP rescue allele, Pde6b(Stop), which allows us to temporally correct PDE6-deficiency. Whereas untreated mutants exhibit degeneration, activation of Cre-loxP recombination in early embryogenesis produced stable long-term rescue. Reversal at later time-points showed partial long-term or short-lived rescue.

In the current study, sequential analyses suggest that microglia are recruited and appear after outer nuclear layer folding.

We demonstrated that more than 80% of the EGFP+ cells in retinas from rd7/rd7;Tg/Tg mice express Iba-1 (a microglial marker), and resident microglia are still present in the retina because AP20187 does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Hence, only circulating bone marrow (BM)-derived microglia are depleted. Depletion of circulating BM-derived microglia accelerates retinal degeneration in rd7 mice. An increased number of autofluorescent (AF) spots is a consequence of resident microglia proliferation, which in turn establishes an inflammatory cytokine milieu via the upregulation of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 expression. This inflammation is likely to accelerate retinal degeneration. This study not only identifies inflammation as a crucial step in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration, but also highlights the involvement of specific cytokine genes that could serve as future treatment targets in retinal degenerations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Count", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Eye Diseases, Hereditary", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microglia", "Retinal Degeneration", "Rod Cell Outer Segment", "Tacrolimus", "Time Factors", "Vision Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nan-Kai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Chun", "Last Name": "Lai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chi-Hsiu", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lung-Kun", "Last Name": "Yeh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chai Lin", "Last Name": "Chou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Takayuki", "Last Name": "Nagasaki", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen H", "Last Name": "Tsang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chung-Liang", "Last Name": "Chien", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Disease models & mechanisms", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}]
