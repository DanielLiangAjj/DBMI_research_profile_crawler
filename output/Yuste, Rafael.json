To explore this experimentally in vivo, we used an axonal-targeted calcium indicator to image action potentials at axonal terminal branches in superficial layers from mouse somatosensory cortical pyramidal neurons. We activated axons with an extracellular electrode, varying stimulation frequencies, and computationally extracted axonal morphologies and associated calcium responses. We find that axonal boutons have higher calcium accumulations than their parent axons, as was reported in vitro.

The viral transduction of GECIs is commonly used to target expression to specific brain regions, can be conveniently used with any mouse strain of interest without the need for prior crossing with a GECI mouse line and avoids potential hazards due to the chronic expression of GECIs during development. A key requirement for monitoring neuronal activity with an indicator is that the indicator itself minimally affects activity. Here, using common adeno-associated viral (AAV) transduction procedures, we describe spatially confined aberrant Ca2+ micro-waves slowly travelling through the hippocampus following expression of GCaMP6, GCaMP7 or R-CaMP1.07 driven by the synapsin promoter with AAV-dependent gene transfer, in a titre-dependent fashion. Ca2+ micro-waves developed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, but not dentate gyrus (DG) nor neocortex, were typically first observed at 4 weeks after viral transduction, and persisted up to at least 8 weeks. The phenomenon was robust, observed across laboratories with various experimenters and setups. Our results indicate that aberrant hippocampal Ca2+ micro-waves depend on the promoter and viral titre of the GECI, density of expression as well as the targeted brain region. We used an alternative viral transduction method of GCaMP which avoids this artifact.

To explore how this morphologic diversity differs across species and ages we analyzed 3D confocal reconstructions of \u223c8000 human spines and \u223c1700 mouse spines, labeled by intracellular injections in fixed tissue. Using unsupervised algorithms, we computationally separated spine heads and necks and systematically measured morphologic features of spines in apical and basal dendrites from cortical pyramidal cells. Human spines had unimodal distributions of parameters, without any evidence of morphologic subtypes. Their spine necks were longer and thinner in apical than in basal spines, and spine head volumes of an 85-year-old individual were larger than those of a 40-year-old individual. Human spines had longer and thicker necks and larger head volumes than mouse spines. Our results indicate that human spines form part of a continuum, are larger and longer than those of mice, and become larger with increasing adult age. These morphologic differences in spines across species could generate functional differences in biochemical and electrical spine compartmentalization, or in synaptic properties, across species and ages.", "Keywords": ["3D confocal reconstructions", "cerebral cortex", "plasticity", "pyramidal cells"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Dendrites", "Dendritic Spines", "Humans", "Mice", "Pyramidal Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Netanel", "Last Name": "Ofer", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 no2328@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Ruth", "Last Name": "Benavides-Piccione", "Affiliation": "Laboratorio Cajal de Circuitos Corticales, Centro de Tecnolog\u00eda Biom\u00e9dica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, 28223, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Javier", "Last Name": "DeFelipe", "Affiliation": "Laboratorio Cajal de Circuitos Corticales, Centro de Tecnolog\u00eda Biom\u00e9dica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, 28223, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}], "Journal": "eNeuro", "PubDate": "2022May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "35506662", "Title": "Intrinsic excitability mechanisms of neuronal ensemble formation.", "Abstract": "Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of cortical neurons, found in spontaneous and evoked activity, that can mediate perception and behavior. To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals of both sexes, replicating in vitro an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles in vivo. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we found that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increased their correlated activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Optogenetic and electrical stimulation also induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed unexpected strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reductions in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance reverted this effect. These significant increases in excitability can explain the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We conclude that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an 'iceberg' model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.", "Keywords": ["Hebbian plasticity", "cell biology", "ensembles", "intrinsic excitability", "mouse", "neuroscience", "optogenetics", "synaptic connection", "visual cortex"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Male", "Mice", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Pyramidal Cells", "Synapses", "Visual Cortex"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tzitzitlini", "Last Name": "Alejandre-Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jes\u00fas", "Last Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortega", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2022May04"}, {"PMID": "35476991", "Title": "An increase in spontaneous activity mediates visual habituation.", "Abstract": "The cerebral cortex is spontaneously active, but the function of this ongoing activity remains unclear. To test whether spontaneous activity encodes learned experiences, we measured the response of neuronal populations in mouse primary visual cortex with chronic two-photon calcium imaging during visual habituation to a specific oriented stimulus. We find that, during habituation, spontaneous activity increases in neurons across the full range of orientation selectivity, eventually matching that of evoked levels. This increase in spontaneous activity robustly correlates with the degree of habituation. Moreover, boosting spontaneous activity with two-photon optogenetic stimulation to the levels of visually evoked activity accelerates habituation.

Spines are biochemical compartments but might also electrically modify synaptic potentials. Using two-photon microscopy and a genetically encoded voltage indicator, we measured membrane potentials in spines and dendrites from pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex of mice during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Spines and dendrites were depolarized together during action potentials, but, during subthreshold and resting potentials, spines often experienced different voltages than parent dendrites, even activating independently. Spine voltages remained compartmentalized after two-photon optogenetic activation of individual spine heads. We conclude that spines are elementary voltage compartments.

However, the motion of freely behaving animals, together with the intermittent detectability of calcium sensors, can hinder automatic monitoring of neuronal activity and their subsequent functional characterization. We report the development and open-source implementation of a multi-step cellular tracking algorithm (Elastic Motion Correction and Concatenation or EMC2) that compensates for the intermittent disappearance of moving neurons by integrating local deformation information from detectable neurons. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our algorithm using calcium imaging data from two-photon volumetric microscopy in visual cortex of awake mice, and from confocal microscopy in behaving Hydra, which experiences major body deformation during its contractions. We quantify the performance of our algorithm using ground truth manual tracking of neurons, along with synthetic time-lapse sequences, covering a wide range of particle motions and detectability parameters. As a demonstration of the utility of the algorithm, we monitor for several days calcium activity of the same neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex in vivo, finding significant turnover within the active neurons across days, with only few neurons that remained active across days. Also, combining automatic tracking of single neuron activity with statistical clustering, we characterize and map neuronal ensembles in behaving Hydra, finding three major non-overlapping ensembles of neurons (CB, RP1 and RP2) whose activity correlates with contractions and elongations.

The study of how neuronal ensembles are built, recalled, and involved in the guiding of complex behaviors has been limited by the lack of experimental and analytical tools to reliably identify and manipulate neurons that have the ability to activate entire ensembles. Such pattern completion neurons have also been proposed as key elements of artificial and biological neural networks. Indeed, the relevance of pattern completion neurons is highlighted by growing evidence that targeting them can activate neuronal ensembles and trigger behavior. As a method to reliably detect pattern completion neurons, we use conditional random fields (CRFs), a type of probabilistic graphical model. We apply CRFs to identify pattern completion neurons in ensembles in experiments using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging from primary visual cortex of male mice and confirm the CRFs predictions with two-photon optogenetics. To test the broader applicability of CRFs we also analyze publicly available calcium imaging data (Allen Institute Brain Observatory dataset) and demonstrate that CRFs can reliably identify neurons that predict specific features of visual stimuli. Finally, to explore the scalability of CRFs we apply them to in silico network simulations and show that CRFs-identified pattern completion neurons have increased functional connectivity. These results demonstrate the potential of CRFs to characterize and selectively manipulate neural circuits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We describe a graph theory method to identify and optically manipulate neurons with pattern completion capability in mouse cortical circuits.

A dream experiment would be to observe the entire development of a nervous system, correlating the emergence of functional units with their associated behaviors. This is possible in the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris, which, after its complete dissociation into individual cells, can reassemble itself back together into a normal animal. We used calcium imaging to monitor the complete neuronal activity of dissociated Hydra as they reaggregated over several days. Initially uncoordinated neuronal activity became synchronized into coactive neuronal ensembles. These local modules then synchronized with others, building larger functional ensembles that eventually extended throughout the entire reaggregate, generating neuronal rhythms similar to those of intact animals. Global synchronization was not due to neurite outgrowth but to strengthening of functional connections between ensembles. We conclude that Hydra's nervous system achieves its functional reassembly through the hierarchical modularity of neuronal ensembles.

Spines, with a bulbous head connected to the dendrite by a thin neck, have a variety of morphologies that likely impact their functional properties. Nevertheless, the question of whether spines belong to distinct morphological subtypes is still open. Addressing this quantitatively requires clear identification and measurements of spine necks. Recent advances in electron microscopy enable large-scale systematic reconstructions of spines with nanometer precision in 3D. Analyzing ultrastructural reconstructions from mouse neocortical neurons with computer vision algorithms, we demonstrate that the vast majority of spine structures can be rigorously separated into heads and necks, enabling morphological measurements of spine necks. We then used a database of spine morphological parameters to explore the potential existence of different spine classes. Without exception, our analysis revealed unimodal distributions of individual morphological parameters of spine heads and necks, without evidence for subtypes of spines. The postsynaptic density size was strongly correlated with the spine head volume. The spine neck diameter, but not the neck length, was also correlated with the head volume. Spines with larger head volumes often had a spine apparatus and pairs of spines in a post-synaptic cell contacted by the same axon had similar head volumes. Our data reveal a lack of morphological subtypes of spines and indicate that the spine neck length and head volume must be independently regulated.

Using volumetric two-photon calcium imaging and local field potentials in primary visual cortex (V1) from awake mice presented with visual \"oddball\" paradigms, we identify both reductions and augmentations of stimulus-evoked responses depending, on whether the stimulus was redundant or deviant, respectively. Interestingly, deviance-augmented responses were limited to a specific subset of neurons mostly in supragranular layers. These deviance-detecting cells were spatially intermixed with other visually responsive neurons and were functionally correlated, forming a neuronal ensemble. Optogenetic suppression of prefrontal inputs to V1 reduced the contextual selectivity of deviance-detecting ensembles, demonstrating a causal role for top-down inputs.

While the former approach has a good temporal resolution, it generally lacks spatial resolution or specificity, particularly in scattering tissues such as the nervous system; meanwhile, the latter approach, particularly when combined with two-photon excitation, has high spatial resolution and specificity but poor temporal resolution. As a new technique, holographic microscopy combines the advantages of both approaches. By projecting a holographic pattern on the brain through a spatial light modulator, the activity of specific groups of neurons in 3D brain volumes can be imaged or stimulated with high spatiotemporal resolution. In a combination of other techniques such as fast scanning or temporal focusing, this high spatiotemporal resolution can be further improved.

Past attempts to do so using anatomical, physiological or molecular features of cortical cells have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neuronal or glial cell types, partly due to limited data. Single-cell transcriptomics is enabling, for the first time, systematic high-throughput measurements of cortical cells and generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and permanent. Statistical analyses of these data reveal clusters that often correspond to cell types previously defined by morphological or physiological criteria and that appear conserved across cortical areas and species. To capitalize on these new methods, we propose the adoption of a transcriptome-based taxonomy of cell types for mammalian neocortex. This classification should be hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It should be based on a probabilistic definition of a cell type and incorporate data from different approaches, developmental stages and species. A community-based classification and data aggregation model, such as a knowledge graph, could provide a common foundation for the study of cortical circuits. This community-based classification, nomenclature and data aggregation could serve as an example for cell type atlases in other parts of the body.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells", "Computational Biology", "Humans", "Neocortex", "Neuroglia", "Neurons", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Terminology as Topic", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA. rmy5@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Hawrylycz", "Affiliation": "Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, WA, USA.

To decipher it, it would be ideal to comprehensively measure the activity of the entire nervous system and musculature in a behaving animal. As a step in this direction, we used the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris to explore how physiological and environmental conditions alter simple contractile behavior and its accompanying neural and muscle activity. We used whole-body calcium imaging of neurons and muscle cells and studied the effect of temperature, media osmolarity, nutritional state, and body size on contractile behavior. In mounted Hydra preparations, changes in temperature, nutrition state, or body size did not have a major effect on neural or muscle activity, or on contractile behavior. But changes in media osmolarity systematically altered contractile behavior and foot detachments, increasing their frequency in hypo-osmolar media solutions and decreasing it in hyperosmolar media. Similar effects were seen in ectodermal, but not in endodermal muscle. Osmolarity also bidirectionally changed the activity of contraction burst (CB) neurons, but did not affect the network of rhythmic potential (RP) neurons in the ectoderm. These findings show osmolarity-dependent changes in the activity of CB neurons and ectodermal muscle, consistent with the hypothesis that CB neurons respond to media hypo-osmolarity, activating ectodermal muscle to generate CBs. This dedicated reflex could serve as an excretory system to prevent osmotic injury.

We used fast in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in male mouse neocortex to reconstruct, with single-cell resolution, the dynamics of acute (4-aminopyridine) focal cortical seizures as they originate within a spatially confined seizure initiation site (intrafocal region), and subsequently propagate into neighboring cortical areas (extrafocal region). We find that seizures originate as local neuronal ensembles within the initiation site. This abnormal hyperactivity engages increasingly larger areas in a saltatory fashion until it breaks into neighboring cortex, where it proceeds smoothly and is then detected electrophysiologically (LFP). Interestingly, PV inhibitory interneurons have spatially heterogeneous activity in intrafocal and extrafocal territories, ruling out a simple role of inhibition in seizure formation and spread. We propose a two-step model for the progression of focal seizures, where neuronal ensembles activate first, generating a microseizure, followed by widespread neural activation in a traveling wave through neighboring cortex during macroseizures.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We have used calcium imaging in mouse sensory cortex in vivo to reconstruct the onset of focal seizures elicited by local injection of the chemoconvulsant 4-aminopyridine. We demonstrate at cellular resolution that acute focal seizures originate as increasingly synchronized local neuronal ensembles. Because of its spatial confinement, this process may at first be undetectable even by nearby LFP electrodes. Further, we establish spatial footprints of local neural subtype activity that correspond to consecutive steps of seizure microprogression. Such footprints could facilitate determining the recording location (e.g., inside/outside an epileptogenic focus) in high-resolution studies, even in the absence of a priori knowledge about where exactly a seizure started.", "Keywords": ["calcium imaging", "epilepsy", "interneurons", "microseizures", "seizures", "two-photon"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Electroencephalography", "Male", "Mice", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Seizures"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Wenzel", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027 michaelwenzel2946@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Jordan P", "Last Name": "Hamm", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Darcy S", "Last Name": "Peterka", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Neurotechnology Center, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Oct23"}, {"PMID": "31410632", "Title": "Electrodiffusion models of synaptic potentials in dendritic spines.", "Abstract": "The biophysical properties of dendritic spines play a critical role in neuronal integration but are still poorly understood, due to experimental difficulties in accessing them. Spine biophysics has been traditionally explored using theoretical models based on cable theory. However, cable theory generally assumes that concentration changes associated with ionic currents are negligible and, therefore, ignores electrodiffusion, i.e. the interaction between electric fields and ionic diffusion. This assumption, while true for large neuronal compartments, could be incorrect when applied to femto-liter size structures such as dendritic spines. To extend cable theory and explore electrodiffusion effects, we use here the Poisson (P) and Nernst-Planck (NP) equations, which relate electric field to charge and Fick's law of diffusion, to model ion concentration dynamics in spines receiving excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs). We use experimentally measured voltage transients from spines with nanoelectrodes to explore these dynamics with realistic parameters. We find that (i) passive diffusion and electrodiffusion jointly affect the dynamics of spine EPSPs; (ii) spine geometry plays a key role in shaping EPSPs; and, (iii) the spine-neck resistance dynamically decreases during EPSPs, leading to short-term synaptic facilitation. Our formulation, which complements and extends cable theory, can be easily adapted to model ionic biophysics in other nanoscale bio-compartments.", "Keywords": ["Asymptotic analysis", "Coarse-grained model", "Dendritic spines", "Electrodiffusion", "Electrophysiology", "Simulations", "Synaptic transmission"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anions", "Cations", "Dendritic Spines", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Ion Channel Gating", "Models, Neurological", "Receptors, AMPA", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Static Electricity", "Synaptic Potentials"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thibault", "Last Name": "Lagache", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA. thibault.lagache@pasteur.fr."}, {"First Name": "Krishna", "Last Name": "Jayant", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of computational neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Aug"}, {"PMID": "31257030", "Title": "Controlling Visually Guided Behavior by Holographic Recalling of Cortical Ensembles.", "Abstract": "Neurons in cortical circuits are often coactivated as ensembles, yet it is unclear whether ensembles play a functional role in behavior.

The existence of such neuronal avalanches has been confirmed by several studies both in vitro and in vivo, among different species and across multiple spatial scales.

For instance, fluorescence microscopy faces a 'colour barrier', owing to the intrinsically broad (about 1,500 inverse centimetres) and featureless nature of fluorescence spectra that limits the number of resolvable colours to two to five (or seven to nine if using complicated instrumentation and analysis). Spontaneous Raman microscopy probes vibrational transitions with much narrower resonances (peak width of about 10 inverse centimetres) and so does not suffer from this problem, but weak signals make many bio-imaging applications impossible. Although surface-enhanced Raman scattering offers high sensitivity and multiplicity, it cannot be readily used to image specific molecular targets quantitatively inside live cells.

To explore this, we used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of neuronal populations in primary visual cortex of awake mice in the presence and absence of visual stimulation. Multidimensional analysis of the network activity allowed us to identify neuronal ensembles defined as groups of cells firing in synchrony. These synchronous groups of neurons were themselves activated in sequential temporal patterns, which repeated at much higher proportions than chance and were triggered by specific visual stimuli such as natural visual scenes.

We filled individual ChCs with biocytin in living brain slices and reconstructed their axonal arbors from serial semi-thin sections. We also reconstructed the cell somata of pyramidal neurons that were located inside the ChC axonal trees and determined the percentage of pyramidal neurons whose axon initial segments were innervated by ChC terminals. We found that the total percentage of pyramidal neurons that were innervated by a single labeled ChC was 18-22 %. Sholl analysis showed that this percentage peaked at 22-35 % for distances between 30 and 60 \u00b5m from the ChC soma, decreasing to lower percentages with increasing distances. We also studied the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the innervated neurons inside the ChC axonal arbor using spatial statistical analysis tools. We found that innervated pyramidal neurons are not distributed at random, but show a clustered distribution, with pockets where almost all cells are innervated and other regions within the ChC axonal tree that receive little or no innervation.

Although it has been suggested that interneurons, especially those belonging to the same subclass, synchronize their activity and impart this synchrony onto their local network, recent theoretical and experimental work have challenged this view. To better understand the activity of interneurons during cortical activity, we combined molecular identification, two-photon imaging, and electrophysiological recordings in thalamocortical slices from mouse somatosensory cortex. Using calcium imaging to monitor cortical activity, we found low spiking correlations among parvalbumin or somatostatin interneurons during cortical UP states, indicating that interneurons do not synchronize their firing. Intracellular recordings confirmed that nearby interneurons do not display more synchronous spiking than excitatory cells. The lack of interneuron synchrony was also evident during slow oscillations, even among interneurons that were electrically coupled via gap junctions, suggesting that their coupling does not function to synchronize their activity. Using voltage-clamp recordings from nearby pyramidal cells, we found that inhibitory currents (IPSCs) are more correlated than excitatory ones, but that correlated IPSCs arise from the activation of common presynaptic inhibitory cells, rather than from synchronization of interneuron activity. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacologically reducing inhibitory currents increases correlated excitatory activity. We conclude that inhibitory interneurons do not have synchronous activity during UP states, and that their function may be to decorrelate rather than to synchronize the firing of neurons within the local network.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Female", "Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Neural Inhibition"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tanya", "Last Name": "Sippy", "Affiliation": "HHMI, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA. missippy@gmail.com"}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Yuste", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Jun05"}, {"PMID": "23734024", "Title": "How to build a two-photon microscope with a confocal scan head.", "Abstract": "This article provides practical guidelines for the conversion of a standard confocal microscope into a two-photon microscope.

Recent data suggest that, in addition to enhancing connectivity and isolating synaptic biochemistry, spines can behave as electrical compartments independent from their parent dendrites. It is becoming clear that, although spines experience voltages similar to those of dendrites during action potentials (APs), spines must sustain higher depolarizations than do dendritic shafts during excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Synaptic potentials are likely amplified at the spine head and then reduced as they invade the dendrite through the spine neck. These electrical changes, probably due to a combination of passive and active mechanisms, may prevent the saturation of dendrites by the joint activation of many inputs, influence dendritic integration, and contribute to rapid synaptic plasticity.

Great effort is being invested into deciphering specific neural interactions and circuits. At the same time, there exist few general theories or principles that explain brain function. We attribute this disparity, in part, to limitations in current methodologies. Traditional neurophysiological approaches record the activities of one neuron or a few neurons at a time. Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between hundreds or thousands of neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states. Brains function at the nanoscale, so tools to study brains must ultimately operate at this scale, as well. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are poised to provide a rich toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function by enabling simultaneous measurement and manipulation of activity of thousands or even millions of neurons.

We studied ChCs located in the border of layers 1 and 2 from primary somatosensory cortex and found that practically all ChC axon terminals contact axon initial segments, with an average of three to five boutons per cartridge. By measuring the number of putative GABAergic synapses in initial segments, we estimate that each pyramidal neuron is innervated, on average, by four ChCs.
