[{"PMID": "38309267", "Title": "PHLDA2-mediated phosphatidic acid peroxidation triggers a distinct ferroptotic response during tumor suppression.", "Abstract": "Although the role of ferroptosis in killing tumor cells is well established, recent studies indicate that ferroptosis inducers also sabotage anti-tumor immunity by killing neutrophils and thus unexpectedly stimulate tumor growth, raising a serious issue about whether ferroptosis effectively suppresses tumor development in\u00a0vivo. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screenings, we discover a pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2 (PHLDA2)-mediated ferroptosis pathway that is neither ACSL4-dependent nor requires common ferroptosis inducers. PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis acts through the peroxidation of phosphatidic acid (PA) upon high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS-induced ferroptosis is critical for tumor growth in the absence of common ferroptosis inducers; strikingly, loss of PHLDA2 abrogates ROS-induced ferroptosis and promotes tumor growth but has no obvious effect in normal tissues in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse tumor models. These data demonstrate that PHLDA2-mediated PA peroxidation triggers a distinct ferroptosis response critical for tumor suppression and reveal that PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis occurs naturally in\u00a0vivo without any treatment from ferroptosis inducers.", "Keywords": ["ALOX12", "GPAT3", "PHLDA2", "ROS", "cystine starvation", "ferroptosis", "lipid peroxidation", "phosphatidic acid", "phosphatidylethanolamine", "tumor suppression"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Disease Models, Animal", "Lipid Peroxidation", "Neoplasms", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Svetlana N", "Last Name": "Samovich", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health and Departments of Environmental Health, Chemistry, Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA;

The peroxidation of PUFA-PLs, particularly sn2-arachidonoyl(AA)- and sn2-adrenoyl(AdA)-containing phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), has been associated with the execution of ferroptosis, a program of regulated cell death. There is a minor subpopulation (\u22481-2\u2005mol\u2009%) of doubly PUFA-acylated phospholipids (di-PUFA-PLs) whose role in ferroptosis remains enigmatic. Here we report that 15-lipoxygenase (15LOX) exhibits unexpectedly high pro-ferroptotic peroxidation activity towards di-PUFA-PEs. We revealed that peroxidation of several molecular species of di-PUFA-PEs occurred early in ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1, a typical ferroptosis inhibitor, effectively prevented peroxidation of di-PUFA-PEs. Furthermore, co-incubation of cells with di-AA-PE and 15LOX produced PUFA-PE peroxidation and induced ferroptotic death. The decreased contents of di-PUFA-PEs in ACSL4 KO A375 cells was associated with lower levels of di-PUFA-PE peroxidation and enhanced resistance to ferroptosis. Thus, di-PUFA-PE species are newly identified phospholipid peroxidation substrates and regulators of ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic target for many diseases related to ferroptotic

TAZ deficiency leads to accumulation of mono-lyso-CL (MLCL), which forms a peroxidase complex with cytochrome c (cyt c) capable of oxidizing polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids. We hypothesized that accumulation of MLCL facilitates formation of anomalous MLCL-cyt c peroxidase complexes and peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid phospholipids as the primary BTHS pathogenic mechanism. Using genetic, biochemical/biophysical, redox lipidomic and computational approaches, we reveal mechanisms of peroxidase-competent MLCL-cyt c complexation and increased phospholipid peroxidation in different TAZ-deficient cells and animal models and in pre-transplant biopsies from hearts of patients with BTHS. A specific mitochondria-targeted anti-peroxidase agent inhibited MLCL-cyt c peroxidase activity, prevented phospholipid peroxidation, improved mitochondrial respiration of TAZ-deficient C2C12 myoblasts and restored exercise endurance in a BTHS Drosophila model.

We focused on gaining new insights into the molecular basis of these pro-ferroptotic interactions using computational modeling and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments. Simulations of 15LOX-1/PEBP1 complex dynamics and interactions with lipids revealed that association with the membrane triggers a conformational change in the complex. This conformational change facilitates the access of stearoyl/arachidonoyl-PE (SAPE) substrates to the catalytic site. Furthermore, the binding of SAPE promotes tight interactions within the complex and induces further conformational changes that facilitate the oxidation reaction. The reaction yields two hydroperoxides as products, 15-HpETE-PE and 12-HpETE-PE, at a ratio of 5:1. A significant effect of PEBP1 is observed only on the predominant product.

Ferroptosis has been associated with the pathogenesis of major chronic degenerative diseases and acute injuries of the brain, cardiovascular system, liver, kidneys, and other organs, and its manipulation offers a promising new strategy for anticancer therapy. This explains the high interest in designing new small-molecule-specific inhibitors against ferroptosis. Given the role of 15-lipoxygenase (15LOX) association with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding protein 1 (PEBP1) in initiating ferroptosis-specific peroxidation of polyunsaturated PE, we propose a strategy of discovering antiferroptotic agents as inhibitors of the 15LOX/PEBP1 catalytic complex rather than 15LOX alone. Here we designed, synthesized, and tested a customized library of 26 compounds using biochemical, molecular, and cell biology models along with redox lipidomic and computational analyses. We selected two lead compounds, FerroLOXIN-1 and 2, which effectively suppressed ferroptosis in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo without affecting the biosynthesis of pro-/anti-inflammatory lipid mediators in\u00a0vivo. The effectiveness of these lead compounds is not due to radical scavenging or iron-chelation but results from their specific mechanisms of interaction with the 15LOX-2/PEBP1 complex, which either alters the binding pose of the substrate [eicosatetraenoyl-PE (ETE-PE)] in a nonproductive way or blocks the predominant oxygen channel thus preventing the catalysis of ETE-PE peroxidation.

The PAO1-driven pathogenic mechanism includes theft-ferroptosis realized via (a) curbing of the host antiferroptotic system, GSH/GPx4, and (b) employing bacterial 15-lipoxygenase to generate proferroptotic signal - 15-hydroperoxy-arachidonoyl-PE (15-HpETE-PE) - in the intestines of irradiated and PAO1-infected mice. Global redox phospholipidomics of the ileum revealed that lysophospholipids and oxidized phospholipids, particularly oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox), represented the major factors that contributed to the pathogenic changes induced by total body irradiation and infection by PAO1. A lipoxygenase inhibitor, baicalein, significantly attenuated animal lethality, PAO1 colonization, intestinal epithelial cell death, and generation of ferroptotic PEox signals.

When 15 lipoxygenase 1 (15LO1), a lipid-peroxidizing enzyme abundant in asthmatic human airway epithelial cells (HAECs), binds phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), hydroperoxy-phospholipids, which drive ferroptotic cell death, are generated. Peroxidases, including glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), metabolize hydroperoxy-phospholipids to hydroxy derivatives to prevent ferroptotic death, but consume reduced glutathione (GSH). The cystine transporter SLC7A11 critically restores/maintains intracellular GSH. We hypothesized that high 15LO1, PEBP1, and GPX4 activity drives abnormal asthmatic redox biology, evidenced by lower bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and intraepithelial cell GSH:oxidized GSH (GSSG) ratios, to enhance type 2 (T2) inflammatory responses. GSH, GSSG (enzymatic assays), 15LO1, GPX4, SLC7A11, and T2 biomarkers (Western blot and RNA-Seq) were measured in asthmatic and healthy control (HC) cells and fluids, with siRNA knockdown as appropriate. GSSG was higher and GSH:GSSG lower in asthmatic compared with HC BAL fluid, while intracellular GSH was lower in asthma. In vitro, a T2 cytokine (IL-13) induced 15LO1 generation of hydroperoxy-phospholipids, which lowered intracellular GSH and increased extracellular GSSG. Lowering GSH further by inhibiting SLC7A11 enhanced T2 inflammatory protein expression and ferroptosis. Ex vivo, redox imbalances corresponded to 15LO1 and SLC7A11 expression, T2 biomarkers, and worsened clinical outcomes.

We show that ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic programmed cell death pathway that is promoted by an excessive phospholipid peroxidation, is activated in the epidermal keratinocytes after their exposure to UVB. The susceptibility of the keratinocytes to UVB-induced ferroptosis depends on the extent of pro-ferroptosis death signal generation and the dysregulation of the glutathione system. Inhibition of ferroptosis prevents the release of HMGB1 from the human epidermal keratinocytes, and blocks necroinflammation in the UVB-irradiated mouse skin. We show that while apoptosis and pyroptosis are also detectable in the keratinocytes after UVB exposure, ferroptosis plays a significant role in initiating UVB-induced inflammation in the skin.
