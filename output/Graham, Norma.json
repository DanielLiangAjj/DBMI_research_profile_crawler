[{"PMID": "36689217", "Title": "Varying test-pattern duration to explore the dynamics of contrast-comparison and contrast-normalization processes.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we examine the dynamics of contrast-comparison and contrast-normalization processes. Observers adapted (for 1 second) to a grid of Gabor patches at one contrast; then a test pattern (which varied in duration from 12 ms to 3012 ms) was shown; and then the adapt pattern was shown again (1 second). All the Gabor patches in all the adapt patterns had 50% contrast. The test pattern was the same as the adapt pattern except that the Gabor patches in the test pattern had two different contrasts; the test contrasts varied from row to row (horizontal test pattern) or column to column (vertical test pattern). The task was to identify the orientation of the contrast variation in the test pattern (in other words, the observer performed a second-order orientation identification task). The two contrasts in each test pattern were varied while keeping the difference between the two contrasts constant. We have previously found that the observer's performance is poor for test patterns containing contrasts both above and below the adapt patterns' contrast (what we have called the \"straddle effect\") when the test duration is approximately 100 ms. Here, we find the straddle effect persists at all test durations we used. Other features of the results varied dramatically with test duration. We find that a simple model containing contrast-comparison and contrast-normalization processes provides a good explanation for the psychophysical results. The results provide some insight into the dynamics of these processes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Contrast Sensitivity", "Adaptation, Physiological", "Pattern Recognition, Visual"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Norma V", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "S Sabina", "Last Name": "Wolfson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of vision", "PubDate": "2023Jan03"}, {"PMID": "29904790", "Title": "Is the straddle effect in contrast perception limited to second-order spatial vision?", "Abstract": "Previous work on the straddle effect in contrast perception (Foley, 2011; Graham & Wolfson, 2007; Wolfson & Graham, 2007, 2009) has used visual patterns and observer tasks of the type known as spatially second-order. After adaptation of about 1 s to a grid of Gabor patches all at one contrast, a second-order test pattern composed of two different test contrasts can be easy or difficult to perceive correctly. When the two test contrasts are both a bit less (or both a bit greater) than the adapt contrast, observers perform very well. However, when the two test contrasts straddle the adapt contrast (i.e., one of the test contrasts is greater than the adapt contrast and the other is less), performance drops dramatically. To explain this drop in performance-the straddle effect-we have suggested a contrast-comparison process. We began to wonder: Are second-order patterns necessary for the straddle effect? Here we show that the answer is \"no\". We demonstrate the straddle effect using spatially first-order visual patterns and several different observer tasks. We also see the effect of contrast normalization using first-order visual patterns here, analogous to our prior findings with second-order visual patterns. We did find one difference between first- and second-order tasks: Performance in the first-order tasks was slightly lower. This slightly lower performance may be due to slightly greater memory load. For many visual scenes, the important quantity in human contrast processing may not be monotonic with physical contrast but may be something more like the unsigned difference between current contrast and recent average contrast.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Contrast Sensitivity", "Humans", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Sensory Thresholds", "Space Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Norma V", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "S Sabina", "Last Name": "Wolfson", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of vision", "PubDate": "2018May01"}]
