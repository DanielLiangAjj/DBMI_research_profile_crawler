These capabilities make VR a powerful tool for many types of behavioural research, including studies of sensorimotor, perceptual and cognitive functions. Here we introduce Ouvrai, an open-source solution that facilitates the design and execution of remote VR studies, capitalizing on the surge in VR headset ownership. This tool allows researchers to develop sophisticated experiments using cutting-edge web technologies such as WebXR to enable browser-based VR, without compromising on experimental design. Ouvrai's features include easy installation, intuitive JavaScript templates, a component library managing front- and backend processes and a streamlined workflow. It integrates with Firebase, Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk and provides data processing utilities for analysis. Unlike other tools, Ouvrai remains free, with researchers managing their web hosting and cloud database via personal Firebase accounts. Ouvrai is not limited to VR studies; researchers can also develop and run desktop or touchscreen studies using the same streamlined workflow. Through three distinct motor learning experiments, we confirm Ouvrai's efficiency and viability for conducting remote VR studies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Virtual Reality", "Neurosciences", "Male", "Adult", "User-Computer Interface", "Software", "Female", "Young Adult", "Behavioral Research"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Evan", "Last Name": "Cesanek", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. evan.cesanek@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Sabyasachi", "Last Name": "Shivkumar", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James N", "Last Name": "Ingram", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Wolpert", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature human behaviour", "PubDate": "2024Jun"}, {"PMID": "38520691", "Title": "Exploration biases forelimb reaching strategies.", "Abstract": "The brain can generate actions, such as reaching to a target, using different movement strategies.

As mice learn to reach the target, they refine their variable joystick trajectories into controlled reaches, which depend on the sensorimotor cortex.

Bias can be compensated for by adaptation and, in tasks in which the magnitude of noise varies across the environment, noise can be reduced by identifying and then acting in less noisy regions of the environment. Here we examine how these two processes interact when participants reach under a combination of an externally imposed visuomotor bias and noise. In a center-out reaching task, participants experienced noise (zero-mean random visuomotor rotations) that was target-direction dependent with a standard deviation that increased linearly from a least-noisy direction. They also experienced a constant bias, a visuomotor rotation that varied (across groups) from 0 to 40 degrees. Critically, on each trial, participants could select one of three targets to reach to, thereby allowing them to potentially select targets close to the least-noisy direction. The group who experienced no bias (0 degrees) quickly learned to select targets close to the least-noisy direction. However, groups who experienced a bias often failed to identify the least-noisy direction, even though they did partially adapt to the bias. When noise was introduced after participants experienced and adapted to a 40 degrees bias (without noise) in all directions, they exhibited an improved ability to find the least-noisy direction. We developed two models-one for reach adaptation and one for target selection-that could explain participants' adaptation and target-selection behavior. Our data and simulations indicate that there is a trade-off between adaptation and selection. Specifically, because bias learning is local, participants can improve performance, through adaptation, by always selecting targets that are closest to a chosen direction. However, this comes at the expense of improving performance, through selection, by reaching toward targets in different directions to find the least-noisy direction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Psychomotor Performance", "Visual Perception", "Learning", "Noise", "Bias", "Adaptation, Physiological", "Movement"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tianyao", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jason P", "Last Name": "Gallivan", "Affiliation": "Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Wolpert", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "J Randall", "Last Name": "Flanagan", "Affiliation": "Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."}], "Journal": "PLoS computational biology", "PubDate": "2023Nov"}, {"PMID": "37884350", "Title": "Fast Feedback Responses to Categorical Sensorimotor Errors That Do Not Indicate Error Magnitude Are Optimized Based on Short- and Long-Term Memory.", "Abstract": "Skilled motor performance depends critically on rapid corrective responses that act to preserve the goal of the movement in the face of perturbations. Although it is well established that the gain of corrective responses elicited while reaching toward objects adapts to different contexts, little is known about the adaptability of corrective responses supporting the manipulation of objects after they are grasped. Here, we investigated the adaptability of the corrective response elicited when an object being lifted is heavier than expected and fails to lift off when predicted. This response involves a monotonic increase in vertical load force triggered, within \u223c90 ms, by the absence of expected sensory feedback signaling lift off and terminated when actual lift off occurs. Critically, because the actual weight of the object cannot be directly sensed at the moment the object fails to lift off, any adaptation of the corrective response would have to be based on memory from previous lifts. We show that when humans, including men and women, repeatedly lift an object that on occasional catch trials increases from a baseline weight to a fixed heavier weight, they scale the gain of the response (i.e., the rate of force increase) to the heavier weight within two to three catch trials. We also show that the gain of the response scales, on the first catch trial, with the baseline weight of the object. Thus, the gain of the lifting response can be adapted by both short- and long-term experience. Finally, we demonstrate that this adaptation preserves the efficacy of the response across contexts.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Here, we present the first investigation of the adaptability of the corrective lifting response elicited when an object is heavier than expected and fails to lift off when predicted. A striking feature of the response, which is driven by a sensory prediction error arising from the absence of expected sensory feedback, is that the magnitude of the error is unknown. That is, the motor system only receives a categorical error indicating that the object is heavier than expected but not its actual weight. Although the error magnitude is not known at the moment the response is elicited, we show that the response can be scaled to predictions of error magnitude based on both recent and long-term memories.", "Keywords": ["adaptive responses", "fast reflexes", "object manipulation", "optimization", "sensorimotor control"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Humans", "Female", "Feedback", "Psychomotor Performance", "Hand Strength", "Memory, Long-Term", "Motivation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael R", "Last Name": "McGarity-Shipley", "Affiliation": "Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Simona", "Last Name": "Markovik Jantz", "Affiliation": "Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Roland S", "Last Name": "Johansson", "Affiliation": "Physiology Section, Department of Integrative Medical Biology, Ume\u00e5 University, SE-901 87 Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Wolpert", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, 10027."}, {"First Name": "J Randall", "Last Name": "Flanagan", "Affiliation": "Centre for Neuroscience Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada flanagan@queensu.ca."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023Dec06"}, {"PMID": "37434268", "Title": "A novel video game for remote studies of motor adaptation in children.", "Abstract": "Here we designed a motor adaptation video game that could be played remotely (at home) through a web browser.

However, there is evidence that error-based learning with terminal visual feedback of the movement (provided at the end of movement) may be driven by both sensory and reward prediction errors. Here we examined the influence of feedback on learning using a visuomotor adaptation task in which participants moved a cursor to a single target while the gain between hand and cursor movement displacement was gradually altered. Different groups received either continuous error feedback (EC), terminal error feedback (ET), or binary reinforcement feedback (success/fail) at the end of the movement (R). Following adaptation we tested generalization to targets located in different directions and found that generalization in the ET group was intermediate between the EC and R groups. We then examined the persistence of adaptation in the EC and ET groups when the cursor was extinguished and only binary reward feedback was provided. Whereas performance was maintained in the ET group, it quickly deteriorated in the EC group.

Nevertheless, the central nervous system (CNS) can gracefully coordinate our movements. Most learning frameworks rely on the internal model principle, which requires a precise internal representation in the CNS to predict the outcomes of our motor commands. However, learning a perfect internal model in a complex environment over a short period of time is a nontrivial problem. Indeed, achieving proficient motor skills may require years of training for some difficult tasks. Internal models alone may not be adequate to explain the motor adaptation behavior during the early phase of learning. Recent studies investigating the active regulation of motor variability, the presence of suboptimal inference, and model-free learning have challenged some of the traditional viewpoints on the sensorimotor learning mechanism. As a result, it may be necessary to develop a computational framework that can account for these new phenomena. Here, we develop a novel theory of motor learning, based on model-free adaptive optimal control, which can bypass some of the difficulties in existing theories. This new theory is based on our recently developed adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and robust ADP (RADP) methods and is especially useful for accounting for motor learning behavior when an internal model is inaccurate or unavailable.

Here, we examine whether rapid motor responses to perturbations of visual feedback about movement, which mediate low-level and involuntary feedback control loops, reflect computations associated with high-level value-based decision-making. In three experiments involving human participants, we varied the value associated with different potential targets for reaching movements by controlling the distributions of rewards across the targets (Experiment 1), the probability with which each target could be specified (Experiment 2), or both (Experiment 3). We found that the size of rapid and involuntary feedback responses to movement perturbations was strongly influenced by the relative value between targets. A statistical model of relative value that includes a term for risk sensitivity provided the best fit to the visuomotor response data, illustrating that feedback control policies are biased to favor more frequent task success at the expense of the overall extrinsic reward accumulated through movement. Importantly however, the regulation of rapid feedback responses was associated with successful pursuit of high-value task outcomes. This implies that when we move, the brain specifies a set of feedback control gains that enable low-level motor areas not only to generate efficient and accurate movement, but also to rapidly and adaptively respond to evolving sensory information in a manner consistent with value-based decision-making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Current theories of sensorimotor control suggest that, rather than selecting and planning the details of movements in advance, the role of the brain is to set time-varying feedback gains that continuously transform sensory information into motor commands by feedback control. Here, we examine whether the fastest motor responses to perturbations of movement, which mediate low-level and involuntary feedback control loops (i.e., reflexes), reflect computations associated with high-level, value-based decision-making. We find that rapid feedback responses during reaching reflect the relative probabilities and rewards associated with target options.

As learning proceeds, muscle co-contraction decreases as an accurate internal model develops. The initial co-contraction could affect the learning of the internal model in several ways. By ensuring the limb remains close to the target state, co-contraction could speed up learning. Conversely, by reducing kinematic errors, a key training signal, it could slow down learning. Alternatively, given that the effects of muscle co-contraction on kinematic errors are predictable and could be discounted when assessing the internal model error, it could have no effect on learning. Using a sequence of force pulses, we pretrained two groups to either co-contract (stiff group) or relax (relaxed group) their arm muscles in the presence of dynamic perturbations. A third group (control group) was not pretrained. All groups performed reaching movements in a velocity-dependent curl field. We measured adaptation using channel trials and found greater adaptation in the stiff group during early learning.

Normally, movements depend on the integration of sensory information with the predicted consequences of action. This integration leads to a suppression in the intensity of predicted sensations, reflected in a 'sensory attenuation'. We examined this integration process and its relation to dopamine in PD, by measuring sensory attenuation. Patients with idiopathic PD (n = 18) and population-derived controls (n = 175) matched a set of target forces applied to their left index finger by a torque motor. To match the force, participants either pressed with their right index finger ('Direct' condition) or moved a knob that controlled a motor through a linear potentiometer ('Slider' condition). We found that despite changes in sensitivity to different forces, overall sensory attenuation did not differ between medicated PD patients and controls. Importantly, the degree of attenuation was negatively related to PD motor severity but positively related to individual patient dopamine dose, as measured by levodopa dose equivalent.

The mechanisms which select modules based on task requirements and modify their output during learning are therefore critical to our understanding of sensorimotor control. Here we develop a novel modular architecture for multi-dimensional tasks in which a set of fixed primitives are each able to compensate for errors in a single direction in the task space. The contribution of the primitives to the motor output is determined by both top-down contextual information and bottom-up error information. We implement this model for a task in which subjects learn to manipulate a dynamic object whose orientation can vary. In the model, visual information regarding the context (the orientation of the object) allows the appropriate primitives to be engaged. This top-down module selection is implemented by a Gaussian function tuned for the visual orientation of the object. Second, each module's contribution adapts across trials in proportion to its ability to decrease the current kinematic error. Specifically, adaptation is implemented by cosine tuning of primitives to the current direction of the error, which we show to be theoretically optimal for reducing error. This error-tuned model makes two novel predictions. First, interference should occur between alternating dynamics only when the kinematic errors associated with each oppose one another. In contrast, dynamics which lead to orthogonal errors should not interfere. Second, kinematic errors alone should be sufficient to engage the appropriate modules, even in the absence of contextual information normally provided by vision. We confirm both these predictions experimentally and show that the model can also account for data from previous experiments.

To test between these alternatives we used a task in which participants were required to reach to either a single target or towards two potential targets while grasping an object.

Critically, on these trials the initial grip force was minimal, appropriate for the midline movement, and not the average of the large grip forces required for movements to the individual targets.

Recently, we demonstrated the upregulation of rapid visuomotor feedback gains early in curl force field learning, which decrease once a predictive motor memory is learned. However, even after learning is complete, these feedback gains are higher than those observed in the null field trials. Interestingly, these upregulated feedback gains in the curl field were not observed in a constant force field. Therefore, we suggest that adaptation also involves selectively tuning the feedback sensitivity of the sensorimotor control system to the environment. Here, we test this hypothesis by measuring the rapid visuomotor feedback gains after subjects adapt to a variety of novel dynamics generated by a robotic manipulandum in three experiments. To probe the feedback gains, we measured the magnitude of the motor response to rapid shifts in the visual location of the hand during reaching. While the feedback gain magnitude remained similar over a larger than a fourfold increase in constant background load, the feedback gains scaled with increasing lateral resistance and increasing instability. The third experiment demonstrated that the feedback gains could also be independently tuned to perturbations to the left and right, depending on the lateral resistance, demonstrating the fractionation of feedback gains to environmental dynamics.

We hypothesized that this occurs when an accumulation of evidence reaches a termination threshold, registered, subjectively, as an \"aha\" moment.

We can reduce such errors by both improving our estimates of the state of the world and through online error correction of the ongoing action. Two prominent frameworks that explain how humans solve these problems are Bayesian estimation and stochastic optimal feedback control. Here we examine the interaction between estimation and control by asking if uncertainty in estimates affects how subjects correct for errors that may arise during the movement. Unbeknownst to participants, we randomly shifted the visual feedback of their finger position as they reached to indicate the center of mass of an object. Even though participants were given ample time to compensate for this perturbation, they only fully corrected for the induced error on trials with low uncertainty about center of mass, with correction only partial in trials involving more uncertainty. The analysis of subjects' scores revealed that participants corrected for errors just enough to avoid significant decrease in their overall scores, in agreement with the minimal intervention principle of optimal feedback control. We explain this behavior with a term in the loss function that accounts for the additional effort of adjusting one's response.

Solving for the optimal plan that minimizes these costs typically leads to specifying a time-varying feedback controller which both generates the movement and can optimally correct for errors that arise within a movement.

We show that by incorporating such state-dependent sensory feedback, the optimal solution incorporates active sensing and is no longer a pure feedback process but includes a significant feedforward component. To examine whether people take into account such state-dependency in sensory feedback we asked people to make movements in which we controlled the reliability of sensory feedback. We made the visibility of the hand state-dependent, such that the visibility was proportional to the component of hand velocity in a particular direction. Subjects gradually adapted to such a sensory perturbation by making curved hand movements. In particular, they appeared to control the late visibility of the movement matching predictions of the optimal controller with state-dependent sensory noise.

Here, instead of probing generalization, which has led to conflicting results, we examine whether novel dynamics can be learned when explicitly and unambiguously presented in particular coordinate systems. Subjects performed center-out reaches to targets in the presence of a force field, while varying the orientation of their hand (i.e., the wrist angle) across trials. Different groups of subjects experienced force fields that were explicitly presented either in Cartesian coordinates (field independent of hand orientation), in object coordinates (field rotated with hand orientation), or in anti-object coordinates (field rotated counter to hand orientation). Subjects learned to represent the dynamics when presented in either Cartesian or object coordinates, learning these as well as an ambiguous force field. However, learning was slower for the object-based dynamics and substantially impaired for the anti-object presentation.

Here we investigated whether the control of rapid corrective arm responses, elicited in response to visual perturbations, has access to such newly acquired knowledge of object dynamics. Participants first learned to make reaching movements while grasping an object subjected to complex load forces that depended on the distance and angle of the hand from the start position. During a subsequent test phase, we examined grip and load force coordination during corrective arm movements elicited (within \u223c150 ms) in response to viewed sudden lateral shifts (1.5 cm) in target or object position. We hypothesized that, if knowledge of object dynamics is incorporated in the control of the corrective responses, grip force changes would anticipate the unusual load force changes associated with the corrective arm movements so as to support grasp stability. Indeed, we found that the participants generated grip force adjustments tightly coupled, both spatially and temporally, to the load force changes associated with the arm movement corrections. We submit that recently learned novel object dynamics are effectively integrated into sensorimotor control policies that support rapid visually driven arm corrective actions during transport of hand held objects.

Here we examine the extent to which each of these three possible coordinate systems--Cartesian hand position, shoulder and elbow joint angles, or hand orientation--underlies the reduction in interference. Subjects performed goal-directed reaching movements in five different limb configurations designed so that different pairs of these configurations involved a change in only one coordinate system. By specifically assigning clockwise and counter-clockwise force fields to the configurations we could create three different conditions in which the direction of the force field could only be uniquely distinguished in one of the three coordinate systems. We examined the ability to learn the two fields based on each of the coordinate systems. The largest reduction of interference was observed when the field direction was linked to the hand orientation with smaller reductions in the other two conditions.

To do this we measure visuomotor responses (involuntary motor responses to shifts in the visual feedback of the hand) during reaching movements. Previous work has demonstrated that these feedback responses can be modulated depending on the statistical distributions of the environment. Specifically, feedback gains were upregulated for task-relevant environments and downregulated for task-irrelevant environments. Using these two statistical distributions, the first experiment examined whether these feedback responses could be independently modulated for the same limb posture for two directions of movement (same limb posture but on either an inward or outward movement), while the second examined whether the feedback responses could modulate, within a single movement, to perturbations to the left or right of the reach. Both experiments demonstrated that visuomotor feedback responses could be learned independently such that the response was appropriate for the environment. This work demonstrates that feedback gains can be simultaneously tuned (upregulated and downregulated) depending on the state of the body and the environment.

However, when the prior distribution becomes more complex than a simple Gaussian, such as skewed or bimodal, training takes much longer and performance appears suboptimal. It is unclear whether such suboptimality arises from an imprecise internal representation of the complex prior, or from additional constraints in performing probabilistic computations on complex distributions, even when accurately represented. Here we probe the sources of suboptimality in probabilistic inference using a novel estimation task in which subjects are exposed to an explicitly provided distribution, thereby removing the need to remember the prior. Subjects had to estimate the location of a target given a noisy cue and a visual representation of the prior probability density over locations, which changed on each trial. Different classes of priors were examined (Gaussian, unimodal, bimodal). Subjects' performance was in qualitative agreement with the predictions of Bayesian Decision Theory although generally suboptimal. The degree of suboptimality was modulated by statistical features of the priors but was largely independent of the class of the prior and level of noise in the cue, suggesting that suboptimality in dealing with complex statistical features, such as bimodality, may be due to a problem of acquiring the priors rather than computing with them. We performed a factorial model comparison across a large set of Bayesian observer models to identify additional sources of noise and suboptimality. Our analysis rejects several models of stochastic behavior, including probability matching and sample-averaging strategies.

Such post-initiation processing can explain the pattern of changes of mind by asserting an accumulation of additional evidence to a criterion level, termed change-of-mind bound. Here we test the hypothesis that physical effort associated with the movement required to change one's mind affects the level of the change-of-mind bound and the time for post-initiation deliberation. We varied the effort required to change from one choice target to another in a reaching movement by varying the geometry of the choice targets or by applying a force field between the targets. We show that there is a reduction in the frequency of change of mind when the separation of the choice targets would require a larger excursion of the hand from the initial to the opposite choice.

Here we measured the visuomotor feedback gain throughout the course of movements made to \"near\" or \"far\" targets in human subjects. The visuomotor gain showed a systematic modulation over the time course of the reach, with the gain peaking at the middle of the movement and dropping rapidly as the target is approached. This modulation depends primarily on the proportion of the movement remaining, rather than hand position, suggesting that the modulation is sensitive to task demands. Model-predictive control suggests that the gains should be continuously recomputed throughout a movement. To test this, we investigated whether feedback gains update when the task goal is altered during a movement, that is when the target of the reach jumped. We measured the visuomotor gain either simultaneously with the jump or 100 ms after the jump. The visuomotor gain nonspecifically reduced for all target jumps when measured synchronously with the jump. However, the visuomotor gain 100 ms later showed an appropriate modulation for the revised task goal by increasing for jumps that increased the distance to the target and reducing for jumps that decreased the distance. We conclude that visuomotor feedback gain shows a temporal evolution related to task demands and that this evolution can be flexibly recomputed within 100 ms to accommodate online modifications to task goals.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Electromyography", "Feedback, Psychological", "Female", "Goals", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Movement", "Photic Stimulation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Robotics", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Dimitriou", "Affiliation": "Computational and Biological Learning Laboratory, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Wolpert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Franklin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Jun26"}, {"PMID": "23727092", "Title": "Context-dependent decay of motor memories during skill acquisition.", "Abstract": "Current models of motor learning posit that skill acquisition involves both the formation and decay of multiple motor memories that can be engaged in different contexts. Memory formation is assumed to be context dependent, so that errors most strongly update motor memories associated with the current context. In contrast, memory decay is assumed to be context independent, so that movement in any context leads to uniform decay across all contexts. We demonstrate that for both object manipulation and force-field adaptation, contrary to previous models, memory decay is highly context dependent. We show that the decay of memory associated with a given context is greatest for movements made in that context, with more distant contexts showing markedly reduced decay. Thus, both memory formation and decay are strongest for the current context. We propose that this apparently paradoxical organization provides a mechanism for optimizing performance. While memory decay tends to reduce force output, memory formation can correct for any errors that arise, allowing the motor system to regulate force output so as to both minimize errors and avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. The motor commands for any given context thus result from a balance between memory formation and decay, while memories for other contexts are preserved.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Humans", "Learning", "Memory", "Motor Activity", "Motor Skills", "Psychomotor Performance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "James N", "Last Name": "Ingram", "Affiliation": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, UK. jni20@cam.ac.uk"}, {"First Name": "J Randall", "Last Name": "Flanagan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Wolpert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Current biology : CB", "PubDate": "2013Jun17"}, {"PMID": "23446696", "Title": "The effect of contextual cues on the encoding of motor memories.", "Abstract": "Several studies have shown that sensory contextual cues can reduce the interference observed during learning of opposing force fields. However, because each study examined a small set of cues, often in a unique paradigm, the relative efficacy of different sensory contextual cues is unclear. In the present study we quantify how seven contextual cues, some investigated previously and some novel, affect the formation and recall of motor memories. Subjects made movements in a velocity-dependent curl field, with direction varying randomly from trial to trial but always associated with a unique contextual cue. Linking field direction to the cursor or background color, or to peripheral visual motion cues, did not reduce interference. In contrast, the orientation of a visual object attached to the hand cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. When the fields were associated with movement in different locations in the workspace, a substantial reduction in interference was observed. We tested whether this reduction in interference was due to the different locations of the visual feedback (targets and cursor) or the movements (proprioceptive). When the fields were associated only with changes in visual display location (movements always made centrally) or only with changes in the movement location (visual feedback always displayed centrally), a substantial reduction in interference was observed. These results show that although some visual cues can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory, changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement are far more effective than changes in simple visual contextual cues.", "Keywords": ["dynamic adaptation", "interference", "motor learning", "state-dependent learning", "visual cues"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cues", "Feedback, Physiological", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Recall", "Movement", "Psychomotor Performance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ian S", "Last Name": "Howard", "Affiliation": "Computational and Biological Learning Lab, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom. ish22@cam.ac.uk"}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Wolpert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David W", "Last Name": "Franklin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neurophysiology", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "23277112", "Title": "Modulation of somatosensory processing by action.", "Abstract": "Psychophysical evidence suggests that sensations arising from our own movements are diminished when predicted by motor forward models and that these models may also encode the timing and intensity of movement. Here we report a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which the effects on sensation of varying the occurrence, timing and force of movements were measured. We observed that tactile-related activity in a region of secondary somatosensory cortex is reduced when sensation is associated with movement and further that this reduction is maximal when movement and sensation occur synchronously. Motor force is not represented in the degree of attenuation but rather in the magnitude of this region's response.
