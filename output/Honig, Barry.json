While intercellular DIP/Dpr interactions have been well characterized, DIPs and Dprs are often co-expressed within the same cells, raising the question as to whether they also interact in cis . We show, in cultured cells and in vivo, that DIP-\u03b1 and DIP-\u03b4 can interact in cis with their ligands, Dpr6/10 and Dpr12, respectively. When co-expressed in cis with their cognate partners, these Dprs regulate the extent of trans binding, presumably through competitive cis interactions. We demonstrate the neurodevelopmental effects of cis inhibition in fly motor neurons and in the mushroom body. We further show that a long disordered region of DIP-\u03b1 at the C-terminus is required for cis but not trans interactions, likely because it alleviates geometric constraints on cis binding. Thus, the balance between cis and trans interactions plays a role in controlling neural development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas C", "Last Name": "Morano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davys H", "Last Name": "Lopez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hagar", "Last Name": "Meltzer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alina P", "Last Name": "Sergeeva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Phinikoula S", "Last Name": "Katsamba", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin D", "Last Name": "Rostam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Himanshu Pawankumar", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan E", "Last Name": "Becker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bavat", "Last Name": "Bornstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Filip", "Last Name": "Cosmanescu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Oren", "Last Name": "Schuldiner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard S", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun06"}, {"PMID": "38844044", "Title": "Robust Prediction of Relative Binding Energies for Protein-Protein Complex Mutations Using Free Energy Perturbation Calculations.", "Abstract": "Computational free energy-based methods have the potential to significantly improve throughput and decrease costs of protein design efforts.

Clustered protocadherins (Pcdh), comprising a large family of isoform-specific homophilic recognition molecules, play a pivotal role in neuronal self-avoidance required for mammalian brain development5-7. The probabilistic expression of different Pcdh isoforms confers unique identities upon neurons and forms the basis for neuronal processes to discriminate between self and non-self5,6,8. Whether this self-recognition mechanism exists in astrocytes, the other predominant cell type of the brain, remains unknown. Here, we report that a specific isoform in the Pcdh\u03b3 cluster, \u03b3C3, is highly enriched in human and murine astrocytes. Through genetic manipulation, we demonstrate that \u03b3C3 acts autonomously to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse visual cortex. To determine if \u03b3C3 proteins act by promoting recognition between processes of the same astrocyte, we generated pairs of \u03b3C3 chimeric proteins capable of heterophilic binding to each other, but incapable of homophilic binding. Co-expressing complementary heterophilic binding isoform pairs in the same \u03b3C3 null astrocyte restored normal morphology. By contrast, chimeric \u03b3C3 proteins individually expressed in single \u03b3C3 null mutant astrocytes did not.

The ectodomains of wild-type cadherins form a crystalline-like two-dimensional lattice in cell-cell interfaces mediated by both trans (apposed cell) and cis (same cell) interactions. In addition to these extracellular forces, adhesive strength is further regulated by cytosolic phenomena involving \u03b1 and \u03b2 catenin-mediated interactions between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. Cell-cell adhesion can be further strengthened under tension through mechanisms that have not been definitively characterized in molecular detail. Here we quantitatively determine the role of the cadherin ectodomain in mechanosensing. To this end, we devise an E-cadherin-coated emulsion system, in which droplet surface tension is balanced by protein binding strength to give rise to stable areas of adhesion. To reach the honeycomb/cohesive limit, an initial emulsion compression by centrifugation facilitates E-cadherin trans binding, whereas a high protein surface concentration enables the cis-enhanced stabilization of the interface. We observe an abrupt concentration dependence on recruitment into adhesions of constant crystalline density, reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. Removing the lateral cis interaction with a \"cis mutant\" shifts this transition to higher surface densities leading to denser, yet weaker adhesions. In both proteins, the stabilization of progressively larger areas of deformation is consistent with single-molecule experiments that show a force-dependent lifetime enhancement in the cadherin ectodomain, which may be attributed to the \"X-dimer\" bond.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomimetics", "Emulsions", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion", "Protein Binding"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kartikeya", "Last Name": "Nagendra", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York; Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry Training Program, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Adrien", "Last Name": "Izzet", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas B", "Last Name": "Judd", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ruben", "Last Name": "Zakine", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Leah", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York; D\u00e9partement de Physique, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, PSL University, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Oliver J", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "L\u00e9a-Laetitia", "Last Name": "Pontani", "Affiliation": "Laboratoire Jean Perrin, Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York; Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York; Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Columbia University, New York, New York; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jasna", "Last Name": "Brujic", "Affiliation": "Center for Soft Matter Research, Department of Physics, New York University, New York, New York; Laboratoire de Physique et M\u00e9canique de Milieux H\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8nes, UMR 7636, CNRS, ESPCI Paris-PSL, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, Paris, France.

In a proteomic screen, we identified BACH1 as a cellular factor that recognizes the p53 DNA-binding domain depending on its mutation status. BACH1 strongly interacts with p53R175H but fails to effectively bind wild-type p53 or other hotspot mutants in vivo for functional regulation. Notably, p53R175H acts as a repressor for ferroptosis by abrogating BACH1-mediated downregulation of SLC7A11 to enhance tumor growth; conversely, p53R175H promotes BACH1-dependent tumor metastasis by upregulating expression of pro-metastatic targets. Mechanistically, p53R175H-mediated bidirectional regulation of BACH1 function is dependent on its ability to recruit the histone demethylase LSD2 to target promoters and differentially modulate transcription. These data demonstrate that BACH1 acts as a unique partner for p53R175H in executing its specific GOFs and suggest that different p53 mutants induce their GOFs through distinct mechanisms.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Down-Regulation", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Mutation", "Proteomics", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhenyi", "Last Name": "Su", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jingjie", "Last Name": "Yi", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haiqing", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Systems Biology, and Medical Sciences in Medicine, Zuckerman Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wanwei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiaosi", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hiroki", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiming", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shoufu", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yanqing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Systems Biology, and Medical Sciences in Medicine, Zuckerman Institute Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "Manfredi", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Rustgi", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. wg8@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature cancer", "PubDate": "2023Apr"}, {"PMID": "36933822", "Title": "PrePPI: A Structure Informed Proteome-wide Database of Protein-Protein Interactions.", "Abstract": "We present an updated version of the Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions (PrePPI) webserver which predicts PPIs on a proteome-wide scale.

Sequence- and structural similarity-based metrics are established between template proteins, T, in the Protein Data Bank that bind compounds, C, and query proteins in the model database, Q. When the metrics exceed threshold values, it is assumed that C also binds to Q with a likelihood ratio (LR) derived from machine learning. If the relationship is based on structural similarity, the LR is based on a scoring function that measures the extent to which C is compatible with the binding site of Q as described in the LT-scanner algorithm. For every predicted complex derived in this way, chemical similarity based on the Tanimoto coefficient identifies other small molecules that may bind to Q. An overall LR for the binding of C to Q is obtained from Naive Bayesian statistics. The PrePCI database can be queried by entering a UniProt ID or gene name for a protein to obtain a list of compounds predicted to bind to it along with associated LRs.

The simulations reveal that the formation of long zippers is an implicit feature of cPcdh structure and is driven by their cis and trans interactions that have been quantitatively characterized in previous work. Moreover, in agreement with cryo-electron tomography studies, the zippers are found to organize into two-dimensional arrays even in the absence of attractive interactions between individual zippers.

Here, we analyze how these CCC-associated proteins (CAPs) integrate into cadherin clusters and how they affect the clustering process. Using a cross-linking approach coupled with mass spectrometry, we found that the majority of CAPs, including the force-sensing protein vinculin, interact with CCCs outside of AJs. Accordingly, structural modeling shows that there is not enough space for CAPs the size of vinculin to integrate into E clusters. Using two CAPs, scribble and erbin, as examples, we provide evidence that these proteins form separate clusters, which we term \"C clusters.\" As proof of principle, we show, by using cadherin ectodomain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), that mAb-bound E-cadherin forms separate clusters that undergo trans interactions. Taken together, our data suggest that, in addition to its role in cell-cell adhesion, CAP-driven CCC clustering serves to organize cytoplasmic proteins into distinct domains that may synchronize signaling networks of neighboring cells within tissues.", "Keywords": ["adherens junctions", "cadherin", "cadherin-associated proteins", "catenins", "protein sorting"], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adherens Junctions", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Cadherins", "Catenins", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Line", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Transport", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Regina B", "Last Name": "Troyanovsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611."}, {"First Name": "Alina P", "Last Name": "Sergeeva", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Indrajyoti", "Last Name": "Indra", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611."}, {"First Name": "Chi-Shuo", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611."}, {"First Name": "Rei", "Last Name": "Kato", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032; bh6@columbia.edu s-troyanovsky@northwestern.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sergey M", "Last Name": "Troyanovsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611; bh6@columbia.edu s-troyanovsky@northwestern.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2021Jul20"}, {"PMID": "34166612", "Title": "Dimerization of Cadherin-11 involves multi-site coupled unfolding and strand swapping.", "Abstract": "Cadherin extracellular domain 1 (EC1) mediates homophilic dimerization in adherens junctions.

Although most cases of DCM are classified as sporadic, 20-30% of cases show a heritable pattern. Familial forms of DCM are genetically heterogeneous, and mutations in several genes have been identified that most commonly play a role in cytoskeleton and sarcomere-associated processes. Still, a large number of familial cases remain unsolved. Here, we report five individuals from three independent families who presented with severe dilated cardiomyopathy during the neonatal period. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified causative, compound heterozygous missense variants in RPL3L (ribosomal protein L3-like) in all the affected individuals. The identified variants co-segregated with the disease in each of the three families and were absent or very rare in the human population, in line with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. They are located within the conserved RPL3 domain of the protein and were classified as deleterious by several in silico prediction software applications. RPL3L is one of the four non-canonical riboprotein genes and it encodes the 60S ribosomal protein L3-like protein that is highly expressed only in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Three-dimensional homology modeling and in silico analysis of the affected residues in RPL3L indicate that the identified changes specifically alter the interaction of RPL3L with the RNA components of the 60S ribosomal subunit and thus destabilize its binding to the 60S subunit. In conclusion, we report that bi-allelic pathogenic variants in RPL3L are causative of an early-onset, severe neonatal form of dilated cardiomyopathy, and we show for the first time that cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of non-syndromic cardiomyopathies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated", "Exome", "Female", "Heart", "Humans",

These processes facilitate dendritic arborization2,3, prevent formation of autapses4 and allow free interaction among non-self neurons1,2,4,5. Avoidance among self neurites is mediated by stochastic cell-surface expression of combinations of about 60 isoforms of \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-clustered protocadherin that provide mammalian neurons with single-cell identities1,2,4-13. Avoidance is observed between neurons that express identical protocadherin repertoires2,5, and single-isoform differences are sufficient to prevent self-recognition10. Protocadherins form isoform-promiscuous cis dimers and isoform-specific homophilic trans dimers10,14-20. Although these interactions have previously been characterized in isolation15,17-20, structures of full-length protocadherin ectodomains have not been determined, and how these two interfaces engage in self-recognition between neuronal surfaces remains unknown. Here we determine the molecular arrangement of full-length clustered protocadherin ectodomains in single-isoform self-recognition complexes, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron tomography. We determine the crystal structure of the clustered protocadherin \u03b3B4 ectodomain, which reveals a zipper-like lattice that is formed by alternating cis and trans interactions. Using cryo-electron tomography, we show that clustered protocadherin \u03b3B6 ectodomains tethered to liposomes spontaneously assemble into linear arrays at membrane contact sites, in a configuration that is consistent with the assembly observed in the crystal structure. These linear assemblies pack against each other as parallel arrays to form larger two-dimensional structures between membranes. Our results suggest that the formation of ordered linear assemblies by clustered protocadherins represents the initial self-recognition step in neuronal avoidance, and thus provide support for the isoform-mismatch chain-termination model of protocadherin-mediated self-recognition, which depends on these linear chains11.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Liposomes", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Neurons", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization", "Protocadherins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kerry M", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alex J", "Last Name": "Noble", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Micah", "Last Name": "Rapp", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seetha", "Last Name": "Mannepalli", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Venkata P", "Last Name": "Dandey", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tristan", "Last Name": "Bepler", "Affiliation": "Computational and Systems Biology, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bonnie", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clinton S", "Last Name": "Potter", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bridget", "Last Name": "Carragher", "Affiliation": "Simons Electron Microscopy Center, New York Structural Biology Center, The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. bh6@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind, Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. lss8@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2019May"}, {"PMID": "30467080", "Title": "Neuron-Subtype-Specific Expression, Interaction Affinities, and Specificity Determinants of DIP/Dpr Cell Recognition Proteins.", "Abstract": "Binding between DIP and Dpr neuronal recognition proteins has been proposed to regulate synaptic connections between lamina and medulla neurons in the Drosophila visual system.

Together, these observations suggest that intrinsic differences in DNA shape provide a robust mechanism for modulating affinity without affecting other protein-DNA interactions.", "Keywords": ["DNA binding specificity", "DNA shape", "Extradenticle", "Hox proteins", "Pbx", "abdominal B", "cooperative binding", "homeodomain", "low-affinity binding sites"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "DNA", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Zeiske", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nithya", "Last Name": "Baburajendran", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Kaczynska", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arthur G", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Mortimer B.

However, it remains a challenge to find cancer-related gene regulatory network because of insufficient sample sizes and complex regulatory mechanisms in which gene is influenced by not only other genes but also other biological factors.

In this paper, we propose an approach, which use biweight midcorrelation to measure the correlation between factors and make use of nonconvex penalty based sparse regression for gene regulatory network inference (BMNPGRN). BMNCGRN incorporates multi-omics data (including DNA methylation and copy number variation) and their interactions in gene regulatory network model. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that BMNPGRN outperforms popular and state-of-the-art methods (including DCGRN, ARACNE and CLR) under false positive control.

To probe this biophysical effect directly, rather than using minor-groove width as an indirect measure for shape readout, we developed a methodology, DNAphi, for predicting EP in the minor groove and confirmed the direct role of EP in protein-DNA binding using massive sequencing data.

These O-Man glycans do not appear to be elongated like O-Man glycans found on \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG), and we recently demonstrated that initiation of cdh/protocadherin (pcdh) O-Man glycosylation is not dependent on the evolutionary conserved POMT1/POMT2 enzymes that initiate O-Man glycosylation on \u03b1-DG. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 genetic dissection strategy combined with sensitive and quantitative O-Man glycoproteomics to identify a homologous family of four putative protein O-mannosyltransferases encoded by the TMTC1-4 genes, which were found to be imperative for cdh and pcdh O-Man glycosylation. KO of all four TMTC genes in HEK293 cells resulted in specific loss of cdh and pcdh O-Man glycosylation, whereas combined KO of TMTC1 and TMTC3 resulted in selective loss of O-Man glycans on specific \u03b2-strands of EC domains, suggesting that each isoenzyme serves a different function. In addition, O-Man glycosylation of IPT/TIG domains of plexins and hepatocyte growth factor receptor was not affected in TMTC KO cells, suggesting the existence of yet another O-Man glycosylation machinery.

The potential post translational modification is composed of the center sites and the adjacent amino acid residues which are fundamental protein sequence residues. It can be helpful to perform their biological functions and contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms that are the foundations of protein design and drug design. The existing algorithms of predicting modified sites often have some shortcomings, such as lower stability and accuracy. In this paper, a combination of physical, chemical, statistical, and biological properties of a protein have been ulitized as the features, and a novel framework is proposed to predict a protein's post translational modification sites. The multi-layer neural network and support vector machine are invoked to predict the potential modified sites with the selected features that include the compositions of amino acid residues, the E-H description of protein segments, and several properties from the AAIndex database. Being aware of the possible redundant information, the feature selection is proposed in the propocessing step in this research.

We recently discovered that the cadherin superfamily carries O-linked mannose (O-Man) glycans at highly conserved residues in specific extracellular cadherin domains, and it was suggested that the function of E-cadherin was dependent on the O-Man glycans. Deficiencies in enzymes catalyzing O-Man biosynthesis, including the two human protein O-mannosyltransferases, POMT1 and POMT2, underlie a subgroup of congenital muscular dystrophies designated \u03b1-dystroglycanopathies, because deficient O-Man glycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan disrupts laminin interaction with \u03b1-dystroglycan and the extracellular matrix. To explore the functions of O-Man glycans on cadherins and protocadherins, we used a combinatorial gene-editing strategy in multiple cell lines to evaluate the role of the two POMTs initiating O-Man glycosylation and the major enzyme elongating O-Man glycans, the protein O-mannose \u03b2-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, POMGnT1. Surprisingly, O-mannosylation of cadherins and protocadherins does not require POMT1 and/or POMT2 in contrast to \u03b1-dystroglycan, and moreover, the O-Man glycans on cadherins are not elongated. Thus, the classical and evolutionarily conserved POMT O-mannosylation pathway is essentially dedicated to \u03b1-dystroglycan and a few other proteins, whereas a novel O-mannosylation process in mammalian cells is predicted to serve the large cadherin superfamily and other proteins.", "Keywords": ["cadherin", "dystroglycan", "glycomics", "glycosylation", "proteomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion Molecules", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Dystroglycans", "Glycosylation", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mannosyltransferases", "Nerve Tissue Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ida Signe Bohse", "Last Name": "Larsen", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Yoshiki", "Last Name": "Narimatsu", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Hiren Jitendra", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Zhang", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Oliver J", "Last Name": "Harrison", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Brasch", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics."}, {"First Name": "Sergey Y", "Last Name": "Vakhrushev", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Henrik", "Last Name": "Clausen", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and."}, {"First Name": "Adnan", "Last Name": "Halim", "Affiliation": "From the Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark, and halim@sund.ku.dk."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2017Jul07"}, {"PMID": "28121514", "Title": "Genetic Drivers of Kidney Defects in the DiGeorge Syndrome.", "Abstract": "The DiGeorge syndrome, the most common of the microdeletion syndromes, affects multiple organs, including the heart, the nervous system, and the kidney.

However, despite substantial efforts, no generally applicable computational method has been described. Here, we describe a systematic free energy perturbation (FEP) protocol and calculate the binding affinities between the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 and three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of the VRC01 class. The protocol has been adapted from successful studies of small molecules to address the challenges associated with modeling protein-protein interactions. Specifically, we built homology models of the three antibody-gp120 complexes, extended the sampling times for large bulky residues, incorporated the modeling of glycans on the surface of gp120, and utilized continuum solvent-based loop prediction protocols to improve sampling. We present three experimental surface plasmon resonance data sets, in which antibody residues in the antibody/gp120 interface were systematically mutated to alanine. The RMS error in the large set (55 total cases) of FEP tests as compared to these experiments, 0.68kcal/mol, is near experimental accuracy, and it compares favorably with the results obtained from a simpler, empirical methodology. The correlation coefficient for the combined data set including residues with glycan contacts, R2=0.49, should be sufficient to guide the choice of residues for antibody optimization projects, assuming that this level of accuracy can be realized in prospective prediction. More generally, these results are encouraging with regard to the possibility of using an FEP approach to calculate the magnitude of protein-protein binding affinities.", "Keywords": ["alchemical FEP", "binding affinity optimization", "computational chemistry", "physics-based models", "protein structure prediction"], "MeSH terms": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Computational Biology", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "Protein Binding", "Surface Plasmon Resonance", "Thermodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anthony J", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tatyana", "Last Name": "Gindin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th St, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Baoshan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lingle", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger Inc., 120 W 45th Street, New York, NY 10036, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Abel", "Affiliation": "Schrodinger Inc., 120 W 45th Street, New York, NY 10036, USA."}, {"First Name": "Colleen S", "Last Name": "Murret", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina J", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tongqing", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, 701 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence", "Last Name": "Shapiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Columbia University Medical Center, 701 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA; Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, 40 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Department of Systems Biology, Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, 1130 Street Nicholas Avenue, Room 815, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friesner", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, MC 3178, New York, NY 10027, USA.

Because mTOR signaling is required for initiation of messenger RNA translation, we hypothesized that cotargeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. We found that a novel PI3K \u03b4 isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc-dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 \u03b5 (CK1\u03b5). Targeting CK1\u03b5 using a selective chemical inhibitor or short hairpin RNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3K\u03b4/CK1\u03b5 inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib.

Acetylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of p53 (also known as TP53) was an early example of non-histone protein acetylation and its precise role remains unclear. Lysine acetylation often creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing 'reader' proteins. Here we use a proteomic screen to identify the oncoprotein SET as a major cellular factor whose binding with p53 is dependent on CTD acetylation status. SET profoundly inhibits p53 transcriptional activity in unstressed cells, but SET-mediated repression is abolished by stress-induced acetylation of p53 CTD. Moreover, loss of the interaction with SET activates p53, resulting in tumour regression in mouse xenograft models. Notably, the acidic domain of SET acts as a 'reader' for the unacetylated CTD of p53 and this mechanism of acetylation-dependent regulation is widespread in nature. For example, acetylation of p53 also modulates its interactions with similar acidic domains found in other p53 regulators including VPRBP (also known as DCAF1), DAXX and PELP1 (refs. 7, 8, 9), and computational analysis of the proteome has identified numerous proteins with the potential to serve as acidic domain readers and lysine-rich ligands. Unlike bromodomain readers, which preferentially bind the acetylated forms of their cognate ligands, the acidic domain readers specifically recognize the unacetylated forms of their ligands. Finally, the acetylation-dependent regulation of p53 was further validated in vivo by using a knock-in mouse model expressing an acetylation-mimicking form of p53. These results reveal that acidic-domain-containing factors act as a class of acetylation-dependent regulators by targeting p53 and, potentially, other proteins.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Female", "Histone Chaperones", "Histones", "Humans", "Ligands", "Mice", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Repressor Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53", "p300-CBP Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Donglai", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gorka", "Last Name": "Lasso", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Systems Biology, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Le", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wenchuan", "Last Name": "Leng", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, National Center for Protein Sciences (The PHOENIX Center, Beijing), Beijing, 102206, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei-Guo", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shenzhen University School of Medicine, Shenzhen 518060, China."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, National Center for Protein Sciences (The PHOENIX Center, Beijing), Beijing, 102206, China."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Systems Biology, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, 1130 Nicholas Ave, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2016Oct06"}, {"PMID": "27334919", "Title": "Lipids Regulate Lck Protein Activity through Their Interactions with the Lck Src Homology 2 Domain.", "Abstract": "Lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (Lck) plays an essential role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and T cell development, but its activation mechanism is not fully understood.

Mutation of these residues, along with trans-interacting partner residues, altered the specificities of Pcdh interactions. Together, these data show how sequence variation among Pcdh isoforms encodes their diverse strict homophilic recognition specificities, which are required for their key roles in neural circuit assembly.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Cadherins", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Protein Binding", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein Isoforms"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kerry Marie", "Last Name": "Goodman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rotem", "Last Name": "Rubinstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chan Aye", "Last Name": "Thu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabiana", "Last Name": "Bahna", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seetha", "Last Name": "Mannepalli", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "G\u00f6ran", "Last Name": "Ahls\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chelsea", "Last Name": "Rittenhouse", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Maniatis", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Zuckerman Mind Brain and Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

While some favor the concept of facultative progenitors involved in homeostasis and repair, neither a location nor markers for such cells have been defined. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) labels a rare population of long-lived, quiescent pancreatic cells. In vitro, Dclk1+ cells proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic inflammation. Accordingly, their loss has detrimental effects after cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Expression of mutant Kras in Dclk1+ cells does not affect their quiescence or longevity. However, experimental pancreatitis converts Kras mutant Dclk1+ cells into potent cancer-initiating cells. As a potential effector of Kras, Dclk1 contributes functionally to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these observations indicate that Dclk1 marks quiescent pancreatic progenitors that are candidates for the origin of pancreatic cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cell Proliferation", "Doublecortin-Like Kinases", "Mice", "Organoids", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pancreatitis", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Tamoxifen"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "C Benedikt", "Last Name": "Westphalen", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Hospital of the University of Munich D-81377, Munich, Germany;

GTP-bound Rac1 then activates its downstream effectors, including p21-activated kinases (PAKs). PREX2 and Rac1 are frequently mutated in cancer and have key roles within the insulin-signaling pathway. Rac1 can be inactivated by multiple mechanisms; however, negative regulation by insulin is not well understood. Here, we show that in response to being activated after insulin stimulation, Rac1 initiates its own inactivation by decreasing PREX2 GEF activity. Following PREX2-mediated activation of Rac1 by the second messengers PIP3 or G\u03b2\u03b3, we found that PREX2 was phosphorylated through a PAK-dependent mechanism. PAK-mediated phosphorylation of PREX2 reduced GEF activity toward Rac1 by inhibiting PREX2 binding to PIP3 and G\u03b2\u03b3. Cell fractionation experiments also revealed that phosphorylation prevented PREX2 from localizing to the cellular membrane. Furthermore, the onset of insulin-induced phosphorylation of PREX2 was delayed compared with AKT. Altogether, we propose that second messengers activate the Rac1 signal, which sets in motion a cascade whereby PAKs phosphorylate and negatively regulate PREX2 to decrease Rac1 activation. This type of regulation would allow for transient activation of the PREX2-Rac1 signal and may be relevant in multiple physiological processes, including diseases such as diabetes and cancer when insulin signaling is chronically activated.", "Keywords": ["G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)", "Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent RAC exchanger 2 (PREX2)", "Rac (Rac GTPase)", "guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)", "insulin", "phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)", "serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK 1 (PAK1)", "signal transduction"], "MeSH terms": ["Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Phosphorylation", "Second Messenger Systems", "p21-Activated Kinases", "rac1 GTP-Binding Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Douglas", "Last Name": "Barrows", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029, the Department of Pharmacology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Sarah M", "Last Name": "Schoenfeld", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Cindy", "Last Name": "Hodakoski", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029."}, {"First Name": "Antonina", "Last Name": "Silkov", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Couvillon", "Affiliation": "Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts 01923."}, {"First Name": "Aliaksei", "Last Name": "Shymanets", "Affiliation": "the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapy, Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Eberhard Karls University Hospitals and Clinics, and Interfaculty Center of Pharmacogenomics and Pharmaceutical Research, University of T\u00fcbingen, 72074 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Bernd", "Last Name": "N\u00fcrnberg", "Affiliation": "the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapy, Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Eberhard Karls University Hospitals and Clinics, and Interfaculty Center of Pharmacogenomics and Pharmaceutical Research, University of T\u00fcbingen, 72074 T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Asara", "Affiliation": "the Division of Signal Transduction, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, and the Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115."}, {"First Name": "Ramon", "Last Name": "Parsons", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029, ramon.parsons@mssm.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "PubDate": "2015Nov27"}, {"PMID": "26290581", "Title": "E-cadherin junction formation involves an active kinetic nucleation process.", "Abstract": "Epithelial (E)-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions play important roles in the development and maintenance of tissue structure in multicellular organisms.

All known preferred TF DNA-binding sites obtained from the B1H, DNase I and SELEX methodologies are presented. DNA shape parameters predicted for these sites are obtained from a high throughput server or from crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes where available. An important feature of the database is that all DNA-binding domains and their binding sites are fully annotated in a eukaryote using structural criteria and evolutionary homology. OnTheFly thus provides a comprehensive view of TFs and their binding sites that will be a valuable resource for deciphering non-coding regulatory DNA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "DNA", "Databases, Genetic", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Internet", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Protein Conformation", "Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional", "Software", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shula", "Last Name": "Shazman", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Department of Systems Biology, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, 1130 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA, Department of Life Science, Open University of Israel, Ra'anana 43107, Israel and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, 701 West 168th Street, HHSC 1104, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hunjoong", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yakov", "Last Name": "Socol", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard S", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nucleic acids research", "PubDate": "2014Jan"}, {"PMID": "24067646", "Title": "Mechanism of E-cadherin dimerization probed by NMR relaxation dispersion.", "Abstract": "Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), a member of the classical cadherin family, mediates calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Crystal structures of classical cadherins reveal an adhesive dimer interface featuring reciprocal exchange of N-terminal \u03b2-strands between two protomers. Previous work has identified a putative intermediate (called the \"X-dimer\") in the dimerization pathway of wild-type E-cadherin EC1-EC2 domains, based on crystal structures of mutants not capable of strand swapping and on deceleration of binding kinetics by mutations at the X-dimer interface. In the present work, NMR relaxation dispersion spectroscopy is used to directly observe and characterize intermediate states without the need to disrupt the strand-swapped binding interface by mutagenesis. The results indicate that E-cadherin forms strand-swapped dimers predominantly by a mechanism in which formation of a weak and short-lived X-dimer-like state precedes the conformational changes required for formation of the mature strand-swapped dimeric structure. Disruption of this intermediate state through mutation reduces both association and dissociation rates by factors of ~10(4), while minimally perturbing affinity. The X-dimer interface lowers the energy barrier associated with strand swapping and enables E-cadherins to form strand-swapped dimers at a rate consistent with residence times in adherens junctions.", "Keywords": ["binding mechanism", "domain swapping", "protein-protein interaction"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cadherins", "Cell Adhesion", "Dimerization", "Fluorescence", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Mice", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Edward S.

Both processes are mediated by the binding of extracellular subdomains whose range of motion in the 2D environment is reduced upon dimerization, defining a thin reaction shell where dimer formation and dissociation take place. We show that the ratio between the 2D and 3D equilibrium constants can be expressed as a product of individual factors describing, respectively, the spatial ranges of motions of the adhesive domains, and their rotational freedom within the reaction shell. The results predicted by the theory are compared to those obtained from a novel, to our knowledge, dynamical simulations methodology, whereby pairs of receptors perform realistic translational, internal, and rotational motions in 2D and 3D. We use cadherins as our model system. The theory and simulations explain how the strength of cis and trans interactions of adhesive receptors are affected both by their presence in the constrained intermembrane space and by the 2D environment of membrane surfaces.

The overall approach depends on extensive use of homology modeling, the exploitation of a wide range of global and local geometric relationships between protein structures and the use of machine learning techniques. The combination of modeling with broad searches of protein structure space defines a \"structural BLAST\" approach to infer function with high genomic coverage. Applications are described to the prediction of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In the context of protein-protein interactions, our structure-based prediction algorithm, PrePPI, has comparable accuracy to high-throughput experiments. An essential feature of PrePPI involves the use of Bayesian methods to combine structure-derived information with non-structural evidence (e.g. co-expression) to assign a likelihood for each predicted interaction. This, combined with a structural BLAST approach significantly expands the range of applications of protein structure in the annotation of protein function, including systems level biological applications where it has previously played little role.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence", "Bayes Theorem", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Proteins", "Proteomics", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fabian", "Last Name": "Dey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and Initiative in Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qiangfeng", "Last Name": "Cliff Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Petrey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barry", "Last Name": "Honig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23193263", "Title": "PrePPI: a structure-informed database of protein-protein interactions.", "Abstract": "PrePPI (http://bhapp.c2b2.columbia.edu/PrePPI) is a database that combines predicted and experimentally determined protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using a Bayesian framework.
