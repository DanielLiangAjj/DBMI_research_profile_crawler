[{"PMID": "38781318", "Title": "Physiologically Based Trimester-Specific Serum Ferritin Thresholds for Iron Deficiency in US Pregnant Women.", "Abstract": "Serum ferritin (SF) concentration is the most widely used indicator for iron deficiency (ID). During pregnancy, the World Health Organization recently recommended SF thresholds for ID of <15 \u00b5g/L for the 1st trimester of pregnancy, based on expert opinion, and made no recommendations for the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. We examined the relationship of SF with two independent indicators of the onset of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, hemoglobin (Hb) and soluble transferrin receptor 1 (sTfR1), in cross-sectional data from NHANES for 1999-2010 and 2015-2018. We included 1288 pregnant women 15-49 years and excluded women with inflammation or potential liver disease. We used restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression analysis to determine SF thresholds for iron-deficient erythropoiesis. SF decreased during pregnancy; geometric mean SF was higher during the 1st and lower during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Using RCS analysis, the SF thresholds identified during pregnancy were <25.8 (18.1, 28.5) \u00b5g/L during 1st trimester, <18.3 (16.3, 22.9) \u00b5g/L during 2nd trimester, and <19.0 (14.4, 26.1) \u00b5g/L during 3rd trimester. These SF threshold levels track concentrations of hepcidin, the iron regulatory hormone controlling the mobilization of iron stores. A SF concentration of <15 \u00b5g/L as the criterion for ID may underestimate the true prevalence of ID throughout pregnancy. In our study, an additional one of every ten pregnant women would be recognized as iron deficient by using the physiologically based thresholds at SF of about 25 \u00b5g/L during the 1st and of about 20 \u00b5g/L during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zuguo", "Last Name": "Mei", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yaw", "Last Name": "Addo", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maria Elena D", "Last Name": "Jefferds", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rafael", "Last Name": "Flores-Ayala", "Affiliation": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gary M", "Last Name": "Brittenham", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York, New York, United States."}], "Journal": "Blood advances", "PubDate": "2024May23"}, {"PMID": "38302093", "Title": "Stable iron (58Fe) isotopic measurements in Kenyan toddlers during 3\u2009months of iron supplementation demonstrate that half of the iron absorbed is lost.", "Abstract": "Increased iron loss may reduce the effectiveness of iron supplementation. The objective of this study was to determine if daily oral iron supplementation increases iron loss, measured using a stable isotope of iron (58Fe). We enrolled and dewormed 24 iron-depleted Kenyan children, 24-27\u2009months of age, whose body iron was enriched and equilibrated with 58Fe given at least 1\u2009year earlier. Over 3\u2009months of supplementation (6\u2009mg iron/kg body weight [BW]/day), mean (\u00b1SD) iron absorption was 1.10 (\u00b10.28)\u2009mg/day. During supplementation, 0.55 (\u00b10.36) mg iron/day was lost, equal to half of the amount of absorbed iron. Supplementation did not increase faecal haem/porphyrin or biomarkers of enterocyte damage and gut or systemic inflammation. Using individual patient data, we examined iron dose, absorption and loss among all available long-term iron isotopic studies of supplementation. Expressed in terms of body weight, daily iron loss was correlated significantly with iron absorption (Pearson's r\u2009=\u20090.66 [95% confidence interval 0.48-0.78]) but not with iron dose (r\u2009=\u20090.16 [95% CI -0.10-0.40]).

We describe important advances in understanding common causes of anemia and their interactions, including iron deficiency (ID), lack of other micronutrients, infection, inflammation, and genetic conditions. ID develops if the iron circulating in the blood cannot provide the amounts required for red blood cell production and tissue needs. ID anemia develops as iron-limited red blood cell production fails to maintain the hemoglobin concentration above the threshold used to define anemia. Globally, absolute ID (absent or reduced body iron stores that do not meet the need for iron of an individual but may respond to iron supplementation) contributes to only a limited proportion of anemia. Functional ID (adequate or increased iron stores that cannot meet the need for iron because of the effects of infection or inflammation and does not respond to iron supplementation) is frequently responsible for anemia in low- and middle-income countries. Absolute and functional ID may coexist. We highlight continued improvement in understanding the roles of infections and inflammation in causing a large proportion of anemia. Deficiencies of nutrients other than iron are less common but important in some settings. The importance of genetic conditions as causes of anemia depends upon the specific inherited red blood cell abnormalities and their prevalence in the settings examined. From a public health perspective, each setting has a distinctive composition of components underlying the common causes of anemia. We emphasize the coincidence between regions with a high prevalence of anemia attributed to ID (both absolute and functional), those with endemic infections, and those with widespread genetic conditions affecting red blood cells, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and regions in Asia and Oceania.", "Keywords": ["absolute iron deficiency", "anemia", "functional iron deficiency", "hemoglobinopathies", "infection", "inflammation", "iron", "iron deficiency", "micronutrients", "thalassemia"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Public Health", "Anemia", "Iron", "Anemia, Iron-Deficiency", "Iron Deficiencies", "Inflammation", "Biology", "Prevalence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gary M", "Last Name": "Brittenham", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.

noninvasive evaluation of liver fibrosis, we investigated the differential sensitivities of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2 * mapping using corrections for the effects of liver iron. Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. While collagen increases R2 * relaxation, measures of R2 * for fibrosis are confounded by liver iron, which may be present in the liver over a wide range of concentrations. The diamagnetic collagen contribution to susceptibility values measured by QSM is much less than the contribution of highly paramagnetic iron. In 19 ex vivo liver explants with and without fibrosis, QSM (\u03c7), R2 * and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) maps were constructed from multiecho gradient-recalled echo (mGRE) sequence acquisition at 3 T. Median parameter values were recorded and differences between the MRI parameters in nonfibrotic vs. advanced fibrotic/cirrhotic samples were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U tests and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Logistic regression with stepwise feature selection was employed to evaluate the utility of combined MRI measurements for detection of fibrosis. Median R2 * increased in fibrotic vs. nonfibrotic liver samples (P = .041), while differences in \u03c7 and PDFF were nonsignificant (P = .545 and P = .395, respectively). Logistic regression identified the combination of \u03c7 and R2 * significant for fibrosis detection (logit [prediction] = -8.45 + 0.23 R2 * - 28.8 \u03c7). For this classifier, a highly significant difference between nonfibrotic vs. advanced fibrotic/cirrhotic samples was observed (P = .002). The model exhibited an AUC of 0.909 (P = .003) for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, which was substantially higher compared with AUCs of the individual parameters (AUC 0.591-0.784).

Anaemic Gambian toddlers were given 2\u00a0mg 57 Fe orally to equilibrate with total body iron over 8-11\u00a0months. After assignment to the positive control arm of the HIGH study, 22\u00a0toddlers consumed a micronutrient powder containing 12\u00a0mg iron for 12\u00a0weeks followed by 12\u00a0weeks without iron supplementation.

Consequently, iron absorption from supplements is highest if iron is given on alternate days. Whether this dosing schedule is also beneficial in women with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) given high-dose iron supplements is uncertain. The primary objective of this study was to assess whether, in women with IDA, alternate-day administration of 100 and 200 mg iron increases iron absorption compared to consecutive-day iron administration. Secondary objectives were to correlate iron absorption with SHep and iron status parameters. We performed a cross-over iron absorption study in women with IDA (n=19; median hemoglobin 11.5 mg/dL; mean serum ferritin 10 mg/L) who received either 100 or 200 mg iron as ferrous sulfate given at 8 AM on days 2, 3 and 5 labeled with stable iron isotopes 57Fe, 58Fe and 54Fe; after a 16-day incorporation period, the other labeled dose was given at 8 AM on days 23, 24 and 26 (days 2, 3 and 5 of the second period). Iron absorption on days 2 and 3 (consecutive) and day 5 (alternate) was assessed by measuring erythrocyte isotope incorporation. For both doses, SHep was higher on day 3 than on day 2 (P<0.001) or day 5 (P<0.01) with no significant difference between days 2 and 5. Similarly, for both doses, fractional iron absorption (FIA) on days 2 and 5 was 40-50% higher than on day 3 (P<0.001), while absorption on day 2 did not differ significantly from day 5. There was no significant difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects comparing the two iron doses (P=0.105). Alternate day dosing of oral iron supplements in anemic women may be preferable because it sharply increases FIA. If needed, to provide the same total amount of iron with alternate day dosing, twice the daily target dose should be given on alternate days, as total iron absorption from a single dose of 200 mg given on alternate days was approximately twice that from 100 mg given on consecutive days (P<0.001). In IDA, even if hepatic hepcidin expression is strongly suppressed by iron deficiency and erythropoietic drive, the intake of oral iron supplements leads to an acute hepcidin increase for 24 hours.

However, a clear distinction is made between the relative strengths of biomarkers to assess hematological consequences of iron deficiency versus other putative functional outcomes, particularly the relationship between maternal and fetal iron status during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and infant cognitive, motor and emotional development. The I-EP also highlighted the importance of considering the confounding effects of inflammation and infection on the interpretation of iron biomarker results, as well as the impact of life stage.

Vitamin D has anti-infective and immunomodulatory effects that may decrease the risk for respiratory infections, asthma, and acute chest syndrome. We conducted a randomized double-blind active-controlled clinical trial to determine whether monthly oral vitamin D3 can reduce the rate of respiratory events in children with sickle cell disease. Seventy sickle cell subjects, ages 3-20 years, with baseline records of respiratory events over 1 year before randomization, underwent screening. Sixty-two subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 5-60 ng/mL were randomly assigned to oral vitamin D3 (100\u2009000 IU or 12\u2009000 IU, n = 31 each) under observed administration once monthly for 2 years. The primary outcome was the annual rate of respiratory events (respiratory infection, asthma exacerbation, or acute chest syndrome) ascertained by the use of a validated questionnaire administered biweekly. Analysis included 62 children (mean age of 9.9 years, 52% female, and predominantly with homozygous HbS disease [87%]) with mean baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 14.3 ng/mL.

The objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Hb, MCV, and EP measurements in screening for ID in preschool children, non-pregnant women 15-49 years of age, and pregnant women. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) (NHANES 2003-2006: n = 861, children three to five years of age; n = 3112, non-pregnant women 15 to 49 years of age.

ID was defined as total body iron stores <0 mg/kg body weight, calculated from the ratio of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) to serum ferritin (SF). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of Hb, MCV, and EP measurements in screening for ID. In detecting ID in children three to five years of age, EP (Area under the Curve (AUC) 0.80) was superior to Hb (AUC 0.62) (p < 0.01) but not statistically different from MCV (AUC 0.73). In women, EP and Hb were comparable (non-pregnant AUC 0.86 and 0.84, respectively; pregnant 0.77 and 0.74, respectively), and both were better than MCV (non-pregnant AUC 0.80; pregnant 0.70) (p < 0.01). We concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of EP in screening for ID were consistently superior to or at least as effective as those of Hb and MCV in each population examined. For children three to five years of age, EP screening for ID was significantly better than Hb and similar to MCV.

In brief, QSM can be generated with postprocessing whenever gradient echo MRI is performed. QSM can be useful for diseases that involve neurodegeneration, inflammation, hemorrhage, abnormal oxygen consumption, substantial alterations in highly paramagnetic cellular iron, bone mineralization, or pathologic calcification; and for all disorders in which MRI diagnosis or surveillance requires contrast agent injection. Clinicians may consider integrating QSM into their routine imaging practices by including gradient echo sequences in all relevant MRI protocols.", "Keywords": ["biometals", "quantitative susceptibility mapping"], "MeSH terms": ["Artifacts", "Contrast Media", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Metals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pascal", "Last Name": "Spincemaille", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexey", "Last Name": "Dimov", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kofi", "Last Name": "Deh", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianqi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, East China Normal University, Shanghai, P.R.

Serum samples from 60 patients with four different iron-overload disorders in various treatment phases were coded and sent in duplicate for analysis to five different laboratories worldwide.

Overall, highest assay levels were observed for patients with untreated hereditary hemochromatosis and \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia, patients with transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndromes and patients with transfusion-dependent and chelated \u03b2-thalassemia major. Absolute levels differed considerably between assays and were lower for labile plasma iron than for non-transferrin-bound iron. Four assays also reported negative values. Assays were reproducible with high between-sample and low within-sample variation. Assays correlated and correlations were highest within the group of non-transferrin-bound iron assays and within that of labile plasma iron assays. Increased transferrin saturation, but not ferritin, was a good indicator of the presence of forms of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron.

Better understanding of these phenomena might improve oral iron dosing schedules. We investigated whether the acute iron-induced increase in hepcidin influences iron absorption of successive daily iron doses and twice-daily iron doses. We recruited 54 nonanemic young women with plasma ferritin \u226420 \u00b5g/L and conducted: (1) a dose-finding investigation with 40-, 60-, 80-, 160-, and 240-mg labeled Fe as [(57)Fe]-, [(58)Fe]-, or [(54)Fe]-FeSO4 given at 8:00 am fasting on 1 or on 2 consecutive days (study 1, n = 25; study 2, n = 16); and (2) a study giving three 60-mg Fe doses (twice-daily dosing) within 24 hours (study 3, n = 13). In studies 1 and 2, 24 hours after doses \u226560 mg, serum hepcidin was increased (P < .01) and fractional iron absorption was decreased by 35% to 45% (P < .01). With increasing dose, fractional absorption decreased (P < .001), whereas absolute absorption increased (P < .001). A sixfold increase in iron dose (40-240 mg) resulted in only a threefold increase in iron absorbed (6.7-18.1 mg). In study 3, total iron absorbed from 3 doses (2 mornings and an afternoon) was not significantly greater than that from 2 morning doses.

In a prospective, observational study of critically ill children, we examined the effect of RBC storage duration on the extent of hemolysis by comparing laboratory measurements obtained before, and 4 hr after, RBC transfusion (N\u2009=\u2009100) or saline/albumin infusion (N\u2009=\u200920). Transfusion of RBCs stored for longer than 4 weeks significantly increased plasma free hemoglobin (P\u2009<\u20090.05), indirect bilirubin (P\u2009<\u20090.05), serum iron (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and non-transferrin-bound iron (P\u2009<\u20090.01). However, days of storage duration poorly correlated (R(2) <0.10) with all measured indicators of hemolysis and inflammation. These results suggest that, in critically ill children, most effects of RBC storage duration on post-transfusion hemolysis are overwhelmed by recipient and/or donor factors. Nonetheless, we identified a subset of patients (N\u2009=\u200921) with evidence of considerable extravascular hemolysis (i.e., increased indirect bilirubin \u22650.4 mg/dL). In these patients, transfusion-associated hemolysis was accompanied by increases in circulating non-transferrin-bound iron and free hemoglobin and by an acute phase response, as assessed by an increase in median C-reactive protein levels of 21.2 mg/L (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In summary, RBC transfusions were associated with an acute phase response and both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis, which were independent of RBC storage duration.

Two multiple spin-echo (MSE) pulse sequences were implemented with different amounts of stimulated echo contamination. Agarose-based phantoms were constructed that simulate the relaxation and susceptibility properties of tissue with different concentrations of dispersed (ferritin-like) and aggregated (hemosiderin-like) iron. Additionally, myocardial iron was assessed in nine human subjects with transfusion iron overload. These data were used to determine the influence of stimulated echoes on iron measurements made by an MR-based iron quantification model that can separately measure dispersed and aggregated iron. The study found that stimulated echo contamination caused an underestimation of dispersed (ferritin-like) iron and an overestimation of aggregated (hemosiderin-like) iron when applying this model. The relationship between the measurements made with and without stimulated echo appears to be linear. The findings suggest that while it is important to use MSE sequences with minimal stimulated echo in T2-based iron quantification, it appears that data acquired with sub-optimal sequences can be retrospectively corrected using the methodology described here.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Artifacts", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Ferritins", "Hemosiderin", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Iron", "Iron Overload", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "beta-Thalassemia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christina L", "Last Name": "Sammet", "Affiliation": "Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. c-sammet@northwestern.edu"}, {"First Name": "Srirama V", "Last Name": "Swaminathan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Haiying", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sujit", "Last Name": "Sheth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jens H", "Last Name": "Jensen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alvaro", "Last Name": "Nunez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kristi", "Last Name": "Hultman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ed X", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gary M", "Last Name": "Brittenham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Truman R", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}]
