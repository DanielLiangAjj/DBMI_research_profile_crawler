The goal of this conference was to develop an expert consensus-driven working framework for comprehensive genetic evaluation of inherited PCA in the multigene testing era addressing genetic counseling, testing, and genetically informed management. Methods An expert consensus conference was convened including key stakeholders to address genetic counseling and testing, PCA screening, and management informed by evidence review. Results Consensus was strong that patients should engage in shared decision making for genetic testing. There was strong consensus to test HOXB13 for suspected hereditary PCA, BRCA1/2 for suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and DNA mismatch repair genes for suspected Lynch syndrome. There was strong consensus to factor BRCA2 mutations into PCA screening discussions. BRCA2 achieved moderate consensus for factoring into early-stage management discussion, with stronger consensus in high-risk/advanced and metastatic setting. Agreement was moderate to test all men with metastatic castration-resistant PCA, regardless of family history, with stronger agreement to test BRCA1/2 and moderate agreement to test ATM to inform prognosis and targeted therapy. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive, multidisciplinary consensus statement to address a genetic evaluation framework for inherited PCA in the multigene testing era. Future research should focus on developing a working definition of familial PCA for clinical genetic testing, expanding understanding of genetic contribution to aggressive PCA, exploring clinical use of genetic testing for PCA management, genetic testing of African American males, and addressing the value framework of genetic evaluation and testing men at risk for PCA-a clinically heterogeneous disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Clinical Decision-Making", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Heredity", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Veda N", "Last Name": "Giri", "Affiliation": "Veda N.

Organoids generated from CARNs (castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells) or normal prostate epithelia exhibit tissue architecture containing luminal and basal cells, undergo long-term expansion in culture and exhibit functional androgen receptor signalling. Lineage-tracing demonstrates that luminal cells are favoured for organoid formation and generate basal cells in culture. Furthermore, tumour organoids can initiate from CARNs after oncogenic transformation and from mouse models of prostate cancer, and can facilitate analyses of drug response.

Distinguishing the many indolent tumors from the minority of lethal ones remains a major clinical challenge. We now show that low Gleason score prostate tumors can be distinguished as indolent and aggressive subgroups on the basis of their expression of genes associated with aging and senescence. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we identified a 19-gene signature enriched in indolent prostate tumors. We then further classified this signature with a decision tree learning model to identify three genes--FGFR1, PMP22, and CDKN1A--that together accurately predicted outcome of low Gleason score tumors. Validation of this three-gene panel on independent cohorts confirmed its independent prognostic value as well as its ability to improve prognosis with currently used clinical nomograms. Furthermore, protein expression of this three-gene panel in biopsy samples distinguished Gleason 6 patients who failed surveillance over a 10-year period.

In the current study, we have performed preclinical studies to investigate the efficacy of intravesical delivery of chemotherapy for preventing progression of bladder cancer. We evaluated three chemotherapy agents, namely cisplatin, gemcitabine, and docetaxel, which are currently in use clinically for systemic treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer and/or have been evaluated for intravesical therapy. These preclinical studies were done using a genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model that progresses from carcinoma in situ (CIS) to invasive, metastatic bladder cancer. We performed intravesical treatment in this GEM model using cisplatin, gemcitabine, and/or docetaxel, alone or by combining two agents, and evaluated whether such treatments inhibited progression to invasive, metastatic bladder cancer. Of the three single agents tested, gemcitabine was most effective for preventing progression to invasive disease, as assessed by several relevant endpoints. However, the combinations of two agents, and particularly those including gemcitabine, were more effective for reducing both tumor and metastatic burden. Our findings suggest combination intravesical chemotherapy may provide a viable bladder-sparing treatment alternative for patients at high risk for developing invasive bladder cancer, which can be evaluated in appropriate clinical trials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Intravesical", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cycloleucine", "Deoxycytidine", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Docetaxel", "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor", "Female", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Random Allocation", "Taxoids", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Gemcitabine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joan C", "Last Name": "Delto", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Takashi", "Last Name": "Kobayashi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell", "Last Name": "Benson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "McKiernan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Abate-Shen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Oncotarget", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}, {"PMID": "23378162", "Title": "Experience with newer intravesical chemotherapy for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.", "Abstract": "The definitive treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who fail to respond to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is cystectomy. However, many patients who experience recurrence after BCG are either poor operative candidates or refuse surgery due to the long-term impact on their quality of life. In the last decade, there has been an increased interest in alternative intravesical therapies, and several novel chemotherapeutics have emerged as promising agents for high-risk NMIBC patients unable or unwilling to undergo cystectomy. Additionally, extended treatment regimens with combined induction and maintenance therapy have been investigated, and may increase the durability of response to these new agents, as has been shown for conventional intravesical therapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Intravesical", "Antineoplastic Agents", "BCG Vaccine", "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell", "Deoxycytidine", "Docetaxel", "Doxorubicin", "Humans", "Mitomycin", "Paclitaxel", "Taxoids", "Thiotepa", "Treatment Failure", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Gemcitabine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "LaMont J", "Last Name": "Barlow", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Herbert Irving Pavilion, Columbia University Medical Center, 11th Floor 161 Fort Washington Ave., New York, NY 10032, USA. ljb2119@columbia.edu"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell C", "Last Name": "Benson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Current urology reports", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23292697", "Title": "Racial disparities in the use of palliative therapy for ureteral obstruction among elderly patients with advanced prostate cancer.", "Abstract": "Palliative issues are an important but understudied issue for patients with advanced cancer.
