A cost-effective, efficient, self-powered sensor for incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) into the surveillance of riverine ecosystems is lacking. This manuscript introduces a device designed for energy harvesting and sensing through a triboelectric-electromagnetic generator (CX-TEHG). The CX-TEHG is composed of a wind-driven electromagnetic generator (F-EMG), a river-driven electromagnetic generator (W-EMG), a triboelectric nanogenerator for measuring flow velocity (W-TENG), and another triboelectric nanogenerator for gauging the speed of floodwater level rise (F-TENG). It employs planetary gears to achieve a 6-fold increase in speed, facilitating efficient multienergy collection from wind and river currents. CX-TEHG achieves a peak power output of 183 mW and a power density of 373.5 W/m3 under environmental conditions featuring a wind speed of 4 m/s and a flow velocity of 0.5 m/s. This study developed a cost-efficient signal acquisition system and a mechanism for information transmission via a 5G module. Alerts are issued on both upper-level computers and mobile devices for river flow velocities exceeding 2.8 m/s and water levels reaching specified locations; thus, an innovative solution for applying the Internet of Things in riverine ecological monitoring is presented.", "Keywords": ["Internet of Things", "Planetary gear acceleration", "River ecological monitoring", "Self-powered", "Triboelectric nanogenerator"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tianyu", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of CNC Equipment Reliability, Ministry of Education, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jilin University, 130022 Changchun, China."}, {"First Name": "Chenxi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of CNC Equipment Reliability, Ministry of Education, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jilin University, 130022 Changchun, China."}, {"First Name": "Kuankuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of CNC Equipment Reliability, Ministry of Education, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jilin University, 130022 Changchun, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 101400, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of CNC Equipment Reliability, Ministry of Education, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jilin University, 130022 Changchun, China."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of CNC Equipment Reliability, Ministry of Education, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jilin University, 130022 Changchun, China."}, {"First Name": "Fuhai", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of CNC Equipment Reliability, Ministry of Education, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jilin University, 130022 Changchun, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongming", "Last Name": "Yao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of CNC Equipment Reliability, Ministry of Education, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Jilin University, 130022 Changchun, China."}], "Journal": "ACS applied materials & interfaces", "PubDate": "2024Jun24"}, {"PMID": "38913030", "Title": "Layer-By-Layer Designed Spark-Type AuCuPt Alloy with Robust Broadband Absorption to Enhance Sensitivity in Flexible Detection of Estriol by a Lateral Flow Immunoassay.", "Abstract": "Excessive intake of estrogen poses significant health risks to the human body; hence, there is a necessity to develop rapid detection methods to monitor its levels of addition. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), commonly utilized as colorimetric signal labels, find extensive application in lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). However, the detection sensitivity of traditional AuNPs-LFIA is typically constrained by low molar extinction coefficients and reliance on a single signal. Herein, in this work, unique spark-type AuCuPt nanoflowers modified with tannic acid (AuCuPt@TA) were precisely designed by reasonable layer-by-layer element composition and green modification. The obtained AuCuPt displays robust broadband absorption spanning the visible to near-infrared spectrum, showcasing a notable molar extinction coefficient of 2.38 \u00d7 1012 M-1 cm-1 and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 48.5%. Based on this, selecting estriol (E3) as a model analyte, colorimetric/photothermal dual-signal LFIA (CLFIA and PLFIA) was developed. Limits of detection (LOD) of the CLFIA and PLFIA were achieved at 0.033 ng mL-1 and 0.021 ng mL-1, respectively, which represent a 9.3- and 14.6-fold improvement compared to the visual LOD of AuNPs-LFIA. Moreover, the application feasibility of the immunoassay was further evaluated in the milk and pork with satisfactory recoveries ranging from 86.21% to 117.91%. Thus, this work has enhanced the performance of LFIA for E3 detection and exhibited enormous potential for other sensing platform construction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Immunoassay", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Gold", "Estriol", "Alloys", "Animals", "Colorimetry", "Limit of Detection", "Tannins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qiaoying", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuechi", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuanyuan", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Chaoying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Jiaqi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Qingzhe", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Huihui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Marine Ecological Restoration, Shandong Marine Resource and Environment Research Institute, No. 216 Changjiang Road, Economic and Technological Development Zone, Shandong, Yantai 264006, China."}, {"First Name": "Ahmed", "Last Name": "Youssef", "Affiliation": "Environmental Engineering Program, University of Science and Technology, Zewail City, Giza 12578, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}, {"First Name": "Daohong", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China."}], "Journal": "Analytical chemistry", "PubDate": "2024Jul02"}, {"PMID": "38907749", "Title": "Thermal decomposition mechanism of HMX/HTPB hybrid explosives studied by reactive molecular dynamics.", "Abstract": "The thermal decomposition process of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HMX/HTPB) hybrid explosives and pure HMX explosives at different temperatures (2000\u2009~\u20093500 K) was investigated using the reactive molecular dynamics method. This study aimed to analyze the effect of binders on the thermal decomposition of HMX at the atomic scale and reveal the thermal decomposition mechanism of HMX/HTPB. The results showed that the thermal decomposition process of the HMX molecule in the HMX/HTPB hybrid system involves a continuous denitration followed by the disintegration of the main ring. The HTPB chain will experience dehydrogenation, dehydroxylation, and chain fragmentation. Including HTPB in the hybrid system significantly increased the presence of H and OH radicals. These radicals then interacted with HMX and its decomposition products and produced more of the final products H2O and H2 in the HMX/HTPB hybrid system compared to pure HMX. Additionally, it was observed that the HTPB chain fragments attached to the HMX decomposition products prevented the formation of N2 and CO2. Furthermore, the activation energies (Ea) of the initial and intermediate decomposition stages of the HMX/HTPB hybrid system were 98.45 kJ\u00a0mol-1 and 90.69 kJ\u00a0mol-1, respectively.

Dark fermentation is a potential technology to treat antibiotic fermentation residue in terms of renewable H2 generation and waste management. However, the inherent antibiotic in antibiotic fermentation residue may inhibit its dark fermentation performance, and current understanding on this topic is limited. This investigation examined the impact of the inherent antibiotic on the dark H2 fermentation of Cephalosporin C (CEPC) fermentation residue, and explored the mechanisms from the perspectives of bacterial communities and functional genes. It was found that CEP-C in the antibiotic fermentation residue significantly inhibited the H2 production, with the H2 yield decreasing from 17.2\u00a0mL/g-VSadded to 12.5 and 9.6\u00a0mL/g-VSadded at CEP-C concentrations of 100 and 200\u00a0mg/L, respectively. CEP-C also prolonged the H2-producing lag period. Microbiological analysis indicated that CEP-C remarkably decreased the abundances of high-yielding H2-producing bacteria, as well as downregulated the genes involved in hydrogen generation from the\"pyruvate pathway\" and\"NADH pathway\", essentially leading to the decline of H2 productivity.

However, most of the superhydrophobic coatings constructed from HSPs are monofunctional, constraining their broader applications. Moreover, traditional methods for constructing HSPs mostly rely on complicated chemical routes and template removal. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy (one-pot method) for producing multifunctional hierarchical hybrid particles (HHPs). Polysilsesquioxane (PSQ), generated from hydrolysis condensation of methyltriethoxylsilane, is used as the sole stabilizer to anchor on the surface of styrene and short fluoroalkyl compound tridecafluorooctyl acrylate comonomers droplets, forming a mesoporous PSQ shell. Subsequently, the comonomers inside of the shell perform restricted polymerization to generate the HHP due to the driving of the mesoporous capillary force. The HHP is then mixed with waterborne polyurethane (WPU) to develop a robust nanocomposite coating (WPU-HHP). Through the deliberate design of the HHP components, the WPU-HHP coating has thermal insulation, photoluminescence properties, and the ability to achieve a wettability transition during abrasion.

This makes them capable of transporting different pollutants, presenting a potential risk to human and ecological well-being. This study aimed to examine the adsorption and co-migration characteristics of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and soil colloids in areas contaminated with organic substances, utilizing both static and dynamic batch experiments. In the static adsorption experiments, it was observed that the adsorption of BaP onto soil colloids followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.966), and the adsorption isotherm conformed to the Langmuir model (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.995). The BaP and soil colloids primarily formed bonds through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions and hydrogen bonds. The dynamic experimental outcomes revealed that elevating colloids concentration contributed to increased BaP mobility. Specifically, when the concentration of soil colloids in influent was 500\u00a0mg\u00a0L-1, the mobility of BaP was 23.2 % compared to that without colloids of 13.4 %. Meanwhile, the lowering influent pH value contributed to increased BaP mobility. Specifically, when the influent pH value was 4.0, the mobility of BaP was 30.1 %. The BaP's mobility gradually declined as the initial concentration of BaP in polluted soil increased. Specifically, when the initial concentration of BaP in polluted soil was 5.27\u00a0mg\u00a0kg-1, the mobility of BaP was 39.1 %.

Nevertheless, given that single-signal mode is incredibly vulnerable to interference, further efforts should be engrossed on the combination of multiplexed immunodetection and multiple signals. Photothermal signal has sparked significant excitement in designing immunosensors. In this work, by optimizing and comparing the amount of gold, CuS@Au heterojunctions (CuS@Au HJ) were synthesized.

Loss of the stress sensor GADD45A is implicated in poor clinical outcomes but its role in LSCs and AML pathogenesis is unknown. Here we define GADD45A as a key downstream target of LGR4 oncogenic signaling and discover a regulatory role for GADD45A loss in promoting leukemia-initiating activity and oxidative resistance in LGR4/HOXA9-dependent AML, a poor prognosis subset of leukemia. Knockout of GADD45A enhances AML progression in murine and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Deletion of GADD45A induces substantial mutations, increases LSC self-renewal and stemness in vivo and reduces levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accompanied by decreased response to ROS-associated genotoxic agents (e.g., ferroptosis inducer RSL3) and acquisition of an increasingly aggressive phenotype upon serial transplantation in mice. Our single-cell CITE-seq analysis on patient-derived LSCs in PDX mice and subsequent functional studies in murine LSCs and primary AML patient cells show that loss of GADD45A is associated with resistance to ferroptosis (an iron-dependent oxidative cell death caused by ROS accumulation) through aberrant activation of antioxidant pathways related to iron and ROS detoxification such as FTH1 and PRDX1, upregulation of which correlates with unfavorable outcomes in AML patients.

Adsorption involves continuous/batch modes with fixed/dispersed adsorbents, leading to diverse systems. The adsorption kinetic models provide essential insights for effectively designing these systems. However, many adsorption models are semi-empirical/empirical, making it challenging to identify the adsorption mechanisms. Additionally, a consistent method for modelling the adsorption kinetics of different processes would be helpful for the comparison and analysis of various adsorption systems, but no such unified model is available. In epidemiological modeling, populations are often categorized into susceptible, infected, and removed individuals, simplifying disease transmission dynamics without considering individual-level movement intricacies. Likewise, we have employed a similar approach within adsorption systems, classifying adsorbates into absorbable, adsorbed, and removed (to the effluent) segments, thus developing the Monolayer-Absorbable-Adsorbed-Removed (MPQR) kinetics model. This model is applicable to continuous/batch adsorption systems, regardless of whether fixed or dispersed adsorbents are employed. The model was validated using experimental data across water/wastewater treatment, drug separation/purification, metal recovery, and desalination. The results showed that our model successfully fitted the kinetic data from various adsorption systems. It outperformed commonly used models for continuous/batch adsorption. The model allowed us to directly compare the parameters among various adsorption processes. The solving method based on Excel was provided and can be used by the researchers.

The obtained Zn0.3Cd0.7S/MXene (ZCM-0.3) hybrid presented the highest photocatalytic H2O2 production rate in pure neutral water of 1160 \u03bcmol h-1 g-1, which was further improved to 2178.58 \u03bcmol h-1 g-1 in the presence of isopropanol as the sacrificial reagent. The experimental results demonstrated that the sufficient visible-light-harvesting ability and appropriate conduction band potential of the Zn0.3Cd0.7S solid solution, the excellent conductivity and two-electron selectivity of MXene, and the construction of Schottky junctions at the Zn0.3Cd0.7S/MXene interface resulted in the fast transfer and separation of the photogenerated charge carriers and the targeted reduction of oxygen to H2O2. The photocatalytic mechanism for H2O2 production was studied and proposed. Moreover, a simple photo-Fenton system consisting of ZnxCd1-xS/MXene and ferrous ions (Fe2+) was constructed and applied for the degradation of various emerging pollutants, which also performed effectively and exhibited universality across different pollutants.

In recent years, the ionizing radiation (usually including gamma ray generated by radionuclide, such as 60Co and 137Cs, and electron beam generated by electron accelerator) technology has received increasing attention for degrading refractory or toxic organic pollutants in wastewater because of its unique advantages, such as no chemical additives, fast reaction rate, strong degradation capacity, high efficiency, flexibility, controllability. Compared to the conventional wastewater treatment processes, ionizing radiation technology, as a disruptive wastewater treatment technology, is more efficient for the decolorization and degradation of dyes and the treatment of dye-containing wastewater. In this paper, the recent advances in the treatment of dye-containing wastewater by ionizing radiation, in particular by electron beam (EB) radiation were summarized and analyzed, focusing on the decolorization and degradation of various dyes. Firstly, the formation of various reactive species induced by radiation and their interactions with dye molecules, as well as the influencing factors on the removal efficiency of dyes were discussed. Secondly, the researches on the treating dye-containing wastewater by electron beam radiation technology were systematically reviewed. Then, the decolorization and degradation mechanisms by electron beam radiation were further discussed in detail. And the integrated processes that would contribute to the advancement of this technology in practical applications were examined. More importantly, the recent advances of electron beam radiation technology from laboratory to application were reviewed, especially successful operation of dye-containing wastewater treatment facilities in China.

This study has demonstrated that ionizing irradiation is a promising pretreatment method for ASP wastewater to improve oil-water separation. After a settling time of 1\u00a0h, approximately 69.5% of oil remained in the raw ASP wastewater, while only 20-29% of the oil persisted in the liquid phase following radiation at absorbed doses ranging from 0.1 to 5.0\u00a0kGy. A noticeable increase in the size of oil droplets and reduction in turbidity was observed after irradiation. Further analysis revealed that the combination of surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and alkali exhibits a synergistic impact, leading to a substantial reduction in interface tension of ASP wastewater. Notably, ionizing irradiation induces several key changes that are crucial for efficient demulsification. The transformation of the wastewater's rheological behavior from pseudoplastics to a Newtonian fluid accompanied by a reduction in viscosity, the increased interfacial tension at both liquid-air and liquid-oil interfaces, along with the degradation of organic components such as partly hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and SDS, all contribute to the coalescence and floatation of oil droplets.", "Keywords": ["Advanced oxidation processes", "Demulsification", "Interfacial tension", "Oilfield", "Produced wastewater"], "MeSH terms": ["Wastewater", "Electrons", "Polymers", "Surface-Active Agents", "Water", "Alkalies"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Libing", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Waste Treatment, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Waste Treatment, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China.

This limitation can be attributed to various factors, with the intrinsic behavior of the crystal structure during the cycle process being a key contributor. These factors include phase transition induced cracks, reduced Li active sites due to Li/Ni mixing, and slower Li+ migration. In addition, the presence of synthesis-induced heterogeneous phases and lattice defects cannot be disregarded as they also contribute to the degradation in performance. Therefore, gaining a profound understanding of the intricate relationship among material synthesis, structure, and performance is imperative for the development of LiTMO2. This paper highlights the pivotal role of structural play in LiTMO2 materials and provides a comprehensive overview of how various control factors influence the specific pathways of structural evolution during the synthesis process.

This method is simple and has the potential for large-scale preparation. For the first time, we successfully obtained hollow polysiloxane nanoparticles with different shapes, including eccentric hollow polysiloxane microspheres (EHPM), apple-like hollow polysiloxane microparticles (AHPM), and bowl-like hollow polysiloxane microparticles (BHPM), by simply changing the solvent. In this method, the hydrolyzed methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) not only stabilizes the system as a surfactant but also acts as a reactant for subsequent reactions, so no additional surfactant is needed. In addition, the formation mechanism of hollow polysiloxane microparticles with different shapes is also proposed: that is, MTES hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form a surfactant, which changes the system from suspension to a stable oil-in-water emulsion. Then, under alkaline conditions, the hydrolyzed MTES polycondenses and nucleates at the oil-water interface. At the same time, with the process of polycondensation, the hydrolyzed MTES will migrate to the nucleation site driven by surface tension, thus forming an eccentric core/shell (solvent/polysiloxane) structure. Due to the different forces between hydrolyzed MTES and different solvents, the deviation degree of hollow in microspheres is different, thus forming particles with various morphologies. This synthesis method provides a new idea for the preparation of shapeable anisotropic hollow structures. Finally, we use AHPM to study the application of the drug load. The results show that the prepared hollow polysiloxane particles have a good drug loading capacity and release performance. It can be predicted that the shape-tunable hollow polysiloxane particles prepared by this method have broad application prospects in the field of drug delivery.", "Keywords": ["drug carrier", "nanoparticles", "shape-tunable", "soft templating method", "surface tension drive", "surfactant-free emulsion"], "MeSH terms": ["Drug Carriers", "Surface-Active Agents", "Siloxanes", "Nanoparticles", "Solvents", "Pulmonary Surfactants", "Water"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Polymer Materials and Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin 300401, P.R.

Specifically, the prepared APBA-TPE NPs achieved 99.99% bacterial inactivation within 60\u00a0min at a concentration of 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. The results showed that APBA-TPE NPs possess a remarkable capacity for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which could attack the bacterial cell membrane, leading to bacterial lysis and content leakage, and ultimately to bacterial death.

According to the findings, the activation energy required by pyrolysis of HMX in the mixed system is much less than that required by the pure HMX system at both phases. From the point of view of reaction energy, poly-NIMMO promoted the thermolysis of HMX. Especially, the mechanism analysis confirmed this point. The nitro and hydroxyl groups detached from Poly-NIMMO will react with HMX, and the generated HNO2 will further accelerate the decomposition process of nitrogen heterocycles. In addition, the number of the final products H2O and H2 in the two-component system increased greatly, but the number of CO2 and N2 molecules had not changed much, and C clusters were formed in the system. The evolution trend of bond number further verified the above analysis.

However, the impact of high temperatures on the quality of high-quality hybrid rice during the booting stage, as well as the differing effects of the booting and grain-filling stages on grain quality, are currently not well-known. Therefore, four high-quality hybrid rice were subjected to control (CK) and high-temperature stress during the booting (HT1) and grain-filling stages (HT2). Compared to the control, HT1 significantly reduced the spikelets panicle-1 (16.1%), seed setting rate (67.5%), and grain weight (7.4%), while HT2 significantly reduced the seed setting rate (6.0%) and grain weight (7.4%). In terms of quality, both HT1 and HT2 significantly increased chalkiness, chalky grain rate, gelatinization temperature, peak viscosity (PV), trough viscosity (TV), final viscosity (FV), and protein content in most varieties, and significantly decreased grain length, grain width, total starch content, and amylose content. However, a comparison between HT1 and HT2 revealed that the increase in chalkiness, chalky grain rate, PV, TV, and FV was greater under HT2. HT1 resulted in a greater decrease in grain length, grain width, total starch content, and amylose content, as well as an increase in protein content. Additionally, HT1 led to a significant decrease in amylopectin content, which was not observed under HT2.

Its hydrolytic susceptibility arises from insufficient solvation-induced charge accumulation and high activity in electrophilic reactions with acidic species.

However, the size limitations of STAs on strips are always a challenge because of the serious steric hindrance. Here, based on metal-quinone coordination and further metal etching, hollow micron-tubular STAs formed by natural alizarin and Fe3+ ions (named ALIFe) are produced to break through size limitations, provide more active sites, and achieve three-mode ICAs (ALIFe STAs-ICAs). Thanks to the special tubular morphology, ALIFe can successfully pass through the strip and provide an ideal signal intensity within 7 min at low mAb and probe dosages to achieve stable ICA analysis.

Here, we present a novel \"one-for-two\"-oriented immobilization platform based on an organism-bispecific nanobody (O-BsNb) scaffold, enabling highly sensitive detection of two bacterial pathogens. Through genetic engineering, a bispecific nanobody (BsNb) was engineered, targeting Salmonella spp. and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The O-BsNb scaffold allowed one nanobody to bind specifically to inactivated bacteria, forming an organism-oriented immobilization platform, while the other served as the capture antibody. Consequently, the O-BsNb bioscaffold-based ELISA (O-ELISA) for individual detection of S. enteritidis and V. parahaemolyticus was established. When compared to the sandwich ELISA utilizing passive immobilization of monovalent nanobodies, the O-ELISA exhibited a remarkable 13.4- and 13.7-fold improvement in LOD for S. enteritidis and V. parahaemolyticus, respectively, highlighting the enhanced immobilization efficacy of the O-ELISA. Furthermore, the feasibility and reproducibility of the assay in practical samples were meticulously evaluated, revealing exemplary performance in terms of recovery precision and assay stability.

Herein, by modifying a small amount of sulphide on the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), a ZnS@ZIF-8 composite and used for photocatalytic H2O2 production to degrade chlorinated organic pollutants under simulated sunlight (SSL). ZnS@ZIF-8 composite could enhance the separation of photo-induced charge carriers, promote electron transfer from zinc sulphide (ZnS) to ZIF-8, which exhibited good selectivity for the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e--ORR) and two-electron water oxidation (2e--WOR) pathways. Based on oxygen (O2) activation, the developed ZnS@ZIF-8/O2/SSL system could achieve 6.43\u00a0mmol/L H2O2 production within 150\u00a0min, which was approximately 8.66 and 10.36 times higher than that of the ZnS/O2/SSL and ZIF-8/O2/SSL systems, respectively.

Utilizing the metal-core charge shielding strategy, we prepared nanoparticles that display glass-to-liquid transition behavior with glass transition temperature far below room temperature (down to -50.9 \u00b0C). Theoretical calculations suggest the outer surface of these unusual nanoparticles is almost neutral, thus leading to interparticle interactions weak enough to give them liquefaction characteristics.

Using the ZrO2-BTMST photoresist, we fabricate a square raster with an area of 1\u2009cm2 in ~33\u2009min. Furthermore, the extremely small chemical components of the ZrO2-BTMST photoresist enable high-precision patterning, leading to a line width as small as 38\u2009nm.

Here, this work realizes the direct observation of SEI by skillfully designed fluorescent tracers acting as an SEI film-forming additive for electrolytes. These fluorescent tracers have three important moieties: an olefin group for polymerization on anode surface so as to participate in SEI film formation during charge/discharge cycles, a polar group for Li-ion conduction, and an AIEgen for fluorescent tracing. Therefore, the tracers participate in SEI film-forming and result in a shining SEI film. This shining SEI film with intrinsic fluorescence signal allows direct observation and quantification on the distribution, relative abundance, and macro morphology of SEI. These fluorescent tracers can also reveal the SEI formation growth destruction regularity during charge/discharge cycles.

As NACC1 had never before been associated with neurological diseases, we investigated how this mutation might lead to altered brain function. We examined neurotransmission in autaptic glutamatergic mouse neurons expressing the murine homolog of the human mutant NACC1, i.e., Nacc1-R284W. We observed that expression of Nacc1-R284W impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission in a cell-autonomous manner, likely through a dominant negative mechanism. Furthermore, by screening for Nacc1 interaction targets in the brain, we identified SynGAP1, GluK2A, and several SUMO E3 ligases as novel Nacc1 interaction partners. At a biochemical level, Nacc1-R284W exhibited reduced binding to SynGAP1 and GluK2A, and also showed greatly increased SUMOylation. Ablating the SUMOylation of Nacc1-R284W partially restored its interaction with SynGAP1 but did not restore binding to GluK2A. Overall, these data indicate a role for Nacc1 in regulating glutamatergic neurotransmission, which is substantially impaired by the expression of a disease-associated Nacc1 mutant.

In addition, the strategy of combining a failed beta-lactam antibiotic with CPTB@pMBO to photoinactivation with no resistance observed was developed, which presented an idea to address the issue of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and to explore facile anti-infection methods. In addition, CPTB@pMBO can reduce excessive proteolysis of tissue and inflammatory response by regulating the expression of genes and pro-inflammatory factors in vivo, holding great potential for the effective treatment of wound infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria.", "Keywords": ["antibacterial ability", "bismuth molybdate", "heterojunction", "hydrogel", "infected wound healing", "methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Bismuth", "Hydrogels", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Anti-Bacterial Agents"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinling", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiulei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Yu", "Last Name": "Miao", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueqing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xinyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jingru", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xueqing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Zehao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Yuxin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiuyun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Jinyou", "Last Name": "Duan", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, China."}], "Journal": "ACS nano", "PubDate": "2023Aug22"}, {"PMID": "37527577", "Title": "A tailored slow-release film with synergistic antibacterial and antioxidant activities for ultra-persistent preservation of perishable products.", "Abstract": "Rapid decrease in antibacterial efficacy of existing active packages is difficult to promisingly prevent microbial infection during the storage of perishable products.

By evaluating the dependence of MOCs' imaging process on photoacid, lithographies of photoresists with and without photoacid generators after exposure to ultraviolet (UV), electron beam, and soft X-ray, it is revealed that photoacid is essential in UV lithography, but it demonstrates little effect on exposure dose in high-energy lithography. Furthermore, theoretical studies using DFT simulations to investigate the plausible photoacid-catalyzed, electron-triggered dissociation, and accompanying radical reaction are performed, and a mechanism is demonstrated that the nanoscale patterning of this type of MOCs is driven by the solubility switch resulting from dissociation-induced strong electrostatic interaction and low-energy barrier radical polymerization with other species.

Taking bioretention facilities as an example, the errors of design VCRAR under different MIT values were compared based on a Stormwater Management Model (SWMM).

Firstly, the novel contrasting strategy takes advantage of the spatial structure and semantic meaning of different regions and provides more cues to learn than that relying only on data augmentation. Specifically, a positive pair is built from two nearby patches sampled along the direction of the texture if they fall into the same cluster. A negative pair is generated from different clusters. When the novel contrasting strategy is applied to the coarse-to-fine CSSL framework, global and local features are learned successively by forcing the positive pair close to each other and the negative pair apart in an embedding space. Secondly, a discriminant constraint is incorporated into the per-pixel classification model to maximize the inter-class distance. It makes the classification model more competent at distinguishing between different categories that have similar appearance. Finally, the proposed method is validated on four SAR images for land-cover classification with limited labeled data and substantially improves the experimental results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in pixel-level tasks after comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Meijuan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Licheng", "Last Name": "Jiao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shuyuan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yake", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "36216278", "Title": "Inhibitory effect of acetic acid on dark-fermentative hydrogen production.", "Abstract": "This study examined the working mechanisms of acetic acid inhibition on dark fermentative hydrogen production.

Dominant microbes were changed from genus Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 to genus Inhella, Aquabacterium and Caulobacter under the stress of acetic acid inhibition. Functional enzyme analysis showed that acetic acid inhibited the hydrogen production by activating the lactate formation pathway when UAA concentration was below the inhibition threshold, while by impairing most hydrogen-producing pathways when UAA concentration was over the inhibition threshold. In brief, acetic acid inhibited the hydrogen production by altering the dominant microbial community and regulating the metabolic pathways, controlling the UAA concentration would be a good strategy to alleviate the acetic acid inhibition.", "Keywords": ["Biohydrogen", "Dark fermentation", "Inhibition", "Microbial analysis", "Undissociated acetic acid"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanan", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Weize", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Low Carbon Energy, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Waste Treatment, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China.

Nonetheless, the investigation execution of SERS-LFIA is often compromised by the intricacy and overlap of the Raman fingerprint spectrum as well as the affinity-interference of nano-tracer to antibody. To circumvent these critical issues, an engineered core-shell multifunctional nano-tracer (named APNPs) with precise control of the size of nano-core (AuNPs) and coating of the nano-shell (Prussian blue nanomaterials) is prepared for SERS-LFIA via a modified enlarging particle size and coating modification strategy.

Given the potential health risks and economic losses associated with PAT, the rapid detection of PAT using fluorescent aptasensors is of significant importance in evaluating food safety.

We combined TCPP/BDC-NH2 mixed ligands functionalized Zr metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFmix) and terminated three-stranded DNA gates (ttsDNA gates) to fabricate a label-free fluorescent aptasensor for PAT detection. The Zr-MOFmix system was synthesized via a one-pot strategy and could be used to address the problem of pore size limitation and increase the loading amounts of dyes. TtsDNA gate was integrated into the Zr-MOFmix system to control the release of dyes, exhibiting a high signal-to-background ratio. The single-stranded aptamer region in ttsDNA gate situated away from the surface of the Zr-MOFmix, resulting in a natural release of dyes in the absence of PAT. While binding to PAT resulted in target-induced conformational changes that helped form the hairpin structure of the aptamer. This structure hindered the release of dyes from the pores of Zr-MOFmix, thus reducing the fluorescence signals intensity. The stimuli-responsive DNA-gated material provides a platform for PAT analysis under conditions of a low limit of detection (0.871\u00a0pg/mL).

The structures of PETN@TA, PETN@PDA, and PETN@MF microcapsules are characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectra. The performances of PETN@TA, PETN@PDA, and PETN@MF microcapsules are characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, accelerating rate calorimetry, explosion point, vacuum deflation volume, and mechanical sensitivity. The study results show that TA, PDA, and MF shells can coat the PETN surface well. Compared with pure PETN, the explosion point has an increase while the vacuum deflation volume and mechanical sensitivity have a decrease for PETN@TA, PETN@PDA, and PETN@MF microcapsules, illustrating that the safeties of PETN@TA, PETN@PDA, and PETN@MF microcapsules are enhanced. In addition, the initial decomposition temperature (T0) and peak decomposition temperature (Tp) of PETN@TA, PETN@PDA, and PETN@MF microcapsules have a slight increase, demonstrating that the thermal stabilities of PETN@TA, PETN@PDA, and PETN@MF microcapsules are better than that of pure PETN.

Western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry were selected to detect PSMD10 expression in cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cell lines. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was adopted to verify that miR-188-5p targeted MALAT1 and PSMD10. qRT-PCR, pull down, and western blot were used to examine the regulation of MALAT1-miR-188-5p-PSMD10 axis. Transwell, wound healing assay, and Tunel cell apoptosis were adopted to respectively detect the regulatory abilities of MALAT1-miR-188-5p-PSMD10 axis on cell invasion, migration, and apoptosis. Western blot was used to detect the regulation mechanism of MALAT1 on Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 proteins.

The transcription factor ZFP281 induces a permissive state for heterogeneous M-like transcriptional programs, which associate with a dormancy signature and phenotype in vivo. Downregulation of ZFP281 leads to a loss of an invasive, M-like dormancy phenotype and a switch to lung metastatic outgrowth. We also show that FGF2 and TWIST1 induce ZFP281 expression to induce the M-like state, which is linked to CDH1 downregulation and upregulation of CDH11.

In this paper, Amaranthus tricolor was used to investigate the response of the plant photosynthesis to various concentration of strontium ions (0.2, 0.6, 3 and 6\u00a0mM), in order to determine the possibility of A. tricolor to remediate strontium contamination. The results showed that strontium ions (0.2-6\u00a0mM) had effect on light energy conversion and utilization in A. tricolor. Low level of strontium (0.2\u00a0mM) promoted the energy utilization in A. tricolor, while higher Sr concentration (3\u00a0mM or higher) increased the excess light energy in the plants. Under strontium stress of 6\u00a0mM, the acceptor side of PSII in A. tricolor leaves was more vulnerable to strontium stress than the donor side. Furthermore, strontium stress led to accumulation of QA- and block in QB downstream of the electron transfer chain in PSII of A. tricolor leaves. The tolerance ability of A. tricolor to strontium and remediation is also reflected in its biomass and strontium content in plants. Strontium at 3\u00a0mM or below promoted the growth of A. tricolor, while higher concentration inhibited the plant growth, but without obvious wilting or curling of leaves. The maximal dry weight increased by 36.29% in shoots, and 60.14% in roots when the spiked-strontium concentration reached 0.2\u00a0mM. The maximal strontium content achieved 8.75\u00a0mg/g dry wt in shoots, and 1.71\u00a0mg/g dry wt in roots respectively, when strontium concentration was 6\u00a0mM. Transfer factors (TFs: ratio of Sr content in shoots to that in roots) of strontium in A. tricolor ranged from 2.85 to 5.93, while bio-concentration factors (BCFs: ratio of Sr content in shoots to that in solutions) ranged from 22.57 to 49.66.

However, the inefficient recognition capabilities of nanozyme sensors for targets hinder its further application. Herein, the authors synthesize bare nickel selenide (NiSe2) via a one-step hydrothermal reaction, in which the Se element possesses a strong binding ability with mercury (Hg). As expected, NiSe2 exhibits oxidase-like activity in the presence of Hg2+, that is, Hg2+ can enhance the oxidase-like activity of NiSe2. The enhanced mechanism is the accelerated electron transfer between NiSe2-Hg2+ and substrate caused by the formation of Hg-Se bonds. Besides, the oxidase-like activity of NiSe2 exhibits excellent selectivity, sensitivity and stability in response to Hg2+, which enables NiSe2-Hg2+ to efficiently oxidize colorless TMB to blue TMB even in harsh environments. Based on this, a dual-mode colorimetric sensor integrating solution reaction and test paper is developed for the detection of Hg2+. In the Hg2+ concentration range of 10-700\u00a0nM, the colorimetric platform presents a liner response to Hg2+, which can reach a low LOD of 5.18\u00a0nM in solution reaction and 8.42\u00a0nM in the test paper.

Necroptosis, a novel form of programmed necrotic cell death distinct from apoptosis, has been increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic strategy. This study sought to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with necrotizing apoptosis to predict prognosis and target drug use to improve patient survival. Methods: Transcriptomic data and clinical data from 85 OS patients with survival time data and expression profiles from 85 random normal adipose tissue samples were extracted from the UCSC Xena website (http://xena.ucsc.edu/). Nine necroptosis-associated differential prognostic lncRNAs were then identified by analysis of variance, correlation analysis, univariate Cox (uni-Cox) regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Then, patients were randomized into training or testing groups. According to uni-Cox, we obtained prognostic lncRNAs in the training group and intersected them with the abovementioned nine lncRNAs to obtain the final necrotizing apoptosis-related differential prognostic lncRNAs (NRlncRNAs). Next, we performed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to construct a risk model of NRlncRNAs. Kaplan-Meier analysis, ROC curves, nomograms, calibration curves, and PCA were used to validate and evaluate the models and grouping. We also analyzed the differences in tumor immunity and drugs between risk groups. Results: We constructed a model containing three NRlncRNAs (AL391121.1, AL354919.2, and AP000851.2) and validated its prognostic predictive power. The value of the AUC curve of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probability was 0.806, 0.728, and 0.731, respectively. Moreover, we found that the overall survival time of patients in the high-risk group was shorter than that in the low-risk group. GSEA and ssGSEA showed that immune-related pathways were mainly abundant in the low-risk group. We also validated the differential prediction of immune checkpoint expression, tumor immunity, and therapeutic compounds in the two risk groups.

Here, we recorded a 16-channel resting-state electroencephalogram after the application of spinal cord stimulation (n = 5) or peripheral nerve stimulation (n = 3). The neuromodulatory effect was compared between specific conditions (active ENS versus rest). To capture the cortical responses of ENS, spectral power and coherence analysis were performed. ENS therapy achieved satisfactory relief from pain with a mean visual analog scale score reduction of 5.9 \u00b1 1.1. The spectral analysis indicated that theta and alpha oscillations increased significantly during active neuromodulation compared with the resting state.

Herein, inspired by the structure of the active center of natural multi-iron peroxidases and polyphenol-protein interactions, a rational design of an artificial peroxidase with mAbs recognition activity by utilizing gallic acid (GA) to chelate with multivalent iron was successfully proposed by utilizing gallic acid (GA) to chelate with multivalent iron. The most essential features of peroxidase-like Fe-GA nanozymes (FGN) were investigated, showing high catalytic performance and good stability. Subsequently, FGN was employed as SM for mAbs in ICA, which played the following triple roles in the ICA sensor: (i) the direct recognizer of mAbs; (ii) the generator of original colorimetric signal; (iii) the generator of catalytic in-suit amplification colorimetric signal. To make the ICA more portable, we have employed a smartphone and principal component analysis (PCA) to assist this on-site detection.

We identified eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A2 (eIF4A2) and defined its mechanistic action through ribosomal protein S26-independent and -dependent ribosomes in translation initiation activation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding pluripotency factors and the histone variant H3.3 with demonstrated roles in maintaining stem cell pluripotency. eIF4A2 also mediates translation initiation activation of Ddx6, which acts together with eIF4A2 to restrict the totipotent two-cell transcription program in ESCs through Zscan4 mRNA degradation and translation repression. Accordingly, knockdown of eIF4A2 disrupts ESC proteome, causing the loss of ESC identity. Collectively, we establish a translational paradigm of the protein synthesis of pluripotency transcription factors and epigenetic regulators imposed on their established roles in controlling pluripotency.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Differentiation", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Histones", "Peptide Initiation Factors", "RNA Stability"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jihong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongwei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Science advances", "PubDate": "2022Apr"}, {"PMID": "35331795", "Title": "Hydrogel loading 2D montmorillonite exfoliated by anti-inflammatory Lycium barbarum L. polysaccharides for advanced wound dressing.", "Abstract": "Designing wound dressing materials with hemocompatibility, suitable mechanical properties, outstanding hemostatic effects and anti-inflammatory activity is of great practical significance for wound management.

The mycotoxins which are produced from Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium are considered most important and therefore regulated in food- and feedstuffs. Analyses are predominantly performed by official laboratory methods in centralized labs by expert technicians. There is an urgent demand for new low-cost, easy-to-use, and portable analytical devices for rapid on-site determination. Most significant advances were realized in the field bioanalytical techniques based on molecular recognition. This review aims to discuss recent progress in the generation of native biomolecules and new bioinspired materials towards mycotoxins for the development of reliable bioreceptor-based analytical methods. After brief presentation of basic knowledge regarding characteristics of most important mycotoxins, the generation, benefits, and limitations of present and emerging biorecognition molecules, such as polyclonal (pAb), monoclonal (mAb), recombinant antibodies (rAb), aptamers, short peptides, and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), are discussed.

Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays crucial roles in the initiation and progression of TNBC. In this study, we analyzed public GEO profiles to verify the key lncRNAs in TNBC. Linc00921 was selected for further study. Low expression of linc00921 was observed in 49 of 95 TNBC tissues. Low expression of linc00921 was correlated with poor postoperative disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of TNBC patients. Overexpression of linc00921 with lentivirus suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells. A luciferase reporter assay showed that linc00921 could sponge miR-9-5p in TNBC. Moreover, linc00921 and miR-9-5p occupied the same Argonaute-2 (Ago2) protein in TNBC cells. Leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2 (LZTS2) was recognized as a target gene of miR-9-5p, and thereby a linc00921/miR-9-5p/LZTS2 axis was identified in TNBC cells. Overexpression of linc00921 promoted nuclear export of \u03b2-catenin, neutralized its function, and subsequently promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC. A xenograft tumor mouse model showed that the miR-9-5p inhibitor upregulates LZTS2 expression and induce nuclear export of \u03b2-catenin in TNBC. Thus, linc00921 upregulates LZTS2 by sponging miR-9-5p to suppress tumorigenesis and EMT of TNBC.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a focal therapeutic strategy for low- to intermediate-risk PCa with a low risk of complications. However, lesions located in the anterior urethral zone are challenging to treat with this approach because it is difficult to avoid urethral injury during HIFU therapy, which might further cause urethral stricture and symptoms related to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). Here, we present the case of a 79-year-old male with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels for over 1 year. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1.8 cm \u00d7 1.0 cm mass covering an area of the anterior urethral zone. Histopathological examination revealed an International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 3 acinar adenocarcinoma. Given the patient's request for functional preservation, a magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery was performed. During the operation, a urethra-sparing approach was utilized by administering proper energy and adjusting the sequence of the sonications. The patient developed urinary retention after catheter removal less than 48 h after the treatment, which resolved after removal of the second catheter a week later. On a follow-up visit 3 months after the treatment, evaluation by the level of PSA and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging showed no recurrence of PCa. No significant changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score and Quality of Life score were found compared to baseline scores. With proper adjustment, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery could be safely used for urethra-sparing surgeries for PCa lesions in the anterior urethral zone, without influencing post-treatment urination. The indwelling time of the catheter should be extended appropriately for full recovery from treatment-related prostatic edema around the prostatic urethra to avoid urinary retention.", "Keywords": ["Prostate neoplasm", "case report", "focal therapy", "functional preservation", "magnetic resonance guided surgery", "urethra-sparing"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Miao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Huimin", "Last Name": "Hou", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Tao", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Cheng", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jintao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianye", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "Journal": "Translational cancer research", "PubDate": "2021Dec"}, {"PMID": "35095893", "Title": "N6-Methyladenosine-Related LncRNAs Are Potential Remodeling Indicators in the Tumor Microenvironment and Prognostic Markers in Osteosarcoma.", "Abstract": "N6-Adenosine methylation, yielding N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is a reversible epigenetic modification found in messenger RNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which affects the fate of modified RNA molecules and is essential for the development and differentiation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents, and is characterized by high mortality. Currently, the possible role of m6A modifications in the prognosis of OS is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between m6A-related lncRNA expression and the clinical outcomes of OS patients via a comprehensive analysis. Clinical and workflow-type data were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Program and The Cancer Genome Atlas. We examined the relationship between m6A modifications and lncRNA expression, conducted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes analysis and also gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), implemented survival analysis to investigate the association of clinical survival data with the expression of m6A-related lncRNAs, and utilized Lasso regression to model the prognosis of OS. Furthermore, we performed immune correlation analysis and TME differential analysis to investigate the infiltration levels of immune cells and their relationship with clinical prognosis. LncRNA expression and m6A levels were closely associated in co-expression analysis. The expression of m6A-related lncRNAs was quite low in tumor tissues; this appeared to be a predicting factor of OS in a prognostic model, independent of other clinical features. The NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway in GSEA. In tumor tissues, SPAG4 was overexpressed while ZBTB32 and DEPTOR were downregulated. Tissues in cluster 2 were highly infiltrated by plasma cells. Cluster 2 presented higher ESTIMATE scores and stromal scores, showing a lower tumor cell purity in the TME. In conclusion, m6A-related lncRNA expression is strongly associated with the occurrence and development of OS, and can be used to as a prognostic factor of OS. Moreover, m6A-related lncRNAs and infiltrating immune cells in the TME could serve as new therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for OS.", "Keywords": ["N6-methyladenosine (m6A)", "epigenetic", "long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)", "osteosarcoma", "plasma cell", "tumor microenvironment"], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Genetic", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Methylation", "Osteosarcoma", "Prognosis", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "ROC Curve", "Transcriptome", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhongguang", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaobo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Spine Surgery, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."}, {"First Name": "Dongjie", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."}, {"First Name": "Zian", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital, Xining, China."}, {"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Spine Surgery, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Spine Surgery, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."}, {"First Name": "Youwen", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Department of Spine Surgery, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "35079908", "Title": "Reactive molecular dynamics simulations on thermal decomposition of 3-methyl-2,6-dinitrophenol.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we simulated the decomposition mechanism of 3-methyl-2,6-dinitrophenol (MDNP) based on reaction molecular dynamics using ReaxFF force field.

Microbial analysis showed that species from genus Romboutsia, Terrisporobacter, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12, Paraclostridium, unclassified_f_Peptostreptococcaceae and Caproiciproducens were significantly positively correlated with MCCs production. Metabolic pathways analysis demonstrated that the co-fermentation promoted the chain elongation process by stimulating the rate-limiting steps involved in the conversion of ethanol to Acetyl-CoA and circular fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.", "Keywords": ["Chain elongation", "Co-fermentation", "Medium-chain carboxylates", "Sewage sludge, macroalgae"], "MeSH terms": ["Bioreactors", "Carboxylic Acids", "Fatty Acids, Volatile", "Fermentation", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Seaweed", "Sewage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yanan", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Waste Treatment, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China.

Low temperature is a major abiotic factor that affects rice germination and reproduction. Here, the underlying regulatory mechanism in seedlings of a TGMS variety (33S) and a cold-sensitive variety (Nipponbare) was investigated by comparative transcriptome. There were 795 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified only in cold-treated 33S, suggesting that 33S had a unique cold-resistance system. Functional and enrichment analysis of these DEGs revealed that, in 33S, several metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, were significantly repressed. Moreover, pathways related to growth and development, including starch and sucrose metabolism, and DNA biosynthesis and damage response/repair, were significantly enhanced. The expression of genes related to nutrient reserve activity were significantly up-regulated in 33S. Finally, three NAC and several ERF transcription factors were predicted to be important in this transcriptional reprogramming.

However, it has a number of disadvantages with regard to accuracy and interference because of difficulties in simplifying the process of preparing nanomaterial-based probes. In this work, inspired by protein self-assembly, for the first time, a facile natural antibody network (NAN)-based mLFIA for multiple chloramphenicol (CAP) and streptomycin (STR) determination was designed. The NAN structure was constructed by introducing a second antibody (Ab2) as a scaffold to noncovalently combine with various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), thus permitting each mAb to act as an independent functional unit to maintain bioactivity. Furthermore, the NAN was colored by simple one-step staining using coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (CBBR) to form a chromogenic probe, eliminating the need for complex nanomaterials to improve reproducibility and precision. Under optimal conditions, a satisfactory detection performance (the visual limit of detection (v-LOD) of 3 ng mL-1 for CAP and 20 ng mL-1 for STR) was obtained for whole milk analysis, which met the basic requirement of detection and had good specificity, reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 15%), and robustness.

Materials and Methods: A total of 901 bladder tumor samples, including 405 samples from TCGA database, 188 samples from GSE13507 and 308 samples from GSE32894, were included in this systematic analysis. The N6-methyladenosine modification patterns were identified utilizing unsupervised clustering analysis. To quantify N6-methyladenosine modification patterns, the m6Ascore of individual sample was developed using principal component analysis algorithms. Relationships among immune infiltration, tumor mutation burden, various clinical characteristics, molecular subtypes, and the m6Ascore were systematically analyzed. The guiding value of m6Ascore in immunotherapy was further validated in an external trial cohort. Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer expression references were also utilized to perform drug sensitivity analysis for patients with distinct m6A modification patterns. Results: We determined three different N6-methyladenosine modification patterns for 901 bladder tumors. The quantitative m6Ascore of individual sample derived from N6-methyladenosine modification patterns could play a significant role in predicting overall survival, immune cell infiltration, and classic oncogene mutations. A low m6Ascore combined with high tumor mutation burden indicated better survival outcomes (p < 0.001). A higher m6Ascore also indicated a higher grade, higher T and N stage, elder ages, higher death rate, and higher PD1/PDL1/CTLA4 expressions (p < 0.01). The Basal type tended to exhibit significantly higher m6Ascores than the Luminal and Neuronal subtypes. External immunotherapy cohorts demonstrated that no difference in therapeutic effects was noted between the high and low m6Ascore groups when anti-PD1 immunotherapy was exclusively administered. When anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy were simultaneously administered, the high m6Ascore group had a significantly better prognosis than the low m6Ascore group (p < 0.001). High m6A groups were potentially sensitive to various medical treatments including Bleomycin, Bortezomib, Cisplatin, Cyclopamine, Dasatinib, Docetaxe, Rapamycin, and Vinblastine in this study.

The TCMSP dataset was used to identify the chemical makeup of Zhuling Jisheng decoction, which was then analyzed and assessed for oral bioavailability and pharmacological similarity. The chemical composition of Zhuling Jisheng decoction was identified through the TCMSP database, and it was evaluated and screened based on oral bioavailability and drug similarity.

The function and linked pathways of the target genes were examined and screened using annotation, visualization, and a comprehensive discovery database. The impact of Zhuling Jisheng decoction on urothelial bladder cancer was studied using Cytoscape software to create a component/target/pathway network. Finally, 69 and 55 target genes were discovered for noninvasive bladder urothelial cancer and invasive bladder urothelial cancer, respectively. In noninvasive urothelial cancer, 118 pathways were highly enriched, including the TNF signaling pathway and the IL-17 signaling route. 103 pathways were highly enriched in invasive urothelial cancer, including the p53 signaling route, bladder cancer route, and calcium signaling route. There were 18 and 15 drug targets associated with noninvasive and invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma prognoses.

Here we find that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) constitute half of the chromatin proteome in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), some being colocalized with RNA polymerase (Pol)\u2009II at promoters and enhancers. Biochemical analyses of representative RBPs show that the paraspeckle protein PSPC1 inhibits the RNA-induced premature release of Pol\u2009II, and makes use of RNA as multivalent molecules to enhance the formation of transcription condensates and subsequent phosphorylation and release of Pol\u2009II.

In addition, this study investigated the association between m6A regulators and antitumor immune responses and discovered higher expression of the immune regulators PD-L1, PD-L2, MRP1, and MRP2 in low m6A scores.

As a combination of platelet and lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was proved to be correlated with the severity as well as prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Exploring the relationship between PLR and in-hospital mortality in cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients was the purpose of this study. PLR was calculated by dividing platelet count by lymphocyte count. All patients were grouped by PLR quartiles and the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The independent effect of PLR was determined by binary logistic regression analysis. The curve in line with overall trend was drawn by local weighted regression (Lowess). Subgroup analysis was used to determine the relationship between PLR and in-hospital mortality in different subgroups. We included 5577 CICU patients.

However, we find that the relevant research that analyzes energy internet and energy misallocation on carbon emissions under the same framework is ignored. For this purpose, the generalized method of moments (GMM), panel threshold model, and spatial analysis (deviation ellipse, hotspot analysis, and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR)) model were applied to investigate the impact of energy internet and energy misallocation on carbon emissions using panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2004 to 2018. The major statistical results include the following: (1) energy misallocation significantly contributes to carbon emissions, while energy internet inhibits carbon emissions. Energy internet can negatively moderate the positive effect of energy misallocation on carbon emissions. (2) The effect of energy misallocation on carbon emissions reveals an inverted \"U-shaped\" characteristic of first promoting and later inhibiting, but the inhibiting effect is insignificant. Moreover, the marginal effect of energy misallocation on carbon emissions decreases when the energy internet crosses the second thresholds consecutively, while the marginal effect of the energy internet on carbon emissions shows an inverted \"N\" shape. (3) Compared with the under-allocated regions, the promotion effect of energy misallocation on carbon emissions and the inhibitory effect of energy internet on carbon emissions are stronger in the over-allocated regions, while the energy internet has a more significant negative moderating effect on energy misallocation. (4) The gravity center of China's carbon emissions gradually shifts to the northwest with time.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is not only a malignant tumor but also a lipid metabolic disease. Previous studies have identified ferroptosis as an important pathophysiological pathway in PCa development and treatment, but its role in the prognosis of PCa is less well known. In this study, we constructed a nine-ferroptosis-related gene risk model that demonstrated strong prognostic and therapeutic predictive power. The higher risk score calculated by the model was significantly associated with a higher ferroptosis potential index, higher Ki67 expression, higher immune infiltration, higher probability of biochemical recurrence, worse clinicopathological characteristics, and worse response to chemotherapy and antiandrogen therapy in PCa. The mechanisms identified by the gene set enrichment analysis suggested that this signature can accurately distinguish high- and low-risk populations, which is possibly closely related to variations in steroid hormone secretion, regulation of endocrine processes, positive regulation of humoral immune response, and androgen response. Results of this study were confirmed in two independent PCa cohorts, namely, The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and the MSK-IMPACT Clinical Sequencing Cohort, which contributed to the body of scientific evidence for the prediction of biochemical recurrence in patients with PCa. In addition, as the main components of this signature, the effects of the AIFM2 and NFS1 genes on ferroptosis were evaluated and verified by in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively.

Iron-based dual active sites endowed Fe-N-O-GC-350 with superior catalytic activity to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as evidenced by the fast degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) (0.24 min-1) in the presence of 0.4 mM PMS and 0.1 g/L Fe-N-O-GC-350. Unlike the reported singlet oxygen and high-valent iron oxo-mediated degradation induced by the SA-Fe catalyst, both surface-bound reactive species and singlet oxygen contributed to SMX degradation, while surface-bound reactive species dominated. Density functional theory (DFT) simulation indicated that Fe2N and SA-Fe enhanced the adsorption of PMS, which played a key role in PMS activation.

However, commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2 , leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large-scale implementation of high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non-shrinkage separator (GS-PI) is fabricated via a novel gel-stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering during heating clearly shows that the as-prepared thin GS-PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit.

The required dose for completely degrading 2-CA by radiation increased when its initial concentration increased. Solution pH affected 2-CA degradation by changing the radiation-chemical yield of reactive species. Chloride ions (10 and 100\u00a0mM) had not obvious influence on 2-CA degradation. Hydrogen radicals, hydrated electrons and hydroxyl radicals, all contributed to the degradation of 2-CA, but with different degradation mechanisms. Hydrogen radicals and hydrated electrons could initiate reductive dechlorination of 2-CA, while hydroxyl radicals can degrade 2-CA by hydroxylation. 6-amino-1,4-cyclohexadiene and chlorobenzene were the main intermediate products of 2-CA degradation in the hydrogen radicals or hydrated electrons dominant process; while o-hydroxyaniline and nitroso-chlorobenzene were the main intermediate products in the hydroxyl radicals dominant process. The solution toxicity after radiation treatment varied with the initial concentration of 2-CA and the absorbed dose. In the actual chemical wastewater, 2-CA can be effectively removed by radiation, even in the presence of high concentration of chloride ions (about 2800\u00a0mg/l).

However, the relevant previous studies lacked the role of analyzing the direct and indirect effects of internet development on green economic growth at the prefecture-level city level. For this purpose, this paper aims to examine the intrinsic mechanism of the impact of internet development on green economic growth and provide empirical support for cities and regions in China to increase internet construction. Furthermore, the mixed model (EBM), which includes both radial and non-radial distance functions, is applied to calculate the green economic growth index. Fixed effect model and mediation effect model are also employed to test influence mechanisms of the internet development on green economic growth using panel data of 269 prefecture-level cities in China from 2004 to 2019. The statistical results reveal that internet development has contributed significantly to green economic growth. When the internet development level increases by 1 unit, the green economic growth level increases by an average of 5.0372 units. However, regional heterogeneity is evident between internet development and green economic growth, that is, the promoting effect of internet development on green economic growth is gradually enhanced from the eastern region to the western region. We also find that internet development guides industrial structure upgrading improves environmental quality and accelerates enterprise innovation, which indirectly contributes to green economic growth. And internet development mainly achieves green economic growth through enterprise innovation. Based on the above findings, we concluded that policymakers should not only strengthen the guiding role of social actors to promote the stable development of the internet industry, but also foster the construction of the three models of \"internet+industry integration,\" \"internet+environmental governance,\" and \"internet+enterprise innovation\" to promote green economic growth.", "Keywords": ["Corporate innovation", "Environmental pollution", "Green economic growth", "Industrial structure upgrading", "Internet development", "Regional heterogeneity"], "MeSH terms": ["China", "Cities", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Economic Development", "Environmental Policy", "Internet"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830047, China."}, {"First Name": "Weilong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830047, China."}, {"First Name": "Qiying", "Last Name": "Ran", "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830047, China."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Irfan", "Affiliation": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China."}, {"First Name": "Siyu", "Last Name": "Ren", "Affiliation": "School of Economics, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaodong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830047, China. yxdlovezt@126.com."}, {"First Name": "Haitao", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China. haitao.kungfuer@gmail.com."}, {"First Name": "Munir", "Last Name": "Ahmad", "Affiliation": "School of Economics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China."}], "Journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "PubDate": "2022Feb"}, {"PMID": "34492486", "Title": "Denitrification performance and microbial community of bioreactor packed with PHBV/PLA/rice hulls composite.", "Abstract": "In this study, a novel biodegradable PHBV/PLA/rice hulls (PPRH) composite was applied and tested as biofilm attachment carrier and carbon source in two bioreactors for biological denitrification process.

Loss of function of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (OsBADH2) affects the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP), which is responsible for aroma in fragrant rice. The current study was aimed at creating new alleles of BADH2 using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology under the genetic background of the japonica Ningjing 1 (NJ1) and indica Huang Huazhan (HHZ) varieties. Sensory evaluation and analysis using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) showed that the grains of the four homozygous T1 lines with new alleles of BADH2 (nj1-cr\u200aBADH2 -1, nj1-cr\u200aBADH2 -2, hhz-cr\u200aBADH2 -1 and hhz-cr\u200aBADH2 -2) produced moderate fragrance and had significantly increased 2-AP content compared with wild-types. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the amylose content and gelatinization temperature among the four lines with new alleles of BADH2 to the wild-types. Thereafter, we crossed the HHZ background new alleles of BADH2 with CMS line Taonong 1A (TN1A) to produce a three-line hybrid variety B-Tao-You-Xiangzhan (BTYXZ) with increased grain aroma. The 2-AP content in grains of the improved BTYXZ-1 and BTYXZ-2 reached at 26.16 and 18.74\u2009\u03bcg/kg, and the gel consistency of BTYXZ-1 and BTYXZ-2 increased significantly by 9.1% and 6.5%, respectively, compared with the wild-type Tao-You-Xiangzhan (TYXZ).

Previous studies have focused mainly on its role in the cytosol where it interacts with Let-7 microRNA precursors or mRNAs, and few have addressed LIN28's role within the nucleus. Here, we show that LIN28 displays dynamic temporal and spatial expression during murine embryo development. Maternal LIN28 expression drops upon exit from the 2-cell stage, and zygotic LIN28 protein is induced at the forming nucleolus during 4-cell to blastocyst stage development, to become dominantly expressed in the cytosol after implantation. In cultured pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), loss of LIN28 led to nucleolar stress and activation of a 2-cell/4-cell-like transcriptional program characterized by the expression of endogenous retrovirus genes. Mechanistically, LIN28 binds to small nucleolar RNAs and rRNA to maintain nucleolar integrity, and its loss leads to nucleolar phase separation defects, ribosomal stress and activation of P53 which in turn binds to and activates 2C transcription factor Dux. LIN28 also resides in a complex containing the nucleolar factor Nucleolin (NCL) and the transcriptional repressor TRIM28, and LIN28 loss leads to reduced occupancy of the NCL/TRIM28 complex on the Dux and rDNA loci, and thus de-repressed Dux and reduced rRNA expression. Lin28 knockout cells with nucleolar stress are more likely to assume a slowly cycling, translationally inert and anabolically inactive state, which is a part of previously unappreciated 2C-like transcriptional program. These findings elucidate novel roles for nucleolar LIN28 in PSCs, and a new mechanism linking 2C program and nucleolar functions in PSCs and early embryo development.", "Keywords": ["2-cell-like

In this study, the contribution of defective structure in UiO-66 to the adsorptive removal of pharmaceutical pollutants from aqueous solution was investigated. The results showed that the controlled defects in UiO-66 greatly affected adsorption equilibrium time, adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity. Slightly defected UiO-66 contained more open frameworks, and it exhibited faster adsorption equilibrium. However, a high degree of destruction to the amorphous state resulted in a longer equilibrium time, due to the interference in the diffusion process as the result of severe structural collapse and interpenetration. Moreover, a higher degree of structural damage of UiO-66 led to a higher adsorption capacity because of the increased active sites. The maximum adsorption capacity was 321\u00a0mg/g for the as-prepared defective UiO-66, which was much higher than that of perfective UiO-66 (54.5\u00a0mg/g). Furthermore, defective UiO-66 had a higher adsorption affinity for diclofenac sodium than other studied pharmaceutical pollutants.

Method: All of the patients were divided into seven groups stratified by plasma osmolarity, and the group with 290-300 mmol/L osmolarity was used as a reference group. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.

Heterotrophic denitrification utilizes organic compounds as electron donors, including low-molecular-weight organics (e.g. acetate, methanol, glucose, benzene, methane, etc.) and high-molecular-weight organics (e.g. cellulose, polylactic acid, polycaprolactone, etc.); while autotrophic denitrification utilizes inorganic compounds as electron donors, including hydrogen (H2), reduced sulfur compounds (e.g. sulfide, element sulfur and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (Fe2+), iron sulfides (e.g. FeS, Fe1-xS and FeS2), arsenite (As(\u0428)) and manganese (Mn(II)).

However, conventional chemotherapy lacks targeting properties, and its long-term and extensive use will have serious side effects on patients. For this reason, a multifunctional nanodrug system (V-RZCD) targeting osteosarcoma was developed in this study. V-RZCD consists of two parts: (1) the core (ZCD), wherein calcium ions (Ca2+) and zoledronic acid (ZA) form a metal-organic framework for loading doxorubicin (DOX), and (2) the shell (V-R), a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligand-modified red blood cell membrane nanovesicle.

Herein, the radiolytic degradation of antibiotic Cephalosporin C (CEP-C) in different water matrices was comprehensively investigated using gamma radiation at various experimental conditions. The results revealed that CEP-C oxidation obeyed pseudo first-order kinetics, and 100%, 94.9%, 67.0%, 44.6% and 34.5% removal of CEP-C with 10-200 mg/L was achieved at 0.4 kGy, respectively. The degradation was faster at higher absorbed dose and acidic conditions (pH = 3.5). The inorganic anions, including SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-, had negative influence on the degradation of CEP-C, the corresponding rate constant decreased from 4.603 to 3.667, 1.677 and 2.509 kGy-1 respectively in the presence of SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-. The analysis of intermediate products indicated that CEP-C was oxidized to generate about 10 intermediate products. Besides, it was inferred that the thioether sulfur oxidation, \u03b2-lactam ring opening, acetyl dissociation from dihydrothiazine ring and D-\u03b1-aminohexylamide group abscission were the major reaction mechanisms of CEP-C degradation by gamma radiation. Importantly, the antibacterial activity of CEP-C could be completely vanished by gamma radiation alone, while more toxic intermediate products might be formed.

However, sensitive and quantitative detection is still challenging for LFIAs in complex environments. In this work, a dual-model colorimetric/SERS lateral flow immunoassay for ultrasensitive determination of clenbuterol was constructed based on a metallic core-shell Au/Au nanostar acting as a multifunction tag. Raman reporter molecules are located between the core (AuNP) and shell (Au nanostar) to form a sandwich structure, which contributes to eliminate the environmental interference and improve the detection stability. In addition, the Au/Au nanostar provides a much higher Raman enhancement due to the presence of sharp tips and larger surface roughness in comparison with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Thus, on the basis of the antibody-antigen interaction, the dual-model immunoassay can produce strong colorimetric and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signals for highly sensitive detection of the target analyte, clenbuterol. Under optimal conditions, clenbuterol could be detected by the colorimetric model with a visual detection limit of 5 ng/mL. Meanwhile, the SERS signal of the Au/Au nanostar was accumulated on the test line for the SERS model detection with a quantitative detection limit as low as 0.05 ng/mL, which is at least 200-fold lower than that of the traditional AuNPs-based immunoassay.

Simultaneously, Chinese local governments have pursued simple economic growth driven by the interests of \"political competition\" for a long time, while the supervision of the ecological environment has been loosened and tightened. In this environment, financial development and technological innovation may easily become the accelerator of this phenomenon, thus exacerbating the fluctuation of green growth. To deeply excavate the key factors to achieve stable and sustained growth of green economy, based on the annual panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2018, this paper studies the impact of financial development and technological innovation on the volatility of green growth using dynamic system GMM method. The findings of this paper are shown as follows: First, the expansion of financial institutions' scale will significantly enhance the volatility of green growth. Second, the increase in the scale of the stock market will also significantly cause green growth fluctuations. Third, the interaction between financial development and technological innovation can significantly weaken the volatility of green growth. Fourth, financial development measured by stock market indicators is more efficient than financial development measured by financial institutions indicators to curb the volatility of green growth. Fifth, the fluctuation of green growth in the previous period will reduce the volatility of green growth in the current period. This study provides new evidence for exploring the power source to promote the stability and sustainable growth of the green economy in the special stage of financial and technological integration. Controlling the development scale of financial institutions and removing their state preferences, expanding the development of capital markets, and deepening the integration of financial development and technological innovation are conducive to achieve stable green growth.", "Keywords": ["Financial development", "Green growth", "System GMM", "Technological innovation", "Volatility"], "MeSH terms": ["China", "Economic Development", "Inventions", "Technology"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jianhong", "Last Name": "Cao", "Affiliation": "School of Business and Economics, University Putra Malaysia, 43400, Seri Kembangan, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"First Name": "Siong Hook", "Last Name": "Law", "Affiliation": "School of Business and Economics, University Putra Malaysia, 43400, Seri Kembangan, Selangor, Malaysia. lawsh@upm.edu.my."}, {"First Name": "Abdul Rahim Bin Abdul", "Last Name": "Samad", "Affiliation": "School of Business and Economics, University Putra Malaysia, 43400, Seri Kembangan, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"First Name": "Wan Norhidayah Binti W", "Last Name": "Mohamad", "Affiliation": "School of Business and Economics, University Putra Malaysia, 43400, Seri Kembangan, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830047, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiaodong", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "School of Economics and Management, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830047, China. yxdlovezt@126.com."}], "Journal": "Environmental science and pollution research international", "PubDate": "2021Sep"}, {"PMID": "33858095", "Title": "Efficient removal of Co(II) and Sr(II) from aqueous solution using polyvinyl alcohol/graphene oxide/MnO2 composite as a novel adsorbent.", "Abstract": "In this study, a novel adsorbent, polyvinyl alcohol/graphene oxide/MnO2 composite was prepared, characterized and used for efficient removal of Co2+ and Sr2+ from aqueous solution.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is involved in the hypoxia response and cancer promotion, and it accumulates in hypoxia and is degraded under normoxic conditions. Here we identify prostate cancer associated transcript-1 (PCAT-1) as a hypoxia-inducible long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that regulates HIF-1\u03b1 stability, crucial for cancer progression. Extensive analyses of clinical data indicate that PCAT-1 is elevated in breast cancer patients and is associated with pathological grade, tumor size, and poor clinical outcomes. Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we find that PCAT-1 promotes hypoxia-associated breast cancer progression including growth, migration, invasion, colony formation, and metabolic regulation. Mechanistically, PCAT-1 directly interacts with the receptor of activated protein C kinase-1 (RACK1) protein and prevents RACK1 from binding to HIF-1\u03b1, thus protecting HIF-1\u03b1 from RACK1-induced oxygen-independent degradation.

Grain formation is a complex biological process, whose molecular mechanism is yet to be improved. Here we investigated the function of an OVATE family protein, Embryo Sac Development 1 (ESD1), in the regulation of seed setting rate in rice (Oryza sativa) by examining its loss-of-function mutants generated via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated9 (Cas9) technology. ESD1 was predominantly expressed at Stage 6 of panicle development, especially in the ovules. esd1 mutants displayed reduced seed setting rates with normal stamen development and pollen tube growth but abnormal pistil group. Investigation of embryo sacs revealed that during the mitosis of functional megaspores, some egg cells degraded during differentiation in esd1 mutants, thereby hindering subsequent fertilization process and reducing seed setting rate. In addition, the transcriptional level of O. sativa anaphase-promoting complex 6, a reported embryo sac developing gene, was significantly reduced in esd1 mutants. These results support that ESD1 is an important modulator of ESD and seed setting rate in rice. Together, this finding demonstrates that ESD1 positively regulates the seed setting rate by controlling ESD in rice and has implications for the improvement of rice yield.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Flowers", "Loss of Function Mutation", "Oryza", "Ovule", "Plant Proteins", "Pollen Tube", "Pollination", "Seeds"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiankang", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha 410125, China."}, {"First Name": "Yixing", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha 410125, China."}, {"First Name": "Shufeng", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha 410125, China."}, {"First Name": "Mudan", "Last Name": "Qiu", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha 410125, China."}, {"First Name": "Licheng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Chengxia", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha 410125, China."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha 410125, China."}, {"First Name": "Lei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China."}], "Journal": "Plant physiology", "PubDate": "2021Jun11"}, {"PMID": "33733410", "Title": "Particle size distribution and pollutant dissolution characteristics of road-deposited sediment in different land-use districts: a case study of Beijing.", "Abstract": "The high pollutants loading of road-deposited sediment (RDS) make it the main threat to receiving water bodies in stormwater management; however, the characteristics of RDS have not yet been sufficiently studied.

Sulfide (S2-) is a potentially important factor that influences the role of denitrification and DNRA.

This study investigated the effects of long-term (108\u00a0d) S2- addition on nitrate reduction pathways and microbial communities in the sediments of two different freshwater lakes. The results show that the increasing S2- addition enhanced the coupling of S2- oxidation with denitrification instead of DNRA. The sulfide-oxidizing denitrifier, Thiobacillus, was significantly enriched in the incubations of both lake samples with S2- addition, which indicates that it may be the key genus driving sulfide-oxidizing denitrification in the lake sediments. During S2- incubation of the Hongze Lake sample, which had lower inherent organic carbon (C) and sulfate (SO42-), Thiobacillus was more enriched and played a dominant role in the microbial community; while during that of the Nansi Lake sample, which had higher inherent organic C and SO42-, Thiobacillus was less enriched, but increasing abundances of sulfate reducing bacteria (Desulfomicrobium, Desulfatitalea and Geothermobacter) were observed. Moreover, sulfide-oxidizing denitrifiers and sulfate reducers were enriched in the Nansi Lake control treatment without external S2- input, which suggests that internal sulfate release may promote the cooperation between sulfide-oxidizing denitrifiers and sulfate reducers.

Moreover, the XPS spectra of as-prepared and used NiCo2O4 catalyst showed that Co ions might indirectly promote the catalytic ozonation process as the Lewis acid sites, while the Ni2+/Ni3+ cycle in the catalyst played a vital role in catalyzing ozone to generate free radicals and enhancing the mineralization capacity of NiCo2O4/O3 system.", "Keywords": ["Antibiotics", "Catalytic ozonation", "NiCo(2)O(4)", "Sulfamethazine"], "MeSH terms": ["Catalysis", "Ozone", "Sulfamethazine", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hai", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Waste Treatment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China.

Here, we prepared a novel aluminum-graphite (Al-Gr) composite, which was capable of high-efficient production of H2O2 through selective O2 reduction via a two-electron pathway. We discovered the production of H2O2 at a wide pH range, which could be enhanced by optimizing Al-Gr synthesis conditions. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) addition could promote the formation of a welding interface and porous structure between Al and Gr in the Al-Gr composite, which enhanced the galvanic corrosion of Al0, the selectivity of oxygen reduction via the two-electron pathway, and the mass transfer of O2 in the Al-Gr/O2 system. The formation of Al4C3 could be regulated by sintering temperature and sintering time, which could promote the intergranular corrosion of Al0 and enhance the mass transfer of O2 by reaction with water to generate the porous structure in the Al-Gr composite. The concentration of H2O2 reached 777.5 mg/L at an initial pH of 9.0, an Al-Gr dosage of 8 g/L, and an O2 gas flow rate of 400 mL/min. The possible mechanisms of Al-Gr synthesis and H2O2 production in the Al-Gr/O2 system were proposed. The Al-Gr composite was effective for the in situ production of H2O2, which could be further decomposed into a hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) by Al0 in the Al-Gr composite.

Transcriptome-wide mapping in ESCs reveals hundreds of messenger RNAs marked by 5hmC at sites characterized by a defined unique consensus sequence and particular features. During differentiation a large number of transcripts, including many encoding key pluripotency-related factors (such as Eed and Jarid2), show decreased cytosine hydroxymethylation. Using Tet-knockout ESCs, we find Tet enzymes to be partly responsible for deposition of 5hmC in mRNA. A transcriptome-wide search further reveals mRNA targets to which Tet1 and Tet2 bind, at sites showing a topology similar to that of 5hmC sites. Tet-mediated RNA hydroxymethylation is found to reduce the stability of crucial pluripotency-promoting transcripts.

The maximum sorption capacities of Sr2+ by PA, PS and PP were 31.8, 51.4 and 52.4 \u03bcg g-1, respectively, with the initial Sr2+concentration of 3400 \u03bcg L-1. The phenomenological models adequately described the sorption kinetics data, concluding that the internal diffusion was the limiting step for Sr2+ sorption onto PS; while the external and internal diffusion were the slowest steps in the case of PA and PP. The MD study revealed that the main sorption mechanism was electrostatic interaction. The interaction energies of PA-SrCl2, PS-SrCl2, and PP-SrCl2 were -5.638, -6.418, and -13.05 kcal mol-1.", "Keywords": ["Mass transfer step", "Microplastics", "Molecular dynamic simulation", "Sorption", "Sr(2+)"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xuan", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Yong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu 610066, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Waste Treatment, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, PR China.

The prevalence of antibiotics in WWTPs among different periods (1999-2009 and 2010-2019) and geographical areas (Europe, America, Asia and Africa) was summarized, analyzed and evaluated. The classes of macrolides (clarithromycin, erythromycin/erythromycin-H2O, azithromycin, roxithromycin), sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole), trimethoprim, quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin) and tetracyclines (tetracycline) were the antibiotics most frequently detected, while bla (blaCTXM, blaTEM), sul (sul1, sul2), tet (tetO, tetQ, tetW) and ermB genes were the ARGs commonly reported in WWTPs.

In this study, the codoping of g-C3N4 with bimetallic oxides (iron and cobalt) and oxygen was investigated to enhance its catalytic capability. The results showed that iron, cobalt, and oxygen codoped g-C3N4 (Fe-Co-O-g-C3N4) was successfully prepared, which was capable of completely degrading sulfamethoxazole (SMX) (0.04 mM) within 30 min, with a reaction rate of 0.085 min-1, indicating the superior catalytic activity of Fe-Co-O-g-C3N4. The mineralization efficiency of SMX was 22.1%. Sulfate radicals and singlet oxygen were detected during the process of PMS activation. However, the role that singlet oxygen played in degrading SMX was not obvious. Surface-bound reactive species and sulfate radicals were responsible for SMX degradation, in which sulfate radicals contributed to 46.6% of SMX degradation. The superior catalytic activity was due to the synergistic effect of metal oxides and O-g-C3N4, in which O-g-C3N4 could act as a carrier and an activator as well as an electron mediator to promote the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and Co(III) to Co(II). Four main steps of SMX degradation were proposed, including direct oxidation of SMX, bond fission of N-C, bond fission of N-S, and bond fission of S-C. The effect of the pH, temperature, PMS concentration, chloridion, bicarbonate, and humic acids on SMX degradation was investigated.

The recovery of spiked milk, milk powder, cheese, and beef ranged from 87.66 to 114.2%. The Nbs-ELISA was not influenced by SpA during the detection of SEB in S. aureus food poisoning.

By directly adjusting protein levels, cells can quickly respond to dynamic transitions during stem cell differentiation and embryonic development. Ribosomes are multisubunit cellular assemblies that mediate translation. Previously seen as invariant machines with the same composition of components in all conditions, recent studies indicate that ribosomes are heterogeneous and that different ribosome types can preferentially translate specific subsets of mRNAs. Such heterogeneity and specialized translation functions are very important in stem cells and development, as they allow cells to quickly respond to stimuli through direct changes of protein abundance. In this review, we discuss ribosome heterogeneity that arises from multiple features of rRNAs, including rRNA variants and rRNA modifications, and ribosomal proteins, including their stoichiometry, compositions, paralogues, and posttranslational modifications.

Combining stimuli-responsive materials with conventional MOF-based adsorbents has been considered an effective method to generate intelligent adsorbents for superior control over the adsorption process. Herein, a smart MOF-based ratiometric fluorescent adsorbent was designed to accurately monitor the progression of the removal of copper ions with dual-emitting fluorescence signal. Unlike the traditional difunctional materials, this delicately designed platform overcomes the huge energy gap to achieve two functions simultaneously. This unconventional platform provides a reliable fluorescent response toward Cu2+ during the removing process, changing linearly related to the degree of the adsorption process, which holds extreme promise in effectively monitoring the adsorption process. The underlying relationship of the adsorption and fluorescence response process toward copper was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

High-throughput sequencing data demonstrated that the predominant bacterial phyla include Proteobacteria (35.99% for Cd-polluted soil and 35.22% for the control soil), Chloroflexi (21.33% and 20.58%), Actinobacteria (12.00% and 12.89%), Acidobacteria (7.47% and 11.14%), Bacteroidetes (7.37% and 6.96%), Gemmatimonadetes (5.60% and 6.65%), Firmicutes (2.82% and 1.86%), Planctomycetes (2.47% and 0.95%), Saccharibacteria (1.26% and 1.11%). The predominant fungal phyla was Ascomycota, with the relative abundance of 89.96% for the control soil and 86.2% for the Cd-polluted soil. S.\u00a0bicolor could grow well in sandy clay loam soil in northern China at low Cd lvel, but it could not accumulate cadmium at higher cadmium level. S.\u00a0bicolor could be used for phytoextraction of cadmium from the lightly Cd-polluted soil.", "Keywords": ["Cadmium", "Microbial community", "Phytoremediation", "Soil remediation", "Sorghum bicolor"], "MeSH terms": ["Bacteria", "Biodegradation, Environmental", "Cadmium", "China", "Microbiota", "Plant Development", "Soil", "Soil Microbiology", "Soil Pollutants", "Sorghum"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Can", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, PR China.

Although some salt responsive genes have been identified in rice, their applications in developing salt tolerant cultivars have resulted in limited achievements. Herein, we used bioinformatic approaches to perform a meta-analysis of three transcriptome datasets from salinity and control conditions in order to reveal novel genes and the molecular pathways underlying rice response to salt. From a total of 28,432 expressed genes, we identify 457 core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) constitutively responding to salt, regardless of the stress duration, genotype, or the tissue. Gene co-expression analysis divided the core DEGs into three different modules, each of them contributing to salt response in a unique metabolic pathway. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses highlighted key biological processes and metabolic pathways involved in the salt response. We identified important novel hub genes encoding proteins of different families including CAM, DUF630/632, DUF581, CHL27, PP2-13, LEA4-5, and transcription factors, which could be functionally characterized using reverse genetic experiments.

At present, the activation performance of carbon materials for persulfate is usually characterized by the removal efficiency of organic pollutants. However, the kinetics of persulfate activation by carbon materials has not been investigated. In this study, the kinetics of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and sludge-derived biochar (BC) were investigated. The experimental results showed that the kinetics of PMS activation followed the two-phase kinetic model (fast phase (a1) and slow phase (a2)). In the absence of organic pollutants, the a1 and a2 were calculated to be 0.320 and 0.0471 min-1 for BC, respectively, and 0.322 and 0.0850 min-1 for RGO, respectively. Based on the characterization of BC and RGO, it can be concluded that the fast phase was mainly due to the formation of surface-bound active species. Competitive adsorption between PMS and targeted pollutants decreased the kinetic constant for the first phase (a1) and the kinetic constant for the second phase (a2) for both BC and RGO. The value of a1 and a2 increased for BC after the addition of phenol, due to the enhanced PMS activation by surface adsorbed phenol. The increase of phenol concentration decreased slightly the value of a1 and a2. The increase of PMS concentration increased significantly the value of a1 and a2. The decrease of a1 and a2 in repeated use of carbon materials could be due to the decrease of oxygen-containing functional groups and defect intensity.", "Keywords": ["Activation kinetics", "Activation mechanism", "Antibiotics", "Carbon materials", "Peroxymonosulfate"], "MeSH terms": ["Adsorption", "Carbon", "Catalysis", "Charcoal", "Graphite", "Kinetics", "Peroxides", "Phenol"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shizong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China."}, {"First Name": "Jianlong", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Radioactive Wastes Treatment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, PR China.

In this work, ampicillin (Amp), a broad-spectrum antibiotic against bacteria, was employed as an ideal Ab replacer to anchor cells of target bacteria. By coating Amp on magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs), the Amp-MNPs showed remarkable binding, separation and enrichment capacities toward bacteria even under complex sample matrices. To ensure the selectivity of this protocol, anti-S. enteritidis monoclonal antibody was then adopted as the second anchoring agent to form a sandwich complex with Amp-MNPs. Based on these facts, S. enteritidis, as low as 102-103\u202fCFU/mL, could be detected by naked eyes in food samples. Therefore, this creative antibiotic-bacteria-antibody LFA sandwich pattern shows great application potential in the monitoring of food contamination and infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria.

In this study, a series of classic organic ligand-based luminescence MOFs materials with high oxidation state central metals (Al3+, Zr4+, Cr3+, Fe3+, and Ti4+) were synthesized and were screened to achieve simultaneously Hg2+ detection and removal through the strong coordination of amino groups or nitrogen centers with Hg2+ and the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of MOFs regulated by the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect. Among these checked materials, NH2-MIL-53(Al) exhibited the excellent ability for Hg2+ detection with wide response interval (1-17.3 \u03bcM), low detection limit (0.15 \u03bcM), good selectivity, wide pH adaptation (4.0-10.0), and strong anti-interference ability. Meanwhile, the resultant NH2-MIL-53(Al) possessed an efficient removal capability toward Hg2+, accompanied by a fast uptake kinetics (within 60 min) and large loading capacity (153.85 mg g-1). Furthermore, NH2-MIL-53(Al) also displayed satisfactory stability before and after Hg2+ treatment because of the formation of strong coordination bonds between high oxidation state aluminum (Al3+) and organic carboxylate ligands. Notably, the prepared NH2-MIL-53(Al) had no significant loss of adsorption performance even after being reused four times.
