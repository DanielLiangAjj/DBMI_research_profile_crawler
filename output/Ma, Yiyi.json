We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/'proxy' AD cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the APOE \u03b54 allele.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

We estimated episodic memory trajectories in 35,245 ethnically diverse older adults representing eight independent cohorts. We conducted apolipoprotein E (APOE)-stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses and combined individual cohorts' results via meta-analysis. Three independent transcriptomics datasets were used to further interpret GWAS signals.

Brain transcriptomics revealed an association between episodic memory maintenance and (1) increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex DCDC2 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a03.8 x 10-4 ) and (2) lower burden of pathological Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmarks (paired helical fragment tau P\u00a0=\u00a0.003, and amyloid beta load P\u00a0=\u00a0.008). Additional transcriptomics results comparing AD and cognitively healthy brain samples showed a downregulation of DCDC2 levels in superior temporal gyrus (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007) and inferior frontal gyrus (P\u00a0=\u00a0.013).

One thing is clear: no single layer of molecular or \"omic\" data is sufficient to capture the variance of AD or aging-related cognitive decline. Nonetheless, reproducible findings are emerging from current efforts, and there is evidence of convergence using different approaches.

However, measuring a large number of environmental factors at high granularity might not always be feasible. Instead, here we propose extracting cellular embedding of environmental factors from gene expression data by using latent variable (LV) analysis and taking these LVs as environmental proxies in detecting gene-by-environment (GxE) interaction effects on gene expression, i.e., GxE expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Applying this approach to two largest brain eQTL datasets (n = 1,100), we show that LVs and GxE eQTLs in one dataset replicate well in the other dataset. Combining the two samples via meta-analysis, 895 GxE eQTLs are identified. On average, GxE effect explains an additional \u223c4% variation in expression of each gene that displays a GxE effect. Ten of these 52 genes are associated with cell-type-specific eQTLs, and the remaining genes are multi-functional. Furthermore, after substituting LVs with expression of transcription factors (TF), we found 91 TF-specific eQTLs, which demonstrates an important use of our brain GxE eQTLs.", "Keywords": ["cell-type specificity", "cellular embedding of environment", "context-specific genotype effects", "eQTL", "gene by environment interactions", "gene expression"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Genotype", "Humans", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bernard", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6T 1Z4; Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Casazza", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6T 1Z4; Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ellis", "Last Name": "Patrick", "Affiliation": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Shinya", "Last Name": "Tasaki", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gherman", "Last Name": "Novakovsky", "Affiliation": "Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Felsky", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yiyi", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Gaiteri", "Affiliation": "Rush Alzheimer Disease Center, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA."}, {"First Name": "Philip L", "Last Name": "De Jager", "Affiliation": "Center for Translational and Computational Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Mostafavi", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics and Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6T 1Z4; Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Child and Brain Development Program, Toronto M5G 1M1, Canada.

We conducted a genome-wide association study using a sliding-window approach to measure the combined effects of CGSes on AD risk in a discovery sample of 24 European ancestry cohorts (12,181 cases, 12,601 controls) from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and replication sample of seven European ancestry cohorts (7,554 cases, 27,382 controls) from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP).

An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested ~1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls). The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families). We identified novel and predicted functional genetic variants in genes previously associated with AD. We also detected associations in three novel genes: IGHG3 (p\u2009=\u20099.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), an immunoglobulin gene whose antibodies interact with \u03b2-amyloid, a long non-coding RNA AC099552.4 (p\u2009=\u20091.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), and a zinc-finger protein ZNF655 (gene-based p\u2009=\u20095.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6).

Genotype calling of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion-deletion variants (indels) was performed centrally using GATK-HaplotypeCaller and Atlas V2. The ADSP Quality Control (QC) Working Group applied QC protocols to project-level variant call format files (VCFs) from each pipeline, and developed and implemented a novel protocol, termed \"consensus calling,\" to combine genotype calls from both pipelines into a single high-quality set. QC was applied to autosomal bi-allelic SNVs and indels, and included pipeline-recommended QC filters, variant-level QC, and sample-level QC. Low-quality variants or genotypes were excluded, and sample outliers were noted. Quality was assessed by examining Mendelian inconsistencies (MIs) among 67 parent-offspring pairs, and MIs were used to establish additional genotype-specific filters for GATK calls. After QC, 578 subjects remained. Pipeline-specific QC excluded ~12.0% of GATK and 14.5% of Atlas SNVs. Between pipelines, ~91% of SNV genotypes across all QCed variants were concordant; 4.23% and 4.56% of genotypes were exclusive to Atlas or GATK, respectively; the remaining ~0.01% of discordant genotypes were excluded. For indels, variant-level QC excluded ~36.8% of GATK and 35.3% of Atlas indels. Between pipelines, ~55.6% of indel genotypes were concordant; while 10.3% and 28.3% were exclusive to Atlas or GATK, respectively; and ~0.29% of discordant genotypes were. The final WGS consensus dataset contains 27,896,774 SNVs and 3,133,926 indels and is publicly available.", "Keywords": ["Atlas", "Consensus calling", "GATK", "Mendelian inconsistencies", "Quality control", "Whole genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Alzheimer Disease", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Male", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Quality Control", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam C", "Last Name": "Naj", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.
