Two major drivers of glucocorticoid-related neurotoxicity are mitochondrial dysfunction and Tau pathology; however, the molecular/cellular mechanisms precipitating these events, and their causal relationship, remain unclear. Using cultured murine hippocampal neurons and 4-5-month-old mice treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, we investigate the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced mitochondrial damage and Tau pathology. We find that glucocorticoids stimulate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore via transcriptional upregulation of its activating component, cyclophilin D. Inhibition of cyclophilin D is protective against glucocorticoid-induced mitochondrial damage as well as Tau phosphorylation and oligomerization in cultured neurons. We further identify the mitochondrially-targeted compound mito-apocynin as an inhibitor of glucocorticoid-induced permeability transition pore opening, and show that this compound protects against mitochondrial dysfunction, Tau pathology, synaptic loss, and behavioural deficits induced by glucocorticoids in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that mito-apocynin and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone rescue Tau pathology in cytoplasmic hybrid cells, an ex vivo Alzheimer's disease model wherein endogenous mitochondria are replaced with mitochondria from Alzheimer's subjects. These findings show that mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening is a precipitating factor in glucocorticoid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and that this event stimulates Tau pathogenesis.

Whether Rab35 is also involved in A\u03b2 overproduction remains an open question. Here, we find that hippocampal Rab35 levels are decreased not only by stress/GC but also by aging, another AD risk factor. Moreover, we show that Rab35 negatively regulates A\u03b2 production by sorting amyloid precursor protein (APP) and \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) out of the endosomal network, where they interact to produce A\u03b2.

In light of the limited cognitive benefit of the direct antagonism of NMDA receptors in AD, we here focus on an alternative way to modify glutamatergic signaling through positive allosteric modulation of AMPA receptors, by the use of a PAM-AMPA compound. Using non-transgenic animal model of A\u03b2 oligomer injection as well as the combined stress and A\u03b2 i.c.v. infusion, we demonstrate that positive allosteric modulation of AMPA receptors by PAM-AMPA treatment reverted memory, but not mood, deficits. Furthermore, PAM-AMPA treatment reverted stress/A\u03b2-driven synaptic missorting of Tau and associated Fyn/GluN2B-driven excitotoxic synaptic signaling accompanied by recovery of neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that positive allosteric modulation of AMPA receptors restores synaptic integrity and cognitive performance in stress- and A\u03b2-evoked hippocampal pathology.

By visualizing MT plus-end dynamics at individual excitatory en passant boutons in axons of cultured hippocampal neurons and in hippocampal slices expressing EB3-EGFP and vGlut1-mCherry, we found that dynamic MTs preferentially grow from presynaptic boutons, show biased directionality in that they are almost always oriented toward the distal tip of the axon, and can be induced by neuronal activity. Silencing of \u03b3-tubulin expression reduced presynaptic MT nucleation, and depletion of either HAUS1 or HAUS7-augmin subunits increased the percentage of retrograde comets initiated at boutons, indicating that \u03b3-tubulin and augmin are required for activity-dependent de novo nucleation of uniformly distally oriented dynamic MTs. We analyzed the dynamics of a wide range of axonal organelles as well as synaptic vesicles (SVs) relative to vGlut1+ stable presynaptic boutons in a time window during which MT nucleation at boutons is promoted upon induction of neuronal activity, and we found that \u03b3-tubulin-dependent presynaptic MT nucleation controls bidirectional (SV) interbouton transport and regulates evoked SV exocytosis.

SAP97 is a PSD protein with two N-terminal isoforms, \u03b1 and \u03b2, that have opposing effects on synaptic strength thought to result from differential targeting of AMPA receptors into distinct synaptic versus extrasynaptic locations, respectively. In this study, we have applied dSTORM super resolution imaging in order to localize the synaptic and extrasynaptic pools of AMPA receptors in neurons expressing \u03b1 or \u03b2SAP97. Unexpectedly, we observed that both \u03b1 and \u03b2SAP97 enhanced the localization of AMPA receptors at synapses. However, this occurred via different mechanisms: \u03b1SAP97 increased PSD size and consequently the number of receptor binding sites, whilst \u03b2SAP97 increased synaptic receptor cluster size and surface AMPA receptor density at the PSD edge and surrounding perisynaptic sites without changing PSD size. \u03b1SAP97 also strongly enlarged presynaptic active zone protein clusters, consistent with both presynaptic and postsynaptic enhancement underlying the previously observed \u03b1SAP97-induced increase in AMPA receptor-mediated currents. In contrast, \u03b2SAP97-expressing neurons increased the proportion of immature filopodia that express higher levels of AMPA receptors, decreased the number of functional presynaptic terminals, and also reduced the size of the dendritic tree and delayed the maturation of mushroom spines. Our data reveal that SAP97 isoforms can specifically regulate surface AMPA receptor nanodomain clusters, with \u03b2SAP97 increasing extrasynaptic receptor domains at peri-synaptic and filopodial sites. Moreover, \u03b2SAP97 negatively regulates synaptic maturation both structurally and functionally. These data support diverging presynaptic and postsynaptic roles of SAP97 N-terminal isoforms in synapse maturation and plasticity.

Accumulating evidence indicates that Parkin also has an important role in excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission, although its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we investigate Parkin's role at glutamatergic synapses of rat hippocampal neurons. We find that Parkin-deficient neurons exhibit significantly reduced AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated currents and cell-surface expression, and that these phenotypes result from decreased postsynaptic expression of the adaptor protein Homer1, which is necessary for coupling AMPAR endocytic zones with the postsynaptic density. Accordingly, Parkin loss of function leads to the reduced density of postsynaptic endocytic zones and to impaired AMPAR internalization. These findings demonstrate a novel and essential role for Parkin in glutamatergic neurotransmission, as a stabilizer of postsynaptic Homer1 and the Homer1-linked endocytic machinery necessary for maintaining normal cell-surface AMPAR levels.", "Keywords": ["AMPA receptor", "Homer", "Parkin", "endocytic zone", "synapse"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Endocytosis", "Female", "Glutamic Acid", "Male", "Neural Inhibition", "Neurons", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Rats, Transgenic", "Receptors, AMPA", "Synaptic Transmission", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giuseppe P", "Last Name": "Cortese", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Mei", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology."}, {"First Name": "Damian", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Columbia Stem Cell Core Facility, Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, and."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Heath", "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa L", "Last Name": "Waites", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, cw2622@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2016Nov30"}, {"PMID": "27535913", "Title": "Activity-Dependent Degradation of Synaptic Vesicle Proteins Requires Rab35 and the ESCRT Pathway.", "Abstract": "Synaptic vesicle (SV) pools must maintain a functional repertoire of proteins to efficiently release neurotransmitter. The accumulation of old or damaged proteins on SV membranes is linked to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. However, despite the importance of SV protein turnover for neuronal health, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Here, we have used dissociated rat hippocampal neurons to investigate the pathway for SV protein degradation. We find that neuronal activity drives the degradation of a subset of SV proteins and that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and SV-associated GTPase Rab35 are key elements of this use-dependent degradative pathway. Specifically, neuronal activity induces Rab35 activation and binding to the ESCRT-0 protein Hrs, which we have identified as a novel Rab35 effector. These actions recruit the downstream ESCRT machinery to SV pools, thereby initiating SV protein degradation via the ESCRT pathway. Our findings show that the Rab35/ESCRT pathway facilitates the activity-dependent removal of specific proteins from SV pools, thereby maintaining presynaptic protein homeostasis.", "Keywords": ["ESCRT", "Hrs", "Rab35", "SV2", "VAMP2", "synaptic vesicle"], "MeSH terms": ["6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione", "Animals", "Biological Transport", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Endocytosis", "Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport", "Excitatory Amino Acids", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurons", "RNA, Small Cytoplasmic", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction", "Synaptic Vesicles", "Valine", "rab GTP-Binding Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Sheehan", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and."}, {"First Name": "Mei", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Beskow", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and."}, {"First Name": "Cyndel", "Last Name": "Vollmer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa L", "Last Name": "Waites", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032 cw2622@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2016Aug17"}, {"PMID": "26160654", "Title": "Presynaptic active zones in invertebrates and vertebrates.", "Abstract": "The regulated release of neurotransmitter occurs via the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at specialized regions of the presynaptic membrane called active zones (AZs). These regions are defined by a cytoskeletal matrix assembled at AZs (CAZ), which functions to direct SVs toward docking and fusion sites and supports their maturation into the readily releasable pool. In addition, CAZ proteins localize voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels at SV release sites, bringing the fusion machinery in close proximity to the calcium source. Proteins of the CAZ therefore ensure that vesicle fusion is temporally and spatially organized, allowing for the precise and reliable release of neurotransmitter. Importantly, AZs are highly dynamic structures, supporting presynaptic remodeling, changes in neurotransmitter release efficacy, and thus presynaptic forms of plasticity.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the temporal and spatial assembly of presynaptic F-actin remain largely unknown. Similar to other F-actin rich membrane specializations, presynaptic boutons contain a set of molecules that respond to cellular cues and trans-synaptic signals to facilitate activity-dependent assembly of F-actin. The presynaptic active zone (AZ) protein Piccolo has recently been identified as a key regulator of neurotransmitter release during SV cycling. It does so by coordinating the activity-dependent assembly of F-Actin and the dynamics of key plasticity molecules including Synapsin1, Profilin and CaMKII. The multidomain structure of Piccolo, its exquisite association with the AZ, and its ability to interact with a number of actin-associated proteins suggest that Piccolo may function as a platform to coordinate the spatial assembly of F-actin. Here we have identified Daam1, a Formin that functions with Profilin to drive F-actin assembly, as a novel Piccolo binding partner. We also found that within cells Daam1 activation promotes Piccolo binding, an interaction that can spatially direct the polymerization of F-Actin. Moreover, similar to Piccolo and Profilin, Daam1 loss of function impairs presynaptic-F-actin assembly in neurons. These data suggest a model in which Piccolo directs the assembly of presynaptic F-Actin from the AZ by scaffolding key actin regulatory proteins including Daam1.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "Animals", "COS Cells", "Cell Membrane", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Female", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Mice", "Neuropeptides", "Presynaptic Terminals", "Protein Binding", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Transport", "Pseudopodia", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Stress Fibers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dhananjay", "Last Name": "Wagh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Nancy Pritzker Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ryan", "Last Name": "Terry-Lorenzo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Nancy Pritzker Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa L", "Last Name": "Waites", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology Columbia University New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sergio A", "Last Name": "Leal-Ortiz", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Nancy Pritzker Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Christoph", "Last Name": "Maas", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Nancy Pritzker Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Reimer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences Stanford University and Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, California, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Craig C", "Last Name": "Garner", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Nancy Pritzker Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "23403927", "Title": "Bassoon and Piccolo maintain synapse integrity by regulating protein ubiquitination and degradation.", "Abstract": "The presynaptic active zone (AZ) is a specialized microdomain designed for the efficient and repetitive release of neurotransmitter. Bassoon and Piccolo are two high molecular weight components of the AZ, with hypothesized roles in its assembly and structural maintenance.

In the present study, we have used interference RNAs to eliminate both proteins from glutamatergic synapses, and find that they are essential for maintaining synaptic integrity. Loss of Bassoon and Piccolo leads to the aberrant degradation of multiple presynaptic proteins, culminating in synapse degeneration.
