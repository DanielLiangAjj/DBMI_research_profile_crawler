SCA-induced PTSD is associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular risk, yet no psychotherapeutic treatment has been developed and tested for this population. Exposure therapy is standard treatment for PTSD, but its safety and efficacy remain unconfirmed for SCA survivors: current protocols do not address their specific disease course and have high attrition. Mindfulness-based interventions are typically well-tolerated and have shown promise in reducing PTSD symptoms from other traumas. Objective: This study sought to determine feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of acceptance and mindfulness-based exposure therapy (AMBET), a novel SCA-specific psychotherapy protocol combining mindfulness and exposure-based interventions with cardiac focused psychoeducation to reduce symptoms and improve health behaviors in patients with post-SCA PTSD. Methods: We conducted an open feasibility pilot study from January 2021 to April 2022 with a small sample (N\u2009=\u200911) of SCA survivors meeting DSM-5 PTSD criteria. AMBET comprised eight 90-minute remotely delivered individual sessions. Clinical evaluators assessed PTSD symptoms using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) at baseline, midpoint, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Ten (91%) of 11 enrolled patients completed treatment. Satisfaction was high and patients reported no adverse events. PTSD symptoms significantly improved statistically (P\u2009<\u2009.001) and clinically with large effect sizes (g\u2009=\u20091.34-2.21) and treatment gains sustained at 3-month follow-up. Posttreatment, 80% of completers (n\u2009=\u20098) showed significant treatment response, 70% (n\u2009=\u20097) with PTSD diagnostic remission. No patient reported symptom increases. Conclusions: This initial trial found AMBET feasible, safe, and potentially efficacious in reducing PTSD following SCA. These encouraging pilot results warrant further research.

CMD can be detected by applying machine learning to EEG recorded during motor command presentation in behaviourally unresponsive patients. Identifying patients with CMD carries clinical implications for patient interactions, communication with families, and guidance of therapeutic decisions but underlying mechanisms of CMD remain unknown. By analysing structural lesion patterns and network level dysfunction we tested the hypothesis that, in cases with preserved arousal and command comprehension, a failure to integrate comprehended motor commands with motor outputs underlies CMD. Manual segmentation of T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion weighted imaging sequences quantifying structural injury was performed in consecutive unresponsive patients with acute brain injury (n = 107) who underwent EEG-based CMD assessments and MRI. Lesion pattern analysis was applied to identify lesion patterns common among patients with (n = 21) and without CMD (n = 86). Thalamocortical and cortico-cortical network connectivity were assessed applying ABCD classification of power spectral density plots and weighted pairwise phase consistency (WPPC) to resting EEG, respectively. Two distinct structural lesion patterns were identified on MRI for CMD and three for non-CMD patients. In non-CMD patients, injury to brainstem arousal pathways including the midbrain were seen, while no CMD patients had midbrain lesions. A group of non-CMD patients was identified with injury to the left thalamus, implicating possible language comprehension difficulties. Shared lesion patterns of globus pallidus and putamen were seen for a group of CMD patients, which have been implicated as part of the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in patients with reversible disorders of consciousness. Thalamocortical network dysfunction was less common in CMD patients [ABCD-index 2.3 (interquartile range, IQR 2.1-3.0) versus 1.4 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.0001; presence of D 36% versus 3%, P = 0.0006], but WPPC was not different. Bilateral cortical lesions were seen in patients with and without CMD. Thalamocortical disruption did not differ for those with CMD, but long-range WPPC was decreased in 1-4 Hz [odds ratio (OR) 0.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-0.9] and increased in 14-30 Hz frequency ranges (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.5). These structural and functional data implicate a failure of motor command integration at the anterior forebrain mesocircuit level with preserved thalamocortical network function for CMD patients with subcortical lesions. Amongst patients with bilateral cortical lesions preserved cortico-cortical network function is associated with CMD detection.

Fear-based distress after CA is associated with higher rates of cardiac event recurrence and mortality in CA survivors. As posited in Dyadic Disruption Theory (DDT), cardiac fear in family members may contribute to the development of distress in CA survivors via socially-based mechanisms. Thus, interventions to reduce family distress may improve CA survivors' outcomes. ICU diaries are easy to implement and scalable and show promise for reducing distress after CA but are primarily targeted towards survivors. The primary aim of the Family-Authored ICU Diaries to reduce Fear in Patients Experiencing a CA (FAID Fear) pilot randomized controlled trial was to test feasibility of an ICU diary intervention targeted towards family member distress alone. Family members of patients hospitalized after CA (N = 16) were randomized 2:1 to receive the FAID Fear intervention or usual care. Intervention participants were provided brief instructions and were asked to write in the diary twice per week until the end of hospital care. Assessments occurred at baseline enrollment, end of hospital care, and 30 days later. Participants' mean age was 50.73 years (SD = 13.41; 80% cis-gender female; 60% White).

The objective of this study is to develop and validate a method for automatically identifying segments of intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform data from external ventricular drainage (EVD) recordings during intermittent drainage and closure.Methods. The proposed method uses time-frequency analysis through wavelets to distinguish periods of ICP waveform in EVD data. By comparing the frequency compositions of the ICP signals (when the EVD system is clamped) and the artifacts (when the system is open), the algorithm can detect short, uninterrupted segments of ICP waveform from the longer periods of non-measurement data. The method involves applying a wavelet transform, calculating the absolute power in a specific range, using Otsu thresholding to automatically identify a threshold, and performing a morphological operation to remove small segments. Two investigators manually graded the same randomly selected one-hour segments of the resulting processed data. Performance metrics were calculated as a percentage.Results. The study analyzed data from 229 patients who had EVD placed following subarachnoid hemorrhage between June 2006 and December 2012. Of these, 155 (67.7%) were female and 62 (27%) developed delayed cerebral ischemia. A total of 45 150 h of data were segmented. 2044 one-hour segments were randomly selected and evaluated by two investigators (MM and DN). Of those, the evaluators agreed on the classification of 1556 one-hour segments. The algorithm was able to correctly identify 86% (1338 h) of ICP waveform data. 8.2% (128 h) of the time the algorithm either partially or fully failed to segment the ICP waveform. 5.4% (84 h) of data, artifacts were mistakenly identified as ICP waveforms (false positives).Conclusion. The proposed algorithm automates the identification of valid ICP waveform segments of waveform in EVD data and thus enables the inclusion in real-time data analysis for decision support.

Methods and Results We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients who survived to admission following OHCA from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival, whose catchment area represents ~50% of the United States from 2013-2019. Our primary exposure was race/ethnicity and primary outcome was utilization of TTM. We built a mixed-effects model with both state of arrest and admitting hospital modeled as random intercepts to account for clustering. Among 96,695 patients (24.6% Black, 8.0% Hispanic/Latino, 63.4% White), a smaller percentage of Hispanic/Latino patients received TTM than Black or White patients (37.5% vs. 45.0 % vs 43.3%, P < .001) following OHCA. In the mixed-effects model, Black patients (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.153, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.102-1.207, P < .001) and Hispanic/Latino patients (OR 1.086, 95% CI 1.017-1.159, P < .001) were slightly more likely to receive TTM compared to White patients, perhaps due to worse admission neurological status. We did find community level disparity as Hispanic/Latino-serving hospitals (defined as the top decile of hospitals that cared for the highest proportion of Hispanic/Latino patients) provided less TTM (OR 0.587, 95% CI 0.474 to 0.742, P < .001). Conclusions Reassuringly, we did not find evidence of intrahospital or interpersonal racial or ethnic disparity in the provision of TTM.

In fact, they need a solid neuroscience foundation for their clinical experiences in all other medical disciplines also because the nervous system plays such a critical role in the function of every organ system. Because of the rapid pace of neuroscience discoveries, it is unrealistic to expect students to master the entire field. It is also unnecessary, as students can expect to have ready access to electronic reference sources no matter where they practice. In the preclerkship phase of medical school, the focus should be on providing students with the foundational knowledge to use those resources effectively and interpret them correctly. This article describes an organizational framework for teaching the essential neuroscience background needed by all physicians. This is particularly germane at a time when many medical schools are reassessing traditional practices and instituting curricular changes such as competency-based approaches, earlier clinical immersion, and increased emphasis on active learning. This article reviews factors that should be considered when developing the preclerkship neuroscience curriculum, including goals and objectives for the curriculum, the general topics to include, teaching and assessment methodology, who should direct the course, and the areas of expertise of faculty who might be enlisted as teachers or content experts. These guidelines were developed by a work group of experienced educators appointed by the Undergraduate Education Subcommittee (UES) of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).

We conducted an online survey study between October 29, 2019, and November 15, 2019 with cardiac arrest survivors and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. We queried survivors as to whether they experienced cognitive or psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. Next, we queried both survivors and caregivers on the provision of resources through three metrics: (1) discussions with providers about potential cognitive or psychological symptoms, (2) neurologist or psychologist appointments scheduled by providers, and (3) mental health referrals by providers. We then ran Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests to compare the proportion of survivors and caregivers who reported resource provision (observed values) to the proportion of survivors who reported experiencing cognitive and psychological symptoms, respectively (expected values). We included responses from 167 survivors and 52 caregivers. A total of 73.1% (n\u2009=\u2009122) survivors reported experiencing cognitive symptoms and 67.1% (n\u2009=\u2009112) psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. When compared to these two proportions, provision of resources was significantly lower in all three metrics: (1) fewer discussions with providers about potential for developing cognitive symptoms (31%) and psychological symptoms (26.3%), (2) fewer neurologist appointments scheduled (8.4%) and psychologist appointments scheduled (4.8%), and (3) fewer referrals to mental health (6%).

Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, the influence of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions on ICH outcomes has not been investigated. We hypothesized that patients with ICH who receive ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions would have worse platelet recovery (using absolute count increment [ACI]) and neurological outcomes (mortality and poor modified Rankin Scale [mRS 4-6]) than those receiving ABO-compatible transfusions. In a single-center cohort of consecutively admitted patients with ICH, we identified 125 patients receiving acute platelet transfusions, of whom 47 (38%) received an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Using quantile regression, we identified an association of ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion with lower platelet recovery (ACI, 2 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL vs 15 \u00d7 103cells per \u03bcL; adjusted coefficient \u03b2, -19; 95% confidence interval [CI], -35.55 to -4.44; P = .01). ABO-incompatible platelet transfusion was also associated with increased odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00-6.73; P = .05) and poor mRS (adjusted OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 0.97-13.42; P = .06); however, these estimates were imprecise.

Recent work has challenged this notion by demonstrating that this region can contribute to many domains of cognition beyond long-term memory, including perception and attention. One potential reason why the MTL (and hippocampus specifically) contributes broadly to cognition is that it contains relational representations-representations of multidimensional features of experience and their unique relationship to one another-that are useful in many different cognitive domains. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the hippocampus/MTL plays a critical role in attention and perception via relational representations. We compared human participants with MTL damage to healthy age- and education-matched individuals on attention tasks that varied in relational processing demands. On each trial, participants viewed two images (rooms with paintings). On \"similar room\" trials, they judged whether the rooms had the same spatial layout from a different perspective. On \"similar art\" trials, they judged whether the paintings could have been painted by the same artist. On \"identical\" trials, participants simply had to detect identical paintings or rooms. MTL lesion patients were significantly and selectively impaired on the similar room task. This work provides further evidence that the hippocampus/MTL plays a ubiquitous role in cognition by virtue of its relational and spatial representations and highlights its important contributions to rapid perceptual processes that benefit from attention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Attention", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Memory, Long-Term", "Space Perception", "Temporal Lobe"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas A", "Last Name": "Ruiz", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Michael R", "Last Name": "Meager", "Affiliation": "New York University."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mariam", "Last Name": "Aly", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "PubDate": "2020Sep"}, {"PMID": "32385835", "Title": "Respiratory and Blood Stream Infections are Associated with Subsequent Venous Thromboembolism After Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage.", "Abstract": "Infection and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are associated with worse outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

We sought to identify predictors and the long-term impact of treatment failure with hypertensive therapy for symptomatic vasospasm. Methods- We performed a retrospective analysis of 1520 subarachnoid hemorrhage patients prospectively enrolled in the Columbia University SAH Outcomes Project between August 1996 and August 2012. One hundred ninety-eight symptomatic vasospasm patients were treated with vasopressors to raise arterial blood pressure, with and without volume expansion. Treatment response, defined as complete or near-complete resolution of the initial neurological deficit, was adjudicated in weekly meetings of the study team based on serial clinical examination after hypertensive treatment. Outcome was evaluated at 1 year with the modified Rankin Scale. Results- Twenty-one percent of the 198 patients who received hypertensive therapy did not respond to treatment. Treatment failure was associated with an increased risk of death or severe disability at 1 year (modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6; 62% versus 25%; P<0.001). Failure of medical therapy was also associated with an admission troponin I level >0.3 \u03bcg/L (64% versus 28%; P=0.001), aneurysm coiling (43% versus 20%; P=0.004), and involvement of >1 symptomatic vascular territory at onset (39% versus 22%; P=0.02). In multivariable analysis, treatment failure was independently associated only with troponin I elevation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.69-11.09; P=0.002). Conclusions- Failure to respond to induced hypertension for symptomatic vasospasm threatens 1-year outcome. Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with symptomatic vasospasm who have elevated initial troponin I levels, indicative of neurogenic cardiac injury, are at twice the risk of medical treatment failure. Expedited endovascular therapy should be considered in these patients.", "Keywords": ["hypertension", "risk factors", "subarachnoid hemorrhage", "treatment failure", "vasospasm"], "MeSH terms":

Despite therapeutic anticoagulation levels, worsening cerebral edema and progression to coma prompted endovascular treatment. Failed endovascular thrombectomy attempts led to placement of 2 separate indwelling microcatheters for continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).

Whole blood coagulation testing using Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) from simultaneous samples taken intracranially (via cerebral microcatheters) and peripherally (via antecubital vein) all revealed prolonged intrinsic pathway activation clotting times consistent with heparin anticoagulation use. However, both intracranial ROTEM samples identified faster clotting times compared to the peripheral sample suggesting lower anticoagulation levels intracranially.

These counterintuitive observations are examples of the \"obesity paradox.\" Does the obesity paradox exist in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)? In this study the authors examined whether there was an association between obesity and functional outcome in patients with ICH.METHODSThe authors analyzed 202 patients admitted to the neurological ICU (NICU) who were prospectively enrolled in the Columbia University ICH Outcomes Project between September 2009 and December 2012. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: overweight (body mass index [BMI] \u2265 25 kg/m2) and not overweight (BMI < 25 kg/m2). The primary outcome was defined as survival with favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-3) versus death or severe disability (mRS score 4-6) at 3 months.RESULTSThe mean age of the patients in the study was 61 years. The mean BMI was 28 \u00b1 6 kg/m2. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10 \u00b1 4 and the mean ICH score was 1.9 \u00b1 1.3. The overall 90-day mortality rate was 41%. Among patients with a BMI < 25 kg/m2, 24% (17/70) had a good outcome, compared with 39% (52/132) among those with a BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2 (p = 0.03). After adjusting for ICH score, sex, do-not-resuscitate code status, and history of hypertension, being overweight or obese (BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2) was associated with twice the odds of having a good outcome compared with patients with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (adjusted odds ratio 2.05, 95% confidence interval 1.03-4.06, p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONSIn patients with ICH admitted to the NICU, being overweight or obese (BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2) was associated with favorable outcome after adjustment for established predictors.

The authors sought to determine its frequency, predictors, and impact on functional outcome. METHODS The authors prospectively studied UEAV in a cohort of 1286 consecutively admitted patients with aSAH between August 1996 and June 2013. Admission clinical, radiographic, and acute clinical course information was documented during patient hospitalization. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were generated to assess predictors of UEAV and its relationship to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and outcome. Multiple imputation methods were used to address data lost to follow-up. RESULTS The cohort incidence rate of UEAV was 4.6%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, sentinel bleed, and poor admission clinical grade were significantly associated with UEAV. Patients with UEAV had a 2-fold increased risk of DCI (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, p = 0.002) and cerebral infarction (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.9, p = 0.04), after adjusting for known predictors. Excluding patients who experienced sentinel bleeding did not change this effect. Patients with UEAV also had a significantly higher hazard for DCI in a multivariable model. UEAV was not found to be significantly associated with poor functional outcome (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6, p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS UEAV may be less frequent than has been reported previously. Patients who exhibit UEAV are at higher risk for refractory DCI that results in cerebral infarction. These patients may benefit from earlier monitoring for signs of DCI and more aggressive treatment. Further study is needed to determine the long-term functional significance of UEAV.", "Keywords": ["ACA = anterior cerebral artery", "APACHE-II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II", "CI = confidence interval", "CTA = CT angiography", "DCI = delayed cerebral ischemia", "DSA = digital subtraction angiography", "HR = hazard ratio", "ICA = internal carotid artery", "MAP = mean arterial pressure", "MCA = middle cerebral artery", "OR = odd ratio", "PCoA = posterior communicating artery", "SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage", "UEAV = ultra-early angiographic vasospasm", "cerebral infarction", "cerebral vasospasm", "delayed cerebral ischemia", "functional recovery", "mRS = modified Rankin Scale", "subarachnoid hemorrhage", "vascular disorders"], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Ischemia", "Cerebral Infarction", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Infarction", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage", "Vasospasm, Intracranial"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Fawaz", "Last Name": "Al-Mufti", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Shouri", "Last Name": "Lahiri", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Emma", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Jens", "Last Name": "Witsch", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Peter", "Last Name": "Frey", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Neha", "Last Name": "Dangayach", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Falo", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Stephan A", "Last Name": "Mayer", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "Philip M", "Last Name": "Meyers", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology and."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Neurosurgery, Columbia University Medical Center;

While massive amounts of data make it difficult for clinicians to extract meaningful signals, these data could provide insight into the state of critically ill patients and guide interventions. We develop uniquely customized computational methods to uncover the causal structure within systemic and brain physiologic measures recorded in a neurological intensive care unit after subarachnoid hemorrhage. While the data have many missing values, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and are composed from a heterogeneous patient population, our advanced imputation and causal inference techniques enable physiologic models to be learned for individuals. Our analyses confirm that complex physiologic relationships including demand and supply of oxygen underlie brain oxygen measurements and that mechanisms for brain swelling early after injury may differ from those that develop in a delayed fashion. These inference methods will enable wider use of ICU data to understand patient physiology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain", "Brain Injuries", "Critical Care", "Critical Illness", "Female", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nervous System Physiological Phenomena", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Shah Atiqur", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yuxiao", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Peter", "Last Name": "Frey", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "J Michael", "Last Name": "Schmidt", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Albers", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cristina Maria", "Last Name": "Falo", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "Division of Critical Care Neurology, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "E Sander", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Kleinberg", "Affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "26992857", "Title": "Global cerebral edema from hypercapnic respiratory acidosis and response to hyperosmolar therapy.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acidosis, Respiratory", "Adult", "Brain Edema", "Humans", "Hypercapnia", "Male", "Osmolar Concentration", "Sodium Chloride"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Roh", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY. dr2753@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Alexander E", "Last Name": "Merkler", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Fawaz", "Last Name": "Al-Mufti", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sachin", "Last Name": "Agarwal", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jan", "Last Name": "Claassen", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Soojin", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "From Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Neurology", "PubDate": "2016Apr19"}, {"PMID": "26905914", "Title": "Unexpected Rapid Improvement and Neurogenic Stunned Myocardium in a Patient With Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy: A Case Report and Literature Review.", "Abstract": "Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy-type Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) is a subset of GBS with either a rapidly improving or protracted course that was first described in China.
