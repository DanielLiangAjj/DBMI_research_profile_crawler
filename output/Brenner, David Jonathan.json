To improve medical response times, we incorporated the G0-Premature Chromosome Condensation (G0-PCC) technique with the Rapid Automated Biodosimetry Tool-II (RABiT-II), creating a faster alternative for large-scale radiation emergencies. Our findings revealed that using a lower concentration of Calyculin A (Cal A) than recommended effectively increased the yield of highly-condensed G0-PCC cells (hPCC). However, integrating recombinant CDK1/Cyclin B kinase, vital for chromosome condensation, proved challenging due to the properties of these proteins affecting interactions with cellular membranes. Interestingly, Cal A alone was capable of inducing chromosome compaction in some G0 cells even in the absence of mitotic kinases, although these chromosomes displayed atypical morphologies. This suggests that Cal A mechanism for compacting G0 chromatin may differ from condensation driven by mitotic kinases. Additionally, we observed a correlation between radiation dose and extent of hPCC chromosome fragmentation, which allowed us to automate radiation damage quantification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our method can address the need for a same-day cytogenetic biodosimetry test in radiation emergency situations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ekaterina", "Last Name": "Royba", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Shuryak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Ponnaiya", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mikhail", "Last Name": "Repin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sergey", "Last Name": "Pampou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles", "Last Name": "Karan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Helen", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Garty", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May30"}, {"PMID": "38721942", "Title": "AAPM Task Group Report 267: A joint AAPM GEC-ESTRO report on biophysical models and tools for the planning and evaluation of brachytherapy.", "Abstract": "Brachytherapy utilizes a multitude of radioactive sources and treatment techniques that often exhibit widely different spatial and temporal dose delivery patterns. Biophysical models, capable of modeling the key interacting effects of dose delivery patterns with the underlying cellular processes of the irradiated tissues, can be a potentially useful tool for elucidating the radiobiological effects of complex brachytherapy dose delivery patterns and for comparing their relative clinical effectiveness. While the biophysical models have been used largely in research settings by experts, it has also been used increasingly by clinical medical physicists over the last two decades. A good understanding of the potentials and limitations of the biophysical models and their intended use is critically important in the widespread use of these models. To facilitate meaningful and consistent use of biophysical models in brachytherapy, Task Group 267 (TG-267) was formed jointly with the American Association of Physics in Medicine (AAPM) and The Groupe Europ\u00e9en de Curieth\u00e9rapie and the European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) to review the existing biophysical models, model parameters, and their use in selected brachytherapy modalities and to develop practice guidelines for clinical medical physicists regarding the selection, use, and interpretation of biophysical models. The report provides an overview of the clinical background and the rationale for the development of biophysical models in radiation oncology and, particularly, in brachytherapy; a summary of the results of literature review of the existing biophysical models that have been used in brachytherapy; a focused discussion of the applications of relevant biophysical models for five selected brachytherapy modalities; and the task group recommendations on the use, reporting, and implementation of biophysical models for brachytherapy treatment planning and evaluation.

CBMN assay cultures were prepared from fresh blood samples collected before and at 4 and 24 h after the start of TBI, corresponding to doses of 1.25 Gy and 3.75 Gy, respectively. For both age groups, there was a significant increase in MN yields with increasing dose (p &lt; 0.05) and dose-dependent decrease in the nuclear division index (NDI; p &lt; 0.0001). In the pre-radiotherapy samples, there was a significantly higher NDI measured in the pediatric cohort compared to the adult due to an increase in the percentage of tri- and quadri-nucleated cells scored.

We have developed a bioengineered tissue platform for studying radiation damage in individualized settings.

We report the effects of high-dose neutrons, a proxy for simulated galactic cosmic rays, on the expression of key genes implicated in tissue responses to ionizing radiation, phenotypic and functional changes in both tissues, and proof-of-principle application of radioprotective agents. We further determined the extent of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and matrix remodeling gene expression changes, and found that these changes were associated with an early hypertrophic phenotype in eCT and myeloid skewing in eBM.

The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay is an established and validated cytogenetic biomarker used to assess DNA damage in irradiated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Here, we describe an intercomparison experiment between two biodosimetry laboratories, located at Columbia University (CU) and Health Canada (HC) that performed different variants of the human blood CBMN assay to reconstruct dose in human blood, with CU performing the assay on isolated lymphocytes and using semi-automated scoring whereas HC used the more conventional whole blood assay. Although the micronucleus yields varied significantly between the two assays, the predicted doses closely matched up to 4 Gy - the range from which the HC calibration curve was previously established. These results highlight the importance of a robust calibration curve(s) across a wide age range of donors that match the exposure scenario as closely as possible and that will account for differences in methodology between laboratories. We have seen that at low doses, variability in the results may be attributed to variation in the processing while at higher doses the variation is dominated by inter-individual variation in cell proliferation.

This assay has been adapted to imaging flow cytometry (IFC), allowing automated analysis of many cells, and eliminating the need to create microscope slides. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of assay performance, a small-volume method previously developed was employed. Irradiated human blood samples were cultured, stained, and analyzed by IFC to produce images of the cells. Samples were run using both manual and 96-well plate automated acquisition. Multiple parameter-based image features were collected for each sample, and the results were compared to confirm that these acquisition methods are functionally identical. This paper details the multi-parametric analysis developed and the resulting calibration curves up to 10 Gy. The calibration curves were created using a quadratic random coefficient model with Poisson errors, as well as a logistic discriminant function. The curves were then validated with blinded, irradiated samples, using relative bias and relative mean square error. Overall, the accuracy of the dose estimates was adequate for triage dosimetry (within 1 Gy of the true dose) over 90% of the time for lower doses and about half the time for higher doses, with the lowest success rate between 5 and 6 Gy where the calibration curve reached its peak and there was the smallest change in MN/BNC with dose.

Overall similar perturbations were observed in both urine and serum metabolite concentrations irrespective of sex or dose rate, with the exception of xanthurenic acid in urine (female specific) and taurine in serum (VHDR specific).

However, incidental/ accidental exposures caused by nuclear weapons can be more complex. The aim of this work was to simulate the DNA damage effects mimicking those caused by the detonation of a several kilotons improvised nuclear device (IND). For this, we modeled complex exposures to: 1. a mixed (photons + IND-neutrons) field and 2. different dose rates that may come from the blast, nuclear fallout, or ground deposition of radionuclides (ground shine). Additionally, we assessed whether myeloid cytokines affect the precision of radiation dose estimation by modulating the frequency of dicentric chromosomes. To mimic different exposure scenarios, several irradiation systems were used. In a mixed field study, human blood samples were exposed to a photon field enriched with neutrons (ranging from 10% to 37%) from a source that mimics Hiroshima's A-bomb's energy spectrum (0.2-9 MeV). Using statistical analysis, we assessed whether photons and neutrons act in an additive or synergistic way to form dicentrics. For the dose rates study, human blood was exposed to photons or electrons at dose rates ranging from low (where the dose was spread over 32 h) to extremely high (where the dose was delivered in a fraction of a microsecond). Potential effects of cytokine treatment on biodosimetry dose predictions were analyzed in irradiated blood subjected to Neupogen or Neulasta for 24 or 48 h at the concentration recommended to forestall manifestation of an acute radiation syndrome in bomb survivors. All measurements were performed using a robotic station, the Rapid Automated Biodosimetry Tool II, programmed to culture lymphocytes and score dicentrics in multiwell plates (the RABiT-II DCA). In agreement with classical concepts of radiation biology, the RABiT-II DCA calibration curves suggested that the frequency of dicentrics depends on the type of radiation and is modulated by changes in the dose rate. The resulting dose-response curves suggested an intermediate dicentric yields and additive effects of photons and IND-neutrons in the mixed field. At ultra-high dose rate (600 Gy/s), affected lymphocytes exhibited significantly fewer dicentrics (P < 0.004, t test). In contrast, we did not find the dose-response modification effects of radiomitigators on the yields of dicentrics (Bonferroni corrected P > 0.006, ANOVA test).

There is a need for effective environmental control measures which, ideally, are not reliant on human behaviour. One potential solution is Krypton Chloride (KrCl) excimer lamps (often referred to as Far-UVC), which can efficiently inactivate pathogens, such as coronaviruses and influenza, in air. Research demonstrates that when KrCl lamps are filtered to remove longer-wavelength ultraviolet emissions they do not induce acute reactions in the skin or eyes, nor delayed effects such as skin cancer. While there is laboratory evidence for Far-UVC efficacy, there is limited evidence in full-sized rooms. For the first time, we show that Far-UVC deployed in a room-sized chamber effectively inactivates aerosolised Staphylococcus aureus. At a room ventilation rate of 3 air-changes-per-hour (ACH), with 5 filtered-sources the steady-state pathogen load was reduced by 98.4% providing an additional 184 equivalent air changes (eACH). This reduction was achieved using Far-UVC irradiances consistent with current American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists threshold limit values for skin for a continuous 8-h exposure. Our data indicate that Far-UVC is likely to be more effective against common airborne viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, than bacteria and should thus be an effective and \"hands-off\" technology to reduce airborne disease transmission.

Currently no FDA-cleared tests are available to diagnose radiation exposures, which can lead to complex, life-threatening injuries. To address this gap, we have achieved substantial advancements in radiation biodosimetry through refinement and adaptation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay as a high throughput, quantitative diagnostic test. The classical CBMN approach, which quantifies micronuclei (MN) resulting from DNA damage, suffers from considerable time and expert labor requirements, in addition to a lack of universal methodology across laboratories. We have developed the CytoRADx\u2122 System to address these drawbacks by implementing a standardized reagent kit, optimized assay protocol, fully automated microscopy and image analysis, and integrated dose prediction. These enhancements allow the CytoRADx System to obtain high-throughput, standardized results without specialized labor or laboratory-specific calibration curves. The CytoRADx System has been optimized for use with both humans and non-human primates (NHP) to quantify radiation dose-dependent formation of micronuclei in lymphocytes, observed using whole blood samples. Cell nuclei and resulting MN are fluorescently stained and preserved on durable microscope slides using materials provided in the kit. Up to 1,000 slides per day are subsequently scanned using the commercially based RADxScan\u2122 Imager with customized software, which automatically quantifies the cellular features and calculates the radiation dose. Using less than 1 mL of blood, irradiated ex vivo, our system has demonstrated accurate and precise measurement of exposures from 0 to 8 Gy (90% of results within 1 Gy of delivered dose). These results were obtained from 636 human samples (24 distinct donors) and 445 NHP samples (30 distinct subjects). The system demonstrated comparable results during in vivo studies, including an investigation of 43 NHPs receiving single-dose total-body irradiation. System performance is repeatable across laboratories, operators, and instruments. Results are also statistically similar across diverse populations, considering various demographics, common medications, medical conditions, and acute injuries associated with radiological disasters. Dose calculations are stable over time as well, providing reproducible results for at least 28 days postirradiation, and for blood specimens collected and stored at room temperature for at least 72 h. The CytoRADx System provides significant advancements in the field of biodosimetry that will enable accurate diagnoses across diverse populations in large-scale emergency scenarios. In addition, our technological enhancements to the well-established CBMN assay provide a pathway for future diagnostic applications, such as toxicology and oncology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calibration", "Cytokinesis", "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Micronucleus Tests", "Radiometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Capaccio", "Affiliation": "ASELL, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Jay R", "Last Name": "Perrier", "Affiliation": "ASELL, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "L\u00eddia", "Last Name": "Cunha", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Center for Radiological Research, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ryan C", "Last Name": "Mahnke", "Affiliation": "ASELL, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "L\u00f6rch", "Affiliation": "MetaSystems, GmbH, 68804 Altulussheim, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "ASELL, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Chris L", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "ASELL, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Ken", "Last Name": "Damer", "Affiliation": "ASELL, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "J Daniel", "Last Name": "Bourland", "Affiliation": "Wake Forest School of Medicine, Departments of Radiation Oncology, Physics, and Biomedical Engineering, Winston-Salem, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Bart", "Last Name": "Frizzell", "Affiliation": "Wake Forest School of Medicine, Departments of Radiation Oncology, Physics, and Biomedical Engineering, Winston-Salem, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Torelli", "Affiliation": "Helix3, Inc., Morrisville, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Marie", "Last Name": "Vasquez", "Affiliation": "Helix3, Inc., Morrisville, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy B", "Last Name": "Brower", "Affiliation": "Lovelace Biomedical Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico."}, {"First Name": "Melanie", "Last Name": "Doyle-Eisele", "Affiliation": "Lovelace Biomedical Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Taveras", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Center for Radiological Research, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Helen", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Center for Radiological Research, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Center for Radiological Research, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Kowalski", "Affiliation": "ASELL, LLC, Owings Mills, Maryland."}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2021Nov01"}, {"PMID": "34493806", "Title": "Author Correction: Far-UVC light: A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA. dw2600@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Manuela", "Last Name": "Buonanno", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Veljko", "Last Name": "Grilj", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Shuryak", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Connor", "Last Name": "Crickmore", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan W", "Last Name": "Bigelow", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gerhard", "Last Name": "Randers-Pehrson", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2021Sep07"}, {"PMID": "34488220", "Title": "Cytogenetic Damage of Human Lymphocytes in Humanized Mice Exposed to Neutrons and X Rays 24 h After Exposure.", "Abstract": "Detonation of an improvised nuclear device highlights the need to understand the risk of mixed radiation exposure as prompt radiation exposure could produce significant neutron and gamma exposures.

In addition to controlled laboratory experiments, analysis of observational data on wild animal and plant populations from areas contaminated by radionuclides can enhance our understanding of radiation responses because such data span wide ranges of dose rates applied over many generations.

High-throughput radiation biodosimetry techniques for such internal exposure are needed to assess potential risks of short-term toxicity and delayed effects (e.g., carcinogenesis) for exposed individuals. Previously, we used \u03b3-H2AX to reconstruct injected 137Cs activity in experimentally-exposed mice, and converted activity values into radiation doses based on time since injection and 137Cs-elimination kinetics. In the current study, we sought to assess the feasibility and possible advantages of combining \u03b3-H2AX with transcriptomics to improve 137Cs activity reconstructions. We selected five genes (Atf5, Hist2h2aa2, Olfr358, Psrc1, Hist2h2ac) with strong statistically-significant Spearman's correlations with injected activity and stable expression over time after 137Cs injection. The geometric mean of log-transformed signals of these five genes, combined with \u03b3-H2AX fluorescence, were used as predictors in a nonlinear model for reconstructing injected 137Cs activity. The coefficient of determination (R2) comparing actual and reconstructed activities was 0.91 and root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.95 MBq. These metrics remained stable when the model was fitted to a randomly-selected half of the data and tested on the other half, repeated 100 times. Model performance was significantly better when compared to our previous analysis using \u03b3-H2AX alone, and when compared to an analysis where genes are used without \u03b3-H2AX, suggesting that integrating \u03b3-H2AX with gene expression provides an important advantage.

Thus while staying within current regulatory dose limits, low-dose-rate far-UVC exposure can potentially safely provide a major reduction in the ambient level of airborne coronaviruses in occupied public locations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antiviral Agents", "Betacoronavirus", "COVID-19", "Cell Line", "Coronavirus 229E, Human", "Coronavirus Infections", "Coronavirus OC43, Human", "Disinfection", "Humans", "Pandemics", "Particulate Matter", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus", "SARS-CoV-2", "Ultraviolet Rays", "Virus Inactivation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Manuela", "Last Name": "Buonanno", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Welch", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Shuryak", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, USA. djb3@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2020Jun24"}, {"PMID": "32320391", "Title": "Cytogenetically-based biodosimetry after high doses of radiation.", "Abstract": "Dosimetry is an important tool for triage and treatment planning following any radiation exposure accident, and biological dosimetry, which estimates exposure dose using a biological parameter, is a practical means of determining the specific dose an individual receives. The cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay (CBMN) is an established biodosimetric tool to measure chromosomal damage in mitogen-stimulated human lymphocytes. The CBMN method is especially valuable for biodosimetry in triage situations thanks to simplicity in scoring and adaptability to high-throughput automated sample processing systems. While this technique produces dose-response data which fit very well to a linear-quadratic model for exposures to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and for doses up for 5 Gy, limitations to the accuracy of this method arise at larger doses. Accuracy at higher doses is limited by the number of cells reaching mitosis. Whereas it would be expected that the yield of micronuclei increases with the dose, in many experiments it has been shown to actually decrease when normalized over the total number of cells. This variation from a monotonically increasing dose response poses a limitation for retrospective dose reconstruction. In this study we modified the standard CBMN assay to increase its accuracy following exposures to higher doses of photons or a mixed neutron-photon beam. The assay is modified either through inhibitions of the G2/M and spindle checkpoints with the addition of caffeine and/or ZM447439 (an Aurora kinase inhibitor), respectively to the blood cultures at select times during the assay. Our results showed that caffeine addition improved assay performance for photon up to 10 Gy. This was achieved by extending the assay time from the typical 70 h to just 74 h. Compared to micronuclei yields without inhibitors, addition of caffeine and ZM447439 resulted in improved accuracy in the detection of micronuclei yields up to 10 Gy from photons and 4 Gy of mixed neutrons-photons. When the dose-effect curves were fitted to take into account the turnover phenomenon observed at higher doses, best fitting was achieved when the combination of both inhibitors was used. These techniques permit reliable dose reconstruction after high doses of radiation with a method that can be adapted to high-throughput automated sample processing systems.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Benzamides", "Caffeine", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytogenetics", "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation", "Female", "Humans", "Lymphocytes", "Male", "Micronucleus Tests", "Middle Aged", "Neutrons", "Protons", "Quinazolines", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiometry"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Monica", "Last Name": "Pujol-Canadell", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jay R", "Last Name": "Perrier", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lidia", "Last Name": "Cunha", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Igor", "Last Name": "Shuryak", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Harken", "Affiliation": "Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, Irvington, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Garty", "Affiliation": "Radiological Research Accelerator Facility, Irvington, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32159453", "Title": "Low Radiation Doses: Small Risks?

The mechanistic background is that, compared with total-body photon irradiations, neutrons produce more heavily-damaged lymphocytes with multiple micronuclei/binucleated cell, whereas partial-body exposures produce fewer such lymphocytes. To utilize these differences for biodosimetry, we developed metrics that describe micronuclei distributions in binucleated cells and serve as predictors in machine learning or parametric analyses of the following scenarios: (A) Homogeneous gamma-irradiation, mimicking total-body exposures, vs. mixtures of irradiated blood with unirradiated blood, mimicking partial-body exposures.

Over a 20-yr period, five adult female Sichuan takin (Budorcas taxicolor tibetana), with 13 total pregnancies, were evaluated because of lameness and distal limb swelling. These clinical signs were observed between 2 and 32 days (mean = 19 days) prior to parturition (gestation period in takin approximately 200-240 days) and resolved in all animals following parturition. Lameness and limb swelling resolved between 8 and 168 days (median = 15 days) after parturition. Sixteen radiographic examinations, from four of the individuals, documented proliferative periosteal reaction, primarily of the metacarpal bones, metatarsal bones, and phalanges.

The assay is typically performed using microscopy, which is labor intensive, time consuming and impractical after a large-scale radiological/nuclear event. Imaging flow cytometry (IFC), which combines the statistical power of traditional flow cytometry with the sensitivity and specificity of microscopy, has been recently used to perform the CBMN assay. Since this technology is capable of automated sample acquisition and multi-file analysis, we have integrated IFC into our Rapid Automated Biodosimetry Technology (RABiT-II). Assay development and optimization studies were designed to increase the yield of binucleated cells (BNCs), and improve data acquisition and analysis templates to increase the speed and accuracy of image analysis. Human peripheral blood samples were exposed ex vivo with up to 4 Gy of c rays at a dose rate of 0.73 Gy/min. After irradiation, samples were transferred to microtubes (total volume of 1 ml including blood and media) and organized into a standard 8 \u00d7 12 plate format. Sample processing methods were modified by increasing the blood-to-media ratio, adding hypotonic solution prior to cell fixation and optimizing nuclear DRAQ5 staining, leading to an increase of 81% in BNC yield. Modification of the imaging processing algorithms within IFC software also improved BNC and MN identification, and reduced the average time of image analysis by 78%. Finally, 50 ll of irradiated whole blood was cultured with 200 ll of media in 96-well plates. All sample processing steps were performed automatically using the RABiT-II cell: :explorer robotic system adopting the optimized IFC-CBMN assay protocol.

However, since existing medical records were used in these studies, they could not control for reasons for the CT scans and therefore, the results may have been confounded by indication. Here we conducted a study to estimate potential indication bias that could affect hazard ratios for colorectal, lung and female breast cancers by reasons for a CT scan. This involved a retrospective cohort study of electronic records from all patients aged 18-89 years without previous cancer diagnoses, who received at least one CT scan at Columbia University Medical Center in the period of 1994-2014. This investigation is not a study of CT-related cancer risks with adjustment for reasons, but an evaluation of the potential for confounding by indication in such studies. Among 75,968 patients, 212,487 CT scans were analyzed during a mean follow-up of 7.6 years. For colorectal and female breast cancers, no hazard ratio bias estimates for any of the CT reasons reached statistical significance. For lung cancer, significant biases occurred only in patients with unknown CT reasons and in patients with CTs for \"abnormal findings\" and in those with CTs for cancer- or nodule-related reasons. This retrospective cohort study among adults with \u22651 CT scan evaluates, for the first time, CT reason-specific indication biases of potential CT-related cancer risks. Overall, our data suggest that, in studies of adults who underwent CT scans, indication bias is likely to be of negligible importance for colorectal cancer and female breast cancer risk estimation; for lung cancer, indication bias is possible but would likely be associated with only a small modulation of the risk estimate.

In the event that an improvised nuclear device (IND) is detonated, a potentially large population of victims will require assessment for radiation exposure. While photons will contribute to a major portion of the dose, neutrons may be responsible for the severity of the biologic effects and cellular responses. We investigated differences in response between these two radiation types by using metabolomics and lipidomics to identify biomarkers in urine and blood of wild-type C57BL/6 male mice. Identification of metabolites was based on a 1 Gy dose of radiation. Compared to X rays, a neutron spectrum similar to that encountered in Hiroshima at 1-1.5 km from the epicenter induced a severe metabolic dysregulation, with perturbations in amino acid metabolism and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation being the predominant ones. Urinary metabolites were able to discriminate between neutron and X rays on day 1 as well as day 7 postirradiation, while serum markers showed such discrimination only on day 1. Free fatty acids from omega-6 and omega-3 pathways were also decreased with 1 Gy of neutrons, implicating cell membrane dysfunction and impaired phospholipid metabolism, which should otherwise lead to release of those molecules in circulation. While a precise relative biological effectiveness value could not be calculated from this study, the results are consistent with other published studies showing higher levels of damage from neutrons, demonstrated here by increased metabolic dysregulation.

Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200-222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control.

Reliable methods are needed for scaling low-LET to high-LET radiation risks for humans, based on animal or in vitro studies comparing these radiations. The current standard metric, relative biological effectiveness (RBE) compares iso-effect doses of two radiations. By contrast, a proposed new metric, radiation effects ratio (RER), compares effects of two radiations at the same dose. This definition of RER allows direct scaling of low-LET to high-LET radiation risks in humans at the dose or doses of interest. By contrast to RBE, RER can be used without need for detailed information about dose response shapes for compared radiations. This property of RER allows animal carcinogenesis experiments to be simplified by reducing the number of tested radiation doses. For simple linear dose-effect relationships, RBE = RER. However, for more complex dose-effect relationships, such as those with nontargeted effects at low doses, RER can be lower than RBE. We estimated RBE and RER values and uncertainties using heavy ion (12C, 28Si, 56Fe) and gamma-ray-induced tumors in a mouse model for intestinal cancer (APC1638N/+), and used both RBE and RER to estimate low-LET to high-LET risk scaling factors. The data showed clear evidence of nontargeted effects at low doses. In situations, such as the ones discussed here where nontargeted effects dominate at low doses, RER was lower than RBE by factors around 2.8-3.5 at 0.03 Gy and 1.3-1.4 at 0.3 Gy.

For CT dosimetry, especially for Monte Carlo calculations of organ and tissue absorbed doses to patients, it is important to take the effect of bowtie filters into account. However, material composition and dimensions of these filters are proprietary. Consequently, a method for bowtie filter simulation independent of access to proprietary data and/or to a specific scanner would be of interest to many researchers involved in CT dosimetry. This study presents such a method based on the weighted computer tomography dose index, CTDIw, defined in two cylindrical PMMA phantoms of 16\u2009cm and 32\u2009cm diameter. With an EGSnrc-based Monte Carlo (MC) code, ratios CTDIw/CTDI100,a were calculated for a specific CT scanner using PMMA bowtie filter models based on sigmoid Boltzmann functions combined with a scanner filter factor (SFF) which is modified during calculations until the calculated MC CTDIw/CTDI100,a matches ratios CTDIw/CTDI100,a, determined by measurements or found in publications for that specific scanner. Once the scanner-specific value for an SFF has been found, the bowtie filter algorithm can be used in any MC code to perform CT dosimetry for that specific scanner. The bowtie filter model proposed here was validated for CTDIw/CTDI100,a considering 11 different CT scanners and for CTDI100,c, CTDI100,p and their ratio considering 4 different CT scanners. Additionally, comparisons were made for lateral dose profiles free in air and using computational anthropomorphic phantoms.

For this reason, we have focused on developing robust radiation exposure biomarkers in easily accessible biofluids such as urine, serum and feces. While we have previously reported on urine and serum biomarkers, here we assessed perturbations in the fecal metabolome resulting from exposure to external X radiation in vivo. The gastrointestinal (GI) system is of particular importance in radiation biodosimetry due to its constant cell renewal and sensitivity to radiation-induced injury. While the clinical GI symptoms such as pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are manifested after radiation exposure, no reliable bioindicator has been identified for radiation-induced gastrointestinal injuries. To this end, we focused on determining a fecal metabolomic signature in X-ray irradiated mice. There is overwhelming evidence that the gut microbiota play an essential role in gut homeostasis and overall health. Because the fecal metabolome is tightly correlated with the composition and diversity of the microorganism in the gut, we also performed fecal 16S rRNA sequencing analysis to determine the changes in the microbial composition postirradiation. We used in-house bioinformatics tools to integrate the 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic data, and to elucidate the gut integrated ecosystem and its deviations from a stable host-microbiome state that result from irradiation. The 16S rRNA sequencing results indicated that radiation caused remarkable alterations of the microbiome in feces at the family level. Increased abundance of common members of Lactobacillaceae and Staphylococcaceae families, and decreased abundances of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiaceae families were found after 5 and 12 Gy irradiation.

Here, we focused on utilizing ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to identify and quantitate the unique changes in the urinary excretion of two metabolite markers, calcitroic acid and citrulline, in mice induced by different forms of irradiation; external \u03b3 irradiation at a low dose rate (LDR) of 3.0 mGy/min and a high dose rate (HDR) of 1.1 Gy/min, and internal exposure to Cesium-137 ((137)Cs) and Strontium-90 ((90)Sr). The multiple reaction monitoring analysis showed that, while exposure to (137)Cs and (90)Sr induced a statistically significant and persistent decrease, similar doses of external \u03b3 beam at the HDR had the opposite effect, and the LDR had no effect on the urinary levels of these two metabolites. This suggests that the source of exposure and the dose rate strongly modulate the in vivo metabolomic injury responses, which may have utility in clinical biodosimetry assays for the assessment of exposure in an affected population.

All steps for single-cell RT-qPCR, including cell isolation and immobilization, cell lysis, mRNA purification, reverse transcription and qPCR, are integrated on a single chip, eliminating the need for off-chip manual cell and reagent transfer and qPCR amplification as commonly used in existing approaches.

Metabolomics, the assessment of the collective small molecule content in a given biofluid or tissue, has proven effective in the rapid identification of radiation biomarkers and metabolic perturbations. To investigate how the genotypic background may alter the ionizing radiation (IR) signature, we analyzed urine from Parp1(-/-) mice, as a model radiosensitive genotype, exposed to IR by utilizing the analytical power of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as urine has been thoroughly investigated in wild type (WT) mice in previous studies from our laboratory. Samples were collected at days one and three after irradiation, time points that are important for the early and efficient triage of exposed individuals. Time-dependent perturbations in metabolites were observed in the tricarboxylic acid pathway (TCA). Other differentially excreted metabolites included amino acids and metabolites associated with dysregulation of energy metabolism pathways. Time-dependent apoptotic pathway activation between WT and mutant mice following IR exposure may explain the altered excretion patterns, although the origin of the metabolites remains to be determined. This first metabolomics study in urine from radiation exposed genetic mutant animal models provides evidence that this technology can be used to dissect the effects of genotoxic agents on metabolism by assessing easily accessible biofluids and identify biomarkers of radiation exposure.

The effect of ionizing radiation on the induction and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in peripheral mouse lymphocytes in vivo was determined using the \u03b3-H2AX biodosimetry marker.

A key finding was that a significant \u03b3-H2AX signal was observed in vivo several weeks after a single radionuclide exposure. A mechanistically-motivated model was used to analyze the temporal kinetics of \u03b3-H2AX fluorescence. Exposure to either radionuclide showed two peaks of \u03b3-H2AX: one within the first week, which may represent the death of mature, differentiated lymphocytes, and the second at approximately three weeks, which may represent the production of new lymphocytes from damaged progenitor cells.

In this study, we compared 10 DSB rejoining models based on data collected from 61 mammalian cell lines after high-dose-rate photon or heavy ion irradiation. The set of models included formalisms with: 1. one, two or three discrete first-order rejoining rates; 2. continuously distributed first-order rejoining rates; and 3. second-order rejoining rates. The Akaike information criterion was used to quantify the relative support for each model from the data, accounting for goodness of fit and model complexity. The best performance was exhibited by a bi-exponential model with two discrete rejoining rates and a model with gamma-distribution rejoining rates. Models with more than three free parameters overfitted the data and models with single DSB rejoining rates or with an inflexible distribution of rejoining rates lacked accuracy.

All major plasma lipid soluble antioxidant levels were lower post- vs pre-CT (P < .05) possibly from the scavenging of free radicals formed by CT-induced IR. Average AA levels increased (134%) while DHAA levels were decreased (29%) post-CT, probably due to intracellular recycling of AA from DHAA. TAC levels in lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts were unchanged, suggesting that other antioxidants may have assisted in free radical quenching, which would corroborate their lower concentrations post-CT.

Using the recently extended RABiT system, that assays the \u03b3-H2AX repair kinetics at multiple time points, the present small scale study followed its kinetics post irradiation at 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 7 h and 24 h in lymphocytes from 94 healthy adults.

To assess the risk related to DNA damage, we compared the yields of two established biodosimetry end points, \u03b3-H2AX and micronuclei (MNi), in peripheral mouse blood lymphocytes after prolonged in vivo exposure to LDR X rays (0.31 cGy/min) vs. acute high-dose-rate (HDR) exposure (1.03 Gy/min). C57BL/6 mice were total-body irradiated with 320 kVP X rays with doses of 0, 1.1, 2.2 and 4.45 Gy. Residual levels of total \u03b3-H2AX fluorescence in lymphocytes isolated 24 h after the start of irradiation were assessed using indirect immunofluorescence methods. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to determine apoptotic cell frequency in lymphocytes sampled at 24 h. Curve fitting analysis suggested that the dose response for \u03b3-H2AX yields after acute exposures could be described by a linear dependence. In contrast, a linear-quadratic dose-response shape was more appropriate for LDR exposure (perhaps reflecting differences in repair time after different LDR doses). Dose-rate sparing effects (P < 0.05) were observed at doses \u22642.2 Gy, such that the acute dose \u03b3-H2AX and TUNEL-positive cell yields were significantly larger than the equivalent LDR yields. At the 4.45 Gy dose there was no difference in \u03b3-H2AX expression between the two dose rates, whereas there was a two- to threefold increase in apoptosis in the LDR samples compared to the equivalent 4.45 Gy acute dose. Micronuclei yields were measured at 24 h and 7 days using the in vitro cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay. The results showed that MNi yields increased up to 2.2 Gy with no further increase at 4.45 Gy and with no detectable dose-rate effect across the dose range 24 h or 7 days post exposure. In conclusion, the \u03b3-H2AX biomarker showed higher sensitivity to measure dose-rate effects after low-dose LDR X rays compared to MNi formation; however, confounding factors such as variable repair times post exposure, increased cell killing and cell cycle block likely contributed to the yields of MNi with accumulating doses of ionizing radiation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Survival", "DNA Damage", "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Histones", "Lymphocytes", "Mice", "Whole-Body Irradiation", "X-Rays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H C", "Last Name": "Turner", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "I", "Last Name": "Shuryak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M", "Last Name": "Taveras", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "A", "Last Name": "Bertucci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "J R", "Last Name": "Perrier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C D", "Last Name": "Elliston", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "G W", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "L B", "Last Name": "Smilenov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "S A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "D J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Radiation research", "PubDate": "2015Mar"}, {"PMID": "25366837", "Title": "Approaches to enhancing radiation safety in cardiovascular imaging: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.", "Abstract": "Education, justification, and optimization are the cornerstones to enhancing the radiation safety of medical imaging.

To gain a comprehensive knowledge of micronucleation process after ionising radiation (IR) exposure, whole genome-wide chromosome analysis is desirable. With this objective, multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) technique was utilised in the present study to characterise the chromosome content of spontaneous and IR-induced micronuclei in three human donors. M-FISH analysis revealed a radiation dose-dependant increase in the number of micronuclei with multi-chromosome material above 2 Gy and as many as 3-6 multicolour signals were detected in micronuclei after high \u03b3-rays radiation doses (5-10 Gy). Involvement of each human chromosome material was more frequently detected in multicoloured micronuclei than in single-coloured micronuclei at high radiation doses (>2 Gy). Observation of dose-dependant increase in the MN frequency with multi-chromosome material may be due to misrepair of DNA double-strand breaks involving multiple chromosomes leading to asymmetric dicentric or ring chromosomes and acentric fragments. Chromosomes belonging to groups A (1, 2 and 3) and B (4 and 5) were frequently detected in 35-45% of the total micronuclei either as single entities or in combination with other chromosomes. Among the A and B groups, chromosome 1 material was consistently detected at high MN frequencies after radiation exposure in all the donors. Additionally, chromosomes 13 and 19 were more frequently observed in micronuclei than the expected frequency based on DNA content.

Most studies to date from our laboratory and others have employed \u03b3-irradiation at relatively high dose rates (HDR), but many environmental exposure scenarios will probably be at relatively low dose rates (LDR). There are well-documented differences in the biologic responses to LDR compared to HDR, so an important question is to assess LDR effects at the metabolomics level. Our study took advantage of a modern mass spectrometry approach in exploring the effects of dose rate on the urinary excretion levels of metabolites 2 days after IR in mice. A wide variety of statistical tools were employed to further focus on metabolites, which showed responses to LDR IR exposure (0.00309 Gy/min) distinguishable from those of HDR. From a total of 709 detected spectral features, more than 100 were determined to be statistically significant when comparing urine from mice irradiated with 1.1 or 4.45 Gy to that of sham-irradiated mice 2 days post-exposure. The results of this study show that LDR and HDR exposures perturb many of the same pathways such as TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, which also have been implicated in our previous IR studies.

Consequently, a logical next step is to investigate the effects of CT scanning in adulthood on lifetime cancer risks by conducting adult-based, appropriately designed epidemiological studies. Here we estimate the sample size required for such studies to detect CT-associated risks. This was achieved by incorporating different age-, sex-, time- and cancer type-dependent models of radiation carcinogenesis into an in silico simulation of a population-based cohort study. This approach simulated individual histories of chest and abdominal CT exposures, deaths and cancer diagnoses. The resultant sample sizes suggest that epidemiological studies of realistically sized cohorts can detect excess lifetime cancer risks from adult CT exposures.

Urine was collected from patients undergoing total body irradiation at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at 4-6 h postirradiation (a single dose of 1.25 Gy) and 24 h (three fractions of 1.25 Gy each). Global metabolomic profiling was obtained through analysis with ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS). Prior to further analyses, each sample was normalized to its respective creatinine level. Statistical analysis was conducted by the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Fisher's exact test and markers were validated against pure standards. Seven markers showed distinct differences between pre- and post-exposure samples. Of those, trimethyl-l-lysine and the carnitine conjugates acetylcarnitine, decanoylcarnitine and octanoylcarnitine play an important role in the transportation of fatty acids across mitochondria for subsequent fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. The remaining metabolites, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid are the final products of the purine catabolism pathway, and high levels of excretion have been associated with increased oxidative stress and radiation induced DNA damage. Further analysis revealed sex differences in the patterns of excretion of the markers, demonstrating that generation of a sex-specific metabolomic signature will be informative and can provide a quick and reliable assessment of individuals in a radiological scenario.

Typically, SRS and SBRT involve the delivery of 1 or a few large-dose fractions of 8 to 30 Gy per fraction: a major paradigm shift from radiation therapy practice over the past 90 years, when, with relatively large amounts of normal tissues receiving high doses, the goal was to maximize tumor response for an acceptable level of normal tissue injury. The development of SRS and SBRT have come about because of technologic advances in image guidance and treatment delivery techniques that enable the delivery of large doses to tumors with reduced margins and high gradients outside the target, thereby minimizing doses to surrounding normal tissues. Because the results obtained with SRS and SBRT have been impressive, they have raised the question whether classic radiobiological modeling, and the linear-quadratic (LQ) model, are appropriate for large doses per fraction. In addition to objections to the LQ model, the possibility of additional biological effects resulting from endothelial cell damage, enhanced tumor immunity, or both have been raised to account for the success of SRS and SBRT. In this review, we conclude that the available preclinical and clinical data do not support a need to change the LQ model or to invoke phenomena over and above the classic 5 Rs of radiobiology and radiation therapy, with the likely exception that for some tumors high doses of irradiation may produce enhanced antitumor immunity. Thus, we suggest that for most tumors, the standard radiobiology concepts of the 5 Rs are sufficient to explain the clinical data, and the excellent results obtained from clinical studies are the result of the much larger biologically effective doses that are delivered with SRS and SBRT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "DNA Damage", "DNA Repair", "Dose Fractionation, Radiation", "Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Melanoma", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms", "Oxygen Consumption", "Radiation Tolerance", "Radiobiology", "Radiosurgery", "Relative Biological Effectiveness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "J Martin", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.

We have developed a qRT-PCR protocol that allows us to assay multiple gene products in small samples, starting at 100 cells and going down to a single cell, and have used it to study radiation responses at the single-cell level. Since the accuracy of qRT-PCR depends greatly on the choice of \"housekeeping\" genes used for normalization, initial studies concentrated on determining the optimal panel of such genes. Using an endogenous control array, it was found that for IMR90 cells, common housekeeping genes tend to fall into one of two categories-those that are relatively stably expressed regardless of the number of cells in the sample, e.g., B2M, PPIA, and GAPDH, and those that are more variable (again regardless of the size of the population), e.g., YWHAZ, 18S, TBP, and HPRT1. Further, expression levels in commonly studied radiation-response genes, such as ATF3, CDKN1A, GADD45A, and MDM2, were assayed in 100, 10, and single-cell samples. It is here that the value of single-cell analyses becomes apparent. It was observed that the expression of some genes such as FGF2 and MDM2 was relatively constant over all irradiated cells, while that of others such as FAS was considerably more variable. It was clear that almost all cells respond to ionizing radiation but the individual responses were considerably varied. The analyses of single cells indicate that responses in individual cells are not uniform and suggest that responses observed in populations are not indicative of identical patterns in all cells. This in turn points to the value of single-cell analyses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Ponnaiya", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, VC11-240, New York, NY, 10032, USA, bp156@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sally A", "Last Name": "Amundson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shanaz A", "Last Name": "Ghandhi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lubomir B", "Last Name": "Smilenov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles R", "Last Name": "Geard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Manuela", "Last Name": "Buonanno", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Brenner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Radiation and environmental biophysics", "PubDate": "2013Nov"}, {"PMID": "23942865", "Title": "Microbeam irradiation of C. elegans nematode in microfluidic channels.", "Abstract": "To perform high-throughput studies on the biological effects of ionizing radiation in vivo, we have implemented a microfluidic tool for microbeam irradiation of Caenorhabditis elegans.

Worms are introduced into the microfluidic device through liquid flow between an inlet and an outlet, and the size of each microchannel guarantees that young adult worms are immobilized within minutes without the use of anesthesia. After site-specific irradiation with the microbeam, the worms can be released by reversing the flow direction in the clamp and collected for analysis of biological endpoints such as repair of radiation-induced DNA damage. For such studies, minimal sample manipulation and reduced use of drugs such as anesthetics that might interfere with normal physiological processes are preferable.
