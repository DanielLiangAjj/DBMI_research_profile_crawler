An April 2021 survey of a nationally representative sample (N\u2009=\u20091208) examined vaccine uptake, attitudes, and sociodemographic characteristics. Sixty-seven percent were vaccine acceptors, 14% wait-and-see, and 19% non-acceptors.

Methods: Three hundred and eleven health-care workers working in a COVID-19 designated hospital in Wuhan, China, and 148 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the same hospital participated in this cross-sectional survey conducted in February 2020. Psychological symptoms, psychological stressors, and perceived coping resources were reported by both groups. Results: Thirty-three percent of health-care workers and 35.2% of patients with COVID-19 had significant psychological symptoms that were indicative of a high risk for psychological disorders. Pandemic-related psychological stressors contributed to psychological symptoms for both populations. Concern about patients was one aspect of psychological stressors of frontline health-care workers and both groups perceived support from the opposite side as an important external coping resource.

Yet contextual factors have only been inconsistently explained. At the 14- and 17-year follow-ups of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, 1,596 parent-child dyads completed the parent-reported Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the adolescent-rated Youth Self-Report (YSR). Maternal, family, adolescent, and parent factors were examined as potential predictors of discrepancies. When adolescent YSR scores were in the clinical range but parents' CBCL ratings were not, adolescents were more likely to report alcohol intoxication in the last 6\u00a0months, illicit drug use, low school motivation, and depression. When parents reported externalizing behaviour in the clinical range but adolescents did not, the characteristics associated with this were a younger maternal age, receiving social security benefit, stress related to parenting, depression, and poor family functioning. These new results will inform clinical management and research with adolescents who present with behavioural disorders. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? We know that adolescent and parent reports of adolescent mental health problems often correlate poorly, but little is known about which contextual factors lead to disagreement. Understanding the factors that influence agreement is clinically relevant for predicting and identifying externalizing behavioural disorders. This is a large-scale study with the ability to assess the impact of numerous psychosocial factors on instrument disagreement. What the present study adds We found that substance use, depression and low school motivation impacted on discrepancy in externalizing behaviour scores for 14-year-old male adolescents and their parents. Parental depression, stress, low family income, and family dysfunction also led to a higher likelihood of discrepancy in scores.", "Keywords": ["Child Behaviour Checklist", "adolescence", "behavioural measures", "rating scales", "reliability"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Alcoholic Intoxication", "Australia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Parents", "Problem Behavior", "Self Report", "Underage Drinking"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Monique", "Last Name": "Robinson", "Affiliation": "Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Dorota A", "Last Name": "Doherty", "Affiliation": "School of Women's and Infants' Health, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey", "Last Name": "Cannon", "Affiliation": "Women and Infants Research Foundation, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Martha", "Last Name": "Hickey", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The University of Melbourne and Royal Women's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Susan L", "Last Name": "Rosenthal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center and Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, NewYork Presbyterian Hospital, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Marino", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The University of Melbourne and Royal Women's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "S Rachel", "Last Name": "Skinner", "Affiliation": "Discipline of Paediatrics and Child Health, The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."}], "Journal": "The British journal of developmental psychology", "PubDate": "2019Jun"}, {"PMID": "30393589", "Title": "Inclusion of Adolescents in STI/HIV Biomedical Prevention Trials: Autonomy, Decision Making, and Parental Involvement.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["HIV infection and AIDS", "adolescents", "clinical trials", "research ethics", "sexually transmitted infections"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Susan L", "Last Name": "Rosenthal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center - College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marilyn C", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center - College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lily F", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center - College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Gregory D", "Last Name": "Zimet", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States."}], "Journal": "Clinical practice in pediatric psychology", "PubDate": "2018Sep"}, {"PMID": "30360654", "Title": "Why Parents Use the Emergency Department Despite Having a Medical Home.", "Abstract": "Despite having a medical home, pediatric patients continue emergency department (ED) utilization for various reasons.

This is largely because of the ethical, legal, and regulatory complexities in the enrolment, consent, and appropriate access of children of minor parents to clinical research. Using a case-based approach, we examine appropriate access of children of minor parents in an international vaccine trial. We first consider the scientific justification for inclusion of children of minor parents in a vaccine trial. Laws and regulations governing consent generally do not address the issue of minor parents. In their absence, local community and cultural contexts may influence consent processes. Rights of the minor parent include dignity in their role as a parent and respect for their decision-making capacity in that role. Rights of the child include the right to have decisions made in their best interest and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Children of minor parents may have vulnerabilities related to the age of their parent, such as increased rates of poverty, that have implications for consent. Neuroscience research suggests that, by age 12-14\u00a0years, minors have adult-level capacity to make research decisions in situations with low emotion and low distraction.

This approach encompasses special groups at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as preterm infants and pregnant women, as well as those with chronic and immune-compromising medical conditions or at increased risk of disease due to immunosenescence. Despite demonstrations of effectiveness and safety, vaccine uptake in these special groups is frequently lower than expected, even in developed countries with vaccination strategies in place. For example, uptake of the influenza vaccine in pregnancy rarely exceeds 50% in developed countries and, although data are scarce, it appears that only half of preterm infants are up-to-date with routine paediatric vaccinations. Many people with chronic medical conditions or who are immunocompromised due to disease or aging are also under-vaccinated. In the US, coverage among people aged 65years or older was 67% for the influenza vaccine in the 2014-2015 season and 55-60% for tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines in 2013, while the coverage rate for herpes zoster vaccination among those aged 60years or older was only 24%. In most other countries, rates are far lower. Reasons for under-vaccination of special groups include fear of adverse outcomes or illness caused by the vaccine, the inconvenience (and in some settings, cost) of vaccination and lack of awareness of the need for vaccination or national recommendations. There is also evidence that healthcare providers' attitudes towards vaccination are among the most important influences on the decision to vaccinate. It is clear that physicians' adherence to recommendations needs to be improved, particularly where patients receive care from multiple subspecialists and receive little or no care from primary care providers.", "Keywords": ["Adolescent", "Immunocompromised", "Older adults", "Pregnancy", "Preterm", "Special group"], "MeSH terms": ["Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Global Health", "Humans", "Vaccination", "Vulnerable Populations"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Doherty", "Affiliation": "GSK Vaccines, Avenue Fleming 20, Parc de la Noire Epine, B-1300 Wavre, Belgium.

The search strategy was developed in Medline and then adapted across several multidisciplinary mainstream databases including Embase Classic & Embase, and PschInfo. All foreign language articles were included if the abstract was available in English. A total of 185 articles were included in the literature review. 66% studied the vaccine hesitancy among HCPs, 17% analysed concerns, attitudes and/or behaviour of HCPs towards vaccinating others, and 9% were about evaluating intervention(s). Overall, knowledge about particular vaccines, their efficacy and safety, helped to build HCPs own confidence in vaccines and their willingness to recommend vaccines to others. The importance of societal endorsement and support from colleagues was also reported. In the face of emerging vaccine hesitancy, HCPs still remain the most trusted advisor and influencer of vaccination decisions. The capacity and confidence of HCPs, though, are stretched as they are faced with time constraints, increased workload and limited resources, and often have inadequate information or training support to address parents' questions. Overall, HCPs need more support to manage the quickly evolving vaccine environment as well as changing public, especially those who are reluctant or refuse vaccination.

Less is known about altruism in adolescent-parent decision-making about clinical trials enrolling healthy adolescents. This qualitative investigation focused on identifying spontaneous statements of altruism within adolescent-parent (dyadic) discussions of participation in a hypothetical phase I clinical trial related to adolescent sexual health. Content analysis revealed several response patterns to each other's altruistic reasoning. Across 70 adolescent-parent dyads in which adolescents were 14-17 years of age and 91% of their parents were mothers, a majority (61%) of dyadic discussions included a statement reflecting altruism. Parents responded to adolescents' statements of altruism more frequently than adolescents responded to parents' statements. Responses included: expresses concern, reiterates altruistic reasoning, agrees with altruistic reasoning, and adds to/expands altruistic reasoning. Since an altruistic perspective was often balanced with concerns about risk or study procedures, researchers cannot assume that altruism will directly lead to study participation. Optimizing the informed consent process for early phase clinical trials involving healthy adolescents may include supporting parents to have conversations with their adolescents which will enhance their capacity to consider all aspects of trial participation.", "Keywords": ["Altruism", "STI clinical trials", "adolescents", "decision-making", "parental consent", "research participation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "No\u00e9 Rub\u00e9n", "Last Name": "Ch\u00e1vez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center - College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Camille Y", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center - College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Lisa S", "Last Name": "Ipp", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Catallozzi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center - College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York, United States; Heilbrunn Department of Population & Family Health, Columbia University Medical Center - Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Susan L", "Last Name": "Rosenthal", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center - College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York, New York, United States."}, {"First Name": "Carmen Radecki", "Last Name": "Breitkopf", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States."}], "Journal": "Research ethics", "PubDate": "2016Apr"}, {"PMID": "26976148", "Title": "Inclusion of Adolescents in Clinical Trials for Sexually Transmitted Infections: A Review of Existing Registered Studies.", "Abstract": "Despite their heightened risk of sexually transmitted infections, minor adolescents (<18\u00a0years old) are often excluded from clinical trials.

We examined the effect of a parent health message intervention on HPV vaccination intent, first dose uptake and series completion among adolescents who received care at SBHCs. Via computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI), 445 parents of young adolescents were randomly assigned to 2 two-level interventions using a 2 \u00d7 2 design (rhetorical question (RQ) or no-RQ and one-sided or two-sided message). The RQ intervention involved asking the parent a question they were likely to endorse (e.g., \"Do you want to protect your daughter from cervical cancer?\") with the expectation that they would then behave in a manner consistent with their endorsement (i.e., agree to vaccinate). For the one-sided message, parents were given information that emphasized the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccine, whereas the two-sided message acknowledged that some parents might have concerns about the vaccine, followed by reassurance regarding the safety and effectiveness. At CATI conclusion, parents indicated intentions to have their adolescents vaccinated. Parents who endorsed any intent were sent a consent form to return and all adolescents with signed returned consents were vaccinated at SBHCs. Medical records were reviewed for uptake/completion.

We also examined intent as a potential mediator of the relationships between predictors (health beliefs and perceived spousal agreement) and vaccination. Slightly more than half (n=135 of 249) of parents reported an intention to vaccinate and 28% (n=69) of males received their first dose of the HPV vaccine. Two of three health beliefs were significantly associated with both intention and uptake as was perceived spousal agreement. We found intention to vaccinate was a partial mediatator between the perceived benefits of HPV vaccine and first dose acceptance. We also determined that intent was a strong mediator between both general immunization benefits and perceived spousal agreement and first dose uptake. While vaccine uptake was lower than expected, particularly considering that many barriers to vaccine initiation were eliminated because of the SBHC setting, this rate is higher than in traditional settings.

The World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and other national health agencies recommend the use of existing STI vaccines, and many countries have incorporated them into their routine vaccination schedule. Despite this, however, data indicate that STI vaccine uptake is suboptimal for a variety of reasons. Health care professionals (HCP) have been shown to have a strong beneficial effect on STI vaccine uptake, yet studies demonstrate that many HCPs fail to discuss or recommend them to adolescent patients. This review article focuses on HCP communication about STI vaccines with adolescents and their parents. It describes STI vaccine message content and delivery as well as the context in which HCPs formulate their messaging approach. It also examines other contextual factors that may shape communication about STI vaccines. Studies from many countries indicate that HCPs often possess misinformation about adolescents, including their sexual risk behaviors, as well as STIs, vaccine safety and efficacy, and STI vaccination recommendations. They also have misconceptions of parental barriers to STI vaccination. These may impact STI vaccine communication and have a negative influence on STI vaccine uptake. These findings highlight the critical need for improved HCP education related to adolescent health, sexuality, and STI vaccination.

This study sought to determine the prevalence and impact of mental health issues in a population of adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes. A cross-sectional study of 150 patients aged 11 to 25 years with type 1 diabetes from an urban, academic diabetes center was conducted. Participants completed 3 validated mental health disorder screening instruments: Beck's Depression Inventory, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-41 anxiety screen, and the Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care. More than a third screened positive: 11.3% for depression, 21.3% for anxiety, and 20.7% for disordered eating (14.7% had \u22652 positive screens). Patients with a positive screen had twice the odds of having poor glycemic control as those without, as measured by HgbA1c.

The type of intimate relationship will make a difference as to whether the adolescent engages in protective behaviors or avoids risky behaviors. However, in reviewing the literature on the association of relationship type and sexual risk and protective behaviors, four methodological challenges were noted. These challenges limit our understanding of the impact of relationship type. These four challenges are: (a) inconsistent definitional frameworks; (b) lack of adolescent voices; (c) lack of consideration of gender; and (d) poor differentiation between individual and relationship risk. These issues direct the course of future work in this area and are necessary to advance the field of adolescent sexual health, particularly with regard to the development and testing of appropriate interventions designed to reduce untoward outcomes of adolescent sexuality.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Female", "Heterosexuality", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Risk-Taking", "Sexual Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mary B", "Last Name": "Short", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Houston-Clearlake, Houston, Texas 77058, USA. shortmb@uhcl.edu"}, {"First Name": "Marina", "Last Name": "Catallozzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmen Radecki", "Last Name": "Breitkopf", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Beth A", "Last Name": "Auslander", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan L", "Last Name": "Rosenthal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of pediatric and adolescent gynecology", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
