Exposed individuals vary in their ability to metabolize arsenic, and variability in arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME) is associated with risks of arsenic-related toxicities. Inherited genetic variation in the 10q24.32 region, near the arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) gene, is associated with urine-based measures of AME in multiple arsenic-exposed populations. To identify potential causal variants in this region, we applied fine mapping approaches to targeted sequencing data generated for exposed individuals from Bangladeshi, American Indian, and European American populations (n = 2,357, 557, and 648 respectively). We identified three independent association signals for Bangladeshis, two for American Indians, and one for European Americans. The size of the confidence sets for each signal varied from 4 to 85 variants. There was one signal shared across all three populations, represented by the same SNP in American Indians and European Americans (rs191177668) and in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a lead SNP in Bangladesh (rs145537350). Beyond this shared signal, differences in LD patterns, minor allele frequency (MAF) (e.g., rs12573221 ~13% in Bangladesh ~0.2% among American Indians), and/or heterogeneity in effect sizes across populations likely contributed to the apparent population specificity of the additional identified signals. One of our potential causal variants influences AS3MT expression and nearby DNA methylation in numerous GTEx tissue types (with rs4919690 as a likely causal variant). Several SNPs in our confidence sets overlap transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory elements (from ENCODE).

Allosteric modulation of the CaS receptor corrects disorders of calcium homeostasis. Here, we report the cryogenic-electron microscopy reconstructions of a near-full-length CaS receptor in the absence and presence of allosteric modulators. Activation of the homodimeric CaS receptor requires a break in the transmembrane 6 (TM6) helix of each subunit, which facilitates the formation of a TM6-mediated homodimer interface and expansion of homodimer interactions. This transformation in TM6 occurs without a positive allosteric modulator. Two modulators with opposite functional roles bind to overlapping sites within the transmembrane domain through common interactions, acting to stabilize distinct rotamer conformations of key residues on the TM6 helix.

Multiple neurotoxic metals have been identified in e-cigarette aerosol. However, it is unknown whether those metals accumulate in the CNS at biologically meaningful levels. To answer this question, two groups of mice were whole-body exposed twice a day, 5 days a week, for two months, to either a dose of e-cigarette aerosol equivalent to human secondhand exposure, or a 5-fold higher dose. After the last exposure, the olfactory bulb, anterior and posterior frontal cortex, striatum, ventral midbrain, cerebellum, brainstem, remaining brain tissue and spinal cord were collected for metal quantification by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and compared to tissues from unexposed control mice. The two-month exposure caused significant accumulation of several neurotoxic metals in various brain areas - for some metals even at the low exposure dose. The most striking increases were measured in the striatum. For several metals, including Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Pb, similar accumulations are known to be neurotoxic in mice. Decreases in some essential metals were observed across the CNS. Our findings suggest that chronic exposure to e-cigarette aerosol could lead to CNS neurotoxic metal deposition and endogenous metal dyshomeostasis, including potential neurotoxicity.

Here we present a near full-length structure of the GABAB receptor, captured in an inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique 'intersubunit latch' within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium",

"Arsenic exposure associated T cell proliferation, smoking, and vitamin D in Bangladeshi men and women.", "Abstract": "There are limited data examining the consequences of environmental exposure to arsenic on the immune system in adults, particularly among smokers. Smoking has been shown to exacerbate or contribute to impaired immune function in men chronically exposed to arsenic. In contrast, vitamin D (VitD) is known to have a positive influence on innate and adaptive immune responses. The effect of circulating VitD on arsenic-associated immune dysfunction is not known. Here we examine the relationship of arsenic exposure and T cell proliferation (TCP), a measure of immune responsiveness, and circulating VitD among adult men and women in Bangladesh. Arsenic exposure was assessed using total urinary arsenic as well as urinary arsenic metabolites all adjusted for urinary creatinine. TCP was measured ex vivo in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 614 adult participants enrolled in the Bangladesh Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study; serum VitD was also evaluated. The influence of cigarette smoking on arsenic-induced TCP modulation was assessed only in males as there was an inadequate number of female smokers. These studies show that arsenic suppressed TCP in males. The association was significantly strong in male smokers and to a lesser extent in male non-smokers. Interestingly, we found a strong protective effect of high/sufficient serum VitD levels on TCP among non-smoking males. Furthermore, among male smokers with low serum VitD (\u229420 ng/ml), we found a strong suppression of TCP by arsenic.

Cyto-/chemokines produced by isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were assayed using a Multiplex system. Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that maternal (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and child (p\u2009=\u20090.02) U-As were positively associated with plasma LL-37 levels. Decreased MDM-mediated Spn killing (p\u2009=\u20090.05) and SBA responses (p\u2009=\u20090.02) were seen to be each associated with fractions of mono-methylarsonic acid (MMA; a U-As metabolite) in the children. In addition, U-As levels were seen to be negatively associated with PBMC formation of fractalkine and IL-7, and positively associated with that for IL-13, IL-17 and MIP-1\u03b1.

environmental pollutants to which people around the world are exposed through water, food and air. In mouse and in vitro studies of human cells, both of these chemicals have been shown to modulate the immune system. In some experimental studies, a synergistic disruption of immune function was observed by a combined exposure to arsenic and PAH. However, a joint effect of arsenic and PAH on immune function has not been studied in humans. We have conducted an epidemiological investigation to examine effects of chronic arsenic and PAH exposures on immune function. We assessed T-cell proliferation (TCP) and cytokine production of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated lymphocytes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBMC) among 197 healthy men enrolled to the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. By design, approximately half were active smokers and the rest were never smokers. Our analyses demonstrated that IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 were significantly stimulated as a function of urinary arsenic levels in models adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and PAH-DNA adducts. After correcting for false detection rate (FDR), only IL-1b remained statistically significant. We found a U-shaped dose response relationship between urinary arsenic and IL-1b. On the other hand, PAH-DNA adducts were associated with an inhibition of TCP and appeared as an inverted U-shape curve. Dose response curves were non-monotonic for PAH-DNA adduct exposures and suggested that cytokine secretion of IFNg, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10 and IL17A followed a complex pattern. In the majority of donors, there was a trend towards a decrease in cytokine associated with PAH-DNA adducts. We did not observe any interaction between urinary arsenic and PAH-DNA adducts on immune parameters. Our results indicate that long-term exposures to arsenic and PAH have independent, non-monotonic associations with TCP and cytokine production.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Arsenic", "Bangladesh", "DNA Adducts", "Environmental Exposure", "Humans", "Immunity", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Faruque", "Last Name": "Parvez", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Fredine T", "Last Name": "Lauer", "Affiliation": "University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pam", "Last Name": "Factor-Litvak", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xinhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Regina M", "Last Name": "Santella", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Field Research Office, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Mahbubul", "Last Name": "Eunus", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Field Research Office, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Nur", "Last Name": "Alam", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Field Research Office, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Golam", "Last Name": "Sarwar", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Field Research Office, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Mizanour", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "University of Chicago Field Research Office, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Habibul", "Last Name": "Ahsan", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Studies, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Scott W", "Last Name": "Burchiel", "Affiliation": "University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Albuquerque, NM, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31075594", "Title": "Thyroid hormones and neurobehavioral functions among adolescents chronically exposed to groundwater with geogenic arsenic in Bangladesh.", "Abstract": "Groundwater, the major source of drinking water in Bengal Delta Plain, is contaminated with geogenic arsenic (As) enrichment affecting millions of people. Children exposed to tubewell water containing As may be associated with thyroid dysfunction, which in turn may impact neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, data to support such relationship is sparse. The purpose of this study was to examine if chronic water As (WAs) from Holocene alluvial aquifers in this region was associated with serum thyroid hormone (TH) and if TH biomarkers were related to neurobehavioral (NB) performance in a group of adolescents. A sample of 32 healthy adolescents were randomly drawn from a child cohort in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Araihazar, Bangladesh. Half of these participants were consistently exposed to low WAs (<10\u202f\u03bcg/L) and the remaining half had high WAs exposure (\u226510\u202f\u03bcg/L) since birth. Measurements included serum total triiodothyronine (tT3), free thyroxine (fT4), thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb); concurrent WAs and urinary arsenic (UAs); and adolescents' NB performance. WAs and UAs were positively and significantly correlated with TPOAb but were not correlated with TSH, tT3 and fT4. After accounting for covariates, both WAs and UAs demonstrated positive but non-significant relationships with TSH and TPOAb and negative but non-significant relationships with tT3 and fT4. TPOAb was significantly associated with reduced NB performance indicated by positive associations with latencies in simple reaction time (b\u202f=\u202f82.58; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and symbol digit (b\u202f=\u202f276.85; p\u202f=\u202f0.005) tests. TSH was significantly and negatively associated with match-to-sample correct count (b\u202f=\u202f-0.95; p\u202f=\u202f0.05). Overall, we did not observe significant associations between arsenic exposure and TH biomarkers although the relationships were in the expected directions.

Once absorbed into the blood stream, most iAs is converted to mono-methylated (MMA) and then di-methylated (DMA) forms, facilitating excretion in urine. Arsenic metabolism efficiency varies among individuals, in part due to genetic variation near AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32). To identify additional arsenic metabolism loci, we measured protein-coding variants across the human exome for 1,660 Bangladeshi individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Among the 19,992 coding variants analyzed exome-wide, the minor allele (A) of rs61735836 (p.Val101Met) in exon 3 of FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) was associated with increased urinary iAs% (P = 8x10-13), increased MMA% (P = 2x10-16) and decreased DMA% (P = 6x10-23). Among 2,401 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions (an indicator of arsenic toxicity and cancer risk) and 2,472 controls, carrying the low-efficiency A allele (frequency = 7%) was associated with increased skin lesion risk (odds ratio = 1.35; P = 1x10-5). rs61735836 is in weak linkage disequilibrium with all nearby variants. The high-efficiency/major allele (G/Valine) is human-specific and eliminates a start codon at the first 5\u00b4-proximal Kozak sequence in FTCD, suggesting selection against an alternative translation start site. FTCD is critical for catabolism of histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In our study population, FTCD and AS3MT SNPs together explain ~10% of the variation in DMA% and support a causal effect of arsenic metabolism efficiency on arsenic toxicity (i.e., skin lesions). In summary, this work identifies a coding variant in FTCD associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency, providing new evidence supporting the established link between one-carbon/folate metabolism and arsenic toxicity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Alleles", "Ammonia-Lyases", "Arsenic", "Arsenic Poisoning", "Bangladesh", "Environmental Exposure", "Female", "Folic Acid", "Gene Frequency", "Glutamate Formimidoyltransferase", "Humans", "Male", "Methylation", "Methyltransferases", "Multifunctional Enzymes", "Mutation, Missense", "Odds Ratio", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Skin Diseases", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brandon L", "Last Name": "Pierce", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Samantha", "Last Name": "Dean", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Argos", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Farzana", "Last Name": "Jasmine", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Rakibuz-Zaman", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Golam", "Last Name": "Sarwar", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Md Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Hasan", "Last Name": "Shahriar", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Mahfuzar", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Md", "Last Name": "Yunus", "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Vincent J", "Last Name": "Lynch", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Devin", "Last Name": "Oglesbee", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad G", "Last Name": "Kibriya", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mary V", "Last Name": "Gamble", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Habibul", "Last Name": "Ahsan", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2019Mar"}, {"PMID": "30771745", "Title": "Changes in blood pressure associated with lead, manganese, and selenium in a Bangladeshi cohort.", "Abstract": "Heavy metal contamination is widespread in Bangladesh.

Developing an understanding of how inter-individual variability in inherited genetic variation alters the effects of environmental exposures will enhance our knowledge of disease mechanisms and improve our ability to predict disease and target interventions to high-risk sub-populations. Limited progress has been made identifying gene-environment interactions in the epidemiological setting using existing statistical approaches for genome-wide searches for interaction. In this paper, we describe a novel two-step approach using omics data to conduct genome-wide searches for gene-environment interactions. Using existing genome-wide SNP data from a large Bangladeshi cohort study specifically designed to assess the effect of arsenic exposure on health, we evaluated gene-arsenic interactions by first conducting genome-wide searches for SNPs that modify the effect of arsenic on molecular phenotypes (gene expression and DNA methylation features). Using this set of SNPs showing evidence of interaction with arsenic in relation to molecular phenotypes, we then tested SNP-arsenic interactions in relation to skin lesions, a hallmark characteristic of arsenic toxicity. With the emergence of additional omics data in the epidemiologic setting, our approach may have the potential to boost power for genome-wide interaction research, enabling the identification of interactions that will enhance our understanding of disease etiology and our ability to develop interventions targeted at susceptible sub-populations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arsenic", "Arsenic Poisoning", "DNA Methylation", "Epistasis, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Argos", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1603 West Taylor Street, MC 923, Chicago, IL, 60612, USA. argos@uic.edu."}, {"First Name": "Lin", "Last Name": "Tong", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shantanu", "Last Name": "Roy", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mekala", "Last Name": "Sabarinathan", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alauddin", "Last Name": "Ahmed", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Md Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad", "Last Name": "Rakibuz-Zaman", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Golam", "Last Name": "Sarwar", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Hasan", "Last Name": "Shahriar", "Affiliation": "UChicago Research Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Mahfuzar", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Research and Evaluation Division, BRAC, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Md", "Last Name": "Yunus", "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Farzana", "Last Name": "Jasmine", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad G", "Last Name": "Kibriya", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiang", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}, {"First Name": "Habibul", "Last Name": "Ahsan", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon L", "Last Name": "Pierce", "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA. brandonpierce@uchicago.edu."}], "Journal": "Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society", "PubDate": "2018Feb"}, {"PMID": "29421402", "Title": "Serum homocysteine, arsenic methylation, and arsenic-induced skin lesion incidence in Bangladesh: A one-carbon metabolism candidate gene study.", "Abstract": "Inorganic arsenic (As) is methylated via one carbon metabolism (OCM) to mono- and dimethylated arsenicals (MMA and DMA), facilitating urinary excretion.

Little is known about the effects of arsenic (As) on hematological disorders among men. We have examined the role of As exposure on hematological indicators of anemia in a group of men exposed to a wide range of As in their drinking water. We conducted a cross-sectional investigation among 119 healthy men in the Health Effects of As Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort, in rural Bangladesh. The participants are part of an ongoing study focused on evaluating the influence of As and smoking on immune function. Samples were collected at recruitment and analyzed for water As, urinary As (UAs) and UAs metabolites to assess As exposure. Blood samples were also collected at recruitment and assayed immediately for hematological parameters. We found that increased WAs levels were associated with decreased red blood cell counts [\u03b2=-0.13, p<0.0001] as well as hematocrit packed cell volumes [\u03b2=-0.68, p=0.008] following adjustment for age, smoking, body mass index and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts.

Unfortunately, therapeutic iron chelators also have undesired toxicity and may deliver iron to microbes. Here we show that a mutant form (K3Cys) of endogenous lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is filtered by the kidney but can bypass sites of megalin-dependent recapture, resulting in urinary excretion. Because K3Cys maintains recognition of its cognate ligand, the iron siderophore enterochelin, this protein can capture and transport iron even in the acidic conditions of urine. Mutant LCN2 strips iron from transferrin and citrate, and delivers it into the urine. In addition, it removes iron from iron overloaded mice, including models of acquired (iron-dextran or stored red blood cells) and primary (Hfe-/-) iron overload. In each case, the mutants reduce redox activity typical of non-transferrin-bound iron.

Thus, elevated exposure to arsenic could potentially be a contributing factor for ocular pathology. A pilot study was therefore initiated to determine whether As could be detected in eye tissue of mice exposed to sodium arsenite in drinking water. Total As concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy in whole eyes, lens, liver, heart, lung, kidneys, spleen, brain, and hair from mice given 0, 10, 50, or 250 ppm sodium arsenite in their drinking water for 4 wk or 0, 10 or 50 ppm for 6 mo. Dose-dependent increases in As concentration were observed in all organs and tissues. Surprisingly, As concentrations in the eye and lens were significantly higher than those in liver, lung, heart, spleen, and brain and similar to that found in kidneys.

Epidemiologic studies have suggested that arsenic (As) exposure is positively related to increases in blood pressure (BP), a primary CVD risk factor. However, evidence of whether genetic susceptibility can modify the association between As and BP is lacking. In this study, we used mixed effect models adjusted for potential confounders to examine the interaction between As exposure from well water and potential genetic modifiers on longitudinal change in BP over approximately 7years of follow-up in 1137 subjects selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. Genotyping was conducted for 235 SNPs in 18 genes related to As metabolism, oxidative stress and endothelial function. We observed interactions between 44 SNPs with well water As for one or more BP outcome measures (systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure (PP)) over the course of follow-up. The interaction between CYBA rs3794624 and well water As on annual PP remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR-adjusted p for interaction=0.05). Among individuals with the rs3794624 variant genotype, well water As was associated with a 2.23mmHg (95% CI: 1.14-3.32) greater annual increase in PP, while among those with the wild type, well water As was associated with a 0.13mmHg (95% CI: 0.02-0.23) greater annual increase in PP.

We tested the hypothesis that As exposure is associated with increased inflammation and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and examined whether the effects of As were modified by plasma glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), or the reduction potential of the GSSG/2GSH pair (EhGSH). In a cross-sectional study of N = 374 Bangladeshi adults having a wide range of As exposure, we measured markers of inflammation (plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP)), renal function (eGFR), GSH, and GSSG.

Our first objective for this paper was to examine the potential renal toxicity of As exposure in Bangladesh. Our second objective relates to examining whether the previously reported positive association between urinary creatinine (uCrn) and As methylation may be explained by renal function. We had hypothesized that these associations relate to supply and demand for s-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor for both creatine synthesis and As methylation. Alternatively, renal function could influence both As and creatinine excretion, or the As metabolites may influence renal function, which in turn influences uCrn. We conducted a cross-sectional study (N\u200a=\u200a478) of adults, composed of a sample recruited in 2001 and a sample recruited in 2003. We assessed renal function using plasma cystatin C, and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Consistent with renal toxicity of As, log-uAs had a marginal inverse association with eGFR in the 2003 sample (b\u200a=\u200a-5.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.07), however this association was not significant in the 2001 sample (b\u200a=\u200a-1.9, p\u200a=\u200a0.24). Adjustment for eGFR did not alter the associations between uCrn and the %uAs metabolites, indicating that GFR does not explain these associations. Increased eGFR was associated with increased odds of having %uInAs >12.2% (2001: OR\u200a=\u200a1.01, 95%CI (1.00,1.03); 2003: OR\u200a=\u200a1.04, 95%CI (1.01,1.07)). In the 2003 sample only, there was a negative association between eGFR and %uDMA (b\u200a=\u200a-0.08, p\u200a=\u200a0.02). These results may indicate differential effects of renal function on excretion of InAs and DMA. Alternatively, a certain methylation pattern, involving decreased %InAs and increased %DMA, may reduce renal function. Given that these studies were cross-sectional, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Discrepancies between the samples may be due to the higher As exposure, poorer nutrition, and lower As methylation capacity in the 2003 sample.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Arsenic", "Bangladesh", "Creatinine", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Environmental Exposure", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "S-Adenosylmethionine", "Water Pollutants, Chemical", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Brandilyn A", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Megan N", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xinhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Y Dana", "Last Name": "Neugut", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "J Richard", "Last Name": "Pilsner", "Affiliation": "Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Diane", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vesna", "Last Name": "Ilievski", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vesna", "Last Name": "Slavkovich", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Arsenic Project in Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Pam", "Last Name": "Factor-Litvak", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mary V", "Last Name": "Gamble", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "25325195", "Title": "Gene-specific differential DNA methylation and chronic arsenic exposure in an epigenome-wide association study of adults in Bangladesh.", "Abstract": "Inorganic arsenic is one of the most common naturally occurring contaminants found in the environment.

InAs undergoes hepatic methylation to form mono- and dimethyl arsenical species (MMA and DMA, respectively), facilitating arsenic elimination. Both reactions are catalyzed by arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor, yielding the methylated product and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a potent product-inhibitor of AS3MT. SAM biosynthesis depends on folate- and cobalamin-dependent one-carbon metabolism. With the use of samples from 353 participants in the Folate and Oxidative Stress Study, our objective was to test the hypotheses that blood SAM and SAH concentrations are associated with arsenic methylation and that these associations differ by folate and cobalamin nutritional status. Blood SAM and SAH were measured by HPLC. Arsenic metabolites in blood and urine were measured by HPLC coupled to dynamic reaction cell inductively coupled plasma MS. In linear regression analyses, SAH was not associated with any of the arsenic metabolites. However, log(SAM) was negatively associated with log(% urinary InAs) (\u03b2: -0.11; 95% CI: -0.19, -0.02; P = 0.01), and folate and cobalamin nutritional status significantly modified associations between SAM and percentage of blood MMA (%bMMA) and percentage of blood DMA (%bDMA) (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). In folate- and cobalamin-deficient individuals, log(SAM) was positively associated with %bMMA (\u03b2: 6.96; 95% CI: 1.86, 12.05; P < 0.01) and negatively associated with %bDMA (\u03b2: -6.19; 95% CI: -12.71, 0.32; P = 0.06).

Enzymes involved in DNA methylation, including DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, may show altered activity under oxidized cellular conditions. Additionally, in vitro studies suggest that glutathione (GSH) depletion leads to global DNA hypomethylation, possibly through the depletion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). We tested the hypothesis that a more oxidized blood GSH redox status is associated with decreased global peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA methylation in a sample of Bangladeshi adults. Global PBMC DNA methylation and whole blood GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and SAM concentrations were measured in 320 adults. DNA methylation was measured by using the [ (3)H]-methyl incorporation assay; values are inversely related to global DNA methylation. Whole blood GSH redox status (Eh) was calculated using the Nernst equation. We found that a more oxidized blood GSH Eh was associated with decreased global DNA methylation (B \u00b1 SE, 271 \u00b1 103, p = 0.009). Blood SAM and blood GSH were associated with global DNA methylation, but these relationships did not achieve statistical significance.

Comparing with the Wilcoxon test for paired predictors based on Harrell's C-index, we found that the proposed test is better in presence of random censoring, although the two unbiased tests are equivalent for outcome either uncensored or censored by a constant. A simulation study also demonstrates that the bias in estimated difference in concordance probability, due to ignoring random censoring, results in overestimated power, especially when random censoring is heavy. The method was applied in two studies, where the biomarkers measured from the same study subjects are correlated. The first study on 299 school children in Bangladesh found the associations that higher blood arsenic and manganese were related to lower intellectual test scores, while the differences between the biomarkers in predicting the intellectual test scores were not statistically significant. The second study on 418 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis found that the baseline serum bilirubin had greater discrimination accuracy than the baseline serum albumin in predicting survival time.", "Keywords": ["C-index", "concordance probability", "discrimination accuracy", "paired predictors", "random censoring"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arsenic", "Bias", "Bilirubin", "Biomarkers", "Biostatistics", "Child", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary", "Male", "Manganese", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Prognosis", "Serum Albumin", "Statistics, Nonparametric"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xinhua", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA XL26@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Zhezhen", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Statistical methods in medical research", "PubDate": "2016Feb"}, {"PMID": "22984214", "Title": "Approaches to increase arsenic awareness in Bangladesh: an evaluation of an arsenic education program.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to design and evaluate a household-level arsenic education and well water arsenic testing intervention to increase arsenic awareness in Bangladesh. The authors randomly selected 1,000 study respondents located in 20 villages in Singair, Bangladesh. The main outcome was the change in knowledge of arsenic from baseline to follow-up 4 to 6 months after the household received the intervention. This was assessed through a pre- and postintervention quiz concerning knowledge of arsenic. Respondents were between 18 and 102 years of age, with an average age of 37 years; 99.9% were female. The knowledge of arsenic quiz scores for study participants were significantly higher at follow-up compared with baseline. The intervention was effective in increasing awareness of the safe uses of arsenic-contaminated water and dispelling the misconception that boiling water removes arsenic. At follow-up, nearly all respondents were able to correctly identify the meaning of a red (contaminated) and green (arsenic safe) well relative to arsenic (99%). The educational program also significantly increased the proportion of respondents who were able to correctly identify the health implications of arsenic exposure. However, the intervention was not effective in dispelling the misconceptions in the population that arsenicosis is contagious and that illnesses such as cholera, diarrhea, and vomiting could be caused by arsenic. Further research is needed to develop effective communication strategies to dispel these misconceptions. This study demonstrates that a household-level arsenic educational program can be used to significantly increase arsenic awareness in Bangladesh.", "Keywords": ["arsenic", "developing countries", "educational intervention"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arsenic", "Arsenic Poisoning", "Bangladesh", "Female", "Fresh Water", "Health Education", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Rural Population", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Water Wells", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christine Marie", "Last Name": "George", "Affiliation": "Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. cmgeorge@jhsph.edu"}, {"First Name": "Pam", "Last Name": "Factor-Litvak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Khalid", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tariqul", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ashit", "Last Name": "Singha", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joyce", "Last Name": "Moon-Howard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "van Geen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Graziano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}]
