Although some of their encoded proteins retain the ability to form capsids and even transfer cargo, their fitness benefit has remained elusive. Here we show that the gag -like genes PNMA1 and PNMA4 support reproductive capacity. Six-week-old mice lacking either Pnma1 or Pnma4 are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, but by six months the mutant mice become prematurely subfertile, with precipitous drops in sex hormone levels, gonadal atrophy, and abdominal obesity; overall they produce markedly fewer offspring than controls. Analysis of donated human ovaries shows that expression of both genes declines normally with aging, while several PNMA1 and PNMA4 variants identified in genome-wide association studies are causally associated with low testosterone, altered puberty onset, or obesity. These findings expand our understanding of factors that maintain human reproductive health and lend insight into the domestication of retrotransposon-derived genes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas W P", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Henriques", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harrison B", "Last Name": "Cullen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mayra", "Last Name": "Romero", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cecilia S", "Last Name": "Blengini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shreya", "Last Name": "Sarathy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Sorkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hilina", "Last Name": "Bekele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seungsoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexei", "Last Name": "Chemiakine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rishad C", "Last Name": "Khondker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 V V", "Last Name": "Isola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Stout", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo A", "Last Name": "Gennarino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Binyam", "Last Name": "Mogessie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Devanshi", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Schindler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yousin", "Last Name": "Suh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Blake", "Last Name": "Wiedenheft", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luke E", "Last Name": "Berchowitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May14"}, {"PMID": "37070548", "Title": "Dosage sensitivity to Pumilio1 variants in the mouse brain reflects distinct molecular mechanisms.", "Abstract": "Different mutations in the RNA-binding protein Pumilio1 (PUM1) cause divergent phenotypes whose severity tracks with dosage: a mutation that reduces PUM1 levels by 25% causes late-onset ataxia, whereas haploinsufficiency causes developmental delay and seizures. Yet PUM1 targets are derepressed to equal degrees in both cases, and the more severe mutation does not hinder PUM1's RNA-binding ability. We therefore considered the possibility that the severe mutation might disrupt PUM1 interactions, and identified PUM1 interactors in the murine brain. We find that mild PUM1 loss derepresses PUM1-specific targets, but the severe mutation disrupts interactions with several RNA-binding proteins and the regulation of their targets. In patient-derived cell lines, restoring PUM1 levels restores these interactors and their targets to normal levels. Our results demonstrate that dosage sensitivity does not always signify a linear relationship with protein abundance but can involve distinct mechanisms.

In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a dosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential to prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 expression remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that ATXN1's unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Based on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' UTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator that binds to a conserved site in ATXN1's 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and translational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and mitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional evidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the possibility that noncoding mutations in the ATXN1 locus may act as risk factors for yet to be discovered progressive ataxias.", "Keywords": ["5\u2032 UTR", "SCA1", "miRNA", "neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": ["5' Untranslated Regions", "Animals", "Ataxin-1", "Cell Line", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "MicroRNAs", "Mutation", "Risk Factors", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Larissa", "Last Name": "Nitschke", "Affiliation": "Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ambika", "Last Name": "Tewari", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie L", "Last Name": "Coffin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eder", "Last Name": "Xhako", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaifang", "Last Name": "Pang", "Affiliation": "Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo A", "Last Name": "Gennarino", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer L", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francisco A", "Last Name": "Blanco", "Affiliation": "Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhandong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huda Y", "Last Name": "Zoghbi", "Affiliation": "Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA."}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2020Sep01"}, {"PMID": "32198202", "Title": "Pumilio proteins utilize distinct regulatory mechanisms to achieve complementary functions required for pluripotency and embryogenesis.", "Abstract": "Gene regulation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been extensively studied at the epigenetic-transcriptional level, but not at the posttranscriptional level. Pumilio (Pum) proteins are among the few known translational regulators required for stem-cell maintenance in invertebrates and plants.

Pum1/2 double-mutant ESCs display severely reduced self-renewal and differentiation, and Pum1/2 double-mutant mice are developmentally delayed at the morula stage and lethal by embryonic day 8.5. Remarkably, Pum1-deficient ESCs show increased expression of pluripotency genes but not differentiation genes, whereas Pum2-deficient ESCs show decreased pluripotency markers and accelerated differentiation. Thus, despite their high homology and overlapping target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), Pum1 promotes differentiation while Pum2 promotes self-renewal in ESCs. Pum1 and Pum2 achieve these two complementary aspects of pluripotency by forming a negative interregulatory feedback loop that directly regulates at least 1,486 mRNAs. Pum1 and Pum2 regulate target mRNAs not only by repressing translation, but also by promoting translation and enhancing or reducing mRNA stability of different target mRNAs.

Investigations of MECP2 mRNA and protein abundance in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells from one NUDT21 deletion and three duplication cases show that NUDT21 regulates MeCP2 protein quantity. Elevated NUDT21 increases usage of the distal polyadenylation site in the MECP2 3' UTR, resulting in an enrichment of inefficiently translated long mRNA isoforms. Furthermore, normalization of NUDT21 via siRNA-mediated knockdown in duplication patient lymphoblasts restores MeCP2 to normal levels.

FMRP is an mRNA-binding protein regulating neuronal translation of target mRNAs. Abnormalities in actin-rich dendritic spines are major neuronal features in FXS, but the molecular mechanism and identity of FMRP targets mediating this phenotype remain largely unknown. Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) was identified as an interactor of FMRP, and its mRNA is a highly ranked FMRP target in mouse brain. Importantly, Cyfip2 is a component of WAVE regulatory complex, a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that Cyfip2 could be implicated in the dendritic spine phenotype of FXS. Here, we generated and characterized Cyfip2-mutant (Cyfip2(+/-)) mice. We found that Cyfip2(+/-) mice exhibited behavioral phenotypes similar to Fmr1-null (Fmr1(-/y)) mice, an animal model of FXS. Synaptic plasticity and dendritic spines were normal in Cyfip2(+/-) hippocampus. However, dendritic spines were altered in Cyfip2(+/-) cortex, and the dendritic spine phenotype of Fmr1(-/y) cortex was aggravated in Fmr1(-/y); Cyfip2(+/-) double-mutant mice. In addition to the spine changes at basal state, metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-induced dendritic spine regulation was impaired in both Fmr1(-/y) and Cyfip2(+/-) cortical neurons. Mechanistically, mGluR activation induced mRNA translation-dependent increase of Cyfip2 in wild-type cortical neurons, but not in Fmr1(-/y) or Cyfip2(+/-) neurons. These results suggest that misregulation of Cyfip2 function and its mGluR-induced expression contribute to the neurobehavioral phenotypes of FXS.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cytoplasm", "Dendritic Spines", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein", "Fragile X Syndrome", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Nerve Tissue Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kihoon", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA kihoonh@bcm.edu hzoghbi@bcm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Hogmei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and, The Cain Foundation Laboratories Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo A", "Last Name": "Gennarino", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald", "Last Name": "Richman", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hui-Chen", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and, Program in Developmental Biology and Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA, The Cain Foundation Laboratories Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Huda Y", "Last Name": "Zoghbi", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Departments of Pediatrics and, Program in Developmental Biology and Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA, Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA kihoonh@bcm.edu hzoghbi@bcm.edu."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2015Apr01"}, {"PMID": "23431031", "Title": "Human-specific regulation of MeCP2 levels in fetal brains by microRNA miR-483-5p.", "Abstract": "Proper neurological function in humans requires precise control of levels of the epigenetic regulator methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 protein levels are low in fetal brains, where the predominant MECP2 transcripts have an unusually long 3' untranslated region (UTR). Here, we show that miR-483-5p, an intragenic microRNA of the imprinted IGF2, regulates MeCP2 levels through a human-specific binding site in the MECP2 long 3' UTR. We demonstrate the inverse correlation of miR-483-5p and MeCP2 levels in developing human brains and fibroblasts from Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients. Importantly, expression of miR-483-5p rescues abnormal dendritic spine phenotype of neurons overexpressing human MeCP2. In addition, miR-483-5p modulates the levels of proteins of the MeCP2-interacting corepressor complexes, including HDAC4 and TBL1X.
