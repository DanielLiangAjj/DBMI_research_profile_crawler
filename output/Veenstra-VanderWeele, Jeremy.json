[{"PMID": "38858755", "Title": "Adolescent chemogenetic activation of dopaminergic neurons leads to reversible decreases in amphetamine-induced stereotypic behavior.", "Abstract": "Chronic perturbations of neuronal activity can evoke homeostatic and new setpoints for neurotransmission. Using chemogenetics to probe the relationship between neuronal cell types and behavior, we recently found reversible decreases in dopamine (DA) transmission, basal behavior, and amphetamine (AMPH) response following repeated stimulation of DA neurons in adult mice. It is unclear, however, whether altering DA neuronal activity via chemogenetics early in development leads to behavioral phenotypes that are reversible, as alterations of neuronal activity during developmentally sensitive periods might be expected to induce persistent effects on behavior. To examine the impact of\u00a0developmental perturbation of DA neuron activity on basal and AMPH behavior, we expressed excitatory hM3D(Gq) in postnatal DA neurons in TH-Cre and WT mice. Basal and CNO- or AMPH-induced locomotion and stereotypy was evaluated in a longitudinal design, with clozapine N-oxide (CNO, 1.0\u00a0mg/kg) administered across adolescence (postnatal days 15-47). Repeated CNO administration did not impact basal behavior and only minimally reduced AMPH-induced hyperlocomotor response in adolescent TH-CrehM3Dq\u00a0mice relative to WThM3Dq littermate controls. Following repeated CNO administration, however, AMPH-induced stereotypic behavior robustly decreased in adolescent TH-CrehM3Dq\u00a0mice relative to controls. A two-month CNO washout period rescued the diminished AMPH-induced stereotypic behavior. Our findings indicate that the homeostatic compensations that take place in response to chronic hM3D(Gq) stimulation during adolescence are temporary and are dependent on ongoing chemogenetic stimulation.", "Keywords": ["Adolescence", "Amphetamine", "Chemogenetics", "Dopamine", "EAAT3", "Locomotion", "Stereotypic behavior", "hM3D(Gq)"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Amphetamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Stereotyped Behavior", "Clozapine", "Locomotion", "Mice", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Mice, Transgenic", "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase", "Behavior, Animal", "Integrases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Muhammad O", "Last Name": "Chohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA. muhammad.chohan@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Amy B", "Last Name": "Lewandowski", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca N", "Last Name": "Siegel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kally C", "Last Name": "O'Reilly", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular brain", "PubDate": "2024Jun11"}, {"PMID": "38712091", "Title": "Genome-wide association study identifies 30 obsessive-compulsive disorder associated loci.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects ~1% of the population and exhibits a high SNP-heritability, yet previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided limited information on the genetic etiology and underlying biological mechanisms of the disorder. We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis combining 53,660 OCD cases and 2,044,417 controls from 28 European-ancestry cohorts revealing 30 independent genome-wide significant SNPs and a SNP-based heritability of 6.7%. Separate GWAS for clinical, biobank, comorbid, and self-report sub-groups found no evidence of sample ascertainment impacting our results. Functional and positional QTL gene-based approaches identified 249 significant candidate risk genes for OCD, of which 25 were identified as putatively causal, highlighting WDR6, DALRD3, CTNND1 and genes in the MHC region. Tissue and single-cell enrichment analyses highlighted hippocampal and cortical excitatory neurons, along with D1- and D2-type dopamine receptor-containing medium spiny neurons, as playing a role in OCD risk. OCD displayed significant genetic correlations with 65 out of 112 examined phenotypes. Notably, it showed positive genetic correlations with all included psychiatric phenotypes, in particular anxiety, depression, anorexia nervosa, and Tourette syndrome, and negative correlations with a subset of the included autoimmune disorders, educational attainment, and body mass index.. This study marks a significant step toward unraveling its genetic landscape and advances understanding of OCD genetics, providing a foundation for future interventions to address this debilitating disorder.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nora I", "Last Name": "Strom", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Zachary F", "Last Name": "Gerring", "Affiliation": "Department of Mental Health and Neuroscience, Translational Neurogenomics, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Marco", "Last Name": "Galimberti", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Human Genetics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dongmei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Department of Center for Genomic Medicine, Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew W", "Last Name": "Halvorsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abdel", "Last Name": "Abdellaoui", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Rodriguez-Fontenla", "Affiliation": "CIMUS (Center for Research in Molecular Medicine and Chronic Diseases), Genomics and Bioinformatics, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, A Coru\u00f1a, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Julia M", "Last Name": "Sealock", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tim", "Last Name": "Bigdeli", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan R", "Last Name": "Coleman", "Affiliation": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Behrang", "Last Name": "Mahjani", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jackson G", "Last Name": "Thorp", "Affiliation": "Mental Health and Neuroscience Program, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Katharina", "Last Name": "Bey", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Christie L", "Last Name": "Burton", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences and Mental Health, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jurjen J", "Last Name": "Luykx", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Brain, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Gwyneth", "Last Name": "Zai", "Affiliation": "Molecular Brain Science Department, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health,, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Alemany", "Affiliation": "Psychiatric Genetics Unit, Group of Psychiatry, Mental Health and Addiction, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Andre", "Affiliation": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Institute, McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen D", "Last Name": "Askland", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Neurosciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Nerisa", "Last Name": "Banaj", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neuropsychiatry, IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Barlassina", "Affiliation": "Department of Heath Sciences, University of Milano, Milano, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Judith Becker", "Last Name": "Nissen", "Affiliation": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Aarhus University Hospital, Psychiatry, Aarhus, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "O Joseph", "Last Name": "Bienvenu", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, General Hospital Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donald", "Last Name": "Black", "Affiliation": "Departments of Roy J. and Lucille A.

In recent years, studies have identified subtle distinctions between the phenotypic effects of 16p11.2 duplication and 16p11.2 deletion with respect to patterns of autism, intellectual impairment, and psychiatric illness. However, although divergent phenotypic findings in some motor domains have been reported, no study has yet made a comprehensive comparison of motor difficulties between 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication carriers to elucidate points of convergence and divergence. We sought to make such a comparison in a group of 133 16p11.2 deletion carriers, 122 duplication carriers, and 388 familial controls, hypothesizing that motor impairment would overall be greater in deletion than duplication carriers. In a series of regression models, we found that 16p11.2 deletion status tended to predict greater impairment along indices of gross motor function, but less impairment along indices of fine motor function. These findings point to a potential pattern of performance difficulties that could be investigated in future studies.

Given this, their published mean plasma serotonin values of 1.2 uM and 2.4 uM for the control/contrast groups appear to be at least 30 to 60 times too high and should be disregarded. The plasma serotonin values reported for the long COVID and viremia patients also should be disregarded, as should any comparisons to the control/contrast groups. We also note that the plasma serotonin means for the two control/contrast groups are not in good agreement. In the \"Discussion\" section, Wong et al state that their results tend to support the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of COVID-19, and they encourage further clinical trials of SSRIs. While they state that, \"Our animal models demonstrate that serotonin levels can be restored and memory impairment reversed by precursor supplementation or SSRI treatment\", it should be noted that no data are presented showing an increase or restoration in circulating serotonin with SSRI administration. In fact, one would expect a marked decline in platelet serotonin due to SSRIs' effective inhibition of the platelet serotonin transporter. Wong et al hypothesize that problems of long COVID arise from too little peripheral serotonin. However, given the frequent presence of a hyperaggregation state in long COVID, and the known augmenting effects of platelet serotonin on platelet aggregation, it is plausible to suggest that reductions in platelet serotonin might be associated with a lessening of the cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "long COVID", "plasma", "platelets", "serotonin", "viral infection"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "George M", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Yale Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edwin H", "Last Name": "Cook", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy D", "Last Name": "Blakely", "Affiliation": "FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, Department of Biomedical Science, Florida Atlantic University, Jupiter, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "James S", "Last Name": "Sutcliffe", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of inflammation research", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38514191", "Title": "Forebrain EAAT3 Overexpression Increases Susceptibility to Amphetamine-Induced Repetitive Behaviors.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by intrusive obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Multiple studies have shown the association of polymorphisms in the SLC1A1 gene with OCD. The most common of these OCD-associated polymorphisms increases the expression of the encoded protein, excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), a neuronal glutamate transporter. Previous work has shown that increased EAAT3 expression results in OCD-relevant behavioral phenotypes in rodent models. In this study, we created a novel mouse model with targeted, reversible overexpression of Slc1a1 in forebrain neurons. The mice do not have a baseline difference in repetitive behavior but show increased hyperlocomotion following a low dose of amphetamine (3\u2005mg/kg) and increased stereotypy following a high dose of amphetamine (8\u2005mg/kg). We next characterized the effect of amphetamine on striatal cFos response and found that amphetamine increased cFos throughout the striatum in both control and Slc1a1-overexpressing (OE) mice, but Slc1a1-OE mice had increased cFos expression in the ventral striatum relative to controls. We used an unbiased machine classifier to robustly characterize the behavioral response to different doses of amphetamine and found a unique response to amphetamine in Slc1a1-OE mice, relative to controls. Lastly, we found that the differences in striatal cFos expression in Slc1a1-OE mice were driven by cFos expression specifically in D1 neurons, as Slc1a1-OE mice had increased cFos in D1 ventral medial striatal neurons, implicating this region in the exaggerated behavioral response to amphetamine in Slc1a1-OE mice.", "Keywords": ["D1-MSN", "DeepLabCut", "RNAScope", "amphetamine", "basal ganglia", "immediate early gene", "neurotransmitter transporters", "preclinical model", "repetitive behavior", "striatum"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Amphetamine", "Corpus Striatum", "Disease Models, Animal", "Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jared M", "Last Name": "Kopelman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Translational Neuroscience Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260."}, {"First Name": "Muhammad O", "Last Name": "Chohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Alex I", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Yttri", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 jeremy.veenstra@nyspi.columbia.edu ahmarise@upmc.edu."}, {"First Name": "Susanne E", "Last Name": "Ahmari", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Translational Neuroscience Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260 jeremy.veenstra@nyspi.columbia.edu ahmarise@upmc.edu."}], "Journal": "eNeuro", "PubDate": "2024Apr"}, {"PMID": "38294788", "Title": "Age-Not Just a Number in Youth Mental Health.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Adolescent", "Mental Health", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health Services"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Saunders", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Frances M", "Last Name": "Knapp", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "JAMA psychiatry", "PubDate": "2024Apr01"}, {"PMID": "37872145", "Title": "A non-canonical striatopallidal Go pathway that supports motor control.", "Abstract": "In the classical model of the basal ganglia, direct pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs) send projections to the substantia nigra (SNr) and entopeduncular nucleus to regulate motor function.

In FXLEARN, the effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) AFQ056 on language learning were evaluated in 3- to 6-year-old children with FXS, expected to have more learning plasticity than adults, for whom prior trials of mGluR5 NAMs have failed.METHODSAfter a 4-month single-blind placebo lead-in, participants were randomized 1:1 to AFQ056 or placebo, with 2 months of dose optimization to the maximum tolerated dose, then 6 months of treatment during which a language-learning intervention was implemented for both groups. The primary outcome was a centrally scored videotaped communication measure, the Weighted Communication Scale (WCS). Secondary outcomes were objective performance-based and parent-reported cognitive and language measures.RESULTSFXLEARN enrolled 110 participants, randomized 99, and had 91 who completed the placebo-controlled period. Although both groups made language progress and there were no safety issues, the change in WCS score during the placebo-controlled period was not significantly different between the AFQ056 and placebo-treated groups, nor were there any significant between-group differences in change in any secondary measures.CONCLUSIONDespite the large body of evidence supporting use of mGluR5 NAMs in animal models of FXS, this study suggests that this mechanism of action does not translate into benefit for the human FXS population and that better strategies are needed to determine which mechanisms will translate from preclinical models to humans in genetic neurodevelopmental disorders.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClincalTrials.gov NCT02920892.FUNDING SOURCESNeuroNEXT network NIH grants U01NS096767, U24NS107200, U24NS107209, U01NS077323, U24NS107183, U24NS107168, U24NS107128, U24NS107199, U24NS107198, U24NS107166, U10NS077368, U01NS077366, U24NS107205, U01NS077179, and U01NS077352;

In combination with optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to manipulate neural circuits in vivo, it is now possible to use model systems to test how specific neural circuits underlie social function and dysfunction. Here, we review the literature that has identified circuits associated with social interest (sociability), social reward, social memory, dominance, and aggression, and we outline a preliminary roadmap of the neural circuits driving these social behaviors.

Here we review and critically evaluate the evidence for the most promising biomarkers in the psychiatric neuroscience literature for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression and bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Candidate biomarkers reviewed include various neuroimaging, genetic, molecular and peripheral assays, for the purposes of determining susceptibility or presence of illness, and predicting treatment response or safety. This review highlights a critical gap in the biomarker validation process. An enormous societal investment over the past 50 years has identified numerous candidate biomarkers. However, to date, the overwhelming majority of these measures have not been proven sufficiently reliable, valid and useful to be adopted clinically. It is time to consider whether strategic investments might break this impasse, focusing on a limited number of promising candidates to advance through a process of definitive testing for a specific indication. Some promising candidates for definitive testing include the N170 signal, an event-related brain potential measured using electroencephalography, for subgroup identification within autism spectrum disorder; striatal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, such as the striatal connectivity index (SCI) and the functional striatal abnormalities (FSA) index, for prediction of treatment response in schizophrenia; error-related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index, for prediction of first onset of generalized anxiety disorder, and resting-state and structural brain connectomic measures for prediction of treatment response in social anxiety disorder. Alternate forms of classification may be useful for conceptualizing and testing potential biomarkers. Collaborative efforts allowing the inclusion of biosystems beyond genetics and neuroimaging are needed, and online remote acquisition of selected measures in a naturalistic setting using mobile health tools may significantly advance the field. Setting specific benchmarks for well-defined target application, along with development of appropriate funding and partnership mechanisms, would also be crucial.

It is unclear whether adaptive behavior in autistic youth is directly impacted by co-occurring ADHD symptoms or by another associated feature of both autism and ADHD, such as increased irritability. The current study examined relationships between irritability, ADHD symptoms, and adaptive behavior in 3- to 7-year-old autistic children. Results suggest that, after adjusting for co-occurring ADHD symptoms, higher levels of irritability are associated with differences in social adaptive behavior specifically. Understanding relationships between irritability, ADHD, and adaptive behavior in autistic children is critical because measures of adaptive behavior, such as the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Functioning, are often used as a proxy for global functioning, as well as for developing intervention plans and measuring outcomes as primary endpoints in clinical trials.", "Keywords": ["Adaptive Behavior", "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Irritability", "Preschool Age"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kimberly L H", "Last Name": "Carpenter", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.

Genetic studies in OCD have pointed to SLC1A1, which encodes the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, with evidence suggesting that increased expression contributes to risk. In mice, midbrain Slc1a1 expression supports repetitive behavior in response to dopaminergic agonists, aligning with neuroimaging and pharmacologic challenge studies that have implicated the dopaminergic system in OCD. These findings suggest that Slc1a1 may contribute to compulsive behavior through altered dopaminergic transmission; however, this theory has not been mechanistically tested. To examine the developmental impact of Slc1a1 overexpression on compulsive-like behaviors, we, therefore, generated a novel mouse model to perform targeted, reversible overexpression of Slc1a1 in dopaminergic neurons. Mice with life-long overexpression of Slc1a1 showed a significant increase in amphetamine (AMPH)-induced stereotypy and hyperlocomotion. Single-unit recordings demonstrated that Slc1a1 overexpression was associated with increased firing of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, dLight1.1 fiber photometry showed that these behavioral abnormalities were associated with increased dorsal striatum dopamine release. In contrast, no impact of overexpression was observed on anxiety-like behaviors or SKF-38393-induced grooming. Importantly, overexpression solely in adulthood failed to recapitulate these behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that overexpression during development is necessary to generate AMPH-induced phenotypes. However, doxycycline-induced reversal of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression in adulthood normalized both the increased dopaminergic firing and AMPH-induced responses. These data indicate that the pathologic effects of Slc1a1/EAAT3 overexpression on dopaminergic neurotransmission and AMPH-induced stereotyped behavior are developmentally mediated, and support normalization of EAAT3 activity as a potential treatment target for basal ganglia-mediated repetitive behaviors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Compulsive Behavior", "Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3", "Mice", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Stereotyped Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Muhammad O", "Last Name": "Chohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared M", "Last Name": "Kopelman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Translational Neuroscience Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Yueh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeinab", "Last Name": "Fazlali", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Natasha", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander Z", "Last Name": "Harris", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Balsam", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "E David", "Last Name": "Leonardo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edgar R", "Last Name": "Kramer", "Affiliation": "Peninsula Medical School, Faculty of Health, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. jeremy.veenstra@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Susanne E", "Last Name": "Ahmari", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Translational Neuroscience Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. ahmarise@upmc.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "34967130", "Title": "Autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia: An updated conceptual review.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are separate disorders, with distinct clinical profiles and natural histories. ASD, typically diagnosed in childhood, is characterized by restricted or repetitive interests or behaviors and impaired social communication, and it tends to have a stable course. SCZ, typically diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood, is characterized by hallucinations and delusions, and tends to be associated with declining function. However, youth with ASD are three to six times more likely to develop SCZ than their neurotypical counterparts, and increasingly, research has shown that ASD and SCZ converge at several levels. We conducted a systematic review of studies since 2013 relevant to understanding this convergence, and present here a narrative synthesis of key findings, which we have organized into four broad categories: symptoms and behavior, perception and cognition, biomarkers, and genetic and environmental risk. We then discuss opportunities for future research into the phenomenology and neurobiology of overlap between ASD and SCZ. Understanding this overlap will allow for researchers, and eventually clinicians, to understand the factors that may make a child with ASD vulnerable to developing SCZ. LAY SUMMARY: Autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia are distinct diagnoses, but people with autism and people with schizophrena share several characteristics. We review recent studies that have examined these areas of overlap, and discuss the kinds of studies we will need to better understand how these disorders are related. Understanding this will be important to help us identify which autistic children are at risk of developing schizophrenia.", "Keywords": ["autism spectrum disorder", "biomarker", "cognition", "medical genetics", "review", "schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Communication", "Humans", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amandeep", "Last Name": "Jutla", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Foss-Feig", "Affiliation": "Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Psychiatry, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "34644471", "Title": "Intranasal Oxytocin in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "Abstract": "Experimental studies and small clinical trials have suggested that treatment with intranasal oxytocin may reduce social impairment in persons with autism spectrum disorder.

Beyond difficulties with processing information within single sensory domains, including both hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity, difficulties in multisensory processing are becoming a core issue of focus in ASD. These difficulties may be targeted by treatment approaches such as \"sensory integration,\" which is frequently applied in autism treatment but not yet based on clear evidence. Recently, psychophysical data have emerged to demonstrate multisensory deficits in some children with ASD. Unlike deficits in social communication, which are best understood in humans, sensory and multisensory changes offer a tractable marker of circuit dysfunction that is more easily translated into animal model systems to probe the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Paralleling experimental paradigms that were previously applied in humans and larger mammals, we and others have demonstrated that multisensory function can also be examined behaviorally in rodents. Here, we review the sensory and multisensory difficulties commonly found in ASD, examining laboratory findings that relate these findings across species. Next, we discuss the known neurobiology of multisensory integration, drawing largely on experimental work in larger mammals, and extensions of these paradigms into rodents. Finally, we describe emerging investigations into multisensory processing in genetic mouse models related to autism risk. By detailing findings from humans to mice, we highlight the advantage of multisensory paradigms that can be easily translated across species, as well as the potential for rodent experimental systems to reveal opportunities for novel treatments. LAY SUMMARY: Sensory and multisensory deficits are commonly found in ASD and may result in cascading effects that impact social communication. By using similar experiments to those in humans, we discuss how studies in animal models may allow an understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie difficulties in multisensory integration, with the ultimate goal of developing new treatments.

We hypothesized that psychotic symptoms would be most common in duplication carriers followed by deletion carriers and noncarriers, that an ASD diagnosis would predict psychotic symptoms among CNV carriers, and that OCD symptoms would predict psychotic symptoms among all participants.

Dietary interventions are common in children and adolescents with ASD, including diets with increased omega-3 fatty acids or diets free of gluten and/or casein, which may also impact GI symptoms and nutrition. However, little is known about the relationship between nutritional intake and GI symptomatology in ASD. The objective of this study was to assess the relationships between GI symptoms, omega-3 intake, micronutrients, and macronutrients in children with ASD. Methods: A total of 120 children diagnosed with ASD participated in this multisite study. A food frequency questionnaire was completed by the patient's caretaker. The USDA Food Composition Database was utilized to provide nutritional data for the food items consumed by each participant. GI symptomatology was assessed using a validated questionnaire on pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms.

Previous studies have found that genetic variation predicts response to metformin in diabetes. In this study, we aimed to assess whether response to metformin for weight gain in this population is associated with variants in five genes previously implicated in metformin response in diabetes. Methods: Youth with ASD who experienced significant weight gain while taking mixed receptor antagonist medications were randomly assigned to metformin or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by open-label metformin treatment for 16 weeks. In the 53 participants with available DNA samples, we used a linear, mixed model analysis to assess response in the first 16 weeks of metformin treatment, whether in the randomized or open-label period, based upon genotypes at polymorphisms in five genes previously associated with metformin response in diabetes: ATM, SLC2A2, MATE1, MATE2, and OCT1. Results: In the primary analysis, both ATM and OCT1 showed significant effects of genotype on change in body mass index z-scores, the primary outcome measure, during the first 16 weeks of treatment with metformin. No other polymorphism showed a significant difference.

We investigated the KCC2b (Slc12a5) heterozygous knockout mouse using a battery of rodent behavioral tests relevant to core and comorbid ASD symptoms. Compared to wild-type littermates, KCC2+/- mice were normal in standard measures of locomotor activity, grooming and digging behaviors, and social, vocalization, and anxiety-like behaviors. However, KCC2+/- mice exhibited increased social dominance behaviors and increased amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) that were previously implicated in governing social hierarchy and dominance behaviors. Treatment of wild-type mouse brain slices with the KCC2 inhibitor VU0240511 increased the amplitude and frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents, partially recapitulating the phenotype of KCC2+/- mice. These findings indicate that the activity of KCC2 plays a role in social dominance, in parallel with effects on PFC signaling, further suggesting that KCC2 function has some relevance to social behavior but without the breadth of impact on autism-like behavior suggested by previous studies. Further testing could assess whether KCC2 alters other circuits and whether additional factors such as environmental insults may precipitate autism-related behavioral phenotypes.

Activation of p38 MAPK signaling networks has been identified in ASD, and p38 MAPK signaling elevates serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) activity, effects mimicked by multiple, hyperfunctional SERT coding variants identified in ASD subjects. Mice expressing the most common of these variants (SERT Ala56) exhibit hyperserotonemia, a biomarker observed in ASD subjects, as well as p38 MAPK-dependent SERT hyperphosphorylation, elevated hippocampal 5-HT clearance, hypersensitivity of CNS 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptors, and behavioral and gastrointestinal perturbations reminiscent of ASD.

Considerable work is still needed to understand how and when behavioural and medical treatments can be effective, and for which children, including those with substantial comorbidities. It is also important to implement what we already know and develop services for adults with autism spectrum disorder.

Structural, neurochemical, and behavioral findings point to a significant role for basal ganglia circuits and for the glutamate system in OCD. Genetic linkage and association studies in OCD point to SLC1A1, which encodes the neuronal glutamate/aspartate/cysteine transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3)/excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAC1). However, no previous studies have investigated EAAT3 in basal ganglia circuits or in relation to OCD-related behavior. Here, we report a model of Slc1a1 loss based on an excisable STOP cassette that yields successful ablation of EAAT3 expression and function. Using amphetamine as a probe, we found that EAAT3 loss prevents expected increases in (i) locomotor activity, (ii) stereotypy, and (iii) immediate early gene induction in the dorsal striatum following amphetamine administration. Further, Slc1a1-STOP mice showed diminished grooming in an SKF-38393 challenge experiment, a pharmacologic model of OCD-like grooming behavior. This reduced grooming is accompanied by reduced dopamine D1 receptor binding in the dorsal striatum of Slc1a1-STOP mice. Slc1a1-STOP mice also exhibit reduced extracellular dopamine concentrations in the dorsal striatum both at baseline and following amphetamine challenge. Viral-mediated restoration of Slc1a1/EAAT3 expression in the midbrain but not in the striatum results in partial rescue of amphetamine-induced locomotion and stereotypy in Slc1a1-STOP mice, consistent with an impact of EAAT3 loss on presynaptic dopaminergic function.

Genetic linkage and association studies of ASD and of whole blood 5-HT levels as a quantitative trait have revealed sexual dimorphism. Few studies have examined the presence of a sex difference on hyperserotonemia within ASD. To assess whether the rate of hyperserotonemia is different in males than in females with ASD, we measured whole blood 5-HT levels in 292 children and adolescents with ASD, the largest sample in which this biomarker has been assessed. Based upon previous work suggesting that hyperserotonemia is more common prior to puberty, we focused our analysis on the 182 pre-pubertal children with ASD. 42% of pre-pubertal participants were within the hyperserotonemia range. In this population, we found that males were significantly more likely to manifest hyperserotonemia than females (P\u2009=\u20090.03). As expected, no significant difference was found in the post-pubertal population. Additional work will be needed to replicate this intriguing finding and to understand whether it could potentially explain differences in patterns of ASD risk between males and females.

Pharmacological treatment studies also show specificity, with consistent response of OCD symptoms to chronic treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors; although most patients are left with residual impairment. In theory, animal models could provide a bridge from the neuroimaging and pharmacology data to an understanding of pathophysiology at the cellular and molecular level. Several mouse models have been proposed using genetic, immunological, pharmacological, and optogenetic tools. These experimental model systems allow testing of hypotheses about the origins of compulsive behavior. Several models have generated behavior that appears compulsive-like, particularly excessive grooming, and some have demonstrated response to chronic serotonin reuptake inhibitors, establishing both face validity and predictive validity. Construct validity is more difficult to establish in the context of a limited understanding of OCD risk factors.

Previously, we found that adult male mice expressing the autism-associated SERT Ala56 variant have altered central serotonin (5-HT) system function, as well as elevated peripheral blood 5-HT levels. Early in gestation, before midbrain 5-HT projections have reached the cortex, peripheral sources supply 5-HT to the forebrain, suggesting that altered maternal or placenta 5-HT system function could impact the developing embryo. We therefore used different combinations of maternal and embryo SERT Ala56 genotypes to examine effects on blood, placenta and embryo serotonin levels and neurodevelopment at embryonic day E14.5, when peripheral sources of 5-HT predominate, and E18.5, when midbrain 5-HT projections have reached the forebrain. Maternal SERT Ala56 genotype was associated with decreased placenta and embryonic forebrain 5-HT levels at E14.5. Low 5-HT in the placenta persisted, but forebrain levels normalized by E18.5. Maternal SERT Ala56 genotype effects on forebrain 5-HT levels were accompanied by a broadening of 5-HT-sensitive thalamocortical axon projections. In contrast, no effect of embryo genotype was seen in concepti from heterozygous dams. Blood 5-HT levels were dynamic across pregnancy and were increased in SERT Ala56 dams at E14.5. Placenta RNA sequencing data at E14.5 indicated substantial impact of maternal SERT Ala56 genotype, with alterations in immune and metabolic-related pathways. Collectively, these findings indicate that maternal SERT function impacts offspring placental 5-HT levels, forebrain 5-HT levels, and neurodevelopment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Genotype", "Maternal-Fetal Exchange", "Mice, Inbred Strains", "Mice, Transgenic", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Prosencephalon", "Rhombencephalon", "Serotonin", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Thalamus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher L", "Last Name": "Muller", "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Neuroscience, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Allison Mj", "Last Name": "Anacker", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical School, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany D", "Last Name": "Rogers", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nick", "Last Name": "Goeden", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Neurobiology and Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth H", "Last Name": "Keller", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "C Gunnar", "Last Name": "Forsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Travis M", "Last Name": "Kerr", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carly LA", "Last Name": "Wender", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical School, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "George M", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gregg D", "Last Name": "Stanwood", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy D", "Last Name": "Blakely", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandre", "Last Name": "Bonnin", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Neurobiology and Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical School, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2017Jan"}, {"PMID": "27321113", "Title": "Psychophysiological Associations with Gastrointestinal Symptomatology in Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by gastrointestinal disturbances, which also may impact behavior. Alterations in autonomic nervous system functioning are also frequently observed in ASD. The relationship between these findings in ASD is not known. We examined the relationship between gastrointestinal symptomatology, examining upper and lower gastrointestinal tract symptomatology separately, and autonomic nervous system functioning, as assessed by heart rate variability and skin conductance level, in a sample of 120 individuals with ASD. Relationships with co-occurring medical and psychiatric symptoms were also examined. While the number of participants with significant upper gastrointestinal tract problems was small in this sample, 42.5% of participants met criteria for functional constipation, a disorder of the lower gastrointestinal tract. Heart rate variability, a measure of parasympathetic modulation of cardiac activity, was found to be positively associated with lower gastrointestinal tract symptomatology at baseline. This relationship was particularly strong for participants with co-occurring diagnoses of anxiety disorder and for those with a history of regressive ASD or loss of previously acquired skills. These findings suggest that autonomic function and gastrointestinal problems are intertwined in children with ASD; although it is not possible to assess causality in this data set. Future work should examine the impact of treatment of gastrointestinal problems on autonomic function and anxiety, as well as the impact of anxiety treatment on gastrointestinal problems. Clinicians should be aware that gastrointestinal problems, anxiety, and autonomic dysfunction may cluster in children with ASD and should be addressed in a multidisciplinary treatment plan.

Some individuals with ASD show altered reactivity to stress and altered immune markers relative to typically-developing individuals, particularly stress-responsive cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Acute and chronic stress is associated with the onset and exacerbation of GI symptoms in those without ASD. The present study examined whether GI symptoms in ASD were associated with increases in cortisol, a stress-associated endocrine marker, and TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in response to stress. As hypothesized, a greater amount of lower GI tract symptoms were significantly associated with post-stress cortisol concentration. The relationship between cortisol response to stress and GI functioning was greater for children who had a history of regressive autism. Exploratory analyses revealed significant correlations between cortisol response, intelligence, and inappropriate speech. In contrast, symptoms of the lower GI tract were not associated with levels of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-6. Significant correlations were found, however, between TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and irritability, socialization, and intelligence. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD and symptoms of the lower GI tract may have an increased response to stress, but this effect is not associated with concomitant changes in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6.

It is not clear, however, how gut dysfunction relates to core ASD features. Multiple, rare hyperfunctional coding variants of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT, encoded by SLC6A4) have been identified in ASD. Expression of the most common SERT variant (Ala56) in mice increases 5-HT clearance and causes ASD-like behaviors. Here, we demonstrated that Ala56-expressing mice display GI defects that resemble those seen in mice lacking neuronal 5-HT. These defects included enteric nervous system hypoplasia, slow GI transit, diminished peristaltic reflex activity, and proliferation of crypt epithelial cells. An opposite phenotype was seen in SERT-deficient mice and in progeny of WT dams given the SERT antagonist fluoxetine. The reciprocal phenotypes that resulted from increased or decreased SERT activity support the idea that 5-HT signaling regulates enteric neuronal development and can, when disturbed, cause long-lasting abnormalities of GI function. Administration of a 5-HT4 agonist to Ala56 mice during development prevented Ala56-associated GI perturbations, suggesting that excessive SERT activity leads to inadequate 5-HT4-mediated neurogenesis. We propose that deficient 5-HT signaling during development may contribute to GI and behavioral features of ASD.

The most widely prescribed antidepressant medications are serotonin (5-HT) selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Although there is much support for 5-HT transporter (SERT) antagonism as a basis of antidepressant efficacy, this evidence is indirect and other targets and mechanisms have been proposed. In order to distinguish SERT-dependent and -independent effects of SSRIs, we developed a knock-in mouse model whereby high-affinity interactions of many antidepressants at SERT have been ablated via knock-in substitution (SERT Met172) without disrupting 5-HT recognition or uptake. Here we utilize the C57BL/6J SERT Met172 model to evaluate SERT dependence for the actions of two widely prescribed SSRIs, fluoxetine and citalopram, in tests sensitive to acute and chronic actions of antidepressants. In the tail suspension and forced swim tests, fluoxetine and citalopram fail to reduce immobility in SERT Met172 mice. In addition, SERT Met172 mice are insensitive to chronic fluoxetine and citalopram administration in the novelty induced hypophagia test (NIH) and fail to exhibit enhanced proliferation or survival of hippocampal stem cells. In both acute and chronic studies, SERT Met172 mice maintained sensitivity to paroxetine, an antidepressant that is unaffected by the Met172 mutation. Together, these studies provide definitive support for an essential role of SERT antagonism in the acute and chronic actions of two commonly used SSRIs in these tests, and reinforce the utility of the SERT Met172 model for isolating SERT/5-HT contributions of drug actions in vivo.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antidepressive Agents", "Brain", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Citalopram", "Depression", "Disease Models, Animal", "Fluoxetine", "Food Preferences", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hindlimb Suspension", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Methionine", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Serotonin", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Synaptosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alex G", "Last Name": "Nackenoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra B", "Last Name": "Moussa-Tooks", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Austin M", "Last Name": "McMeekin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons/New York Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Randy D", "Last Name": "Blakely", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA."}], "Journal": "Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology", "PubDate": "2016Jun"}, {"PMID": "26506588", "Title": "Clinical Correlates of Early Generalized Overgrowth in Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Female", "Head", "Humans", "Male", "Torso"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kelly", "Last Name": "McGuire", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "Amy M", "Last Name": "Shui", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, New York State Psychiatric Institute and New York-Presbyterian Hospital Center for Autism and the Developing Brain, New York City.

Replication in the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) was attempted using available medical condition data on gastrointestinal disturbances (GID), sleep problems, allergy and epilepsy. In the AGRE cohort, no discrete clusters emerged among 14 medical conditions. GID and seizures were enriched in unaffected family members, and together with sleep problems, were represented in both AGRE and SSC. Further analysis of these medical conditions identified predictive co-occurring patterns in both samples. For a child with ASD, the presence of GID predicts sleep problems and vice versa, with an approximately 2-fold odds ratio in each direction. These risk patterns were replicated in the SSC sample, and in addition, there was increased risk for seizures and sleep problems to co-occur with GID. In these cohorts, seizure alone was not predictive of the other conditions co-occurring, but behavioral impairments were more severe as the number of co-occurring medical symptoms increased.

Here we examine the consequences of haploinsufficiency in the mouse integrin \u03b23 subunit gene (Itgb3) on SERT function and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) effectiveness in vivo. Biochemical fractionation studies and immunofluorescent staining of murine brain slices reveal that \u03b1v\u03b23 receptors and SERTs are enriched in presynaptic membranes from several brain regions and that \u03b1v\u03b23 colocalizes with a subpopulation of SERT-containing synapses in raphe nuclei. Notably, we establish that loss of a single allele of Itgb3 in murine neurons is sufficient to decrease 5-HT uptake by SERT in midbrain synaptosomes. Pharmacological assays to elucidate the \u03b1v\u03b23-mediated mechanism of reduced SERT function indicate that decreased integrin \u03b23 subunit expression scales down the population size of active SERT molecules and, as a consequence, lowers the effective dose of SSRIs. These data are consistent with the existence of a subpopulation of SERTs that are tightly modulated by integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and significantly contribute to global SERT function at 5-HT synapses in the midbrain. Importantly, our screen of a normal human population for single nucleotide polymorphisms in human ITGB3 identified a variant associated with reductions in integrin \u03b23 expression levels that parallel our mouse findings.

Prior studies have focused on large mammals, yet the mouse offers a host of advantages, most importantly the wealth of available genetic manipulations relevant to human disease. To begin to employ this model species for multisensory research it is necessary to first establish and validate a robust behavioral assay for the mouse. Two common mouse strains (C57BL/6J and 129S6/SvEv) were first trained to respond to unisensory (visual and auditory) stimuli separately. Once trained, performance with paired audiovisual stimuli was then examined with a focus on response accuracy and behavioral gain. Stimulus durations varied from 50 ms to 1 s in order to modulate the effectiveness of the stimuli and to determine if the well-established \"principle of inverse effectiveness\" held in this model. Response accuracy in the multisensory condition was greater than for either unisensory condition for all stimulus durations, with significant gains observed at the 300 ms and 100 ms durations. Main effects of stimulus duration, stimulus modality and a significant interaction between these factors were observed. The greatest behavioral gain was seen for the 100 ms duration condition, with a trend observed that as the stimuli became less effective, larger behavioral gains were observed upon their pairing (i.e., inverse effectiveness).

One previous study in ASD found association of a rare, hyperfunctional SERT variant with sensory aversion, but studies of common SERT variants have never examined sensory symptoms in ASD.

Some of these targeted treatments later show benefit for a broader, yet specific, array of cancers.

There is greater awareness of medical conditions that co-occur with autism and expansion of treatment options. Closer scrutiny has led to refinement of the diagnostic criteria, and there have been advances in genetics examining potential causal factors. Transition to adulthood is an area of growing concern, and professionals and families require guidance on this issue. This article summarizes the proceedings of the Autism Speaks conference on Treating the Whole Person with Autism: Care across the Lifespan. The conference was organized with the intent of providing a forum for both families and professionals to learn about the most current research in the field. Dr. Sue Swedo provides important background information regarding the changes in the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders. She particularly deals with the concerns of individuals and families that their autism diagnosis may change. Recommendations for genetic testing and its interpretation are provided by Dr. David Miller. His discussion helps make sense of the utility of genetic testing for ASD, along with demonstration of the complexity of determining which genetic factors are doing what and through which pathways.

We have quantified the variance in liability to disease explained by all SNPs for two phenotypically-related neurobehavioral disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette Syndrome (TS), using GCTA. Our analysis yielded a heritability point estimate of 0.58 (se = 0.09, p = 5.64e-12) for TS, and 0.37 (se = 0.07, p = 1.5e-07) for OCD. In addition, we conducted multiple genomic partitioning analyses to identify genomic elements that concentrate this heritability. We examined genomic architectures of TS and OCD by chromosome, MAF bin, and functional annotations. In addition, we assessed heritability for early onset and adult onset OCD. Among other notable results, we found that SNPs with a minor allele frequency of less than 5% accounted for 21% of the TS heritability and 0% of the OCD heritability. Additionally, we identified a significant contribution to TS and OCD heritability by variants significantly associated with gene expression in two regions of the brain (parietal cortex and cerebellum) for which we had available expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Finally we analyzed the genetic correlation between TS and OCD, revealing a genetic correlation of 0.41 (se = 0.15, p = 0.002). These results are very close to previous heritability estimates for TS and OCD based on twin and family studies, suggesting that very little, if any, heritability is truly missing (i.e., unassayed) from TS and OCD GWAS studies of common variation.

Diabetes is a risk factor for these conditions. Insulin resistance in the brain is specifically associated with susceptibility to psychostimulant abuse. Here, we examined whether phosphorylation of Akt, a key regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, controls serotonin (5-HT) signaling. To explore how impairment in Akt function regulates 5-HT homeostasis, we used a brain-specific rictor knockout (KO) mouse model of impaired neuronal phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. Cortical 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor binding was significantly elevated in rictor KO mice. Concomitant with this elevated receptor expression, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) led to an increased hypothermic response in rictor KO mice. The increased cortical 5-HT1A receptor density was associated with higher 5-HT1A receptor levels on the cortical cell surface. In contrast, rictor KO mice displayed significantly reduced head-twitch response (HTR) to the 5-HT2A/C agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), with evidence of impaired 5-HT2A/C receptor signaling. In vitro, pharmacological inhibition of Akt significantly increased 5-HT1A receptor expression and attenuated DOI-induced 5-HT2A receptor signaling, thereby lending credence to the observed in vivo cross-talk between neuronal Akt signaling and 5-HT receptor regulation. These data reveal that defective central Akt function alters 5-HT signaling as well as 5-HT-associated behaviors, demonstrating a novel role for Akt in maintaining neuronal 5-HT receptor function.", "Keywords": ["5HT(1A) receptor", "5HT(2A) receptor", "Akt", "Cortex", "Serotonin"], "MeSH terms": ["8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin", "Animals", "Insulin", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Neurons", "Oncogene Protein v-akt", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A", "Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A", "Serotonin", "Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Serotonin Receptor Agonists", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Saunders", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Siuta", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina D", "Last Name": "Robertson", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Adeola R", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Sauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Heinrich J G", "Last Name": "Matthies", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Paul J", "Last Name": "Gresch", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Airey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Craig W", "Last Name": "Lindsley", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Schetz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX."}, {"First Name": "Kevin D", "Last Name": "Niswender", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy M", "Last Name": "Veenstra-Vanderweele", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}, {"First Name": "Aurelio", "Last Name": "Galli", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN."}], "Journal": "Neurochemistry international", "PubDate": "2014Jul"}, {"PMID": "24083388", "Title": "Genetic background modulates phenotypes of serotonin transporter Ala56 knock-in mice.", "Abstract": "Previously, we identified multiple, rare serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) variants in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

AEDs do not appear to have a large effect size to treat behavioral symptoms in ASD, but further research is needed, particularly in the subgroup of patients with epileptiform abnormalities.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anticonvulsants", "Child", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Fructose", "Humans", "Irritable Mood", "Lamotrigine", "Levetiracetam", "Piracetam", "Topiramate", "Triazines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tomoya", "Last Name": "Hirota", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1601 23rd Avenue South 3102 VPH, Nashville, TN, 37212, USA, tomoya.hirota@vanderbilt.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-Vanderweele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Hollander", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taro", "Last Name": "Kishi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of autism and developmental disorders", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}, {"PMID": "24074462", "Title": "Here/in this issue and there/abstract thinking: human brain development in a dish.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Child", "Child Development", "Diet", "Humans", "Poverty"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-Vanderweele", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on Human Development, Vanderbilt Brain Institute, Nashville, TN.

We hypothesized that mice could be used to make a similar judgment if they prefer \"typical\" over \"atypical\" social interactions with mouse models relevant to ASD. We used wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice as \"judges\" and evaluated their preference for a chamber containing a \"typical\" (B6 or 129S6) or an \"atypical\" mouse. For our atypical mouse stimuli, we chose two inbred strains with well-documented social phenotypes (BTBR and BALB/c), as well a mutant line with abnormal social behavior and seizures (Gabrb3 +/-). Overall, we observed a stimulus by time interaction (P < 0.0001), with B6 mice preferring the typical mouse chamber during the last 10 min of the 30-min test. For two of the individual stimulus pairings, we observed a similar chamber by time interaction (BALB/c vs. 129S6, P = 0.0007; Gabrb3 +/- vs. 129S6, P = 0.033). For the third stimulus pairing, we found a trend for preference of the typical mouse across time (BTBR vs. B6, P = 0.051). We repeated the experiments using 129S6 mice as judges and found a significant overall interaction (P = 0.034), but only one stimulus pairing reached significance on its own (BALB/c vs. 129S6, P = 0.0021). These data suggest that a characteristic pattern of exploration in B6 mice can distinguish some socially atypical animals from controls.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Disease Models, Animal", "Exploratory Behavior", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Inbred Strains", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Social Behavior"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Charisma R", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carl Gunnar", "Last Name": "Forsberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jing-Qiong", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeremy", "Last Name": "Veenstra-VanderWeele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research", "PubDate": "2013Jun"}, {"PMID": "22976374", "Title": "Brief report: retrospective case series of oxcarbazepine for irritability/agitation symptoms in autism spectrum disorder.", "Abstract": "We examined response to oxcarbazepine prescribed for irritability/agitation symptoms in a retrospective case series of 30 patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
