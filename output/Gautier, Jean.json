ICL inducing compounds are commonly used as chemotherapies due to their effectiveness in inhibiting cell proliferation. Naturally occurring crosslinking agents formed from metabolic processes can also pose a challenge to genome stability especially in slowly or non-dividing cells.

A total of 194 plasma samples were collected from patients with type 2 DM and DR (moderate to proliferative (PDR) or control (no or mild DR) matched for age, gender, diabetes duration, HbA1c, and hypertension. Untargeted lipidomic and metabolomic approaches were performed. Partial-least square methods were used to analyze the datasets. Levels of 69 metabolites and 85 lipid species were found to be significantly different in the plasma of DR patients versus controls. Metabolite set enrichment analysis indicated that pathways such as metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (methylglutaryl carnitine p = 0.004), the kynurenine pathway (tryptophan p < 0.001), and microbiota metabolism (p-Cresol sulfate p = 0.004) were among the most enriched deregulated pathways in the DR group.

To address the physiological role of CtIP, an essential gene, in translocation-mediated lymphomagenesis, we introduced the T855A mutation at murine CtIP to nonhomologous end-joining and Tp53 double-deficient mice that routinely succumbed to lymphomas carrying A-EJ-mediated IgH-Myc translocations. T855 of CtIP is phosphorylated by ATM or ATR kinases upon DNA damage to promote end resection. Here, we reported that the T855A mutation of CtIP compromised the neonatal development of Xrcc4-/-Tp53-/- mice and the IgH-Myc translocation-driven lymphomagenesis in DNA-PKcs-/-Tp53-/- mice. Mechanistically, the T855A mutation limits DNA end resection length without affecting hairpin opening, translocation frequency, or fork stability.

We aimed to examine whether non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus enhances the risk of virus infections compared with the risk in healthy individuals without non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed case-control and cohort studies on the association between non-autoimmune diabetes and viruses. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science with no language restriction, to identify articles published until February 15, 2021. The main outcome assessment was the risk of virus infection in individuals with non-autoimmune diabetes.

This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019134142. Out of 3136 articles identified, we included 68 articles (90 studies, as the number of virus and or diabetes phenotype varied between included articles).

Only patients eligible for SDD (no oral anticoagulant, distance home-hospital <150 km) and having >6-month follow-up were included (n = 180). All patients underwent RARP with or without lymph node dissection. Comparisons were performed between SDD (n = 42) and inpatient RARP (n = 138).

MYC is a key oncogene activated across most cancers, and identifying associated synthetic lethality or sickness can provide important clues about its activity and potential therapeutic strategies. On the basis of previously conducted genome-wide screenings in MCF10A cells expressing MYC fused to an estrogen receptor fragment, we identified UVSSA, a gene involved in transcription-coupled repair, whose knockdown or knockout decreased cell viability when combined with MYC expression. Synthetic sick interactions between MYC expression and UVSSA down-regulation correlated with ATM/CHK2 activation, suggesting increased genome instability. We show that the synthetic sick interaction is diminished by attenuating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity; yet, it is independent of UV-induced damage repair, suggesting that UVSSA has a critical function in regulating RNAPII in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Supporting this hypothesis, RNAPII ChIP-seq revealed that MYC-dependent increases in RNAPII promoter occupancy are reduced or abrogated by UVSSA knockdown, suggesting that UVSSA influences RNAPII dynamics during MYC-dependent transcription. Taken together, our data show that the UVSSA complex has a significant function in supporting MYC-dependent RNAPII dynamics and maintaining cell survival during MYC addiction.

While A-EJ-mediated repair of endonuclease-generated breaks requires DNA end resection, we show that CtIP-mediated DNA end resection is dispensable for A-EJ-mediated CSR using cNHEJ-deficient B cells. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed that loss of ATM/ATR phosphorylation of CtIP at T855 or ATM kinase inhibition suppresses resection without altering the MH pattern of the A-EJ-mediated switch junctions. Moreover, we found that ATM kinase promotes Alt-EJ-mediated CSR by suppressing interchromosomal translocations independent of end resection. Finally, temporal analyses reveal that MHs are enriched in early internal deletions even in cNHEJ-proficient B cells.

The SSA consisted in respecting the sphincteric sleeve during the anastomosis suturing only the internal layer of the urethra with the bladder and thereby avoiding the loss of sphincteric length induced by the suture.

In Group 2 (SSA), we observed a complete continence recovery in 75.6% at catheter removal (p\u2009=\u20090.0000035), in 82.9% at 1 month (p\u2009=\u20090.000092), and in 97.5% at 1 year (p\u2009=\u20090.028), independently of bladder neck preservation (p\u2009=\u20090.388). There was also a significant difference between the two groups concerning urinary reeducation requirement (p\u2009=\u20090.0006), pad use, and urinary quality of life (p\u2009=\u20090.0000002).

The two primary mechanisms of T2DM pathogenesis are pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance.

Therapeutic modalities that improve \u03b2-cell function are considered critical to T2DM management; however, blood glucose control remains a challenge for many patients due to suboptimal treatment efficacy and the progressive nature of T2DM. Incretin-based therapies are now the most frequently prescribed antidiabetic drugs in Korea. Incretin-based therapies are a favorable class of drugs due to their ability to reduce blood glucose by targeting the incretin hormone system and, most notably, their potential to improve pancreatic \u03b2-cell function.

Altering the balance of MYC protein levels at the level of transcription, protein stability, or turnover is sufficient to transform cells to a tumorigenic phenotype. While direct targeting of MYC is difficult, specific genetic vulnerabilities of MYC-deregulated cells could be exploited to selectively inhibit their growth. Using a genome-wide shRNA screen, we identified 78 candidate genes, which are required for survival of human mammary epithelial cells with elevated MYC levels. Among the candidates, we validated and characterized FBXW7, a component of the SCF-like ubiquitin ligase complex that targets MYC for proteasomal degradation. Down-regulation of FBXW7 leads to synergistic accumulation of cellular and active chromatin-bound MYC, while protein levels of other FBXW7 targets appear unaffected. Over a four-week time course, continuous FBXW7 down-regulation and MYC activation together cause an accumulation of cells in S-phase and G2/M-phase of the cell cycle. Under these conditions, we also observe elevated chromatin-bound levels of CDC45, suggesting increased DNA replication stress. Consistent with these results, FBXW7 down-regulation alone decreases the survival of T47D breast cancer cells.

Chromatin binding by modified CtIP precedes extensive resection and full checkpoint activation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Extracts", "Chromatin", "Conserved Sequence", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Cleavage", "DNA Repair", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Rabbits", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Xenopus Proteins", "Xenopus laevis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shaun E", "Last Name": "Peterson", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yinyin", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Foon", "Last Name": "Wu-Baer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian T", "Last Name": "Chait", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Baer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Max E", "Last Name": "Gottesman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Gautier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Molecular cell", "PubDate": "2013Feb21"}]
