ASCC1 uniquely combines two evolutionarily ancient domains: nucleotide-binding K-Homology (KH) (associated with regulating splicing, transcriptional, and translation) and two-histidine phosphodiesterase (PDE; associated with hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotide phosphate bonds). Germline mutations link loss of ASCC1 function to spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures 2 (SMABF2). Herein analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggests ASCC1 RNA overexpression in certain tumors correlates with poor survival, Signatures 29 and 3 mutations, and genetic instability markers. We determined crystal structures of Alvinella pompejana (Ap) ASCC1 and Human (Hs) PDE domain revealing high-resolution details and features conserved over 500 million years of evolution. Extending our understanding of the KH domain Gly-X-X-Gly sequence motif, we define a novel structural Helix-Clasp-Helix (HCH) nucleotide binding motif and show ASCC1 sequence-specific binding to CGCG-containing RNA. The V-shaped PDE nucleotide binding channel has two His-\u03a6-Ser/Thr-\u03a6 (HXT) motifs (\u03a6 being hydrophobic) positioned to initiate cyclic phosphate bond hydrolysis. A conserved atypical active-site histidine torsion angle implies a novel PDE substrate. Flexible active site loop and arginine-rich domain linker appear regulatory. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed aligned KH-PDE RNA binding sites with limited flexibility in solution. Quantitative evolutionary bioinformatic analyses of disease and cancer-associated mutations support implied functional roles for RNA binding, phosphodiesterase activity, and regulation. Collective results inform ASCC1's roles in transactivation and alkylation damage responses, its targeting by structure-based inhibitors, and how ASCC1 mutations may impact inherited disease and cancer.", "Keywords": ["DNA repair", "RNA", "binding protein", "conformational change", "crystallography", "genomics", "inhibition mechanism", "phosphodiesterase: cancer", "small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)", "structural biology"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Computational Biology", "RNA-Binding Motifs"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Naga Babu", "Last Name": "Chinnam", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roopa", "Last Name": "Thapar", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew S", "Last Name": "Arvai", "Affiliation": "Integrative Structural & Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Altaf H", "Last Name": "Sarker", "Affiliation": "Biological Systems and Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer M", "Last Name": "Soll", "Affiliation": "Division of Laboratory and Genomic Medicine, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tanmoy", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aleem", "Last Name": "Syed", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Rosenberg", "Affiliation": "Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michal", "Last Name": "Hammel", "Affiliation": "Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Albino", "Last Name": "Bacolla", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Panagiotis", "Last Name": "Katsonis", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Abhishek", "Last Name": "Asthana", "Affiliation": "Department Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miaw-Sheue", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Biological Systems and Engineering, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Lichtarge", "Affiliation": "Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Silverman", "Affiliation": "Department Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nima", "Last Name": "Mosammaparast", "Affiliation": "Division of Laboratory and Genomic Medicine, Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan E", "Last Name": "Tsutakawa", "Affiliation": "Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.

Characterizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that lack DPH or show synthetic growth defects in the absence of DPH, we show that loss of DPH increases resistance to the fungal translation inhibitor sordarin and increases -1 ribosomal frameshifting at non-programmed sites during normal translation elongation and at viral programmed frameshifting sites. Ribosome profiling of yeast and mammalian cells lacking DPH reveals increased ribosomal drop-off during elongation, and removal of out-of-frame stop codons restores ribosomal processivity on the ultralong yeast MDN1 mRNA. Finally, we show that ADP-ribosylation of DPH impairs the productive binding of eEF2 to elongating ribosomes.

NER couples lesion recognition by XPC to strand separation by XPB and XPD ATPases, followed by lesion excision by XPF and XPG nucleases. Here, we describe key regulatory mechanisms and roles of XPG for and beyond its cleavage activity. Strikingly, by combing single-molecule imaging and bulk cleavage assays, we found that XPG binding to the 7-subunit TFIIH core (coreTFIIH) stimulates coreTFIIH-dependent double-strand (ds)DNA unwinding 10-fold, and XPG-dependent DNA cleavage by up to 700-fold. Simultaneous monitoring of rates for coreTFIIH single-stranded (ss)DNA translocation and dsDNA unwinding showed XPG acts by switching ssDNA translocation to dsDNA unwinding as a likely committed step. Pertinent to the NER pathway regulation, XPG incision activity is suppressed during coreTFIIH translocation on DNA but is licensed when coreTFIIH stalls at the lesion or when ATP hydrolysis is blocked.

This approach uses two classes of magnetic particles that are labelled to selectively hybridize with different regions of the target mRNA. Hybridization leads to the formation of large magnetic clusters that remain localized within the cells of interest, thereby enabling the cells to be magnetically separated. Targeting specific intracellular mRNAs enablescirculating tumour cells to be distinguished\u00a0from normal haematopoietic cells.

The levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factors 1 (eIF1) and 5 (eIF5) play critical roles in controlling the stringency of translation start site selection. The basic leucine zipper and W2 domain-containing proteins 1 and 2 (BZW1 and BZW2), also known as eIF5-mimic proteins, are paralogous human proteins containing C-terminal HEAT domains that resemble the HEAT domain of eIF5. We show that translation of mRNAs encoding BZW1 and BZW2 homologs in fungi, plants and metazoans is initiated by AUG codons in conserved unfavorable initiation contexts. This conservation is reminiscent of the conserved unfavorable initiation context that enables autoregulation of EIF1. We show that overexpression of BZW1 and BZW2 proteins enhances the stringency of start site selection, and that their poor initiation codons confer autoregulation on BZW1 and BZW2 mRNA translation. We also show that overexpression of these two proteins significantly diminishes the effect of overexpressing eIF5 on stringency of start codon selection, suggesting they antagonize this function of eIF5.

Previously, our analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons predicted stop codon readthrough of several mammalian genes, all of which have been validated experimentally. Four mRNAs display highly efficient stop codon readthrough, and these mRNAs have a UGA stop codon immediately followed by CUAG (UGA_CUAG) that is conserved throughout vertebrates. Extending on the identification of this readthrough motif, we here investigated stop codon readthrough, using tissue culture reporter assays, for all previously untested human genes containing UGA_CUAG. The readthrough efficiency of the annotated stop codon for the sequence encoding vitamin D receptor (VDR) was 6.7%. It was the highest of those tested but all showed notable levels of readthrough. The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors, and it binds its major ligand, calcitriol, via its C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Readthrough of the annotated VDR mRNA results in a 67 amino acid-long C-terminal extension that generates a VDR proteoform named VDRx.

The cpc-1 mRNA contains two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its >700-nucleotide\u00a0(nt) 5' leader, and its expression is controlled at the level of translation in response to amino acid starvation. We used N.\u00a0crassa cell extracts and obtained data indicating that cpc-1 uORF1 and uORF2 are functionally analogous to GCN4 uORF1 and uORF4, respectively, in controlling translation. We also found that the 5' region upstream of the main coding sequence of the cpc-1 mRNA extends for more than 700 nucleotides without any in-frame stop codon. For 100 cpc-1 homologs from Pezizomycotina and from selected Basidiomycota, 5' conserved extensions of the CPC1 reading frame are also observed. Multiple non-AUG near-cognate codons (NCCs) in the CPC1 reading frame upstream of uORF2, some deeply conserved, could potentially initiate translation. At least four NCCs initiated translation in vitroIn vivo data were consistent with initiation at NCCs to produce N-terminally extended N.\u00a0crassa CPC1 isoforms. The pivotal role played by CPC1, combined with its translational regulation by uORFs and NCC utilization, underscores the emerging significance of noncanonical initiation events in controlling gene expression.IMPORTANCE There is a deepening and widening appreciation of the diverse roles of translation in controlling gene expression. A central fungal transcription factor, the best-studied example of which is Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN4, is crucial for the response to amino acid limitation. Two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the GCN4 mRNA are critical for controlling GCN4 synthesis. We observed that two uORFs in the corresponding Neurospora crassa cpc-1 mRNA appear functionally analogous to the GCN4 uORFs. We also discovered that, surprisingly, unlike GCN4, the CPC1 coding sequence extends far upstream from the presumed AUG start codon with no other in-frame AUG codons. Similar extensions were seen in homologs from many filamentous fungi. We observed that multiple non-AUG near-cognate codons (NCCs) in this extended reading frame, some conserved, initiated translation to produce longer forms of CPC1, underscoring the significance of noncanonical initiation in controlling gene expression.", "Keywords": ["Neurospora", "filamentous fungi", "gene regulation", "molecular genetics", "translational control"], "MeSH terms": ["Ascomycota", "Basidiomycota", "Codon", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Gene Fusion", "Neurospora crassa", "Open Reading Frames", "Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ivaylo P", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Jiajie", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen Z", "Last Name": "Caster", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristina M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA."}, {"First Name": "Audrey M", "Last Name": "Michel", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew E", "Last Name": "Firth", "Affiliation": "Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Freitag", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jay C", "Last Name": "Dunlap", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Systems Biology, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Bell-Pedersen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Atkins", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Matthew S", "Last Name": "Sachs", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA msachs@bio.tamu.edu."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2017Jun27"}, {"PMID": "28649316", "Title": "Discovery of Decamidine as a New and Potent PRMT1 Inhibitor.", "Abstract": "Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is a key player for the dynamic regulation of arginine methylation.

Here we report the electrochemical detection of mutated ctDNA in samples collected from cancer patients. By developing a strategy relying on the use of DNA clutch probes (DCPs) that render specific sequences of ctDNA accessible, we were able to readout the presence of mutated ctDNA. DCPs prevent reassociation of denatured DNA strands: they make one of the two strands of a dsDNA accessible for hybridization to a probe, and they also deactivate other closely related sequences in solution. DCPs ensure thereby that only mutated sequences associate with chip-based sensors detecting hybridization events. The assay exhibits excellent sensitivity and specificity in the detection of mutated ctDNA: it detects 1 fg/\u03bcL of a target mutation in the presence of 100 pg/\u03bcL of wild-type DNA, corresponding to detecting mutations at a level of 0.01% relative to wild type.

The polymerase and exonuclease reactions are performed alternately and are spatially separated in different protein domains. Thus, the growing DNA primer terminus has to undergo dynamic conformational switching between two distinct functional sites on the polymerase. Furthermore, the transition from polymerization (pol) mode to exonuclease (exo) mode must occur in the context of a DNA Pol holoenzyme, wherein the polymerase is physically associated with processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and primer-template DNA. The mechanism of this conformational switching and the role that PCNA plays in it have remained obscure, largely due to the dynamic nature of ternary Pol/PCNA/DNA assemblies. Here, we present computational models of ternary assemblies for archaeal polymerase PolB. We have combined all available structural information for the binary complexes with electron microscopy data and have refined atomistic models for ternary PolB/PCNA/DNA assemblies in pol and exo modes using molecular dynamics simulations. In addition to the canonical PIP-box/interdomain connector loop (IDCL) interface of PolB with PCNA, contact analysis of the simulation trajectories revealed new secondary binding interfaces, distinct between the pol and exo states. Using targeted molecular dynamics, we explored the conformational transition from pol to exo mode. We identified a hinge region between the thumb and palm domains of PolB that is critical for conformational switching. With the thumb domain anchored onto the PCNA surface, the neighboring palm domain executed rotational motion around the hinge, bringing the core of PolB down toward PCNA to form a new interface with the clamp. A helix from PolB containing a patch of arginine residues was involved in the binding, locking the complex in the exo mode conformation. Together, these results provide a structural view of how the transition between the pol and exo states of PolB is coordinated through PCNA to achieve efficient proofreading.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Archaeal Proteins", "DNA", "DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase", "Holoenzymes", "Microscopy, Electron", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Domains", "Pyrococcus abyssi", "Rotation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaojun", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University , Atlanta, Georgia 30302, United States."}, {"First Name": "Chunli", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University , Atlanta, Georgia 30302, United States."}, {"First Name": "Bradley R", "Last Name": "Kossmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University , Atlanta, Georgia 30302, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University , Atlanta, Georgia 30302, United States."}], "Journal": "The journal of physical chemistry.

To understand how paralogous transcription factors evolve divergent DNA specificities, we examined how the glucocorticoid receptor and its paralogs evolved to bind activating response elements [(+)GREs] and negative glucocorticoid response elements (nGREs). We show that binding to nGREs is a property of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA-binding domain (DBD) not shared by other members of the steroid receptor family. Using phylogenetic, structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics techniques, we show that the ancestral DBD from which GR and its paralogs evolved was capable of binding both nGRE and (+)GRE sequences because of the ancestral DBD's ability to assume multiple DNA-bound conformations. Subsequent amino acid substitutions in duplicated daughter genes selectively restricted protein conformational space, causing this dual DNA-binding specificity to be selectively enhanced in the GR lineage and lost in all others. Key substitutions that determined the receptors' response element-binding specificity were far from the proteins' DNA-binding interface and interacted epistatically to change the DBD's function through DNA-induced allosteric mechanisms. These amino acid substitutions subdivided both the conformational and functional space of the ancestral DBD among the present-day receptors, allowing a paralogous family of transcription factors to control disparate transcriptional programs despite high sequence identity.", "Keywords": ["epistasis", "evolution", "glucocorticoid", "steroid receptors"], "MeSH terms": ["Allosteric Regulation", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Base Sequence", "DNA", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Receptors, Glucocorticoid", "Receptors, Mineralocorticoid", "Response Elements", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Substrate Specificity", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William H", "Last Name": "Hudson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322;"}, {"First Name": "Bradley R", "Last Name": "Kossmann", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302;"}, {"First Name": "Ian Mitchelle S", "Last Name": "de Vera", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute, Scripps Florida, Jupiter, FL 33458;"}, {"First Name": "Shih-Wei", "Last Name": "Chuo", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302;"}, {"First Name": "Emily R", "Last Name": "Weikum", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322;"}, {"First Name": "Geeta N", "Last Name": "Eick", "Affiliation": "Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403;"}, {"First Name": "Joseph W", "Last Name": "Thornton", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637."}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo N", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302;"}, {"First Name": "Douglas J", "Last Name": "Kojetin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute, Scripps Florida, Jupiter, FL 33458;"}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Ortlund", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322; eric.ortlund@emory.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2016Jan12"}, {"PMID": "26557958", "Title": "Integrative Modeling of Macromolecular Assemblies from Low to Near-Atomic Resolution.", "Abstract": "While conventional high-resolution techniques in structural biology are challenged by the size and flexibility of many biological assemblies, recent advances in low-resolution techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have opened up new avenues to define the structures of such assemblies.

LRH-1 plays an important role in controlling lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and is a potential target for the treatment of metabolic and neoplastic diseases. Although the prospect of modulating LRH-1 via small molecules is exciting, the molecular mechanism linking PL structure to transcriptional co-regulator preference is unknown. Previous studies showed that binding to an activating PL ligand, such as dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, favors LRH-1's interaction with transcriptional co-activators to up-regulate gene expression. Both crystallographic and solution-based structural studies showed that dilauroylphosphatidylcholine binding drives unanticipated structural fluctuations outside of the canonical activation surface in an alternate activation function (AF) region, encompassing the \u03b2-sheet-H6 region of the protein. However, the mechanism by which dynamics in the alternate AF influences co-regulator selectivity remains elusive. Here, we pair x-ray crystallography with molecular modeling to identify an unexpected allosteric network that traverses the protein ligand binding pocket and links these two elements to dictate selectivity. We show that communication between the alternate AF region and classical AF2 is correlated with the strength of the co-regulator interaction.

CTCs are captured with 97% efficiency from 2 mL of whole blood, yielding a 500-fold concentration within 1 h. We show efficient capture of as few as 2 cancer cells/(mL of blood) and demonstrate that the gene expression module accurately profiles the expression of prostate-specific genes in CTCs captured from whole blood. This advance provides the first sample-to-answer solution for gene-based testing of CTCs. The approach was successfully validated using samples collected from prostate cancer patients: both CTCs and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA sequences were detected in all cancer patient samples and not in the healthy controls.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biosensing Techniques", "Electrochemical Techniques", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Magnetite Nanoparticles", "Male", "Microelectrodes", "Neoplastic Cells, Circulating", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "RNA, Messenger", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "U937 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Reza M", "Last Name": "Mohamadi", "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, \u2021Division of Urology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, \u00a7Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, \u2225Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and \u22a5Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3M2."}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, \u2021Division of Urology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, \u00a7Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, \u2225Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and \u22a5Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3M2."}, {"First Name": "Jessica", "Last Name": "Stojcic", "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, \u2021Division of Urology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, \u00a7Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, \u2225Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and \u22a5Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3M2."}, {"First Name": "Robert K", "Last Name": "Nam", "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, \u2021Division of Urology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, \u00a7Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, \u2225Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and \u22a5Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3M2."}, {"First Name": "Edward H", "Last Name": "Sargent", "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, \u2021Division of Urology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, \u00a7Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, \u2225Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and \u22a5Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3M2."}, {"First Name": "Shana O", "Last Name": "Kelley", "Affiliation": "\u2020Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, \u2021Division of Urology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, \u00a7Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, \u2225Institute for Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and \u22a5Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3M2."}], "Journal": "Analytical chemistry", "PubDate": "2015Jun16"}, {"PMID": "26004442", "Title": "Functional dynamics in replication protein A DNA binding and protein recruitment domains.", "Abstract": "Replication Protein A (RPA) is an essential scaffold for many DNA processing machines; its function relies on its modular architecture.

The power of VDJ recombination and N nucleotide addition has led to the common conception that the sequence of CDR-H3 is unrestricted in its variability and random in its composition. Under this view, the immune response is solely controlled by somatic positive and negative clonal selection mechanisms that act on individual B cells to promote production of protective antibodies and prevent the production of self-reactive antibodies. This concept of a repertoire of random antigen binding sites is inconsistent with the observation that diversity (DH) gene segment sequence content by reading frame (RF) is evolutionarily conserved, creating biases in the prevalence and distribution of individual amino acids in CDR-H3. For example, arginine, which is often found in the CDR-H3 of dsDNA binding autoantibodies, is under-represented in the commonly used DH RFs rearranged by deletion, but is a frequent component of rarely used inverted RF1 (iRF1), which is rearranged by inversion. To determine the effect of altering this germline bias in DH gene segment sequence on autoantibody production, we generated mice that by genetic manipulation are forced to utilize an iRF1 sequence encoding two arginines. Over a one year period we collected serial serum samples from these unimmunized, specific pathogen-free mice and found that more than one-fifth of them contained elevated levels of dsDNA-binding IgG, but not IgM; whereas mice with a wild type DH sequence did not. Thus, germline bias against the use of arginine enriched DH sequence helps to reduce the likelihood of producing self-reactive antibodies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibody Diversity", "Autoantibodies", "B-Lymphocytes", "Biological Evolution", "Complementarity Determining Regions", "Conserved Sequence", "DNA", "Genes, Immunoglobulin", "Immunoglobulin G", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Reading Frames", "V(D)J Recombination"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aaron", "Last Name": "Silva-Sanchez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Cun Ren", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Andre M", "Last Name": "Vale", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America; Program in Immunobiology, Carlos Chagas Filho Institute of Biophysics, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Mohamed", "Last Name": "Khass", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America; Genetic Engineering Division, National Research Center of Egypt, Ad Doqi, Egypt."}, {"First Name": "Pratibha", "Last Name": "Kapoor", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ada", "Last Name": "Elgavish", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo I", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gregory C", "Last Name": "Ippolito", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Robert L", "Last Name": "Schelonka", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Trenton R", "Last Name": "Schoeb", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Burrows", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America; Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Harry W", "Last Name": "Schroeder", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America; Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America; Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "25377874", "Title": "Nanoparticle-mediated binning and profiling of heterogeneous circulating tumor cell subpopulations.", "Abstract": "The analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is an important capability that may lead to new approaches for cancer management.

Until recent discoveries in Drosophila, only a very limited number of readthrough cases in chromosomal genes had been reported. Analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons identified potential stop codon readthrough of four mammalian genes. Here we use a modified targeted bioinformatic approach to identify a further three mammalian readthrough candidates. All seven genes were tested experimentally using reporter constructs transfected into HEK-293T cells. Four displayed efficient stop codon readthrough, and these have UGA immediately followed by CUAG. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that in the four readthrough candidates containing UGA-CUAG, this motif is conserved not only in mammals but throughout vertebrates with the first six of the seven nucleotides being universally conserved. The importance of the CUAG motif was confirmed using a systematic mutagenesis approach. One gene, OPRL1, encoding an opiate receptor, displayed extremely efficient levels of readthrough (\u223c31%) in HEK-293T cells. Signals both 5' and 3' of the OPRL1 stop codon contribute to this high level of readthrough.

Here, we show that the transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) channel and the inhibitor of MyoD family, I-mfa, function antagonistically in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. I-mfa null mice have an osteopenic phenotype characterized by increased osteoclast numbers and surface, which are normalized in mice lacking both Trpc1 and I-mfa. In vitro differentiation of pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa-deficient mice leads to an increased number of mature osteoclasts and higher bone resorption per osteoclast. These parameters return to normal levels in osteoclasts derived from double mutant mice. Consistently, whole cell currents activated in response to the depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores are larger in pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa knock-out mice compared with currents in wild type mice and normalized in cells derived from double mutant mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of I-mfa on TRPC1 in these cells. A new splice variant of TRPC1 (TRPC1\u03b5) was identified in early pre-osteoclasts.

Human APE1 and bacterial Nfo represent the two conserved 5' AP endonuclease families in the biosphere; they both recognize AP sites and incise the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the lesion, yet they lack similar structures and metal ion requirements. Here, we determined and analyzed crystal structures of a 2.4 \u00c5 resolution APE1-DNA product complex with Mg(2+) and a 0.92 \u00c5 Nfo with three metal ions. Structural and biochemical comparisons of these two evolutionarily distinct enzymes characterize key APE1 catalytic residues that are potentially functionally similar to Nfo active site components, as further tested and supported by computational analyses. We observe a magnesium-water cluster in the APE1 active site, with only Glu-96 forming the direct protein coordination to the Mg(2+). Despite differences in structure and metal requirements of APE1 and Nfo, comparison of their active site structures surprisingly reveals strong geometric conservation of the catalytic reaction, with APE1 catalytic side chains positioned analogously to Nfo metal positions, suggesting surprising functional equivalence between Nfo metal ions and APE1 residues. The finding that APE1 residues are positioned to substitute for Nfo metal ions is supported by the impact of mutations on activity. Collectively, the results illuminate the activities of residues, metal ions, and active site features for abasic site endonucleases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Bacterial Proteins", "Catalytic Domain", "Conserved Sequence", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "DNA", "DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase", "Deoxyribonuclease IV (Phage T4-Induced)", "Escherichia coli", "Humans", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Structural Homology, Protein", "Thermotoga maritima"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Susan E", "Last Name": "Tsutakawa", "Affiliation": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037."}, {"First Name": "Clifford D", "Last Name": "Mol", "Affiliation": "Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037."}, {"First Name": "Tadahide", "Last Name": "Izumi", "Affiliation": "University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536; University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555."}, {"First Name": "Andrew S", "Last Name": "Arvai", "Affiliation": "Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Mantha", "Affiliation": "University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555."}, {"First Name": "Bartosz", "Last Name": "Szczesny", "Affiliation": "University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555."}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo N", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia 30302."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Hosfield", "Affiliation": "Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037."}, {"First Name": "Buddhadev", "Last Name": "Maiti", "Affiliation": "Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia 30302."}, {"First Name": "Mike E", "Last Name": "Pique", "Affiliation": "Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth A", "Last Name": "Frankel", "Affiliation": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720."}, {"First Name": "Kenichi", "Last Name": "Hitomi", "Affiliation": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720; Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037; Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-8531, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Cunningham", "Affiliation": "University of Albany, State University of New York, Albany, New York 12222."}, {"First Name": "Sankar", "Last Name": "Mitra", "Affiliation": "University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555."}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Tainer", "Affiliation": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720; Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.

The mechanisms involved in this commensal-host crosstalk are not well understood. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) not only create a physical barrier between the commensals and immune cells in host tissues, but also facilitate interactions between them. Perturbations of epithelial homeostasis or function lead to the development of intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and intestinal cancer. IECs receive signals from commensals and produce effector immune molecules. IECs also affect the function of immune cells in the lamina propria. Here we discuss some of these properties of IECs that define them as innate immune cells. We focus on how IECs may integrate and transmit signals from individual commensal bacteria to mucosal innate and adaptive immune cells for the establishment of the unique mucosal immunological equilibrium.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bacteria", "Bacterial Physiological Phenomena", "Epithelial Cells", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Intestinal Neoplasms", "Intestines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yoshiyuki", "Last Name": "Goto", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo I", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Immunology and cell biology", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "23303776", "Title": "A new structural framework for integrating replication protein A into DNA processing machinery.", "Abstract": "By coupling the protection and organization of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with recruitment and alignment of DNA processing factors, replication protein A (RPA) lies at the heart of dynamic multi-protein DNA processing machinery. Nevertheless, how RPA coordinates biochemical functions of its eight domains remains unknown. We examined the structural biochemistry of RPA's DNA-binding activity, combining small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the architecture of RPA's DNA-binding core. The scattering data reveal compaction promoted by DNA binding; DNA-free RPA exists in an ensemble of states with inter-domain mobility and becomes progressively more condensed and less dynamic on binding ssDNA. Our results contrast with previous models proposing RPA initially binds ssDNA in a condensed state and becomes more extended as it fully engages the substrate. Moreover, the consensus view that RPA engages ssDNA in initial, intermediate and final stages conflicts with our data revealing that RPA undergoes two (not three) transitions as it binds ssDNA with no evidence for a discrete intermediate state. These results form a framework for understanding how RPA integrates the ssDNA substrate into DNA processing machinery, provides substrate access to its binding partners and promotes the progression and selection of DNA processing pathways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["DNA, Single-Stranded", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Neutron Diffraction", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Replication Protein A", "Scattering, Small Angle", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chris A", "Last Name": "Brosey", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Center for Structural Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunli", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Susan E", "Last Name": "Tsutakawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William T", "Last Name": "Heller", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert P", "Last Name": "Rambo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Tainer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivaylo", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Walter J", "Last Name": "Chazin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nucleic acids research", "PubDate": "2013Feb01"}, {"PMID": "23247167", "Title": "Enzyme cofactors: double-edged sword for catalysis.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Diphosphate", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "Catalysis", "Coenzymes", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2", "Enzyme Activation", "Humans", "Magnesium", "Models, Biological", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ivaylo", "Last Name": "Ivanov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature chemistry", "PubDate": "2013Jan"}, {"PMID": "23167816", "Title": "Chip-based nanostructured sensors enable accurate identification and classification of circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer patient blood samples.", "Abstract": "The identification and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is an important goal for the development of noninvasive cancer diagnosis.
