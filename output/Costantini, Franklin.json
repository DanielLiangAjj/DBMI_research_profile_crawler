To understand the pathogenesis of AKI and CKD in preterm humans, we generated potentially novel mouse models with a 30%-70% reduction in nephron number by inhibiting or deleting Ret tyrosine kinase in the developing ureteric bud. These mice developed glomerular and tubular hypertrophy, followed by the transition to CKD, recapitulating the renal pathological changes seen in humans born preterm. We injected neonatal mice with gentamicin, a ubiquitous nephrotoxic exposure in preterm infants, and detected more severe proximal tubular injury in mice with low nephron number compared with controls with normal nephron number. Mice with low nephron number had reduced proliferative repair with more rapid development of CKD. Furthermore, mice had more profound inflammation with highly elevated levels of MCP-1 and CXCL10, produced in part by damaged proximal tubules. Our study directly links low nephron endowment with postnatal renal hypertrophy, which in this model is maladaptive and results in CKD. Underdeveloped kidneys are more susceptible to gentamicin-induced AKI, suggesting that AKI in the setting of low nephron number is more severe and further increases the risk of CKD in this vulnerable population.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Nephrology"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Acute Kidney Injury", "Gentamicins", "Hypertrophy", "Infant, Premature", "Kidney", "Nephrons", "Premature Birth", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pamela I", "Last Name": "Good", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Holly A", "Last Name": "Hurst", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Ileana", "Last Name": "Serrano Herrera", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meenakshi", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Bateman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}, {"First Name": "Qais", "Last Name": "Al-Awqati", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivette D", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Costantini", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fangming", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2023Feb08"}, {"PMID": "33914865", "Title": "Ret signaling in ureteric bud epithelial cells controls cell movements, cell clustering and bud formation.", "Abstract": "Ret signaling promotes branching morphogenesis during kidney development, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear.

Ureteric bud growth and branching requires GDNF signaling from the surrounding mesenchyme to cells at the ureteric bud tips, via the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase and coreceptor Gfr\u03b11; Ret signaling up-regulates transcription factors Etv4 and Etv5, which are also critical for branching. Despite extensive knowledge of the genetic control of these events, it is not understood, at the cellular level, how renal branching morphogenesis is achieved or how Ret signaling influences epithelial cell behaviors to promote this process. Analysis of chimeric embryos previously suggested a role for Ret signaling in promoting cell rearrangements in the nephric duct, but this method was unsuited to study individual cell behaviors during ureteric bud branching. Here, we use Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM), combined with organ culture and time-lapse imaging, to trace the movements and divisions of individual ureteric bud tip cells. We first examine wild-type clones and then Ret or Etv4 mutant/wild-type clones in which the mutant and wild-type sister cells are differentially and heritably marked by green and red fluorescent proteins. We find that, in normal kidneys, most individual tip cells behave as self-renewing progenitors, some of whose progeny remain at the tips while others populate the growing UB trunks. In Ret or Etv4 MADM clones, the wild-type cells generated at a UB tip are much more likely to remain at, or move to, the new tips during branching and elongation, while their Ret-/- or Etv4-/- sister cells tend to lag behind and contribute only to the trunks. By tracking successive mitoses in a cell lineage, we find that Ret signaling has little effect on proliferation, in contrast to its effects on cell movement.

Simultaneous deletion of Etv4 and Etv5 (Etv4/5 double knock-out (dKO)) in ES cells resulted in a flat, epithelial cell-like appearance, whereas the morphology changed into compact colonies in a 2i medium (containing two inhibitors for GSK3 and MEK/ERK).

A differentiation assay revealed that the embryoid bodies derived from Etv4/5 dKO ES cells were smaller than the control, and expression of ectoderm marker genes, including Fgf5, Sox1, and Pax3, was not induced in dKO-derived embryoid bodies.

Duplex collecting systems rank among the most common abnormalities of CAKUT, but the molecular basis for this defect is poorly understood. In mice, conditional deletion of Wnt5a in mesoderm results in bilateral duplex kidney and ureter formation. The ureteric buds (UBs) in mutants emerge as doublets from the intermediate mesoderm (IM)-derived nephric duct (ND) without anterior expansion of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) expression domain in the surrounding mesenchyme. Wnt5a is normally expressed in a graded manner at the posterior end of the IM, but its expression is down-regulated prior to UB outgrowth at E10.5. Furthermore, ablation of Wnt5a in the mesoderm with an inducible Cre at E7.5 results in duplex UBs, whereas ablation at E8.5 yields normal UB outgrowth, demonstrating that Wnt5a functions in IM development well before the formation of the metanephros. In mutants, the posterior ND is duplicated and surrounding Pax2-positive mesenchymal cells persist in the nephric cord, suggesting that disruption of normal ND patterning prompts the formation of duplex ureters and kidneys. Ror2 homozygous mutants, which infrequently yield duplex collecting systems, show a dramatic increase in incidence with the additional deletion of one copy of Wnt5a, implicating this receptor in non-canonical Wnt5a signaling during IM development.

This technique involves (1) culture of the metanephric kidney at embryonic day 12 (mouse) or 14 (rat), (2) whole-mount immunofluorescence to selectively stain ureteric tree epithelium, (3) confocal microscopy to obtain a complete Z series through the ureteric tree, and (4) image analysis algorithms to binarize, skeletonize, and measure individual branch lengths in 3D. This method has been extended to analysis of the same ureteric tree over time (4D). The results obtained provide accurate and precise quantitation of ureteric tree growth in the developing mouse or rat kidney.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Epithelium", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Kidney", "Mice", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Morphogenesis", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Rats", "Ureter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luise A", "Last Name": "Cullen-McEwen", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gabriel", "Last Name": "Fricout", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dominique", "Last Name": "Jeulin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ian S", "Last Name": "Harper", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Frank", "Last Name": "Costantini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John F", "Last Name": "Bertram", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "PubDate": "2014"}]
