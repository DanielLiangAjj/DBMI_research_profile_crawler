The medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are key thalamic nuclei involved in the processing and relay of auditory and visual information, respectively, and are the subject of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI studies of neural activation and functional connectivity in human participants. However, localization of BOLD fMRI signal originating from neural activity in MGN and LGN remains a technical challenge, due in part to the poor definition of boundaries of these thalamic nuclei in standard T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Here, we report the development and evaluation of an auditory and visual sensory thalamic localizer (TL) fMRI task that produces participant-specific functionally-defined regions of interest (fROIs) of both MGN and LGN, using 3 Tesla multiband fMRI and a clustered-sparse temporal acquisition sequence, in less than 16 minutes of scan time. We demonstrate the use of MGN and LGN fROIs obtained from the TL fMRI task in standard resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) fMRI analyses in the same participants. In RSFC analyses, we validated the specificity of MGN and LGN fROIs for signals obtained from primary auditory and visual cortex, respectively, and benchmark their performance against alternative atlas- and segmentation-based localization methods. The TL fMRI task and analysis code (written in Presentation and MATLAB, respectively) have been made freely available to the wider research community.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip N", "Last Name": "Tubiolo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zu Jie", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eilon B", "Last Name": "Silver-Frankel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dathy T", "Last Name": "Pham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Natalka K", "Last Name": "Haubold", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sameera K", "Last Name": "Abeykoon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anissa", "Last Name": "Abi-Dargham", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jared X", "Last Name": "Van Snellenberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Apr30"}, {"PMID": "38658167", "Title": "Altered Hierarchical Gradients of Intrinsic Neural Timescales in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of seniors in the United States. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study neurophysiology in AD and its prodromal condition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which can be estimated through the magnitude of the autocorrelation of neural signals from rs-fMRI, is thought to quantify the duration that neural information is stored in a local circuit. Such heterogeneity of the timescales forms a basis of the brain functional hierarchy and captures an aspect of circuit dynamics relevant to excitation/inhibition balance, which is broadly relevant for cognitive functions. Given that, we applied rs-fMRI to test whether distinct changes of INT at different hierarchies are present in people with MCI, those progressing to AD (called Converter), and AD patients of both sexes. Linear mixed-effect model was implemented to detect altered hierarchical gradients across populations followed by pairwise comparisons to identify regional differences. High similarities between AD and Converter were observed. Specifically, the inferior temporal, caudate, and pallidum areas exhibit significant alterations in both AD and Converter. Distinct INT-related pathological changes in MCI and AD were found. For AD/Converter, neural information is stored for a longer time in lower hierarchical areas, while higher levels of hierarchy seem to be preferentially impaired in MCI leading to a less pronounced hierarchical gradient. These results inform that the INT holds great potential as an additional measure for AD prediction, even a stable biomarker for clinical diagnosis.", "Keywords": ["AD", "INT", "MCI", "rs-fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Alzheimer Disease", "Male", "Female", "Aged", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Brain", "Aged, 80 and over", "Middle Aged", "Disease Progression", "Brain Mapping"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aiying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Wengler", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Terry E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Seonjoo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032 seonjoo.lee@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "For Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2024Jun19"}, {"PMID": "38548878", "Title": "Retraction Note: Association between neuromelanin-sensitive MRI signal and psychomotor slowing in late-life depression.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Wengler", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brandon K", "Last Name": "Ashinoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Pueraro", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clifford M", "Last Name": "Cassidy", "Affiliation": "The University of Ottawa's Institute of Mental Health Research, affiliated with the Royal, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

Here, we attempt to replicate its diagnostic capabilities measured by the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristic curves discriminating individuals with psychosis (n\u2009=\u2009101) from healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200951) in the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis.

Finally, we tested the prognostic capability of the FSA by the correlation between baseline scores and symptom improvement over 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in a separate cohort (n\u2009=\u200997).

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has become a widely used neuroimaging tool to study neurophysiology in AD and its prodromal condition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which can be estimated through the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals using rs-fMRI, is thought to quantify the duration that neural information is stored in a local cortical circuit. The heterogeneity of the timescales is considered to be a basis of the functional hierarchy in the brain. In addition, INT captures an aspect of circuit dynamics relevant to excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, which is thought to be broadly relevant for cognitive functions. Here we examined its relevance to AD. We used rs-fMRI data of 904 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The subjects were divided into 4 groups based on their baseline and end-visit clinical status, which were cognitively normal (CN), stable MCI, Converter, and AD groups. Linear mixed effect model and pairwise comparison were implemented to investigate the large-scale hierarchical organization and local differences. We observed high similarities between AD and Converter groups. Specifically, among the eight identified ROIs with distinct INT alterations in AD, three ROIs (inferior temporal, caudate, pallidum areas) exhibit stable and significant alteration in AD converter. In addition, distinct INT related pathological changes in stable MCI and AD/Converter were found. For AD and Converter groups, neural information is stored for a longer time in lower hierarchical order areas, while higher levels of hierarchy seem to be preferentially impaired in stable MCI leading to a less pronounced hierarchical gradient effect. These results inform that the INT holds great potential as an additional measure for AD prediction, a stable biomarker for clinical diagnosis and an important therapeutic target in AD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aiying", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Wengler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Terry E", "Last Name": "Goldberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seonjoo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Sep27"}, {"PMID": "37622401", "Title": "Hallucination-Proneness is Associated With a Decrease in Robust Averaging of Perceptual Evidence.", "Abstract": "Hallucinations are characterized by disturbances in perceptual decision-making about environmental stimuli.

In turn, prominent models of perceptual disturbances in psychosis frame hallucination-like phenomena as percepts excessively biased toward perceptual prior expectations. Despite mounting support for this notion, whether this hallucination-related prior bias results secondarily from imprecise sensory representations at early processing stages or directly from alterations in perceptual priors-both suggested candidates potentially consistent with Bayesian models-remains to be tested. Using modified interval timing paradigms designed to arbitrate between these alternative hypotheses, we show in human participants (16 females and 24 males) from a nonclinical population that hallucination proneness correlates with a circumscribed form of prior bias that reflects selective differences in weighting of contextual prior variance, a prior bias that is unrelated to the effect of sensory noise and to a separate index of sensory resolution. Our results thus suggest distinct mechanisms underlying prior biases in perceptual inference and favor the notion that hallucination proneness could reflect direct alterations in the representation or use of perceptual priors independent of sensory noise.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Current theories of psychosis posit that hallucination proneness results from excessive influence of prior expectations on perception. It is not clear whether this prior bias represents a primary top-down process related to the representation or use of prior beliefs or instead a secondary bottom-up process stemming from imprecise sensory representations at early processing stages. To address this question, we examined interval timing behaviors captured by Bayesian perceptual-inference models. Our data support the notion that excessive influence of prior expectations associated with hallucination propensity is not directly secondary to sensory imprecision and is instead more consistent with a primary top-down process. These results help refine computational theories of psychosis and may contribute to the development of improved intervention targets.", "Keywords": ["hallucinations", "interval timing", "perceptual inference", "prior beliefs", "psychosis", "sensory resolution"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Female", "Humans", "Bayes Theorem", "Hallucinations", "Psychotic Disorders", "Illusions", "Bias"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emeline", "Last Name": "Duhamel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Andra", "Last Name": "Mihali", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York 10032 HorgaG@nyspi.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023Jul19"}, {"PMID": "37198261", "Title": "Probing midbrain dopamine function in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder via neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an impairing psychiatric condition, which often onsets in childhood. Growing research highlights dopaminergic alterations in adult OCD, yet pediatric studies are limited by methodological constraints. This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N\u2009=\u2009135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n\u2009=\u200964 had an OCD diagnosis. N\u2009=\u200947 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.51) and ventral tegmental area (p\u2009=\u20090.006, d\u2009=\u20090.50). Follow-up analyses indicated that more severe lifetime symptoms (t\u2009=\u2009-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and longer illness duration (t\u2009=\u2009-2.22, p\u2009=\u20090.03) related to lower neuromelanin-MRI signal. Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.001, d\u2009=\u20091.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms. Future studies should explore the utility of neuromelanin-MRI biomarkers to identify early risk prior to onset, parse OCD subtypes or symptom heterogeneity, and explore prediction of pharmacotherapy response.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Adolescent", "Humans", "Child", "Dopamine", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Ventral Tegmental Area"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Pagliaccio", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. david.pagliaccio@nyspi.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Wengler", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Durham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martine", "Last Name": "Fontaine", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Meryl", "Last Name": "Rueppel", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Becker", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Bilek", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Pieper", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Caroline", "Last Name": "Risdon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kate D", "Last Name": "Fitzgerald", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Marsh", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2023Jul"}, {"PMID": "37159365", "Title": "Candidate biomarkers in psychiatric disorders: state of the field.", "Abstract": "The field of psychiatry is hampered by a lack of robust, reliable and valid biomarkers that can aid in objectively diagnosing patients and providing individualized treatment recommendations. Here we review and critically evaluate the evidence for the most promising biomarkers in the psychiatric neuroscience literature for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression and bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Candidate biomarkers reviewed include various neuroimaging, genetic, molecular and peripheral assays, for the purposes of determining susceptibility or presence of illness, and predicting treatment response or safety. This review highlights a critical gap in the biomarker validation process. An enormous societal investment over the past 50 years has identified numerous candidate biomarkers. However, to date, the overwhelming majority of these measures have not been proven sufficiently reliable, valid and useful to be adopted clinically. It is time to consider whether strategic investments might break this impasse, focusing on a limited number of promising candidates to advance through a process of definitive testing for a specific indication. Some promising candidates for definitive testing include the N170 signal, an event-related brain potential measured using electroencephalography, for subgroup identification within autism spectrum disorder; striatal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, such as the striatal connectivity index (SCI) and the functional striatal abnormalities (FSA) index, for prediction of treatment response in schizophrenia; error-related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index, for prediction of first onset of generalized anxiety disorder, and resting-state and structural brain connectomic measures for prediction of treatment response in social anxiety disorder. Alternate forms of classification may be useful for conceptualizing and testing potential biomarkers. Collaborative efforts allowing the inclusion of biosystems beyond genetics and neuroimaging are needed, and online remote acquisition of selected measures in a naturalistic setting using mobile health tools may significantly advance the field. Setting specific benchmarks for well-defined target application, along with development of appropriate funding and partnership mechanisms, would also be crucial.

A Bayesian formalization of base-rate neglect in the context of sequential belief updating predicts that belief trajectories should exhibit dynamic patterns of dependence on the order in which evidence is presented and its consistency with prior beliefs. To test this, we developed a novel 'urn-and-beads' task that systematically manipulated the order of colored bead sequences and elicited beliefs via an incentive-compatible procedure. Our results in two independent online studies confirmed the predictions of the sequential base-rate neglect model: people exhibited beliefs that are more influenced by recent evidence and by evidence inconsistent with prior beliefs. We further found support for a noisy-sampling inference model whereby base-rate neglect results from rational discounting of noisy internal representations of prior beliefs. Finally, we found that model-derived indices of base-rate neglect-including noisier prior representation-correlated with propensity for unusual beliefs outside the laboratory.

Individuals with late-life depression often show impairment across these domains, all of which are moderated by the functioning of dopaminergic circuits. As dopaminergic function declines with normal aging and increased inflammatory burden, the role of dopamine may be particularly salient for late-life depression. We review the literature examining the role of dopamine in the pathogenesis of depression, as well as how dopamine function changes with aging and is influenced by inflammation. Applying a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Initiative perspective, we then review work examining how dopaminergic signaling affects these domains, specifically focusing on Cognitive, Positive Valence, and Sensorimotor Systems. We propose a unified model incorporating the effects of aging and low-grade inflammation on dopaminergic functioning, with a resulting negative effect on cognition, reward processing, and motor function. Interplay between these systems may influence development of a depressive phenotype, with an initial deficit in one domain reinforcing decline in others.

First, we assess and evaluate the experimental paradigms most often used to study inferential alterations in delusions. Based on our review of the literature and theoretical considerations, we contend that classic draws-to-decision paradigms are not well-suited to isolate inferential processes, further arguing that the commonly cited 'jumping-to-conclusion' bias may reflect neither delusion-specific nor inferential alterations. Second, we discuss several enhancements to standard paradigms that show promise in more effectively isolating inferential processes and delusion-related alterations therein. We further draw on our recent work to build an argument for a specific failure mode for delusions consisting of prior overweighting in high-level causal inferences about partially observable hidden states.

Two metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonists (pomaglumetad [POMA] and TS-134) were assessed in two Phase Ib proof of mechanism studies of comparable designs and using identical clinical assessments and pharmacoBOLD methodology. POMA was examined in a randomized controlled trial under double-blind conditions for 10-days at doses of 80 or 320\u2009mg/d POMA versus placebo (1:1:1 ratio). The TS-134 trial was a randomized, single-blind, 6-day study of 20 or 60\u2009mg/d TS-134 versus placebo (5:5:2 ratio). Primary outcomes were ketamine-induced changes in pharmacoBOLD in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and symptoms reflected on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Both trials were conducted contemporaneously. 95 healthy volunteers were randomized to POMA and 63 to TS-134. High-dose POMA significantly reduced ketamine-induced BPRS total symptoms within and between-groups (p\u2009<\u20090.01, d\u2009=\u2009-0.41; p\u2009=\u20090.04, d\u2009=\u2009-0.44, respectively), but neither POMA dose significantly suppressed ketamine-induced dACC pharmacoBOLD. In contrast, low-dose TS-134 led to moderate to large within and between group reductions in both BPRS positive symptoms (p\u2009=\u20090.02, d\u2009=\u2009-0.36; p\u2009=\u20090.008, d\u2009=\u2009-0.82, respectively) and dACC pharmacoBOLD (p\u2009=\u20090.004, d\u2009=\u2009-0.56; p\u2009=\u20090.079, d\u2009=\u2009-0.50, respectively) using pooled across-study placebo data. High-dose POMA exerted significant effects on clinical symptoms, but not on target engagement, suggesting a higher dose may yet be needed, while the low dose of TS-134 showed evidence of symptom reduction and target engagement.

NM-MRI has been validated as a measure of both dopamine neuron loss, with applications in neurodegenerative disease, and dopamine function, with applications in psychiatric disease. Furthermore, a voxelwise-analysis approach has been validated to resolve substructures, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), within midbrain dopaminergic nuclei thought to have distinct anatomical targets and functional roles. NM-MRI is thus a promising tool that could have diverse research and clinical applications to noninvasively interrogate in vivo the dopamine system in neuropsychiatric illness. Although a test-retest reliability study by Langley et\u00a0al. using the standard NM-MRI protocol recently reported high reliability, a systematic and comprehensive investigation of the performance of the method for various acquisition parameters and preprocessing methods has not been conducted. In particular, most previous studies used relatively thick MRI slices (~3\u00a0\u200bmm), compared to the typical in-plane resolution (~0.5\u00a0\u200bmm) and to the height of the SN (~15\u00a0\u200bmm), to overcome technical limitations such as specific absorption rate and signal-to-noise ratio, at the cost of partial-volume effects. Here, we evaluated the effect of various acquisition and preprocessing parameters on the strength and test-retest reliability of the NM-MRI signal to determine optimized protocols for both region-of-interest (including whole SN-VTA complex and atlas-defined dopaminergic nuclei) and voxelwise measures. Namely, we determined a combination of parameters that optimizes the strength and reliability of the NM-MRI signal, including acquisition time, slice-thickness, spatial-normalization software, and degree of spatial smoothing. Using a newly developed, detailed acquisition protocol, across two scans separated by 13 days on average, we obtained intra-class correlation values indicating excellent reliability and high contrast, which could be achieved with a different set of parameters depending on the measures of interest and experimental constraints such as acquisition time. Based on this, we provide detailed guidelines covering acquisition through analysis and recommendations for performing NM-MRI experiments with high quality and reproducibility.

Alterations in inferential processes have long been proposed to underlie delusional pathology, but previous attempts to show this have failed to yield compelling evidence for a specific relationship between inferential abnormalities and delusional severity in schizophrenia. Using a novel, incentivized information-sampling task (a modified version of the beads task), alongside well-characterized decision-making tasks, we sought a mechanistic understanding of delusions in a sample of medicated and unmedicated patients with schizophrenia who exhibited a wide range of delusion severity. In this novel task, participants chose whether to draw beads from one of two hidden jars or to guess the identity of the hidden jar, in order to minimize financial loss from a monetary endowment, and concurrently reported their probability estimates for the hidden jar. We found that patients with higher delusion severity exhibited increased information seeking (i.e. increased draws-to-decision behaviour). This increase was highly specific to delusion severity as compared to the severity of other psychotic symptoms, working-memory capacity, and other clinical and socio-demographic characteristics. Delusion-related increases in information seeking were present in unmedicated patients, indicating that they were unlikely due to antipsychotic medication. In addition, after adjusting for delusion severity, patients as a whole exhibited decreased information seeking relative to healthy individuals, a decrease that correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Computational analyses of reported probability estimates further showed that more delusional patients exhibited abnormal belief updating characterized by stronger reliance on prior beliefs formed early in the inferential process, a feature that correlated with increased information seeking in patients. Other decision-making parameters that could have theoretically explained the delusion effects, such as those related to subjective valuation, were uncorrelated with both delusional severity and information seeking among the patients. In turn, we found some preliminary evidence that subjective valuation (rather than belief updating) may explain group differences in information seeking unrelated to delusions. Together, these results suggest that abnormalities in belief updating, characterized by stronger reliance on prior beliefs formed by incorporating information presented earlier in the inferential process, may be a core computational mechanism of delusional ideation in psychosis. Our results thus provide direct empirical support for an inferential mechanism that naturally captures the characteristic rigidity associated with delusional beliefs.", "Keywords": ["Bayesian inference", "belief updating", "computational psychiatry", "delusions", "schizophrenia"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Decision Making", "Delusions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Thinking"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seth C", "Last Name": "Baker", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna B", "Last Name": "Konova", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University Behavioral Health Care, and Brain Health Institute, Rutgers University - New Brunswick, 671 Hoes Lane West, Piscataway, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel D", "Last Name": "Daw", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, South Drive, Princeton, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2019Jun01"}, {"PMID": "30796187", "Title": "Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a noninvasive proxy measure of dopamine function in the human brain.", "Abstract": "Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) purports to detect the content of neuromelanin (NM), a product of dopamine metabolism that accumulates with age in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra (SN).

Here, we validated that NM-MRI signal intensity in postmortem midbrain specimens correlated with regional NM concentration even in the absence of neurodegeneration, a prerequisite for its use as a proxy for dopamine function. We then validated a voxelwise NM-MRI approach with sufficient anatomical sensitivity to resolve SN subregions. Using this approach and a multimodal dataset of molecular PET and fMRI data, we further showed the NM-MRI signal was related to both dopamine release in the dorsal striatum and resting blood flow within the SN. These results suggest that NM-MRI signal in the SN is a proxy for function of dopamine neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. As a proof of concept for its clinical utility, we show that the NM-MRI signal correlated to severity of psychosis in schizophrenia and individuals at risk for schizophrenia, consistent with the well-established dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway in psychosis.

Now that therapies to block this neuronal loss are under development, it is imperative that the disease be diagnosed at earlier stages and that the response to therapies is monitored. Recent studies suggest this can be accomplished by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection of neuromelanin (NM), the characteristic pigment of SN dopaminergic, and locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons. NM is an autophagic product synthesized via oxidation of catecholamines and subsequent reactions, and in the SN and LC it increases linearly during normal aging. In PD, however, the pigment is lost when SN and LC neurons die. As shown nearly 25 years ago by Zecca and colleagues, NM's avid binding of iron provides a paramagnetic source to enable electron and nuclear magnetic resonance detection, and thus a means for safe and noninvasive measure in living human brain. Recent technical improvements now provide a means for MRI to differentiate between PD patients and age-matched healthy controls, and should be able to identify changes in SN NM with age in individuals. We discuss how MRI detects NM and how this approach might be improved. We suggest that MRI of NM can be used to confirm PD diagnosis and monitor disease progression. We recommend that for subjects at risk for PD, and perhaps generally for older people, that MRI sequences performed at regular intervals can provide a pre-clinical means to detect presymptomatic PD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "1Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center , New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Clifford", "Last Name": "Cassidy", "Affiliation": "4The Royal's Institute of Mental Health Research, Affiliated with the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON Canada."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "1Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Center , New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Un Jung", "Last Name": "Kang", "Affiliation": "2Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Fahn", "Affiliation": "2Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY USA."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Casella", "Affiliation": "5Department of Chemistry, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Gianni", "Last Name": "Pezzoli", "Affiliation": "Parkinson Institute, ASST \"Gaetano Pini-CTO\", Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Langley", "Affiliation": "7Center for Advanced NeuroImaging, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoping P", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "8Department of Bioengineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, CA USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabio A", "Last Name": "Zucca", "Affiliation": "9Institute of Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council of Italy, Milan, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Ioannis U", "Last Name": "Isaias", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital and Julius-Maximillian-University, Wuerzburg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Luigi", "Last Name": "Zecca", "Affiliation": "9Institute of Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council of Italy, Milan, Italy."}], "Journal": "NPJ Parkinson's disease", "PubDate": "2018"}, {"PMID": "29398218", "Title": "A Perceptual Inference Mechanism for Hallucinations Linked to Striatal Dopamine.", "Abstract": "Hallucinations, a cardinal feature of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, are known to depend on excessive striatal dopamine. However, an underlying cognitive mechanism linking dopamine dysregulation and the experience of hallucinatory percepts remains elusive. Bayesian models explain perception as an optimal combination of prior expectations and new sensory evidence, where perceptual distortions such as illusions and hallucinations may occur if prior expectations are afforded excessive weight. Such excessive weight of prior expectations, in turn, could stem from a gain-control process controlled by neuromodulators such as dopamine. To test for such a dopamine-dependent gain-control mechanism of hallucinations, we studied unmedicated patients with schizophrenia with varying degrees of hallucination severity and healthy individuals using molecular imaging with a pharmacological manipulation of dopamine, structural imaging, and a novel task designed to measure illusory changes in the perceived duration of auditory stimuli under different levels of uncertainty. Hallucinations correlated with a perceptual bias, reflecting disproportional gain on expectations under uncertainty. This bias could be pharmacologically induced by amphetamine, strongly correlated with striatal dopamine release, and related to cortical volume of the dorsal anterior cingulate, a brain region involved in tracking environmental uncertainty. These findings outline a novel dopamine-dependent mechanism for perceptual modulation in physiological conditions and further suggest that this mechanism may confer vulnerability to hallucinations in hyper-dopaminergic states underlying psychosis.", "Keywords": ["Bayesian inference", "PET imaging", "amphetamine", "dopamine", "hallucinations", "illusion", "predictive coding", "psychosis", "schizophrenia", "sensory learning"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Bayes Theorem", "Brain", "Corpus Striatum", "Dopamine", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Hallucinations", "Humans", "Illusions", "Male", "Perception", "Perceptual Distortion", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Clifford M", "Last Name": "Cassidy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, USA; The Royal's Institute of Mental Health Research, University of Ottawa, 1145 Carling Avenue, Ottawa, ON K1Z 7K4, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Balsam", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Psychology, Columbia University, 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jodi J", "Last Name": "Weinstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook University, 100 Nicholls Road, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel J", "Last Name": "Rosengard", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Slifstein", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook University, 100 Nicholls Road, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel D", "Last Name": "Daw", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Princeton University, South Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anissa", "Last Name": "Abi-Dargham", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook University, 100 Nicholls Road, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guillermo", "Last Name": "Horga", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University Medical Center, 1051 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10032, USA.

We recruited 56 participants at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis based on the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) and 49 healthy controls. Twelve of the CHR participants eventually developed psychosis. We compared functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD signal during the performance of the Simon task. We tested for differences between CHR individuals and controls in conflict-related functional activity. In the CHR group when compared with controls, we detected smaller conflict-related activations in several cortical areas, including the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, conflict-related activations in the DLPFC of those CHR individuals who ultimately developed psychosis (CHR converters) were smaller than in non-converters (CHR non-converters). Higher levels of conflict-related activation were associated with better social and role outcome. Risk for psychosis was associated at the neural level with reduced conflict-related brain activity.
