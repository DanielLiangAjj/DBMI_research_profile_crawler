All stressors studied induce vacuolar fragmentation prior to \u00b5LP. Moreover, during \u00b5LP, fragmented vacuoles fuse to form cup-shaped structures that encapsulate and ultimately take up LDs. Our studies also indicate that proteins of the endosome sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) are upregulated, required for \u00b5LP, and recruited to LDs, vacuolar membranes, and sites of vacuolar membrane scission during \u00b5LP. We identify possible target proteins for LD-mediated ER proteostasis. Our live-cell imaging studies reveal that one potential target (Nup159) localizes to punctate structures that colocalizes with LDs 1) during movement from ER membranes to the cytosol, 2) during microautophagic uptake into vacuoles, and 3) within the vacuolar lumen. Finally, we find that mutations that inhibit LD biogenesis, homotypic vacuolar membrane fusion or ESCRT function inhibit stress-induced autophagy of Nup159 and other ER proteins.

As such, aberrant MAM function may help explain the seemingly unrelated metabolic abnormalities often seen in neurodegeneration. In the specific case of Alzheimer disease (AD), besides perturbations in calcium and lipid homeostasis, there are numerous documented alterations in mitochondrial behavior and function, including reduced respiratory chain activity and oxidative phosphorylation, increased free radical production, and altered organellar morphology, dynamics, and positioning (especially perinuclear mitochondria). However, whether these alterations are primary events causative of the disease, or are secondary downstream events that are the result of some other, more fundamental problem, is still unclear. In support of the former possibility, we recently reported that C99, the C-terminal processing product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived from its cleavage by \u03b2-secretase, is present in MAM, that its level is increased in AD, and that this increase reduces mitochondrial respiration, likely via a C99-induced alteration in cellular sphingolipid homeostasis.

In yeast, the ERMES complex is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria tether composed of four proteins, three of which contain a SMP (synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial-lipid binding protein) domain. No functional ortholog for any ERMES protein has been identified in metazoans. Here, we identified PDZD8 as an ER protein present at ER-mitochondria contacts. The SMP domain of PDZD8 is functionally orthologous to the SMP domain found in yeast Mmm1. PDZD8 was necessary for the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts in mammalian cells. In neurons, PDZD8 was required for calcium ion (Ca2+) uptake by mitochondria after synaptically induced Ca2+-release from ER and thereby regulated cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics. Thus, PDZD8 represents a critical ER-mitochondria tethering protein in metazoans.

In all cases, actin flow is driven by the push of actin polymerization and assembly at the cell cortex, and myosin-driven pulling forces deeper within the cell [6-10].

These processes affect and are affected by the redox status of and ATP production by mitochondria. Here, we describe the use of two ratiometric, genetically encoded biosensors that can detect mitochondrial redox state and ATP levels at subcellular resolution in living yeast cells. Mitochondrial redox state is measured using redox-sensitive Green Fluorescent Protein (roGFP) that is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Mito-roGFP contains cysteines at positions 147 and 204 of GFP, which undergo reversible and environment-dependent oxidation and reduction, which in turn alter the excitation spectrum of the protein. MitGO-ATeam is a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe in which the \u03b5 subunit of the FoF1-ATP synthase is sandwiched between FRET donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins. Binding of ATP to the \u03b5 subunit results in conformation changes in the protein that bring the FRET donor and acceptor in close proximity and allow for fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the donor to acceptor.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Biosensing Techniques", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Mitochondria", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason D", "Last Name": "Vevea", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Dana M", "Last Name": "Alessi Wolken", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Theresa C", "Last Name": "Swayne", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Adam B", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Liza A", "Last Name": "Pon", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE", "PubDate": "2013Jul22"}, {"PMID": "23735484", "Title": "Regulation of alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter and peroxisome biogenesis in different fermentation processes in Pichia pastoris.", "Abstract": "Production of recombinant proteins is affected by process conditions, where transcriptional regulation of Pichia pastoris alcohol oxidase 1 (PpAOX1) promoter has been a key factor to influence expression levels of proteins of interest. Here, we demonstrate that the AOX1 promoter and peroxisome biogenesis are regulated based on different process conditions. Two types of GFP-fusion proteins, Ub-R-GFP (short-lived GFP in the cytosol) and GFP-SKL (peroxisomal targeting GFP), were successfully used to characterize the time-course of the AOX1 promoter and peroxisome biogenesis, respectively. The activity of the AOX1 promoter and peroxisome biogenesis was highly subjected to different fermentation process conditions - methanol-limited condition at normoxy (ML), switched feeding of carbon sources (e.g., glucose and methanol) under carbon-limited condition at normoxy (SML), and oxygen-limited (OL) condition. The AOX1 promoter was most active under the ML, but less active under the OL. Peroxisome biogenesis showed a high dependency on methanol consumption. In addition, the proliferation of peroxisomes was inhibited in a medium containing glucose and stimulated in the methanol phase under a carbon-limited fed-batch culture condition. The specific productivity of a monoclonal antibody (qp) under the AOX1 promoter was higher at 86h of induction in the ML than in the OL (0.026 vs 0.020mgg(-1)h(-1)). However, the oxygen-limited condition was a robust process suitable for longer induction (180h) due to high cell fitness. Our study suggests that the maximal production of a recombinant protein is highly dependent on methanol consumption rate that is affected by the availability of methanol and oxygen molecules.", "Keywords": ["AOX1 promoter", "ML", "OL", "Peroxisome biogenesis", "Pichia pastoris", "Process conditions", "SML", "methanol-limited at normoxic condition", "oxygen-limited condition", "q(m)", "q(p)", "specific consumption rate of methanol (mgg(\u22121)h(\u22121))", "specific productivity of a monoclonal antibody (mgg(\u22121)h(\u22121))", "switched feeding of carbon sources under carbon-limited at normoxy"], "MeSH terms": ["Aldehyde Oxidase", "Batch Cell Culture Techniques", "Bioreactors", "Cells, Cultured", "Fermentation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Glucose", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Methanol", "Oxygen", "Peroxisomes", "Pichia", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sehoon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "GlycoFi, Biologics Discovery, Merck & Co., Inc, 16 Cavendish Ct., Lebanon, NH 03766, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shannon", "Last Name": "Warburton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Istvan", "Last Name": "Boldogh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cecilia", "Last Name": "Svensson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liza", "Last Name": "Pon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "d'Anjou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Terrance A", "Last Name": "Stadheim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Byung-Kwon", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of biotechnology", "PubDate": "2013Jul20"}, {"PMID": "23578876", "Title": "Mitochondrial fission: rings around the organelle.", "Abstract": "Mitochondria form a dynamic network in which organelles fuse or divide in response to metabolic changes or cellular stress.
