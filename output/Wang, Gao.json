[{"PMID": "38882238", "Title": "Digenic Analysis Finds Highly Interactive Genetic Variants Underlying Polygenic Traits.", "Abstract": "We briefly review our recently published approach to mining digenic genotype patterns, which consist of two genotypes each originating in a different DNA variant. We do this for a genetic case-control study by evaluating all possible pairs of genotypes, distributing the workload over numerous CPUs (threads) in a high-performance computing environment and apply our methods to two known datasets, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Parkinson Disease (PD). Based on a list of (e.g., 100,000) genotype pairs with largest genotype pair frequency differences between cases and controls, we determine the number  N u   of unique variants occurring in this list. For each unique variant, we find the number of genotype pairs it participates in, which identifies a set of variants \"connected\" with the given unique variant. Among the total of variants \"connected\" with all unique variants, only a subset of variants is unique. The ratio of all connected variants divided by that subset of variants is a measure for the overall density or connectedness of variants interacting with each other. We find that variants for the AMD data are much more interconnected than those for PD, at least based on the 100,000 genotype pairs with largest chi-square we investigated. Further, for each of the  N u   unique variants, we use the number of variants connected with it as a test statistic, weighted by the inverse of the rank at which the unique variant first occurred in the original list of genotype patterns. This weighing scheme ties the number of connections to the genetics of the trait and allows us to obtain, for each of the  N u   unique variants, an empirical significance level by permuting ranks. We find 12 and 8 significant, highly connected variants for AMD and PD, respectively, some of which have previously been identified by other machine learning methods, thus providing credence to our approach. Among the 100,000 genotype pairs investigated for each of AMD and PD, significant variants showed connections with up to 7,093 and 3,777 other variants, respectively. Our approach has been implemented in a freely available piece of software, the Digenic Network Test. Thus, our statistical genetics method can provide important information on the genetic architecture of polygenic traits.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jurg", "Last Name": "Ott", "Affiliation": "Rockefeller University, New York."}], "Journal": "Medical research archives", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "38514782", "Title": "Cell subtype-specific effects of genetic variation in the Alzheimer's disease brain.", "Abstract": "The relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in brain cell types and subtypes remains understudied.

A new variant influences APOE expression only in microglia and is associated with greater cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not Alzheimer's disease pathology, after adjusting for APOE\u03b54, providing mechanistic insights into both pathologies.

"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of disease-associated non-coding variants, posing urgent needs for functional interpretation. Molecular Quantitative Trait Loci (xQTLs) such as eQTLs serve as an essential intermediate link between these non-coding variants and disease phenotypes and have been widely used to discover disease-risk genes from many population-scale studies. However, mining and analyzing the xQTLs data presents several significant bioinformatics challenges, particularly when it comes to integration with GWAS data. Here, we developed xQTLbiolinks as the first comprehensive and scalable tool for bulk and single-cell xQTLs data retrieval, quality control and pre-processing from public repositories and our integrated resource. In addition, xQTLbiolinks provided a robust colocalization module through integration with GWAS summary statistics. The result generated by xQTLbiolinks can be flexibly visualized or stored in standard R objects that can easily be integrated with other R packages and custom pipelines. We applied xQTLbiolinks to cancer GWAS summary statistics as case studies and demonstrated its robust utility and reproducibility. xQTLbiolinks will profoundly accelerate the interpretation of disease-associated variants, thus promoting a better understanding of disease etiologies. xQTLbiolinks is available at https://github.com/lilab-bioinfo/xQTLbiolinks.", "Keywords": ["GWAS", "bioinformatics", "disease variants", "eQTL", "xQTL"], "MeSH terms": ["Quantitative Trait Loci", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Reproducibility of Results", "Phenotype", "Computational Biology", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ruofan", "Last Name": "Ding", "Affiliation": "Institute of Systems and Physical Biology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Xudong", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Institute of Systems and Physical Biology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Yangmei", "Last Name": "Qin", "Affiliation": "Institute of Systems and Physical Biology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Lihai", "Last Name": "Gong", "Affiliation": "Institute of Systems and Physical Biology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Institute of Systems and Physical Biology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Xuelian", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Institute of Systems and Physical Biology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Shouhong", "Last Name": "Guang", "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, The USTC RNA Institute, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Membraneless Organelles & Cellular Dynamics, School of Life Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Biomedical Sciences and Health Laboratory of Anhui Province, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China."}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Research, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, Shenzhen 518055, China."}, {"First Name": "Gao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "The Gertrude H.

With technological advances, it is now possible to measure multiple phenotypes in large samples. Multiple phenotypes can share their genetic component; therefore, modeling these phenotypes jointly may improve prediction accuracy by leveraging effects that are shared across phenotypes. However, effects can be shared across phenotypes in a variety of ways, so computationally efficient statistical methods are needed that can accurately and flexibly capture patterns of effect sharing. Here, we describe new Bayesian multivariate, multiple regression methods that, by using flexible priors, are able to model and adapt to different patterns of effect sharing and specificity across phenotypes. Simulation results show that these new methods are fast and improve prediction accuracy compared with existing methods in a wide range of settings where effects are shared. Further, in settings where effects are not shared, our methods still perform competitively with state-of-the-art methods. In real data analyses of expression data in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, our methods improve prediction performance on average for all tissues, with the greatest gains in tissues where effects are strongly shared, and in the tissues with smaller sample sizes.

Here we present new methods for fitting the SuSiE model to summary data, for example to single-SNP z-scores from an association study and linkage disequilibrium (LD) values estimated from a suitable reference panel. To develop these new methods, we first describe a simple, generic strategy for extending any individual-level data method to deal with summary data. The key idea is to replace the usual regression likelihood with an analogous likelihood based on summary data. We show that existing fine-mapping methods such as FINEMAP and CAVIAR also (implicitly) use this strategy, but in different ways, and so this provides a common framework for understanding different methods for fine-mapping. We investigate other common practical issues in fine-mapping with summary data, including problems caused by inconsistencies between the z-scores and LD estimates, and we develop diagnostics to identify these inconsistencies. We also present a new refinement procedure that improves model fits in some data sets, and hence improves overall reliability of the SuSiE fine-mapping results. Detailed evaluations of fine-mapping methods in a range of simulated data sets show that SuSiE applied to summary data is competitive, in both speed and accuracy, with the best available fine-mapping methods for summary data.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Likelihood Functions", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Models, Genetic", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Reproducibility of Results"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yuxin", "Last Name": "Zou", "Affiliation": "Department of Statistics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Carbonetto", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Gao", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology and the Gertrude.

TAA is a heritable disease that can be potentially life threatening. While 10%-20% of TAA cases are caused by rare, pathogenic variants in single genes, the origin of the majority of TAA cases remains unknown. A previous study implicated common variants in FBN1 with TAA disease risk. Here, we report a genome-wide scan of 1,351 TAA-affected individuals and 18,295 control individuals from the Cardiovascular Health Improvement Project and Michigan Genomics Initiative at the University of Michigan. We identified a genome-wide significant association with TAA for variants within the third intron of TCF7L2 following replication with meta-analysis of four additional independent cohorts. Common variants in this locus are the strongest known genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Although evidence indicates the presence of different causal variants for TAA and type 2 diabetes at this locus, we observed an opposite direction of effect. The genetic association for TAA colocalizes with an aortic eQTL of TCF7L2, suggesting a functional relationship. These analyses predict an association of higher expression of TCF7L2 with TAA disease risk.

The RV-NPL differs from the NPL in that RVs are analyzed, and allele sharing among affected relative-pairs is estimated only for minor alleles. Analyzing families can increase power because causal variants with familial aggregation usually have larger effect sizes than those underlying sporadic diseases. Differing from association analysis, for NPL only affected individuals are analyzed, which can increase power, since unaffected family members can be susceptibility variant carriers. RV-NPL is robust to population substructure and admixture, inclusion of nonpathogenic variants, as well as allelic and locus heterogeneity and can readily be applied outside of coding regions.

Causal variants that aggregate in families usually have larger effect sizes than those found in sporadic cases, so family-based designs can be a more powerful approach than population-based designs. Moreover, some family-based designs are robust to confounding due to population admixture or substructure. We developed a RV extension of the generalized disequilibrium test (GDT) to analyze sequence data obtained from nuclear and extended families. The GDT utilizes genotype differences of all discordant relative pairs to assess associations within a family, and the RV extension combines the single-variant GDT statistic over a genomic region of interest. The RV-GDT has increased power by efficiently incorporating information beyond first-degree relatives and allows for the inclusion of covariates. Using simulated genetic data, we demonstrated that the RV-GDT method has well-controlled type I error rates, even when applied to admixed populations and populations with substructure. It is more powerful than existing family-based RV association methods, particularly for the analysis of extended pedigrees and pedigrees with missing data. We analyzed whole-genome sequence data from families affected by Alzheimer disease to illustrate the application of the RV-GDT. Given the capability of the RV-GDT to adequately control for population admixture or substructure and analyze pedigrees with missing genotype data and its superior power over other family-based methods, it is an effective tool for elucidating the involvement of RVs in the etiology of complex traits.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "TNK1", "exome sequence data", "extended and nuclear pedigrees", "family-based association analysis", "generalized disequilibrium test", "missing data", "pedigree disequilibrium test", "rare variants", "whole-genome sequence data"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Axin Protein", "Computer Simulation", "Databases, Genetic", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Male", "Models, Genetic", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zongxiao", "Last Name": "He", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Di", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alan E", "Last Name": "Renton", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Biao", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linhai", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gao T", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Center for Statistical Genetics, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alison M", "Last Name": "Goate", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and Gertrude H.
