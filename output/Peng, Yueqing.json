For example, hippocampal theta, gamma and sharp wave oscillations are critical for memory formation and communication between hippocampal subareas and the cortex. In this study, we investigated the neuronal activity of the dentate gyrus (DG) with electrophysiological and optical imaging tools during sleep-wake cycles. We found that the activity of major glutamatergic cell populations in the DG is organized into in-fraslow oscillations (0.01 - 0.03 Hz) during NREM sleep. Although the DG is considered a sparsely active network during wakefulness, we found that 50% of granule cells and about 25% of mossy cells exhibit increased activity during NREM sleep. Further experiments revealed that the infraslow oscillation in the DG is modulated by rhythmic serotonin release during sleep, which oscillates at the same frequency but in an opposite phase. Genetic manipulation of 5-HT receptors revealed that this neuromodulatory regulation is mediated by 5-HT1a receptors and the knockdown of these receptors leads to memory impairment. Together, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into how the 5-HT system can influence hippocampal activity patterns during sleep.", "Keywords": ["Dentate gyrus", "calcium imaging", "fiber photometry", "infraslow oscillation", "microarousal", "serotonin", "sleep", "two-photon imaging"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gergely F", "Last Name": "Turi", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, Division of Systems Neuroscience New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sasa", "Last Name": "Teng", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xinyue", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily Cy", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Columbia College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carla", "Last Name": "Dias", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute, Division of Systems Neuroscience New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruining", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruizhi", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fenghua", "Last Name": "Zhen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yueqing", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May27"}, {"PMID": "38582752", "Title": "Expression of GCaMP6s in the dentate gyrus induces tonic-clonic seizures.", "Abstract": "GCaMP is a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) widely used in neuroscience research.

Sweet and bitter are two of the most salient sensory percepts for humans and other animals; sweet taste allows the identification of energy-rich nutrients whereas bitter warns against the intake of potentially noxious chemicals. In mammals, information from taste receptor cells in the tongue is transmitted through multiple neural stations to the primary gustatory cortex in the brain. Recent imaging studies have shown that sweet and bitter are represented in the primary gustatory cortex by neurons organized in a spatial map, with each taste quality encoded by distinct cortical fields. Here we demonstrate that by manipulating the brain fields representing sweet and bitter taste we directly control an animal's internal representation, sensory perception, and behavioural actions. These results substantiate the segregation of taste qualities in the cortex, expose the innate nature of appetitive and aversive taste responses, and illustrate the ability of gustatory cortex to recapitulate complex behaviours in the absence of sensory input.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Appetitive Behavior", "Avoidance Learning", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "Discrimination, Psychological", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Optogenetics", "Stereotaxic Techniques", "Taste", "Taste Perception", "Wakefulness"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yueqing", "Last Name": "Peng", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Gillis-Smith", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hao", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dimitri", "Last Name": "Tr\u00e4nkner", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas J P", "Last Name": "Ryba", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles S", "Last Name": "Zuker", "Affiliation": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2015Nov26"}]
