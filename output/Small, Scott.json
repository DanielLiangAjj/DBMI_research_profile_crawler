We hypothesize that deep learning applied to a structural neuroimaging dataset could detect disease-related alteration and improve classification and diagnostic accuracy. We tested this hypothesis using a single, widely available, and conventional T1-weighted MRI scan, from which we extracted the 3D whole-brain structure using standard post-processing methods. A deep learning model was then developed, optimized, and evaluated on three open datasets with T1-weighted MRI scans of patients with schizophrenia. Our proposed model outperformed the benchmark model, which was also trained with structural MR images using a 3D CNN architecture. Our model is capable of almost perfectly (area under the ROC curve\u2009=\u20090.987) distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy controls on unseen structural MRI scans. Regional analysis localized subcortical regions and ventricles as the most predictive brain regions. Subcortical structures serve a pivotal role in cognitive, affective, and social functions in humans, and structural abnormalities of these regions have been associated with schizophrenia. Our finding corroborates that schizophrenia is associated with widespread alterations in subcortical brain structure and the subcortical structural information provides prominent features in diagnostic classification.

Previous studies suggested that consumption of dietary flavanols might specifically be associated with the hippocampal-dependent memory component of cognitive aging and that memory benefits of a flavanol intervention might depend on habitual diet quality. Here, we tested these hypotheses in the context of a large-scale study of 3,562 older adults, who were randomly assigned to a 3-y intervention of cocoa extract (500 mg of cocoa flavanols per day) or a placebo [(COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study) COSMOS-Web, NCT04582617]. Using the alternative Healthy Eating Index in all participants and a urine-based biomarker of flavanol intake in a subset of participants [n = 1,361], we show that habitual flavanol consumption and diet quality at baseline are positively and selectively correlated with hippocampal-dependent memory. While the prespecified primary end point testing for an intervention-related improvement in memory in all participants after 1 y was not statistically significant, the flavanol intervention restored memory among participants in lower tertiles of habitual diet quality or habitual flavanol consumption. Increases in the flavanol biomarker over the course of the trial were associated with improving memory.

In Burkina Faso, the major African malaria mosquito Anopheles funestus comprises two strictly sympatric and morphologically indistinguishable yet karyotypically differentiated forms reported to differ in ecology and behavior. However, knowledge of the genetic basis and\u00a0environmental determinants of An. funestus diversification was impeded by lack of modern genomic resources. Here, we applied deep whole-genome sequencing and analysis to test the hypothesis that these two forms are ecotypes differentially adapted to breeding in natural swamps versus irrigated rice fields. We demonstrate genome-wide differentiation despite extensive microsympatry, synchronicity, and ongoing hybridization. Demographic inference supports a split only ~1,300 y ago, closely following the massive expansion of domesticated African rice cultivation ~1,850 y ago. Regions of highest divergence, concentrated in chromosomal inversions, were under selection during lineage splitting, consistent with local adaptation. The origin of nearly all variations implicated in adaptation, including chromosomal inversions, substantially predates the ecotype split, suggesting that rapid adaptation was fueled mainly by standing genetic variation. Sharp inversion frequency differences likely facilitated adaptive divergence between ecotypes by suppressing recombination between opposing chromosomal orientations of the two ecotypes, while permitting free recombination within the structurally monomorphic rice ecotype.

Nevertheless, SORLA's precise structural-functional relationship in endosomal recycling tubules remains unknown. Here, we address these outstanding questions by relying on crystallographic and artificial-intelligence evidence to generate a structural model for how SORLA folds and fits into retromer-positive endosomal tubules, where it is found to dimerize via both SORLA's fibronectin-type-III (3Fn)- and VPS10p-domains. Moreover, we identify a SORLA fragment comprising the 3Fn-, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains that has the capacity to form a dimer, and to enhance retromer-dependent recycling of APP by decreasing its amyloidogenic processing. Collectively, these observations generate a model for how SORLA dimer (and possibly polymer) formation can function in stabilizing and enhancing retromer function at endosome tubules.

In recent species radiations the sharing of genetic variation across porous species boundaries can facilitate adaptation to new environments and generate novel phenotypes, which may contribute to further diversification. Most Anopheles mosquito species that are of major importance as human malaria vectors have evolved within recent and rapid radiations of largely nonvector species. Here, we focus on one of the most medically important yet understudied anopheline radiations, the Afrotropical Anopheles funestus complex (AFC), to investigate the role of introgression in its diversification and the possible link between introgression and vector potential. The AFC comprises at least seven morphologically similar species, yet only An. funestus sensu stricto is a highly efficient malaria vector with a pan-African distribution. Based on de novo genome assemblies and additional whole-genome resequencing, we use phylogenomic and population genomic analyses to establish species relationships. We show that extensive interspecific gene flow involving multiple species pairs has shaped the evolutionary history of the AFC since its diversification. The most recent introgression event involved a massive and asymmetrical movement of genes from a distantly related AFC lineage into An. funestus, an event that predated and plausibly facilitated its subsequent dramatic geographic range expansion across most of tropical Africa.

Here, we performed a CSF proteomic screen in mice with a neuronal-selective knockout of the core of the retromer complex VPS35, a master conductor of endosomal traffic that has been implicated in AD. We then validated three of the most relevant proteomic findings: the amino terminus of the transmembrane proteins APLP1 and CHL1, and the mid-domain of tau, which is known to be unconventionally secreted and elevated in AD. In patients with AD dementia, the concentration of amino-terminal APLP1 and CHL1 in the CSF correlated with tau and phosphorylated tau. Similar results were observed in healthy controls, where both proteins correlated with tau and phosphorylated tau and were elevated in about 70% of patients in the prodromal stages of AD.

A major barrier to mapping normal brain aging has been the difficulty in excluding the earliest preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Here, before addressing this issue we first imaged a mouse model and learn that the best MRI measure of dendritic spine loss, a known pathophysiological driver of normal aging, is one that relies on the combined use of functional and structural MRI. In the primary study, we then deployed the combined functional-structural MRI measure to investigate over 100 cognitively-normal people from 20-72 years of age. Next, to cover the tail end of aging, in secondary analyses we investigated structural MRI acquired from cognitively-normal people, 60-84 years of age, who were Alzheimer's-free via biomarkers.

Antipsychotic drugs have been proven to alleviate acute psychotic symptoms and prevent their recurrence in schizophrenia, but the outcomes of most patients historically have been suboptimal. However, a series of findings in studies of first-episode schizophrenia patients transformed the psychiatric field's thinking about the pathophysiology, course, and potential for disease-modifying effects of treatment. These include the relationship between the duration of untreated psychotic symptoms and outcome; the superior responses of first-episode patients to antipsychotics compared with patients with chronic illness, and the reduction in brain gray matter volume over the course of the illness. Studies of the effectiveness of early detection and intervention models of care have provided encouraging but inconclusive results in limiting the morbidity and modifying the course of illness. Nevertheless, first-episode psychosis studies have established an evidentiary basis for considering a team-based, coordinated specialty approach as the standard of care for treating early psychosis, which has led to their global proliferation. In contrast, while clinical high-risk research has developed an evidence-based care model for decreasing the burden of attenuated symptoms, no treatment has been shown to reduce risk or prevent the transition to syndromal psychosis. Moreover, the current diagnostic criteria for clinical high risk lack adequate specificity for clinical application. What limits our ability to realize the potential of early detection and intervention models of care are the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic criteria for pre-syndromal schizophrenia, validated biomarkers, and proven therapeutic strategies. Future research requires methodologically rigorous studies in large patient samples, across multiple sites, that ideally are guided by scientifically credible pathophysiological theories for which there is compelling evidence. These caveats notwithstanding, we can reasonably expect future studies to build on the research of the past four decades to advance our knowledge and enable this game-changing model of care to become a reality.", "Keywords": ["Biomarkers", "Early Detection", "Prevention", "Psychosis", "Schizophrenia", "Treatment"], "MeSH terms": ["Early Diagnosis", "Humans", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jeffrey A", "Last Name": "Lieberman", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry (Lieberman, Small, Girgis) and Department of Neurology (Small), College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York (Lieberman, Small, Girgis)."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry (Lieberman, Small, Girgis) and Department of Neurology (Small), College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York (Lieberman, Small, Girgis)."}, {"First Name": "Ragy R", "Last Name": "Girgis", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry (Lieberman, Small, Girgis) and Department of Neurology (Small), College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York (Lieberman, Small, Girgis)."}], "Journal": "The American journal of psychiatry", "PubDate": "2019Oct01"}, {"PMID": "31520793", "Title": "Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid levels are associated with delayed memory retention in cognitively normal biomarker-negative older adults.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is defined by abnormal levels of amyloid and tau biomarkers.

Lymphatic filariasis currently affects the lives of 90 million people in 52 countries. There are three nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti, but 90% of all cases of lymphatic filariasis are caused solely by W. bancrofti (Wb). Here we use population genomics to reconstruct the probable route and timing of migration of Wb strains that currently infect Africa, Haiti, and Papua New Guinea (PNG). We used selective whole genome amplification to sequence 42 whole genomes of single Wb worms from populations in Haiti, Mali, Kenya, and PNG. Our results are consistent with a hypothesis of an Island Southeast Asia or East Asian origin of Wb. Our demographic models support divergence times that correlate with the migration of human populations. We hypothesize that PNG was infected at two separate times, first by the Melanesians and later by the migrating Austronesians. The migrating Austronesians also likely introduced Wb to Madagascar where later migrations spread it to continental Africa.

The mechanism(s) by which CT inhibits NHE3 is partially understood, although no drug therapy has been successful at reversing this inhibition. We now describe that CT phosphorylates an amino acid in the PDZ domain of SNX27, which inhibits SNX27-mediated trafficking of NHE3 from the early endosomes to the plasma membrane (PM), and contributes to reduced basal NHE3 activity through a mechanism that involves reduced PM expression and reduced endocytic recycling. Importantly, mutagenesis studies (Ser to Asp) showed that the effect of this phosphorylation of SNX27 phenocopies the effects seen upon loss of SNX27 function, affecting PM trafficking of cargo proteins that bind SNX27-retromer. Additionally, CT destabilizes retromer function by decreasing the amount of core retromer proteins. These effects of CT can be partially rescued by enhancing retromer stability by using 'pharmacological chaperones'.

Strikingly, mice deficient in the glutamate synthetic enzyme glutaminase have CA1 hypoactivity and a SCZ-resilience profile, implicating glutamate-metabolizing enzymes. To address this further, we examined mice with a brain-wide deficit in the glutamate-metabolizing enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), encoded by Glud1, which should lead to glutamate excess due to reduced glutamate metabolism in astrocytes. We found that Glud1-deficient mice have behavioral abnormalities in the 3 SCZ symptom domains, with increased baseline and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion as a positive symptom proxy, nest building and social preference as a negative symptom proxy, and reversal/extradimensional set shifting in the water T-maze and contextual fear conditioning as a cognitive symptom proxy. Neuroimaging of cerebral blood volume revealed hippocampal hyperactivity in CA1, which was associated with volume reduction. Parameters of hippocampal synaptic function revealed excess glutamate release and an elevated excitatory/inhibitory balance in CA1. Finally, in a direct clinical correlation using imaging-guided microarray, we found a significant SCZ-associated postmortem reduction in GLUD1 expression in CA1. These findings advance GLUD1 deficiency as a driver of excess hippocampal excitatory transmission and SCZ symptoms, and identify GDH as a target for glutamate modulation pharmacotherapy for SCZ.

We implemented the MEGA-PRESS sequence on a Bruker 94/20 system with ParaVision 6.0.1, and magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from nine male wild-type C57BL/6\u00a0J mice at the thalamus. Four individual scans were obtained for each mouse in a 2-h time course whilst the mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane. We developed an automated analysis program with improved correction for frequency and phase drift compared with the standard creatine (Cr) fitting-based method and provided automatic quantification. During MEGA-PRESS acquisition, a single voxel with a size of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm3 was placed at the thalamus to evaluate GABA to Cr (GABA/Cr) ratios during anesthesia.

W. bancrofti currently infects over 90 million people throughout the tropics and has been acknowledged by the world health organization as a vulnerable parasite. Current research has focused primarily on the clinical manifestations of disease and little is known about the evolutionary history of W. bancrofti. To improve upon knowledge of the evolutionary history of W. bancrofti, we whole genome sequenced 13 W. bancrofti larvae. We circumvent many of the difficulties of multiple infections by sampling larvae directly from mosquitoes that were experimentally inoculated with infected blood. To begin, we used whole genome data to reconstruct the historical population size. Our results support a history of fluctuating population sizes that can be correlated with human migration and fluctuating mosquito abundances. Next, we reconstructed the putative pedigree of W. bancrofti worms within an infection using the kinship coefficient. We deduced that there are full-sib and half-sib relationships residing within the same larval cohort. Through combined analysis of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes we concluded that this is likely a results of polyandrous mating, the first time reported for W. bancrofti. Lastly, we scanned the genomes for signatures of natural selection.

Because the polymerization reaction is exothermic, many researchers have attempted to minimize thermal osteonecrosis due to heat generation by altering procedures in the preparation of the cement. In most previous studies, only one or two aspects of the preparation procedure were controlled, and there has been little research that comprehensively examines the effects of preparation on the cure kinetics and resulting properties of bone cement. In this study, cement viscosity, cement layer thickness, initial cement temperature, initial metal component temperature, and mixing method were varied to assess the effects on the cement. Maximum temperature, polymerization time, necrosis index, bending strength, and porosity were chosen to evaluate the different preparation procedures, where an optimal procedure would minimize necrosis, reduce cement cure time, and maximize bending strength. Design of Experiments (DOE) was used to examine the main effects and interactions of preparation techniques. Among the most prominent results, it was found that the cure kinetics and the related quantities are primarily controlled by the initial metal component temperature and that the bending strength is most dependent on the mixing method. For the two formulations studied, the optimum preparation procedures should keep cement and metal components at room temperature prior to mixing with a vacuum mixing system.

In many malaria endemic areas, several species of Anopheles coexist, sometimes in the form of related sibling species that are morphologically indistinguishable. Determining the size and organization of Anopheles populations, and possible ongoing gene flow among them is important for malaria control and, in particular, for monitoring the spread of insecticide resistance alleles. However, these parameters have been difficult to evaluate in most Anopheles species due to the paucity of genetic data available. Here, we assess the extent of contemporary gene flow and historical variations in population size by sequencing and de novo assembling the genomes of wild-caught mosquitoes from four species of the Anopheles punctulatus group of Papua New Guinea. Our analysis of more than 50\u00a0Mb of orthologous DNA sequences revealed no evidence of contemporary gene flow among these mosquitoes. In addition, investigation of the demography of two of the An. punctulatus species revealed distinct population histories.

Current tools available to monitor LF are limited to diagnostic tests targeting DNA repeats, filarial antigens, and anti-filarial antibodies. While these tools are useful for detection and surveillance, elimination programs have yet to take full advantage of molecular typing for inferring infection history, strain fingerprinting, and evolution. To date, molecular typing approaches have included whole mitochondrial genomes, genotyping, targeted sequencing, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). These studies have revealed much about Wb biology. For example, in one study in Papua New Guinea researchers identified 5 major strains that were widespread and many minor strains some of which exhibit geographic stratification. Genome data, while rare, has been utilized to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among taxa of the Onchocercidae (the clade of filarial nematodes) and identify gene synteny. Their phylogeny reveals that speciation from the common ancestor of both B. malayi and Wb occurred around 5-6 millions years ago with shared ancestry to other filarial nematodes as recent as 15 million years ago. These discoveries hold promise for gene discovery and identifying drug targets in species that are more amenable to in vivo experiments. Continued technological developments in whole genome sequencing and data analysis will likely replace many other forms of molecular typing, multiplying the amount of data available on population structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetics. Once widely available, the addition of population genetic data from genomic studies should hasten the elimination of LF parasites like Wb. Infectious disease control programs have benefited greatly from population genetics data and recently from population genomics data. However, while there is currently a surplus of data for diseases like malaria and HIV, there is a scarcity of this data for filarial nematodes. With the falling cost of genome sequencing, research on filarial nematodes could benefit from the addition of population genetics statistics and phylogenetics especially in dealing with elimination programs. A comprehensive review focusing on population genetics of filarial nematode does not yet exist. Here our goal is to provide a current overview of the molecular epidemiology of W. bancrofti (Wb) the primary causative agent of LF. We begin by reviewing studies utilizing molecular typing techniques with specific focus on genomic and population datasets. Next, we used whole mitochondrial genome data to construct a phylogeny and examine the evolutionary history of the Onchocercidae. Then, we provide a perspective to aid in understanding how population genetic techniques translate to modern epidemiology.

A variety of metabolic changes related to T2D (e.g. hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and elevated branched-chain amino acids) have been proposed as mechanistic links, but the basis for this association remains unknown. Retromer-dependent trafficking is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, and two key retromer proteins, VPS35 and VPS26, are deficient in the hippocampal formation of AD patients. We characterized VPS35 levels in five different mouse models of T2D/obesity to identify specific metabolic factors that could affect retromer levels in the brain. Mouse models in which hyperleucinemia was present displayed hippocampus-selective retromer deficiency. Wild-type lean mice fed a high leucine diet also developed hippocampal-selective retromer deficiency, and neuronal-like cells grown in high ambient leucine had reduced retromer complex proteins.

We carried out a gene expression study in human postmortem tissue harvested from both DG and entorhinal cortex (EC), a neighboring subregion unaffected by aging and known to be the site of onset of AD. Using expression in the EC for normalization, we identified 17 genes that manifested reliable age-related changes in the DG. The most significant change was an age-related decline in RbAp48, a histone-binding protein that modifies histone acetylation. To test whether the RbAp48 decline could be responsible for age-related memory loss, we turned to mice and found that, consistent with humans, RbAp48 was less abundant in the DG of old than in young mice. We next generated a transgenic mouse that expressed a dominant-negative inhibitor of RbAp48 in the adult forebrain. Inhibition of RbAp48 in young mice caused hippocampus-dependent memory deficits similar to those associated with aging, as measured by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that within the hippocampal formation, dysfunction was selectively observed in the DG, and this corresponded to a regionally selective decrease in histone acetylation. Up-regulation of RbAp48 in the DG of aged wild-type mice ameliorated age-related hippocampus-based memory loss and age-related abnormalities in histone acetylation. Together, these findings show that the DG is a hippocampal subregion targeted by aging, and identify molecular mechanisms of cognitive aging that could serve as valid targets for therapeutic intervention.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetylation", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Animals", "Dentate Gyrus", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genes, Dominant", "Histone Acetyltransferases", "Histones", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Memory Disorders", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Organ Specificity", "Phosphoproteins", "Protein Binding", "RNA, Messenger", "Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 4"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elias", "Last Name": "Pavlopoulos", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sidonie", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stylianos", "Last Name": "Kosmidis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maggie", "Last Name": "Close", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carla", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Olga", "Last Name": "Kovalerchik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Eric R", "Last Name": "Kandel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Science translational medicine", "PubDate": "2013Aug28"}, {"PMID": "23907271", "Title": "Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate regulates sorting and processing of amyloid precursor protein through the endosomal system.", "Abstract": "Defects in endosomal sorting have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

Silencing Vps34 causes an enlargement of neuronal endosomes, enhances the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein in these organelles and reduces amyloid precursor protein sorting to intraluminal vesicles.

Here, to investigate regional vulnerability in the disease, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to translationally link studies in patients with a mouse model of disease. Using fMRI, we mapped cerebral blood volume (CBV) in three groups: HD patients, symptom-free carriers of the huntingtin genetic mutation, and age-matched controls. In contrast to a region in the anterior caudate, in which dysfunction was linked to genotype independent of phenotype, a region in the posterior body of the caudate was differentially associated with disease phenotype. Guided by these observations, we harvested regions from the anterior and posterior body of the caudate in postmortem control and HD human brain tissue. Gene-expression profiling identified two molecules whose expression levels were most strongly correlated with regional vulnerability - protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7 (PPP1R7) and Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1). To verify and potentially extend these findings, we turned to the YAC128 (C57BL/6J) HD transgenic mice. By fMRI we longitudinally mapped CBV in transgenic and wildtype (WT) mice, and over time, abnormally low fMRI signal emerged selectively in the dorsal striatum. A relatively unaffected brain region, primary somatosensory cortex (S1), was used as a control. Both dorsal striatum and S1 were harvested from transgenic and WT mice and molecular analysis confirmed that PPP1R7 deficiency was strongly correlated with the phenotype. Together, converging findings in human HD patients and this HD mouse model suggest a functional pattern of caudate vulnerability and that variation in expression levels of herein identified molecules correlate with this pattern of vulnerability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Corpus Striatum", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurons", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phenotype", "Protein Phosphatase 1", "Repressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole M", "Last Name": "Lewandowski", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yvette", "Last Name": "Bordelon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sergio", "Last Name": "Angulo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Usman", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan", "Last Name": "Muraskin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Erica Y", "Last Name": "Griffith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Paula", "Last Name": "Wasserman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Liliana", "Last Name": "Menalled", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean Paul", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Marder", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Herman", "Last Name": "Moreno", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Neurobiology of disease", "PubDate": "2013Apr"}, {"PMID": "23142455", "Title": "High initial stability in porous titanium acetabular cups: a biomechanical study.", "Abstract": "Initial stability with limited micromotion in uncemented total hip arthroplasty acetabular components is essential for bony attachment and long-term biomechanical fixation. This study compared porous titanium fixation surfaces to clinically established, plasma-sprayed designs in terms of interface stability and required seating force. Porous plasma-sprayed modular and metal-on-metal (MOM) cups were compared to a modular, porous titanium designs. Cups were implanted into polyurethane blocks with1-mm interference fit and subsequently edge loaded to failure. Porous titanium cups exhibited 23% to 65% improvement in initial stability when compared to plasma-sprayed cup designs (P=.01): a clinically significant increase, based on experience and prior literature. The results of this study indicate increased interface stability in porous titanium-coated cups without significantly increasing the necessary force and energy required for full seating.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetabulum", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Hip Prosthesis", "Materials Testing", "Prosthesis Design", "Titanium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Scott R", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Joint Replacement Surgeons of Indiana Foundation, Inc., Mooresville, Indiana, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Berend", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leah A", "Last Name": "Howard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Renee D", "Last Name": "Rogge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine A", "Last Name": "Buckley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Merrill A", "Last Name": "Ritter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of arthroplasty", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}, {"PMID": "22948528", "Title": "Acetabular cup design influences deformational response in total hip arthroplasty.", "Abstract": "Press-fit acetabular components are susceptible to deformation in an underreamed socket, with excessive deformation of metal-on-metal (MOM) components potentially leading to increased torsional friction and micromotion.

Acetabular implant stiffness has been suggested as a factor in pelvic stress shielding and osseous integration. This study was designed to examine the combined effects of acetabular cup orientation and stiffness and on pelvic osseous loading. Four implant designs of varying stiffness were implanted into a composite hemipelvis in 35\u00b0 or 50\u00b0 of abduction. Specimens were dynamically loaded to simulate gait and pelvic strains were quantified with a grid of rosette strain gages and digital image correlation techniques. Changes in the joint reaction force orientation significantly altered mean acetabular bone strain values up to 67%. Increased cup abduction resulted in a 12% increase along the medial acetabular wall and an 18% decrease in strain in inferior lateral regions. Imbalanced loading distributions were observed with the stiffer components, resulting in higher, more variable, and localized surface strains. This study illustrates the effects of cup stiffness, gait, and implant orientation on loading distributions across the implanted pelvis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Acetabulum", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Hip Joint", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Scott R", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Joint Replacement Surgeons of Indiana Foundation, Inc, Mooresville, Indiana, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael E", "Last Name": "Berend", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Leah A", "Last Name": "Howard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Didem", "Last Name": "Tun\u00e7", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine A", "Last Name": "Buckley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Merrill A", "Last Name": "Ritter", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of arthroplasty", "PubDate": "2013Feb"}]
