We retrospectively examined male and female children (aged 1-9 years) who underwent ambulatory surgery that lasted < 2 h. Various parameters, including the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score (mYPAS) before anesthesia induction, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score at recovery time, and the value of the patient state index (PSI), were extracted from our electronic anesthesia database. The relationships between the PAED score and the mean PSI values were examined with univariate analyses. We also investigated the associations among the mean PSI, propofol anesthesia, age, mYPAS, the type of surgery, and the total amount of fentanyl divided by body weight with the PAED score using multiple regression analysis with interaction terms. There were 32 and 34 patients in the sevoflurane and propofol groups, respectively. The PAED scores (all patients: r = -0.34, p = 0.0048; sevoflurane group: r = -0.37, p = 0.036) were negatively correlated with the mean PSI, whereas the PAED score in the propofol group [r = 0.31 (-0.03, 0.59), p = 0.073] did not show a significant positive correlation with the mean PSI in the univariate analysis. The multiple linear regression analysis outcomes revealed that the mean PSI value was an independent clinical factor associated with the PAED score. Intraoperative electroencephalogram monitoring may be proved as one of the useful tools for the assessment of EA risks in children.", "Keywords": ["electroencephalogram", "emergence agitation", "patient state index", "propofol", "sevoflurane"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Male", "Female", "Sevoflurane", "Propofol", "Emergence Delirium", "Retrospective Studies", "Incidence", "Methyl Ethers", "Anesthesia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Akihiro", "Last Name": "Kanaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Takahiro", "Last Name": "Mihara", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Data Science, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Data Science."}, {"First Name": "Shoma", "Last Name": "Tanaka", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Maya", "Last Name": "Mikami", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Toshihiro", "Last Name": "Wagatsuma", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Sendai Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Masanori", "Last Name": "Yamauchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine."}], "Journal": "The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine", "PubDate": "2023May26"}, {"PMID": "36045388", "Title": "Chronic allergic lung inflammation negatively influences neurobehavioral outcomes in mice.", "Abstract": "Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide.

Asthma severity is associated with airway inflammation; therefore, reducing airway inflammation is an important therapeutic target. Gelsolin is an actin capping and severing protein that has been reported to be involved in modulation of the inflammatory response. Using mice genetically lacking gelsolin, we evaluated the role of gelsolin in the establishment of house dust mite (HDM) antigen-induced allergic lung inflammation. The genetic absence of gelsolin was found to be protective against HDM sensitization, resulting in reduced lung inflammation, inflammatory cytokines, and Muc5AC protein in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and interstitial macrophages in the BAL were increased after HDM sensitization in wild-type mice but were attenuated in gelsolin-null mice. The observed attenuation of inflammation may be partly due to delayed migration of immune cells, because the reduced eosinophils in the BALs from gelsolin-null mice compared with controls occurred despite similar amounts of the chemoattractant eotaxin. Splenic T cells demonstrated similar proliferation rates, but ex vivo alveolar macrophage migration was delayed in gelsolin-null mice. In vivo, the reduced lung inflammation after HDM sensitization in gelsolin-null mice was associated with significantly diminished airway resistance to inhaled methacholine compared with HDM-treated wild-type mice.

Patients are increasingly seeking complementary and alternative medicine approaches to control their symptoms, including the use of natural products. Ginger, a natural product that we previously demonstrated acutely relaxes airway smooth muscle (ASM), has long been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties, although a precise mechanistic understanding is lacking. In these studies, we demonstrate that chronic administration of whole ginger extract or 6-shogaol, a bioactive component of ginger, mitigates in vivo house dust mite antigen-mediated lung inflammation in mice. We further show that this decrease in inflammation is associated with reduced in vivo airway responsiveness. Utilizing in vitro studies, we demonstrate that 6-shogaol augments cAMP concentrations in CD4 cells, consistent with phosphodiesterase inhibition, and limits the induction of nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in activated CD4 cells. Sustained elevations in cAMP concentration are well known to inhibit effector T cell function. Interestingly, regulatory T cells (Tregs) utilize cAMP as a mediator of their immunosuppressive effects, and we demonstrate here that 6-shogaol augments the Treg polarization of na\u00efve CD4 cells in vitro.

Primary cultured ASM cells from these mice demonstrate enhanced inositol triphosphate (IP3) synthesis and increased intracellular calcium in response to Gq-coupled agonists. We hypothesized that this was due to increased intracellular availability of unbound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), based on the fact that gelsolin contains a short peptide region that binds PIP2, presumably making it a less available substrate. We now questioned whether a peptide that corresponds to the PIP2 binding region of gelsolin could modulate ASM signaling and contraction. The 10 amino acid sequence of the gelsolin peptide within the PIP2-binding region was incubated with primary cultures of human ASM cells, and IP3 synthesis was measured in response to a Gq-coupled agonist. Gelsolin peptide-treated cells generated less IP3 under basal and bradykinin or acetylcholine (Gq-coupled) conditions. Acetylcholine-induced contractile force measured in isolated tracheal rings from mice and human tracheal muscle strips in organ baths was attenuated in the presence of the gelsolin peptide. The gelsolin peptide also attenuated methacholine-induced airway constriction in murine precision-cut lung slices.

Osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of monocytes in response to receptor activators of NF-\u03baB-ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (M-CSF). Calreticulin (CRT), a commonly known intracellular protein as a calcium-binding chaperone, has an unexpectedly robust anti-osteoclastogenic effect when its recombinant form is applied to osteoclast precursors in vitro or at the site of bone inflammation externally in vivo. Externally applied Calreticulin was internalized inside the cells. It inhibited key pro-osteoclastogenic transcription factors such as c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1)-in osteoclast precursor cells that were treated with RANKL in vitro. Recombinant human Calreticulin (rhCRT) inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory osteoclastogenesis in the mouse calvarial bone in vivo. Cathepsin K molecular imaging verified decreased Cathepsin K activity when rhCalreticulin was applied at the site of LPS application in vivo.

Isolated tracheal rings from gelsolin knockout (KO) mice showed impaired relaxation to both a \u03b2-agonist and chloroquine, a bitter taste receptor agonist, which relaxes ASM, despite inducing transiently increased [Ca2+]i. A single inhalation of methacholine increased lung resistance to a similar extent in wild-type and gelsolin KO mice, but the subsequent spontaneous relaxation was less in gelsolin KO mice. In ASM cells derived from gelsolin KO mice, serotonin-induced Gq-coupled activation increased both [Ca2+]i and inositol triphosphate synthesis to a greater extent compared to cells from wild-type mice, possibly due to the absence of gelsolin binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Single-cell analysis showed higher filamentous:globular actin ratio at baseline and slower cytoskeletal remodeling dynamics in gelsolin KO cells. Gelsolin KO ASM cells also showed an attenuated decrease in cell stiffness to chloroquine and flufenamic acid.
