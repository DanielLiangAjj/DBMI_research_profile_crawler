To investigate this question, we tracked the eye movements of human observers while they read trivia questions and, after a brief delay, were visually given the answer. We show that higher curiosity was associated with earlier anticipatory orienting of gaze toward the answer location without changes in other metrics of saccades or fixations, and that these influences were distinct from those produced by variations in confidence and surprise. Across subjects, the enhancement of anticipatory gaze was correlated with measures of trait curiosity from personality questionnaires.

For example, attention must be directed towards specific objects, their identities recognized, and a choice made among alternatives. Pairs of competing accumulators and drift-diffusion processes provide good models of evidence integration in two-alternative perceptual choices, but more complex tasks requiring the coordination of attention and decision making involve multistage processing and multiple brain areas. Here we consider a task in which a target is located among distractors and its identity reported by lever release. The data comprise reaction times, accuracies, and single unit recordings from two monkeys' lateral interparietal area (LIP) neurons. LIP firing rates distinguish between targets and distractors, exhibit stimulus set size effects, and show response-hemifield congruence effects. These data motivate our model, which uses coupled sets of leaky competing accumulators to represent processes hypothesized to occur in feature-selective areas and limb motor and pre-motor areas, together with the visual selection process occurring in LIP. Model simulations capture the electrophysiological and behavioral data, and fitted parameters suggest that different connection weights between LIP and the other cortical areas may account for the observed behavioral differences between the animals.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Attention", "Behavior, Animal", "Decision Making", "Macaca", "Models, Neurological", "Parietal Lobe", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Stochastic Processes", "Visual Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Schwemmer", "Affiliation": "Mathematical Biosciences Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Samuel F", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Sciences, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates."}, {"First Name": "Philip J", "Last Name": "Holmes", "Affiliation": "Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Gottlieb", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "25580237", "Title": "Active learning and decision making: an introduction to the collection.", "Abstract": "The importance of exploratory behaviors by which agents actively sample information has been long appreciated in a wide range of disciplines ranging from machine and robot learning to neuroscience and psychology. \u00a0Given the complexity of these behaviors, progress in understanding them will require a confluence of ideas from these multiple fields.\u00a0 This collection of articles in F1000Research aims to provide a home for a broad range of studies addressing this topic, including full length research articles, brief communications, single figure studies, and review/opinion articles, and studies using computational, behavioral or neural approaches. \u00a0Here, we provide an introduction to the collection which we hope will grow and become a valuable resource for the researchers exploring this topic.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Gottlieb", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, The Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manuel", "Last Name": "Lopes", "Affiliation": "INRIA, Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France."}, {"First Name": "Pierre-Yves", "Last Name": "Oudeyer", "Affiliation": "INRIA, Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, France."}], "Journal": "F1000Research", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "25392517", "Title": "Attention, reward, and information seeking.", "Abstract": "Decision making is thought to be guided by the values of alternative options and involve the accumulation of evidence to an internal bound.

Because the available rewards are ambiguous or unknown during the exploratory phase, subjects must act in intrinsically motivated fashion. However, a vast majority of behavioral and neural studies to date have focused on decision making in reward-based tasks, and the rules guiding intrinsically motivated exploration remain largely unknown. To examine this question we developed a paradigm for systematically testing the choices of human observers in a free play context. Adult subjects played a series of short computer games of variable difficulty, and freely choose which game they wished to sample without external guidance or physical rewards. Subjects performed the task in three distinct conditions where they sampled from a small or a large choice set (7 vs. 64 possible levels of difficulty), and where they did or did not have the possibility to sample new games at a constant level of difficulty. We show that despite the absence of external constraints, the subjects spontaneously adopted a structured exploration strategy whereby they (1) started with easier games and progressed to more difficult games, (2) sampled the entire choice set including extremely difficult games that could not be learnt, (3) repeated moderately and high difficulty games much more frequently than was predicted by chance, and (4) had higher repetition rates and chose higher speeds if they could generate new sequences at a constant level of difficulty. The results suggest that intrinsically motivated exploration is shaped by several factors including task difficulty, novelty and the size of the choice set, and these come into play to serve two internal goals-maximize the subjects' knowledge of the available tasks (exploring the limits of the task set), and maximize their competence (performance and skills) across the task set.", "Keywords": ["decision making", "exploration", "intrinsic motivation", "novelty", "video games"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adrien F", "Last Name": "Baranes", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pierre-Yves", "Last Name": "Oudeyer", "Affiliation": "Inria Bordeaux, France ; Ensta ParisTech Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Gottlieb", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University Medical Center New York, NY, USA ; Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24899716", "Title": "Novelty enhances visual salience independently of reward in the parietal lobe.", "Abstract": "Novelty modulates sensory and reward processes, but it remains unknown how these effects interact, i.e., how the visual effects of novelty are related to its motivational effects. A widespread hypothesis, based on findings that novelty activates reward-related structures, is that all the effects of novelty are explained in terms of reward. According to this idea, a novel stimulus is by default assigned high reward value and hence high salience, but this salience rapidly decreases if the stimulus signals a negative outcome. Here we show that, contrary to this idea, novelty affects visual salience in the monkey lateral intraparietal area (LIP) in ways that are independent of expected reward. Monkeys viewed peripheral visual cues that were novel or familiar (received few or many exposures) and predicted whether the trial will have a positive or a negative outcome--i.e., end in a reward or a lack of reward. We used a saccade-based assay to detect whether the cues automatically attracted or repelled attention from their visual field location. We show that salience--measured in saccades and LIP responses--was enhanced by both novelty and positive reward associations, but these factors were dissociable and habituated on different timescales. The monkeys rapidly recognized that a novel stimulus signaled a negative outcome (and withheld anticipatory licking within the first few presentations), but the salience of that stimulus remained high for multiple subsequent presentations. Therefore, novelty can provide an intrinsic bonus for attention that extends beyond the first presentation and is independent of physical rewards.", "Keywords": ["intrinsic motivation", "monkey", "novelty", "parietal", "reward", "salience"], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Attention", "Cues", "Exploratory Behavior", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Motivation", "Neurons", "Parietal Lobe", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Reward", "Statistics, Nonparametric"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholas C", "Last Name": "Foley", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Jangraw", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Peck", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Gottlieb", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Kavli Institute for Brain Science, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032 jg2141@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2014Jun04"}, {"PMID": "24523935", "Title": "Neural correlates of temporal credit assignment in the parietal lobe.", "Abstract": "Empirical studies of decision making have typically assumed that value learning is governed by time, such that a reward prediction error arising at a specific time triggers temporally-discounted learning for all preceding actions. However, in natural behavior, goals must be acquired through multiple actions, and each action can have different significance for the final outcome. As is recognized in computational research, carrying out multi-step actions requires the use of credit assignment mechanisms that focus learning on specific steps, but little is known about the neural correlates of these mechanisms. To investigate this question we recorded neurons in the monkey lateral intraparietal area (LIP) during a serial decision task where two consecutive eye movement decisions led to a final reward. The underlying decision trees were structured such that the two decisions had different relationships with the final reward, and the optimal strategy was to learn based on the final reward at one of the steps (the \"F\" step) but ignore changes in this reward at the remaining step (the \"I\" step). In two distinct contexts, the F step was either the first or the second in the sequence, controlling for effects of temporal discounting. We show that LIP neurons had the strongest value learning and strongest post-decision responses during the transition after the F step regardless of the serial position of this step. Thus, the neurons encode correlates of temporal credit assignment mechanisms that allocate learning to specific steps independently of temporal discounting.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Computer Simulation", "Decision Making", "Decision Trees", "Eye Movements", "Learning", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Parietal Lobe", "Psychomotor Performance", "Reproducibility of Results", "Reward", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Timothy M", "Last Name": "Gersch", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas C", "Last Name": "Foley", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Eisenberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jacqueline", "Last Name": "Gottlieb", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America ; The Kavli Institute for Brain Science Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2014"}, {"PMID": "24403392", "Title": "Extrafoveal preview benefit during free-viewing visual search in the monkey.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that subjects require less time to process a stimulus at the fovea after a saccade if they have viewed the same stimulus in the periphery immediately prior to the saccade.

Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating and characterizing a similar extrafoveal preview benefit in monkeys during a free-viewing visual search task. We trained two monkeys to report the orientation of a target among distractors by releasing one of two bars with their hand; monkeys were free to move their eyes during the task. Both monkeys took less time to indicate the orientation of the target after foveating it, when the target lay closer to the fovea during the previous fixation. An extrafoveal preview benefit emerged even if there was more than one intervening saccade between the preview and the target fixation, indicating that information about target identity could be transferred across more than one saccade and could be obtained even if the search target was not the goal of the next saccade. An extrafoveal preview benefit was also found for distractor stimuli.

Distractor responses were more strongly suppressed and more closely correlated with performance in the dlPFC relative to LIP. Moreover, reversible inactivation of the dlPFC produced much larger increases in distractibility than inactivation of LIP.
