A major obstacle to elucidating these mechanisms is the lack of experimental approaches that can resolve these interconversions between functionally relevant biomolecular structures. Here, using a nano-electronic device with microsecond time resolution, we dissect the complete set of structural rearrangements executed by an ultra-stable RNA, the UUCG stem-loop, at the single-molecule level. We show that the stem-loop samples at least four conformations along two folding pathways leading to two distinct folded structures, only one of which has been previously observed. By modulating its flexibility, the stem-loop can adaptively select between these pathways, enabling it to both fold rapidly and resist unfolding. This paradigm of stabilization through compensatory changes in flexibility broadens our understanding of stable RNA structures and is expected to serve as a general strategy employed by all biopolymers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sukjin S", "Last Name": "Jang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Korak Kumar", "Last Name": "Ray", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "David G", "Last Name": "Lynall", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth L", "Last Name": "Shepard", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Nuckolls", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruben L", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May27"}, {"PMID": "38712078", "Title": "A dynamic compositional equilibrium governs mRNA recognition by eIF3.", "Abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 3 is a multi-subunit protein complex that binds both ribosomes and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in order to drive a diverse set of mechanistic steps during translation.

Stem-loops are one of the most common RNA structural motifs and serve as building blocks for the formation of complex RNA structures. Given their prevalence and integral role in RNA folding, the kinetics of stem-loop (un)folding has been extensively characterized using both experimental and computational approaches. Interestingly, these studies have reported vastly disparate timescales of (un)folding, which has been interpreted as evidence that (un)folding of even simple stem-loops occurs on a highly rugged conformational energy landscape. Because smFETs do not rely on fluorophore reporters of conformation or mechanical (un)folding forces, they provide a unique approach that has allowed us to directly monitor tens of thousands of (un)folding events of individual stem-loops at a 200 \u03bcs time resolution. Our results show that under our experimental conditions, stem-loops (un)fold over a 1-200 ms timescale during which they transition between ensembles of unfolded and folded conformations, the latter of which is composed of at least two sub-populations. The 1-200 ms timescale of (un)folding we observe here indicates that smFETs report on complete (un)folding trajectories in which unfolded conformations of the RNA spend long periods of time wandering the free-energy landscape before sampling one of several misfolded conformations or the natively folded conformation.

Such heterogeneity manifests as changes and/or differences in the transition rates that are observed within individual signal trajectories or across a population of signal trajectories. Because characterizing kinetic heterogeneity can provide critical mechanistic information, we have developed a computational method that effectively and comprehensively enables such analysis. To this end, we have developed a computational algorithm and software program, hFRET, that uses the variational approximation for Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of a hierarchical hidden Markov model, thereby enabling robust identification and characterization of kinetic heterogeneity. Using simulated signal trajectories, we demonstrate the ability of hFRET to accurately and precisely characterize kinetic heterogeneity. In addition, we use hFRET to analyze experimentally recorded signal trajectories reporting on the conformational dynamics of ribosomal pre-translocation (PRE) complexes. The results of our analyses demonstrate that PRE complexes exhibit kinetic heterogeneity, reveal the physical origins of this heterogeneity, and allow us to expand the current model of PRE complex dynamics.

During the next round of continuous translation, however, we find that ribosomes carrying a P-site peptidyl-D-aa-tRNA partition into subpopulations that are either translationally arrested or that can continue translating. Consistent with its ability to arrest translation, chemical protection experiments and molecular dynamics simulations show that P site-bound peptidyl-D-aa-tRNA can trap the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center in a conformation in which peptidyl transfer is impaired. Our results reveal a novel mechanism through which D-aa-tRNAs interfere with translation, provide insight into how the TM might be engineered to use D-aa-tRNAs, and increase our understanding of the physiological role of a widely distributed enzyme that clears D-aa-tRNAs from cells.", "Keywords": ["D-amino acids", "D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase", "ribosome", "translation arrest"], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Binding Sites", "Chromatography, Thin Layer", "Escherichia coli", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Peptides", "Peptidyl Transferases", "Phenylalanine-tRNA Ligase", "Protein Binding", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Protein Engineering", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "RNA, Transfer", "RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl", "Ribosomes", "Stereoisomerism", "Substrate Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Englander", "Affiliation": "Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Department of Chemistry, and."}, {"First Name": "Joshua L", "Last Name": "Avins", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "Rachel C", "Last Name": "Fleisher", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology."}, {"First Name": "Philip R", "Last Name": "Effraim", "Affiliation": "Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Department of Chemistry, and."}, {"First Name": "Jiangning", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027;"}, {"First Name": "Klaus", "Last Name": "Schulten", "Affiliation": "Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology, Department of Physics, and Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801; and."}, {"First Name": "Thomas S", "Last Name": "Leyh", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461."}, {"First Name": "Ruben L", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; rlg2118@columbia.edu vc114@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; rlg2118@columbia.edu vc114@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2015May12"}, {"PMID": "25882682", "Title": "The emerging role of rectified thermal fluctuations in initiator aa-tRNA- and start codon selection during translation initiation.", "Abstract": "Decades of genetic, biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies suggest that the conformational dynamics of the translation machinery (TM), of which the ribosome is the central component, play a fundamental role in the mechanism and regulation of translation.

The GTP-bound form of IF2 accelerates subunit joining, whereas IF3 antagonizes subunit joining and plays a prominent role in maintaining translation initiation fidelity. The molecular mechanisms through which IF2 and IF3 collaborate to regulate the efficiency of 70S IC formation, including how they affect the dynamics of subunit joining, remain poorly defined. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor the interactions between IF2 and the GTPase-associated center (GAC) of the 50S subunit during real-time subunit joining reactions in the absence and presence of IF3. In the presence of IF3, IF2-mediated subunit joining becomes reversible, and subunit joining events cluster into two distinct classes corresponding to formation of shorter- and longer-lifetime 70S ICs. Inclusion of IF3 within the 30S IC was also found to alter the conformation of IF2 relative to the GAC, suggesting that IF3's regulatory effects may stem in part from allosteric modulation of IF2-GAC interactions. The results are consistent with a model in which IF3 can exert control over the efficiency of subunit joining by modulating the conformation of the 30S IC, which in turn influences the formation of stabilizing intersubunit contacts and thus the reaction's degree of reversibility.", "Keywords": ["70S initiation complex", "GTPase-associated center", "ribosome", "smFRET", "translation initiation"], "MeSH terms": ["Escherichia coli", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer", "Guanosine Triphosphate", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Conformation", "Prokaryotic Initiation Factor-2", "Prokaryotic Initiation Factor-3", "Protein Biosynthesis", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA, Transfer, Met", "Ribosome Subunits, Small, Bacterial", "Ribosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel D", "Last Name": "MacDougall", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Chemistry, 3000 Broadway, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruben L", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Chemistry, 3000 Broadway, New York, NY 10027, USA.

To address this question, we have used ribosome mutagenesis or a ribosome-targeting antibiotic to predictably perturb the dynamics of intersubunit rotation, a structural rearrangement of the ribosome that is essential for the translocation and ejection of ribosome-bound tRNAs during translation. Concomitantly, we have used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to characterize the effects of these perturbations on the dynamics of ribosomal L1 stalk movements and ribosome-bound tRNA reconfigurations, conformational changes that are likewise essential for the translocation and ejection of tRNAs during translation. Together with the results of complementary biochemical studies, our smFRET studies demonstrate that the ribosome uses cooperative conformational changes to maximize and regulate the efficiency with which it translocates and ejects tRNAs during translation. We propose that the ribosome employs cooperative conformational changes to efficiently populate global conformational states that are productive for translation, that translation factors exploit this cooperativity as part of their mechanisms of action, and that antibiotics exploit it to maximize the potency with which they inhibit translation.

This work represents the first example, to our knowledge, in which the detailed molecular mechanism of any ABC-F family protein has been determined and establishes a framework for elucidating the mechanisms of other regulatory translation factors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Models, Biological", "Models, Molecular", "Peptide Chain Elongation, Translational", "Phylogeny", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "RNA, Transfer", "Ribosomes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bo", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gr\u00e9gory", "Last Name": "Bo\u00ebl", "Affiliation": "1] Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

Nonspecific adsorption of fluorophore-labeled biomolecules to the metallic cladding and silica bottoms of nanoapertures, however, remains a critical limitation. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a selective functionalization chemistry whereby the metallic cladding of gold nanoaperture arrays is passivated with methoxy-terminated, thiol-derivatized polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the silica bottoms of those arrays are functionalized with a binary mixture of methoxy- and biotin-terminated, silane-derivatized PEG. This functionalization scheme enables biotinylated target biomolecules to be selectively tethered to the silica nanoaperture bottoms via biotin-streptavidin interactions and reduces the nonspecific adsorption of fluorophore-labeled ligand biomolecules. This, in turn, enables the observation of ligand biomolecules binding to their target biomolecules even under greater than 1 \u03bcM background concentrations of ligand biomolecules, thereby rendering previously impracticable biological systems accessible to single-molecule fluorescence investigations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biopolymers", "Biosensing Techniques", "Gold", "Image Enhancement", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Molecular Imaging", "Refractometry", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Colin D", "Last Name": "Kinz-Thompson", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University , New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Palma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dileep K", "Last Name": "Pulukkunat", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Chenet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Hone", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shalom J", "Last Name": "Wind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ruben L", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS nano", "PubDate": "2013Sep24"}, {"PMID": "23584454", "Title": "Conformational selection of translation initiation factor 3 signals proper substrate selection.", "Abstract": "During translation, initiation factor 3 (IF3) binds to the small (30S) ribosomal subunit and regulates the fidelity with which the initiator tRNA and mRNA start codon substrates are selected into the 30S initiation complex (30S IC). The molecular mechanism through which IF3 promotes the recognition and signaling of correct substrate selection, however, remains poorly defined. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that 30S IC-bound Escherichia coli IF3 exists in a dynamic equilibrium between at least three conformations. We found that recognition of a proper anticodon-codon interaction between initiator tRNA and the start codon within a completely assembled 30S IC selectively shifts this equilibrium toward a single conformation of IF3. Our results strongly support a conformational selection model in which the conformation of IF3 that is selectively stabilized within a completely and correctly assembled 30S IC facilitates further progress along the initiation pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Codon, Initiator", "Escherichia coli", "Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer", "Models, Biological", "Models, Molecular", "Prokaryotic Initiation Factor-3", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Protein Conformation", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA, Transfer, Met", "Ribosome Subunits, Small"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Margaret M", "Last Name": "Elvekrog", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruben L", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature structural & molecular biology", "PubDate": "2013May"}, {"PMID": "26985282", "Title": "Hierarchically-coupled hidden Markov models for learning kinetic rates from single-molecule data.", "Abstract": "We address the problem of analyzing sets of noisy time-varying signals that all report on the same process but confound straightforward analyses due to complex inter-signal heterogeneities and measurement artifacts. In particular we consider single-molecule experiments which indirectly measure the distinct steps in a biomolecular process via observations of noisy time-dependent signals such as a fluorescence intensity or bead position. Straightforward hidden Markov model (HMM) analyses attempt to characterize such processes in terms of a set of conformational states, the transitions that can occur between these states, and the associated rates at which those transitions occur; but require ad-hoc post-processing steps to combine multiple signals. Here we develop a hierarchically coupled HMM that allows experimentalists to deal with inter-signal variability in a principled and automatic way.
