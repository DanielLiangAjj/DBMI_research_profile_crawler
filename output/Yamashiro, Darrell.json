[{"PMID": "38014922", "Title": "Activating Transcription Factor 5 Promotes Neuroblastoma Metastasis by Inducing Anoikis Resistance.", "Abstract": "MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma often presents as a highly aggressive metastatic disease with a poor prognosis. Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is implicated in neural cell differentiation and cancer cell survival. Here, we show that ATF5 is highly expressed in patients with stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, with increased expression correlating with a poorer prognosis. We demonstrated that ATF5 promotes the metastasis of neuroblastoma cell lines in vivo. Functionally, ATF5 depletion significantly reduced xenograft tumor growth and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells to the bone marrow and liver. Mechanistically, ATF5 endows tumor cells with resistance to anoikis, thereby increasing their survival in systemic circulation and facilitating metastasis. We identified the proapoptotic BCL-2 modifying factor (BMF) as a critical player in ATF5-regulated neuroblastoma anoikis. ATF5 suppresses BMF under suspension conditions at the transcriptional level, promoting anoikis resistance, whereas BMF knockdown significantly prevents ATF5 depletion-induced anoikis. Therapeutically, we showed that a cell-penetrating dominant-negative ATF5 peptide, CP-d/n-ATF5, inhibits neuroblastoma metastasis to the bone marrow and liver by inducing anoikis sensitivity in circulating tumor cells. Our study identified ATF5 as a metastasis promoter and CP-d/n-ATF5 as a potential antimetastatic therapeutic agent for neuroblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Anoikis", "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein", "Neuroblastoma", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Activating Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Debarshi", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shuobo", "Last Name": "Boboila", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shunpei", "Last Name": "Okochi", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "James M", "Last Name": "Angelastro", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, California."}, {"First Name": "Angela V", "Last Name": "Kadenhe-Chiweshe", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gonzalo", "Last Name": "Lopez", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Eileen P", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Darrell J", "Last Name": "Yamashiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Cancer research communications", "PubDate": "2023Dec12"}, {"PMID": "37408891", "Title": "Combining immunotherapy with high-dose radiation therapy (HDRT) significantly inhibits tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma.", "Abstract": "The mortality in patients with MYCN-amplified high-risk neuroblastoma remains greater than 50% despite advances in multimodal therapy.

One previously defined, high-risk group of hepatoblastomas is the small cell undifferentiated variant. In light of molecular studies showing SMARCB1 deletion in these tumors, it is now recognized that most small cell, undifferentiated liver tumors represent an aggressive unrelated tumor-the malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT). SMARCB1 is a member of the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and encodes the INI1 protein. The histologic diagnosis of MRT is currently based on INI1 negative immunoreactivity and the presence of rhabdoid morphology. INI1-negative small cell liver tumors lacking classic rhabdoid morphology are often misclassified as small cell undifferentiated hepatoblastomas (SCUD-HB), according to the current classification. Pediatric liver tumors diagnosed between 2003-2017 as SCUD-HB (four cases) or MRT (two cases) were identified from the Columbia University Pathology Department Archives. All tumors were associated with normal or low serum alpha fetoprotein levels, and showed an absence of immunohistochemical staining of hepatocellular markers (Hep-par1, Arginase) and loss of INI1 staining. Two cases were initially diagnosed as MRT, one with prominent rhabdoid morphology, the other with predominant small cell morphology. The remaining four cases with small cell morphology were classified as SCUD-HB. Ancillary molecular studies confirmed the loss of SMARCB1, supporting the diagnosis of MRT in all cases, proving morphology an unreliable criterion. It is critical to eliminate the term INI1-negative hepatoblastoma from the current classification scheme, and classify INI1-negative tumors as MRT, particularly since high-risk HB-chemotherapy regimens are not effective for treating MRT.", "Keywords": ["Hepatoblastoma", "INI1", "Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor (MRT)", "SMARCB1", "small cell Hepatoblastoma", "small cell undifferentiated (SCUD) Hepatoblastoma"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ladan", "Last Name": "Fazlollahi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan J", "Last Name": "Hsiao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manpreet", "Last Name": "Kochhar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Columbia University Irving Medical Center; New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mahesh M", "Last Name": "Mansukhani", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darrell J", "Last Name": "Yamashiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Helen E", "Last Name": "Remotti", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10032, USA."}], "Journal": "Cancers", "PubDate": "2019Dec11"}, {"PMID": "31759078", "Title": "High-Dose Radiation Increases Notch1 in Tumor Vasculature.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to characterize the effects of high-dose radiation therapy (HDRT) on Notch signaling components of the tumor vasculature.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Jagged-1 Protein", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Radiation Dosage", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Receptor, Notch1", "Repressor Proteins", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Debarshi", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sunjay M", "Last Name": "Barton", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Peter W", "Last Name": "Grabham", "Affiliation": "Center for Radiological research, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ariela L", "Last Name": "Rumeld", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shunpei", "Last Name": "Okochi", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Cherease", "Last Name": "Street", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Kadenhe-Chiweshe", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Shuobo", "Last Name": "Boboila", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Darrell J", "Last Name": "Yamashiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York; Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.

Similar to other members of the MYC family of oncoproteins, MYCN (also known as N-Myc) is a transcription factor, and its stability and activity are tightly controlled by ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that N-Myc is a driver of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, therapies that directly suppress N-Myc activity in human tumors are limited. Here we have identified ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7; also known as HAUSP) as a regulator of N-Myc function in neuroblastoma. HAUSP interacts with N-Myc, and HAUSP expression induces deubiquitination and subsequent stabilization of N-Myc. Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of USP7 in neuroblastoma cancer cell lines, or genetic ablation of Usp7 in the mouse brain, destabilizes N-Myc, which leads to inhibition of N-Myc function. Notably, HAUSP is more abundant in patients with neuroblastoma who have poorer prognosis, and HAUSP expression substantially correlates with N-Myc transcriptional activity. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibitors of HAUSP's deubiquitinase activity markedly suppress the growth of MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma cell lines in xenograft mouse models. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a crucial role of HAUSP in regulating N-Myc function in vivo and suggest that HAUSP inhibition is a potential therapy for MYCN-amplified tumors.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Immunoprecipitation", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Neuroblastoma", "Proto-Oncogene Mas", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Ubiquitin Thiolesterase", "Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7", "Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Omid", "Last Name": "Tavana", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dawei", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gonzalo", "Last Name": "Lopez", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debarshi", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Kon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Discovery for Metabolic Disease, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Darrell J", "Last Name": "Yamashiro", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hongbin", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Discovery for Metabolic Disease, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature medicine", "PubDate": "2016Oct"}, {"PMID": "26907918", "Title": "High-Dose, Single-Fraction Irradiation Rapidly Reduces Tumor Vasculature and Perfusion in a Xenograft Model of Neuroblastoma.", "Abstract": "To characterize the effects of high-dose radiation therapy (HDRT) on neuroblastoma tumor vasculature, including the endothelial cell (EC)-pericyte interaction as a potential target for combined treatment with antiangiogenic agents.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Angiography", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Communication", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Lectins", "Mice, Nude", "Neuroblastoma", "Pericytes", "Radiotherapy Dosage", "Random Allocation", "Regional Blood Flow", "Time Factors", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashish", "Last Name": "Jani", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Fauzia", "Last Name": "Shaikh", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sunjay", "Last Name": "Barton", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Callen", "Last Name": "Willis", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Debarshi", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sonia L", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Tom", "Last Name": "Hei", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Angela", "Last Name": "Kadenhe-Chiweshe", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Darrell J", "Last Name": "Yamashiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York;

Transgenic mice with heterozygous loss of Notch1 demonstrated a marked increase in hepatic metastases, indicating that Notch1 signaling acts as metastatic suppressor in the liver microenvironment.

Inhibition of tumor-derived JAG1 signaling activated hepatic stellate cells, increasing their recruitment to vasculature of micrometastases, thereby supporting progression to macrometastases.

However, therapies that inhibit pathological neuron loss could promote tumorigenesis by preventing the physiological death of cancerous cells. To avert this, we targeted the transcriptional upregulation of p21(waf1/cip1) (p21), an endogenous tumor suppressor with neuroprotective and pro-regenerative activity. We identified potential p21 indcuers by screening a FDA-approved drug and natural product small molecule library against hippocampal HT22 cells stably expressing a luciferase reporter driven by the proximal 60bp of the p21 promoter, and tested them for neuroprotection from glutathione depletion mediated oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity to cancer cell lines (DLD-1, Neuro-2A, SH-SY5Y, NGP, CHLA15, CHP212, and SK-N-SH) in vitro. Of the p21 inducers identified, only ciclopirox, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-4-hydroxylase (HIF-PHD) inhibitor, simultaneously protected neurons from glutathione depletion and decreased cancer cell proliferation at concentrations that were not basally toxic to neurons. We found that other structurally distinct HIF-PHD inhibitors (desferrioxamine, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, and dimethyloxalyl glycine) also protected neurons at concentrations that killed cancer cells. HIF-PHD inhibitors stabilize HIF transcription factors, mediating genetic adaptation to hypoxia. While augmenting HIF stability is believed to promote tumorigenesis, we found that chronic HIF-PHD inhibition killed cancer cells, suggesting a protumorigenic role for these enzymes.
