[{"PMID": "38809096", "Title": "Replication Stress in Activated Human NK Cells Induces Sensitivity to Apoptosis.", "Abstract": "NK cells are innate immune effectors that kill virally infected or malignant cells. NK cell deficiency (NKD) occurs when NK cell development or function is impaired and variants in MCM4, GINS1, MCM10, and GINS4 result in NKD. Although NK cells are strongly impacted by mutational deficiencies in helicase proteins, the mechanisms underlying this specific susceptibility are poorly understood. In this study, we induced replication stress in activated NK cells or T cells by chemical and genetic methods. We found that the CD56bright subset of NK cells accumulates more DNA damage and replication stress during activation than do CD56dim NK cells or T cells. Aphidicolin treatment increases apoptosis of CD56bright NK cells through increased pan-caspase expression and decreases perforin expression in surviving cells. These findings show that sensitivity to replication stress affects NK cell survival and function and contributes to NKD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Apoptosis", "Lymphocyte Activation", "DNA Damage", "DNA Replication", "CD56 Antigen", "Stress, Physiological", "T-Lymphocytes", "Cells, Cultured"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicole C", "Last Name": "Guilz", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Yong-Oon", "Last Name": "Ahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Hijab", "Last Name": "Fatima", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Luis Alberto", "Last Name": "Pedroza", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Seungmae", "Last Name": "Seo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh Kumar", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2024Jul01"}, {"PMID": "38805302", "Title": "Induced CD8\u03b1 identifies human NK cells with enhanced proliferative fitness and modulates NK cell activation.", "Abstract": "The surface receptor CD8\u03b1 is present on 20-80% of human (but not mouse) NK cells, yet its function on NK cells remains poorly understood. CD8\u03b1 expression on donor NK cells was associated with a lack of therapeutic responses for leukemia patients in prior studies, thus we hypothesized that CD8\u03b1 may impact critical NK cell functions. Here, we discovered that CD8\u03b1- NK cells had improved control of leukemia in xenograft models, compared to CD8\u03b1+ NK cells, likely due to an enhanced capacity for proliferation. Unexpectedly, CD8\u03b1 expression was induced on approximately 30% of previously CD8\u03b1- NK cells following IL-15 stimulation. These 'induced' CD8\u03b1+ ('iCD8\u03b1+') NK cells had the greatest proliferation, responses to IL-15 signaling, and metabolic activity, compared to those that sustained existing CD8\u03b1 expression ('sustained CD8\u03b1+) or those that remained CD8\u03b1- ('persistent CD8\u03b1-'). These iCD8\u03b1+ cells originated from an IL-15R\u03b2 high NK cell population, with CD8\u03b1 expression dependent on the transcription factor RUNX3. Moreover, CD8A CRISPR/Cas9 deletion resulted in enhanced responses through the activating receptor NKp30, possibly by modulating KIR inhibitory function.

We sought to characterize circulatory NK cells using functional assays, phenotyping, and transcriptomics to elucidate their role in pathology. NK cells from NMOSD patients and MG patients with elevated disease burden exhibited reduced ADCC and CD56dimCD16hi NK cells, along with an elevated frequency of CD56dimCD16dim/- NK cells.

In addition, the expression of different receptors on individual NK cells is highly stochastic, but the reason for these variegated expression patterns is unclear.

Unfortunately, important differences have been observed between murine and human lrNK cells, complicating the extrapolation of data obtained in mice to man. We previously described two NK cell subsets in the porcine liver: A CD8\u03b1high subset, with a phenotype much like conventional CD8\u03b1high NK cells found in the peripheral blood, and a specific liver-resident CD8\u03b1dim subset which phenotypically strongly resembles human lrNK cells. These data suggest that the pig might be an attractive model for studying lrNK cell biology. In the current study, we used RNA-seq to compare the transcriptome of three porcine NK cell populations: Conventional CD8\u03b1high NK cells from peripheral blood (cNK cells), CD8\u03b1high NK cells isolated from the liver, and the liver-specific CD8\u03b1dim NK cells. We found that highly expressed transcripts in the CD8\u03b1dim lrNK cell population mainly include genes associated with the (adaptive) immune response, whereas transcripts associated with cell migration and extravasation are much less expressed in this subset compared to cNK cells. Overall, our data indicate that CD8\u03b1dim lrNK cells show an immature and anti-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, we also observed that the CD8\u03b1high NK cell population that is present in the liver appears to represent a population with an intermediate phenotype. Indeed, while the transcriptome of these cells largely overlaps with that of cNK cells, they also express transcripts associated with liver residency, in particular CXCR6.

Mechanisms of human natural killer cell development have not been fully elucidated, especially the role of signals that drive the spatial localization and maturation of natural killer cells. Cytokines, extracellular matrix components, and chemokines provide maturation signals and influence the trafficking of natural killer cell progenitors to peripheral sites of differentiation. Here we present the latest advances in our understanding of natural killer and innate lymphoid cell development in peripheral sites, including secondary lymphoid tissues (i.e. tonsil).

The CMG helicase is made up of CDC45 \u2013 MCM \u2013 GINS and accessory proteins including MCM10. The CMG helicase plays a critical role in DNA replication by unwinding the double helix and enabling access of polymerases to single-stranded DNA, and thus helicase proteins are active in any proliferating cell. Replication stress, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest are among the cellular phenotypes attributed to loss of function variants in CMG helicase proteins. Despite the ubiquitous function of the CMG helicase, NK cells have an apparent susceptibility to the deficiency of helicase proteins.

Several genetic diseases are caused by mutations in key DNA replication genes; however, it remains unclear whether these genes influence the normal program of DNA replication timing. Similarly, the factors that regulate DNA replication dynamics are poorly understood. To systematically identify trans-acting modulators of replication timing, we profiled replication in 184 cell lines from three cell types, encompassing 60 different gene knockouts or genetic diseases. Through a rigorous approach that considers the background variability of replication timing, we concluded that most samples displayed normal replication timing. However, mutations in two genes showed consistently abnormal replication timing. The first gene was RIF1, a known modulator of replication timing. The second was MCM10, a highly conserved member of the pre-replication complex. Cells from a single patient carrying MCM10 mutations demonstrated replication timing variability comprising 46% of the genome and at different locations than RIF1 knockouts. Replication timing alterations in the mutated MCM10 cells were predominantly comprised of replication delays and initiation site gains and losses. Taken together, this study demonstrates the remarkable robustness of the human replication timing program and reveals MCM10 as a novel candidate modulator of DNA replication timing.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line", "DNA Replication", "DNA Replication Timing", "Humans", "Minichromosome Maintenance Proteins", "Replication Origin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Madison", "Last Name": "Caballero", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tiffany", "Last Name": "Ge", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ana Rita", "Last Name": "Rebelo", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seungmae", "Last Name": "Seo", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sean", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kayla", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Zuccaro", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Radhakrishnan", "Last Name": "Kanagaraj", "Affiliation": "The Francis Crick Institute, London NW1 1AT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dan", "Last Name": "Vershkov", "Affiliation": "The Azrieli Center for Stem Cells and Genetic Research, Department of Genetics, Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Dongsung", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Agata", "Last Name": "Smogorzewska", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Genome Maintenance, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus", "Last Name": "Smolka", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nissim", "Last Name": "Benvenisty", "Affiliation": "The Azrieli Center for Stem Cells and Genetic Research, Department of Genetics, Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Stephen C", "Last Name": "West", "Affiliation": "The Francis Crick Institute, London NW1 1AT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Dieter", "Last Name": "Egli", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amnon", "Last Name": "Koren", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2022Aug25"}, {"PMID": "35344172", "Title": "Quantifying Human Natural Killer Cell Migration by Imaging and Image Analysis.", "Abstract": "Migration is an important function for natural killer cells. Cell motility has implications in development, tissue infiltration, and cytotoxicity, and measuring the properties of natural killer (NK) cell migration using in vitro assays can be highly informative. Many researchers have an interest in studying properties of NK cell migration in the context of genetic mutation, disease, or in specific tissues and microenvironments. Motility assays can also provide information on the localization of proteins during different phases of cell migration. These assays can be performed on different surfaces for migration or coupled with chemoattractants and/or target cells to test functional outcomes or characterize cell migration speeds and phenotypes. NK cells undergo migration during differentiation in tissue, and these conditions can be modeled by culturing NK cells on a confluent bed of stromal cells on glass and imaging cell migration. Alternatively, fibronectin- or ICAM-1-coated surfaces promote NK cell migration and can be used as substrates. Here, we will describe techniques for the experimental setup and analysis of NK cell motility assays by confocal microscopy or in-incubator imaging using commercially available systems.

We demonstrate that neoplastic NK cells are stably, but reversibly, arrested at earlier stages of NK-cell maturation. Genes downregulated in the most epigenetic immature tumors were associated with polycomb silencing along with genomic gain and overexpression of EZH2. ENKTL cells exhibited genome-wide DNA hypermethylation. Tumor-specific DNA methylation gains were associated with polycomb-marked regions, involving extensive gene silencing and loss of transcription factor binding. To investigate therapeutic targeting, we treated novel patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ENKTL with the DNA hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine.

However, her NK cell enumeration showed absent (< 1%) NK cells (CD3\u2212 CD56+ CD16+ by BD Biosciences 6-color TBNK, San Jose, CA). Subsequent testing at a local laboratory identified normal numbers of NK cells (26%), but at this laboratory, NK cells were defined as (CD3\u2212 CD56+ by locally derived reagents).

We find evidence for a major mid-20th century shift in groundwater DIC input from mostly closed- to mostly open-system carbonate dissolution, which we suggest is driven by input of anthropogenic carbonate soil amendments. Crucially, enhanced open-system dissolution, in which DIC equilibrates with soil CO2, fundamentally affects the initial 14C activity of recently recharged groundwater. Conventional 14C dating of deeper SJV groundwater, assuming an open system, substantially overestimates residence time and thereby underestimates susceptibility to modern contamination.

The effector function of NK cells is linked to their ability to migrate to sites of inflammation or damage. Therefore, understanding the factors regulating NK cell migration is of substantial interest. Here, we show that in the absence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, NK cells have reduced capacity to migrate and infiltrate tumors in vivo. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that ankyrin repeat and SOCS Box containing 2 (Asb2) expression was dramatically decreased in Ahr-/- NK cells and that AhR ligands modulated its expression. Further, AhR directly regulated the promoter region of the Asb2 gene. Similar to what was observed with murine Ahr-/- NK cells, ASB2 knockdown inhibited the migration of human NK cells. Activation of AHR by its agonist FICZ induced ASB2-dependent filamin A degradation in NK cells; conversely, knockdown of endogenous ASB2 inhibited filamin A degradation. Reduction of filamin A increased the migration of primary NK cells and restored the invasion capacity of AHR-deficient NK cells.

To understand the mechanism of MCM10-associated disease, we modeled these variants in human cell lines. MCM10 deficiency causes chronic replication stress that reduces cell viability due to increased genomic instability and telomere erosion. Our data suggest that loss of MCM10 function constrains telomerase activity by accumulating abnormal replication fork structures enriched with single-stranded DNA. Terminally-arrested replication forks in MCM10-deficient cells require endonucleolytic processing by MUS81, as MCM10:MUS81 double mutants display decreased viability and accelerated telomere shortening.

The first inherited loss of any functional component of CD4, including soluble CD4, is clinically distinct from any other congenital or acquired CD4 T-cell defect and characterized by compensatory changes in T-cell subsets and functional impairment of B cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells.", "Keywords": ["CD4 deficiency", "double-negative T cells", "immunizations", "recurrent pneumonia"], "MeSH terms": ["Bone Marrow", "CD4 Antigens", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Codon, Initiator", "Cytokines", "Female", "Humans", "Ileum", "Immunity, Innate", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Monocytes", "Mutation, Missense", "Pedigree", "Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational", "Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Lisco", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peying", "Last Name": "Ye", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chun-Shu", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luxin", "Last Name": "Pei", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amy P", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvia Lucena", "Last Name": "Lage", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Addison Jon", "Last Name": "Ward", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephen A", "Last Name": "Migueles", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Megan V", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clarisa M", "Last Name": "Buckner", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Moir", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam", "Last Name": "Rupert", "Affiliation": "Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alina", "Last Name": "Dulau-Florea", "Affiliation": "National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Princess", "Last Name": "Ogbogu", "Affiliation": "Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dylan", "Last Name": "Timberlake", "Affiliation": "Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luigi D", "Last Name": "Notarangelo", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stefania", "Last Name": "Pittaluga", "Affiliation": "National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roshini S", "Last Name": "Abraham", "Affiliation": "Nationwide Children`s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irini", "Last Name": "Sereti", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}], "Journal": "The Journal of infectious diseases", "PubDate": "2021Feb24"}, {"PMID": "33310702", "Title": "Fc \u03b3 receptor IIIa/CD16a processing correlates with the\u00a0expression of glycan-related genes in human natural killer cells.", "Abstract": "Many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies require binding to Fc \u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) for full effect and increasing the binding affinity increases efficacy.

The measured neutron energy spectra of AmLi sources produced by Monsanto Research Corporation have not been found in open literature before and therefore the focus of the study was to obtain the high definition energy distribution of the sources. The initial gamma spectrometry measurements, aimed to estimate the radionuclide content and potential impurities, revealed a significant contamination of the source material with beryllium. Consequent neutron spectrum measurements confirmed beryllium contamination through the presence of a high energy tail contributing up to 17% to the total neutron emission rate. The obtained lithium-only portion of the measured source energy distribution was compared against other AmLi spectra discussed in the past and recent literature. Determination of the total neutron yields of the sources was made with measurements in a neutron well counter.

Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.

Interestingly, whereas NK cell functional maturation from stage 3 and 4A NKDIs was independent of Notch activation, the latter was required for high NKp80 expression and a stage 4B-like phenotype by the NKDI-derived NK cells. The Notch-dependent effects required simultaneous engagement with OP9 stromal cells and were also stage-specific, with NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 receptors regulating stage 3 NKDIs and NOTCH1 primarily regulating stage 4A NKDIs.

We aim to understand how natural killer (NK) cells modulate cell-mediated immunity in humans. We found that human CD14+CD16- monocytes that differentiate into inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) are shaped at the early stages of differentiation by cell-to-cell interactions with NK cells. Although a fraction of monocytes is eliminated by NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, the polarization of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) at the NKp30-stabilized synapses triggers a stable IFN-\u03b3 signature in surviving monocytes that persists after their differentiation into DCs. Notably, NK-cell-instructed DCs drive the priming of type 17 CD8+ T cells (Tc17) with the capacity to produce IFN-\u03b3 and interleukin-17A.

Three NK cell subsets resembled well-described populations; CD56brightCD16-, CD56dimCD16+CD57-, and CD56dimCD16+CD57+. CD56dimCD16+CD57- cells subdivided to include a population with higher chemokine mRNA and increased frequency of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor expression. Three novel human blood NK cell populations were identified: a population of type I interferon-responding NK cells that were CD56neg; a population exhibiting a cytokine-induced memory-like phenotype, including increased granzyme B mRNA in response to IL-2; and finally, a small population, with low ribosomal expression, downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, and high levels of immediate early response genes indicative of cellular activation. Analysis of CMV+ donors established that CMV altered the proportion of NK cells in each subset, especially an increase in adaptive NK cells, as well as gene regulation within each subset. Together, these data establish an unexpected diversity in blood NK cells and provide a new framework for analyzing NK cell responses in health and disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Receptors, KIR", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samantha L", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "The Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, and."}, {"First Name": "Philippa R", "Last Name": "Kennedy", "Affiliation": "The Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, and."}, {"First Name": "Kevin B", "Last Name": "Stacey", "Affiliation": "The Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, and."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Worboys", "Affiliation": "The Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, and."}, {"First Name": "Annie", "Last Name": "Yarwood", "Affiliation": "Centre for Genetics and Genomics Versus Arthritis, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Seungmae", "Last Name": "Seo", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Everardo Hegewisch", "Last Name": "Solloa", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Brandon", "Last Name": "Mistretta", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX; and."}, {"First Name": "Sujash S", "Last Name": "Chatterjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX; and."}, {"First Name": "Preethi", "Last Name": "Gunaratne", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX; and."}, {"First Name": "Kimaada", "Last Name": "Allette", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, and."}, {"First Name": "Ying-Chih", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, and."}, {"First Name": "Melissa Laird", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, and."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "Sebra", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, and."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Amir", "Last Name": "Horowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Oncological Sciences, Precision Immunology Institute, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Wendy", "Last Name": "Thomson", "Affiliation": "Centre for Genetics and Genomics Versus Arthritis, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "The Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, and."}, {"First Name": "Steve", "Last Name": "Eyre", "Affiliation": "Centre for Genetics and Genomics Versus Arthritis, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Daniel M", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "The Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, and."}], "Journal": "Blood advances", "PubDate": "2020Apr14"}, {"PMID": "32125282", "Title": "DNA hypermethylation during tuberculosis dampens host immune responsiveness.", "Abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) has coevolved with humans for millennia and developed multiple mechanisms to evade host immunity. Restoring host immunity in order to improve outcomes and potentially shorten existing therapy will require identification of the full complement by which host immunity is inhibited. Perturbation of host DNA methylation is a mechanism induced by chronic infections such as HIV, HPV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and schistosomiasis to evade host immunity. Here, we evaluated the DNA methylation status of patients with tuberculosis (TB) and their asymptomatic household contacts and found that the patients with TB have DNA hypermethylation of the IL-2/STAT5, TNF/NF-\u03baB, and IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathways. We performed methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-quantitative PCR (MSRE-qPCR) and observed that multiple genes of the IL-12/IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway (IL12B, IL12RB2, TYK2, IFNGR1, JAK1, and JAK2) were hypermethylated in patients with TB. The DNA hypermethylation of these pathways was associated with decreased immune responsiveness with decreased mitogen-induced upregulation of IFN-\u03b3, TNF, IL-6, CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL-1\u03b2 production. The DNA hypermethylation of the IL-12/IFN-\u03b3 pathway was associated with decreased IFN-\u03b3-induced gene expression and decreased IL-12-inducible upregulation of IFN-\u03b3.

This coupling often depends on the function of multidomain scaffolds that orchestrate transient interactions among multiple signaling intermediates and regulatory proteins on organelles. The number of possible scaffold interaction partners and the ability for these interactions to occur at different timescales makes investigations of scaffold functions challenging. This work employs live cell imaging to probe how the multidomain scaffold IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) coordinates the activities of proteins affecting local actin polymerization, membrane processing, and phosphoinositide signaling. Using endosomes that are confined by a local actin network as a model system, we demonstrate that IQGAP1 can transition between different actin and endosomal membrane tethered states. Fast scaffold binding/disassociation transitions are shown to be driven by interactions between C-terminal scaffold domains and Rho GTPases at the membrane. Fluctuations in these binding modes are linked to negative regulation of actin polymerization. Although this control governs core elements of IQGAP1 dynamics, actin binding by the N-terminal calponin homology domain of the scaffold is shown to help the scaffold track the temporal development of endosome membrane markers, implying actin associations bolster membrane and actin coordination. Importantly, these effects are not easily distilled purely through standard (static) co-localization analyses or traditional pathway perturbations methods and were resolved by performing dynamic correlation and multiple regression analyses of IQGAP1 scaffold mutants. Using these capabilities with pharmacological inhibition, we provide evidence that membrane tethering\u00a0is dependent on the activities of the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase in addition to the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. Overall, these methods and results point to a scaffold tethering mechanism that allows IQGAP1 to help control the amplitude of phosphoinositide lipid messenger signaling by coordinating signaling intermediate activities with the development and disassembly of local actin cytoskeletal networks.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "GTP Phosphohydrolases", "Humans", "Lipids", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "ras GTPase-Activating Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nicholaus J", "Last Name": "Trenton", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "R Tyler", "Last Name": "McLaughlin", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas; Graduate Program in Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Satya K", "Last Name": "Bellamkonda", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Tsao", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Rodzinski", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Volker", "Last Name": "Schweikhard", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Michael R", "Last Name": "Diehl", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas; Graduate Program in Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas; Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, Texas.

The current pipeline for investigating NKDs involves the acquisition and clinical assessment of patients with a suspected NKD followed by subsequent in silico, in vitro, and in vivo laboratory research. Evaluation involves initially quantifying NK cells and measuring NK cell cytotoxicity and expression of certain NK cell receptors involved in NK cell development and function. Subsequent studies using genomic methods to identify the potential causative variant are conducted along with variant impact testing to make genotype-phenotype connections.

Heterozygous C-terminal mutations in NFKB2 have been associated with early-onset common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), central adrenal insufficiency and ectodermal dysplasia. Only two previously reported cases have documented decreased natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, and little is known about the role of NF-\u03baB2 in NK cell maturation and function. Here we report a 13-year-old female that presented at 6 years of age with a history of early onset recurrent sinopulmonary infections, progressive hair loss, and hypogamaglobulinemia consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CVID. At 9 years of age she had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia that responded to ganciclovir treatment. Functional NK cell testing demonstrated decreased NK cell cytotoxicity despite normal NK cell numbers, consistent with a greater susceptibility to systemic CMV infection. Research exome sequencing (ES) was performed and revealed a novel de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in NFKB2 (c.2611C>T, p.Gln871*) that was not carried by either of her parents. The variant was Sanger sequenced and confirmed to be de novo in the patient. At age 12, she presented with a reactivation of the systemic CMV infection that was associated with severe and progressive nephrotic syndrome with histologic evidence of pedicellar effacement and negative immunofluorescence. To our knowledge, this is the third NF-\u03baB2 deficient patient in which an abnormal NK cell function has been observed, suggesting a role for non-canonical NF-\u03baB2 signaling in NK cell cytotoxicity. NK cell function should be assessed in patients with mutations in the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway to explore the risk for systemic viral infections that may lead to severe complications and impact patient survival. Similarly NF-\u03baB2 should be considered in patients with combined immunodeficiency who have aberrant NK cell function. Further studies are needed to characterize the role of NF-\u03baB2 in NK cell cytotoxic function.", "Keywords": ["NF-\u03baB2", "NK cell deficiency", "common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)", "nephrotic syndrome", "pituitary deficiency", "primary immunodeficiency", "systemic cytomegalovirus"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alejandra", "Last Name": "Aird", "Affiliation": "Cl\u00ednica Alemana de Santiago, Facultad de Medicina Cl\u00ednica Alemana-Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Macarena", "Last Name": "Lagos", "Affiliation": "Cl\u00ednica Las Condes, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Vargas-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Affiliation": "Section of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer E", "Last Name": "Posey", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zeynep", "Last Name": "Coban-Akdemir", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shalini", "Last Name": "Jhangiani", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunogenetics, Department of Pediatrics, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York Presbyterian, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anaid", "Last Name": "Reyes", "Affiliation": "Section of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Alejandra", "Last Name": "King", "Affiliation": "Cl\u00ednica Alemana de Santiago, Facultad de Medicina Cl\u00ednica Alemana-Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Felipe", "Last Name": "Cavagnaro", "Affiliation": "Cl\u00ednica Alemana de Santiago, Facultad de Medicina Cl\u00ednica Alemana-Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Lisa R", "Last Name": "Forbes", "Affiliation": "Section of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ivan K", "Last Name": "Chinn", "Affiliation": "Section of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "James R", "Last Name": "Lupski", "Affiliation": "Section of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Human Immunobiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Division of Immunogenetics, Department of Pediatrics, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York Presbyterian, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maria Cecilia", "Last Name": "Poli", "Affiliation": "Cl\u00ednica Alemana de Santiago, Facultad de Medicina Cl\u00ednica Alemana-Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in pediatrics", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "31308374", "Title": "Human DEF6 deficiency underlies an immunodeficiency syndrome with systemic autoimmunity and aberrant CTLA-4 homeostasis.", "Abstract": "Immune responses need to be controlled tightly to prevent autoimmune diseases, yet underlying molecular mechanisms remain partially understood.

Patient T cells exhibit impaired regulation of CTLA-4 surface trafficking associated with reduced functional CTLA-4 availability, which is replicated in DEF6-knockout Jurkat cells. Mechanistically, we identify the small GTPase RAB11 as an interactor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DEF6, and find disrupted binding of mutant DEF6 to RAB11 as well as reduced RAB11+CTLA-4+ vesicles in DEF6-mutated cells. One of the patients has been treated with CTLA-4-Ig and achieved sustained remission.

The importance of their homeostasis and function can be demonstrated by the study of patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), which are part of the family of diseases known as inborn defects of immunity. While NK cells are affected in many PIDs in ways that may contribute to a patient's clinical phenotype, a small number of PIDs have an NK cell abnormality as their major immunological defect. These PIDs can be collectively referred to as NK cell deficiency (NKD) disorders and include effects upon NK cell numbers, subsets, and/or functions. The clinical impact of NKD can be severe including fatal viral infection, with particular susceptibility to herpesviral infections, such as cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. While NKD is rare, studies of these diseases are important for defining specific requirements for human NK cell development and homeostasis. New themes in NK cell biology are emerging through the study of both known and novel NKD, particularly those affecting cell cycle and DNA damage repair, as well as broader PIDs having substantive impact upon NK cells. In addition, the discovery of NKD that affects other innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets opens new doors for better understanding the relationship between conventional NK cells and other ILC subsets. Here, we describe the biology underlying human NKD, particularly in the context of new insights into innate immune cell function, including a discussion of recently described NKD with accompanying effects on ILC subsets. Given the impact of these disorders upon human immunity with a common focus upon NK cells, the unifying message of a critical role for NK cells in human host defense singularly emerges.", "Keywords": ["innate lymphoid cell", "natural killer cell", "natural killer cell deficiency", "primary immunodeficiency"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Herpesviridae Infections", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Killer Cells, Natural"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Immunological reviews", "PubDate": "2019Jan"}, {"PMID": "30386947", "Title": "Warts and DADA2: a Mere Coincidence?", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Deaminase", "Adult", "Agammaglobulinemia", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Autoimmunity", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Etanercept", "Genotype", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Phenotype", "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency", "Skin", "Warts"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katrijn", "Last Name": "Arts", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory for Inborn Errors of Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University Hospitals Leuven, KU Leuven, Herestraat 49 -

When inherently defective, it can lead to aberrant immunity resulting in a dysregulated response that can cause autoimmunity and/or autoinflammation. Biallelic or digenic loss-of-function variants in some of the proteasome subunits have been described as causing a primary immunodeficiency disease that manifests as a severe dysregulatory syndrome: chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE). Proteasome maturation protein (POMP) is a chaperone for proteasome assembly and is critical for the incorporation of catalytic subunits into the proteasome. Here, we characterize and describe POMP-related autoinflammation and immune dysregulation disease (PRAID) discovered in two unrelated individuals with a unique constellation of early-onset combined immunodeficiency, inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis, and autoimmunity.

All experiments were performed on human primary immune cells from a longitudinal cohort of recently TB-exposed children.

AIRE-knockdown macrophage-like THP-1 cells exhibited less Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors accumulation, decreased signaling pathway activity at the FS, lower C. albicans phagocytosis, and less lysosome formation.

Actin remodeling at the lytic immunological synapse\u00a0is a critical requirement for multiple facets of cytotoxic function. Activating receptor and integrin signaling leads to the regulated turnover and remodeling of actin, which is required for adhesion, sustained receptor signaling, and ultimately exocytosis. NK cells undergo lytic granule exocytosis in hypodense regions of a pervasive actin network. Although these requirements have been well demonstrated, neither the dynamic regulation of synaptic actin nor its specific function, however, has been determined at a nanoscale level. Here, live-cell super-resolution microscopy demonstrates nanoscale filamentous actin dynamism in NK cell lytic granule secretion. Following cell spreading, the overall content of the branched actin network at an immune synapse is stable over time and contains branched actin fibers and discrete actin foci. Similar actin architecture is generated in cytolytic T\u00a0cells, although the timescale differs from that of NK cells. Individual filament displacement leads to stochastic clearance formation and disappearance, which are independent of lytic granule positioning. Actin dynamism is dependent upon branched network formation mediated by Arp2/3 and contractility generated by myosin IIA.

While this coordination is known to impact cell morphology, motility, cell adhesion, and vesicular traffic, among other functions, the spatiotemporal properties and regulatory mechanisms of IQGAP1 have not been fully resolved. Herein, we describe a series of super-resolution and live-cell imaging analyses that identified a role for IQGAP1 in the regulation of an actin cytoskeletal shell surrounding a novel membranous compartment that localizes selectively to the basal cortex of polarized epithelial cells (MCF-10A). We also show that IQGAP1 appears to both stabilize the actin coating and constrain its growth. Loss of compartmental IQGAP1 initiates a disassembly mechanism involving rapid and unconstrained actin polymerization around the compartment and dispersal of its vesicle contents. Together, these findings suggest IQGAP1 achieves this control by harnessing both stabilizing and antagonistic interactions with actin.

This variant segregated perfectly with the disease and has not been reported in genetic databases. RASGRP1 deficiency was associated in T cells and B cells with decreased phosphorylation of the extracellular-signal-regulated serine kinase ERK, which was restored following expression of wild-type RASGRP1. RASGRP1 deficiency also resulted in defective proliferation, activation and motility of T cells and B cells. RASGRP1-deficient natural killer (NK) cells exhibited impaired cytotoxicity with defective granule convergence and actin accumulation.

In 3 families, we identified 4 children with recurrent infections and varying clinical manifestations including mild neutropenia, impaired wound healing, severe stomatitis with oral stenosis, and death. All patients studied had similar distinctive neutrophil herniation of the nuclear lobes and agranular regions within the cytosol. Chemotaxis and chemokinesis were markedly impaired, but staphylococcal killing was normal, and neutrophil oxidative burst was increased both basally and on stimulation. Neutrophil spreading on glass and cell polarization were also impaired. Neutrophil F-actin was elevated fourfold, suggesting an abnormality in F-actin regulation. Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis identified abnormal actin-interacting protein 1 (Aip1), encoded by WDR1, in patient samples. Biallelic mutations in WDR1 affecting distinct antiparallel \u03b2-strands of Aip1 were identified in all patients. It has been previously reported that Aip1 regulates cofilin-mediated actin depolymerization, which is required for normal neutrophil function. Heterozygous mutations in clinically normal relatives confirmed that WDR1 deficiency is autosomal recessive. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation corrected the immunologic defect in 1 patient. Mutations in WDR1 affect neutrophil morphology, motility, and function, causing a novel primary immunodeficiency.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Child", "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Leukocyte Disorders", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Microfilament Proteins", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Mutation", "Neutrophils", "Pedigree"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Douglas B", "Last Name": "Kuhns", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Danielle L", "Last Name": "Fink", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Uimook", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Host Defenses and."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Sweeney", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Host Defenses and."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Lau", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Debra Long", "Last Name": "Priel", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Dara", "Last Name": "Riva", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Mendez", "Affiliation": "Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD."}, {"First Name": "Gulbu", "Last Name": "Uzel", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra F", "Last Name": "Freeman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth N", "Last Name": "Olivier", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Victoria L", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Robin", "Last Name": "Currens", "Affiliation": "Werner H.

Understanding how signaling activity depends on such distributions and the cellular structures driving them is required for comprehensive insight into signal transduction. In the activation of primary murine T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) signaling intermediates associate with various subcellular structures, prominently a transient, wide, and actin-associated lamellum extending from an interdigitated T cell:APC interface several micrometers into the T cell. While actin dynamics are well established as general regulators of cellular organization, their role in controlling signaling organization in primary T cell:APC couples and the specific cellular structures driving it is unresolved.

Within human peripheral blood, the more mature CD56(dim) NK cell efficiently kills malignant targets at rest, whereas the less mature CD56(bright) NK cells cannot. In this study, we show that resting CD56(bright) NK cells express significantly more phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein when compared with CD56(dim) NK cells. Consistent with this, forced overexpression of PTEN in NK cells resulted in decreased cytolytic activity, and loss of PTEN in CD56(bright) NK cells resulted in elevated cytolytic activity. Comparable studies in mice showed PTEN overexpression did not alter NK cell development or NK cell-activating and inhibitory receptor expression yet, as in humans, did decrease expression of downstream NK activation targets MAPK and AKT during early cytolysis of tumor target cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that PTEN overexpression disrupts the NK cell's ability to organize immunological synapse components including decreases in actin accumulation, polarization of the microtubule organizing center, and the convergence of cytolytic granules. In summary, our data suggest that PTEN normally works to limit the NK cell's PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway activation and the consequent mobilization of cytolytic mediators toward the target cell and suggest that PTEN is among the active regulatory components prior to human NK cells transitioning from the noncytolytic CD56(bright) NK cell to the cytolytic CD56(dim) NK cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunoblotting", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microscopy, Confocal", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Edward L", "Last Name": "Briercheck", "Affiliation": "Medical Scientist Training Program and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;"}, {"First Name": "Rossana", "Last Name": "Trotta", "Affiliation": "The Comprehensive Cancer Center and Arthur G.

"Abstract": "Germline loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) cause immunodeficiency, whereas somatic gain-of-function mutations in STAT3 are associated with large granular lymphocytic leukemic, myelodysplastic syndrome, and aplastic anemia. Recently, germline mutations in STAT3 have also been associated with autoimmune disease. Here, we report on 13 individuals from 10 families with lymphoproliferation and early-onset solid-organ autoimmunity associated with 9 different germline heterozygous mutations in STAT3. Patients exhibited a variety of clinical features, with most having lymphadenopathy, autoimmune cytopenias, multiorgan autoimmunity (lung, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and/or endocrine dysfunction), infections, and short stature. Functional analyses demonstrate that these mutations confer a gain-of-function in STAT3 leading to secondary defects in STAT5 and STAT1 phosphorylation and the regulatory T-cell compartment. Treatment targeting a cytokine pathway that signals through STAT3 led to clinical improvement in 1 patient, suggesting a potential therapeutic option for such patients. These results suggest that there is a broad range of autoimmunity caused by germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutations, and that hematologic autoimmunity is a major component of this newly described disorder.

However, STAT3 activation is a key oncogenic pathway in natural killer (NK)-lineage large granular lymphomas, and we recently reported enhanced proliferation and function of human NK cells activated with IL-21, which signals primarily through STAT3. These IL-21-expanded NK cells also have increased NKG2D expression, which led us to focus our investigation on whether STAT3 regulates NKG2D. In this study, we show that modulation of STAT3 phosphorylation with cytokines and small-molecule inhibitors correlates with NKG2D expression on human NK cells, leading to altered NK-cell degranulation. Moreover, NKG2D expression on murine NK cells having conditional STAT3 ablation is lower than on NK cells from wild-type mice, and human NK cells carrying dominant-negative STAT3 mutations have decreased baseline NKG2D expression and blunted responses to IL-10 and IL-21. Lastly, we show binding of STAT3 to a predicted STAT3 binding site upstream of the NKG2D gene, which is enhanced by IL-10 and IL-21 and decreased by STAT3 inhibition.

Here, we investigated the proximal signaling pathways downstream of the immunotyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) bearing activating receptors. We found that the adaptor molecule SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76) is recruited to microclusters at the plasma membrane in activated NK cells and that this is required for initiation of downstream signaling and multiple NK-cell effector functions in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that 2 types of proximal signaling complexes involving SLP-76 were formed. In addition to the canonical membrane complex formed between SLP-76 and linker for activation of T cells (LAT) family members, a novel LAT family-independent SLP-76-dependent signaling pathway was identified. The LAT family-independent pathway involved the SH2 domain of SLP-76 and adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP). Both the LAT family-dependent and ADAP-dependent pathway contributed to interferon-gamma production and cytotoxicity; however, they were not essential for other SLP-76-dependent events, including phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-related kinase and cellular proliferation. These results demonstrate that NK cells possess an unexpected bifurcation of proximal ITAM-mediated signaling, each involving SLP-76 and contributing to optimal NK-cell function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Amino Acid Transport System y+", "Amino Acid Transport System y+L", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Light Chains", "Interferon-gamma", "Killer Cells, Natural", "MAP Kinase Signaling System", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, Knockout", "NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A", "Neoplasms", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca M", "Last Name": "May", "Affiliation": "Division of Transfusion Medicine and Therapeutic Pathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mariko", "Last Name": "Okumura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chin-Jung", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hamid", "Last Name": "Bassiri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Enjun", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gregory", "Last Name": "Rak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Naomi H", "Last Name": "Philip", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Weiguo", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Baumgart", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kim E", "Last Name": "Nichols", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taku", "Last Name": "Kambayashi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Apr18"}, {"PMID": "23380740", "Title": "Rapid activation receptor- or IL-2-induced lytic granule convergence in human natural killer cells requires Src, but not downstream signaling.", "Abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells participate in host defense by surveying for and ultimately killing virally infected or malignant target cells. NK cell cytotoxicity is a tightly regulated process that proceeds stepwise from adhesion and activation to the secretion of preformed lytic granule contents onto a diseased or stressed cell. We previously characterized rapid dynein-dependent lytic granule convergence to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) as an early, prerequisite step in NK cell cytotoxicity. Although multiple activating receptors can trigger granule convergence, the specific signal or signals responsible remained unknown. Using live cell confocal microscopy, NK cell lytic granule movement after NK cell activation was captured and measured. Using inhibitors of common early signaling mediators, we show that Src kinases are required for lytic granule convergence, but downstream signals that promote actin rearrangement, MTOC polarization, and calcium mobilization are not. Exposure to interleukin 2 was also sufficient to induce lytic granule convergence, which required noncanonical Src-dependent signaling. Thus, NK cell lytic granule convergence, prompted by specific receptor-mediated and soluble cytokine signals, depends on a directly downstream early Src kinase-dependent signal and emphasizes the importance of this step in readying NK cells for cytotoxicity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Actins", "CD18 Antigens", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Dyneins", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Humans", "Interleukin-2", "Janus Kinase 3", "K562 Cells", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymphocyte Activation", "MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microtubule-Organizing Center", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Phospholipase C gamma", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction", "src-Family Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ashley Mentlik", "Last Name": "James", "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Cell Biology and Physiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hsiang-Ting", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Prachi", "Last Name": "Dongre", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gulbu", "Last Name": "Uzel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "Mace", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pinaki P", "Last Name": "Banerjee", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jordan S", "Last Name": "Orange", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Apr04"}, {"PMID": "23380217", "Title": "Defective actin accumulation impairs human natural killer cell function in patients with dedicator of cytokinesis 8 deficiency.", "Abstract": "Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) mutations are responsible for a rare primary combined immunodeficiency syndrome associated with severe cutaneous viral infections, increased IgE levels, autoimmunity, and malignancy.

Here we report an NK cell functional defect in GATA2-deficient patients and extend this genetic lesion to what is considered to be the original NK cell-deficient patient. In most cases, GATA2 deficiency is accompanied by a severe reduction in peripheral blood NK cells and marked functional impairment.
