The use of an evaluative approach in these types of investigations allows the forensic scientist to evaluate the significance of the evidence with regard to two alternative hypothesis. The presence of saliva on an airbag may be the result of the driver coming into contact with it during an impact. Alternatively, the saliva may have transferred to the airbag from another area in the vehicle following its deployment. To address this question and attach significance to this finding, a dataset on the prevalence and persistence of saliva is required, alongside relevant background information on the case. The purpose of this study was to determine if saliva matching the main driver of a vehicle is present in the areas immediately surrounding the driver's section, and also to determine the persistence of saliva in vehicles. Salivary-\u03b1-amylase was detected in 53% of all samples collected from vehicles. Saliva positive samples yielded statistically significantly (p<0.05) more DNA than saliva negative samples. There was no statistical difference in DNA yields from the different areas sampled in the vehicles. The steering wheel was observed to have the greatest number of saliva positive samples (80%). The driver's DNA profile was detected in 72% of the total samples taken. We demonstrated that saliva can persist for at least ten days in vehicles in daily use.

Several recent investigations have found that plaque structure and composition may represent a more direct biomarker of plaque rupture risk compared with the degree of stenosis. In this study, pulse wave imaging was applied in 111 (n\u202f=\u202f11, N\u202f=\u202f13 plaques) patients diagnosed with moderate (>50%) to severe (>80%) carotid artery stenosis to investigate the feasibility of characterizing plaque properties based on the pulse wave-induced arterial wall dynamics captured by pulse wave imaging. Five (n\u202f=\u202f5 patients, N\u202f=\u202f20 measurements) healthy volunteers were also imaged as a control group. Both conventional and high-frame-rate plane wave radiofrequency imaging sequences were used to generate piecewise maps of the pulse wave velocity (PWV) at a single depth along stenotic carotid segments, as well as intra-plaque PWV mapping at multiple depths. Intra-plaque cumulative displacement and strain maps were also calculated for each plaque region. The Bramwell-Hill equation was used to estimate the compliance of the plaque regions based on the PWV and diameter. Qualitatively, wave convergence, elevated PWV and decreased cumulative displacement around and/or within regions of atherosclerotic plaque were observed and may serve as biomarkers for plaque characterization. Intra-plaque mapping revealed the potential to capture wave reflections between calcified inclusions and differentiate stable (i.e., calcified) from vulnerable (i.e., lipid) plaque components based on the intra-plaque PWV and cumulative strain. Quantitatively, one-way analysis of variance indicated that the pulse wave-induced cumulative strain was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the moderately and severely calcified plaques compared with the normal controls. As expected, compliance was also significantly lower in the severely calcified plaques regions compared with the normal controls (p < 0.01). The results from this pilot study indicated the potential of pulse wave imaging coupled with strain imaging to differentiate plaques of varying stiffness, location and composition. Such findings may serve as valuable information to compensate for the limitations of currently used methods for the assessment of stroke risk.", "Keywords": ["Arterial compliance", "Arterial wall elasticity maps", "Arterial wall motion", "Atherosclerosis", "Calcified plaque", "High-frame-rate ultrasound", "Pulse wave imaging", "Pulse wave velocity"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Carotid Arteries", "Carotid Stenosis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pilot Projects", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Ultrasonography"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ronny X", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Ultrasound and Elasticity Imaging Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Iason Z", "Last Name": "Apostolakis", "Affiliation": "Ultrasound and Elasticity Imaging Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Kemper", "Affiliation": "Ultrasound and Elasticity Imaging Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew D J", "Last Name": "McGarry", "Affiliation": "Ultrasound and Elasticity Imaging Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ada", "Last Name": "Ip", "Affiliation": "Ultrasound and Elasticity Imaging Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edward S", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurologic Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "James F", "Last Name": "McKinsey", "Affiliation": "Division of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Interventions, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elisa E", "Last Name": "Konofagou", "Affiliation": "Ultrasound and Elasticity Imaging Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.

Since its introduction to the medical field in the late 1980s, 3D printers have constructed a range of devices, such as dentures, hearing aids, and prosthetics. With the ultimate goals of decreasing healthcare costs and improving patient care and outcomes, neurosurgeons are utilizing this dynamic technology, as well. Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) can be translated into Stereolithography (STL) files, which are then read and methodically built by 3D Printers. Vessels, tumors, and skulls are just a few of the anatomical structures created in a variety of materials, which enable surgeons to conduct research, educate surgeons in training, and improve pre-operative planning without risk to patients. Due to the infancy of the field and a wide range of technologies with varying advantages and disadvantages, there is currently no standard 3D printing process for patient care and medical research. In an effort to enable clinicians to optimize the use of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, we outline the most suitable 3D printing models and computer-aided design (CAD) software for 3D printing in neurosurgery, their applications, and the limitations that need to be overcome if 3D printers are to become common practice in the neurosurgical field.", "Keywords": ["3D printing", "Additive manufacturing", "Computer-aided design", "Fused deposition modeling", "Material jetting", "Neurosurgery", "Solid modeling", "Stereolithography", "Three-dimensional printing"], "MeSH terms": ["Computer-Aided Design", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Neurosurgery", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Software", "Stereolithography", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Josephine U", "Last Name": "Pucci", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center Department of Neurological Surgery, 710 W 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, United States.

In 2015, ninety-nine years after his death, a state funeral was offered to his living family to honor his role in the struggle for Irish independence. However, inaccuracies in record keeping did not allow the bodily remains that supposedly belonged to Kent to be identified with absolute certainty. Using a novel approach based on homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identified these remains to be those of Kent by comparing his genetic data to that of two known living relatives. As the DNA degradation found on Kent's DNA, characteristic of ancient DNA, rendered traditional methods of relatedness estimation unusable, we forced all loci homozygous, in a process we refer to as \"forced homozygote approach\". The results were confirmed using simulated data for different relatedness classes. We argue that this method provides a necessary alternative for relatedness estimations, not only in forensic analysis, but also in ancient DNA studies, where reduced amounts of genetic information can limit the application of traditional methods.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Damage", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Family", "Genetics, Population", "Genome, Human", "Genomics", "Haplotypes", "History, 20th Century", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Ireland", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "White People"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Fernandes", "Affiliation": "School of Archaeology, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Kendra", "Last Name": "Sirak", "Affiliation": "School of Archaeology, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Mario", "Last Name": "Novak", "Affiliation": "School of Archaeology, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Finarelli", "Affiliation": "Earth Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Byrne", "Affiliation": "National Forensic Coordination Office, Garda Technical Bureau, Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, Dublin 8, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Edward", "Last Name": "Connolly", "Affiliation": "Forensic Science Ireland, Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, Dublin 8, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Jeanette E L", "Last Name": "Carlsson", "Affiliation": "School of Biology and Environment Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Edmondo", "Last Name": "Ferretti", "Affiliation": "Area 52 Research Group, School of Biology and Environment Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Ron", "Last Name": "Pinhasi", "Affiliation": "School of Archaeology, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Jens", "Last Name": "Carlsson", "Affiliation": "School of Biology and Environment Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Republic of Ireland."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2017Jan30"}, {"PMID": "28093343", "Title": "Moyamoya and Inflammation.", "Abstract": "More than 50 years have elapsed since moyamoya disease was initially described; however, the disease etiology remains unknown.

In this study, we assessed the intra and inter laboratory variation in DNA mixture interpretation for three European ISO17025-accredited laboratories.

Three main aspects were considered: 1) whether the mixed DNA profiles met the criteria for comparison to a reference profile, 2) the actual result of the comparison between references and DNA profiling data and 3) whether the weight of the DNA evidence could be assessed. Similarity in answers depended mostly on the complexity of the tasks. This study showed less variation within laboratories than between laboratories which could be the result of differences between internal laboratory guidelines and methods and tools available. Results show the profile types for which the three laboratories report differently, which informs indirectly on the complexity threshold the laboratories employ. Largest differences between laboratories were caused by the methods available to assess the weight of the DNA evidence. This exercise aids in training forensic scientists, refining laboratory guidelines and explaining differences between laboratories in court.
