In addition, sCr may require days to reach diagnostic thresholds, yet tubular cells respond with programs of damage and repair within minutes or hours. To detect acute responses to clinically relevant stimuli, we created mice expressing Rosa26-floxed-stop uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (Uprt) and inoculated 4-thiouracil (4-TU) to tag nascent RNA at selected time points. Cre-driven 4-TU-tagged RNA was isolated from intact kidneys and demonstrated that volume depletion and ischemia induced different genetic programs in collecting ducts and intercalated cells. Even lineage-related cell types expressed different genes in response to the 2 stressors. TU tagging also demonstrated the transient nature of the responses. Because we placed Uprt in the ubiquitously active Rosa26 locus, nascent RNAs from many cell types can be tagged in vivo and their roles interrogated under various conditions. In short, 4-TU labeling identifies stimulus-specific, cell-specific, and time-dependent acute responses that are otherwise difficult to detect with other technologies and are entirely obscured when sCr is the sole metric of kidney damage.", "Keywords": ["Chronic kidney disease", "Nephrology"], "MeSH terms": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Animals", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Mice", "RNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tian Huai", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Jacob", "Last Name": "Stauber", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Katherine", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Jacunski", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neal", "Last Name": "Paragas", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miriam", "Last Name": "Callahan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Run", "Last Name": "Banlengchit", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Abraham D", "Last Name": "Levitman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Desanti De Oliveira", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Beenken", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Madeleine S", "Last Name": "Grau", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Edwin", "Last Name": "Mathieu", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Qingyin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Yuanji", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Tejashree", "Last Name": "Gopal", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Nathaniel", "Last Name": "Askanase", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Siddarth", "Last Name": "Arumugam", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering."}, {"First Name": "Sumit", "Last Name": "Mohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Pamela I", "Last Name": "Good", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, and."}, {"First Name": "Jacob S", "Last Name": "Stevens", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Fangming", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, and."}, {"First Name": "Samuel K", "Last Name": "Sia", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering."}, {"First Name": "Chyuan-Sheng", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vivette", "Last Name": "D'Agati", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krzysztof", "Last Name": "Kiryluk", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Tatonetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Barasch", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, and."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2022Mar22"}, {"PMID": "33549589", "Title": "Uromodulin fights UTI with sugars.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["cell signaling", "inflammation", "microbiology"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Sugars", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Uromodulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Beenken", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Department of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.

hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and its anosmia-associated form (Kallmann syndrome [KS]) are genetically heterogeneous. Among the >15 genes implicated in these conditions, mutations in FGF8 and FGFR1 account for ~12% of cases; notably, KAL1 and HS6ST1 are also involved in FGFR1 signaling and can be mutated in CHH. We therefore hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding a broader range of modulators of the FGFR1 pathway might contribute to the genetics of CHH as causal or modifier mutations. Thus, we aimed to (1) investigate whether CHH individuals harbor mutations in members of the so-called \"FGF8 synexpression\" group and (2) validate the ability of a bioinformatics algorithm on the basis of protein-protein interactome data (interactome-based affiliation scoring [IBAS]) to identify high-quality candidate genes. On the basis of sequence homology, expression, and structural and functional data, seven genes were selected and sequenced in 386 unrelated CHH individuals and 155 controls. Except for FGF18 and SPRY2, all other genes were found to be mutated in CHH individuals: FGF17 (n = 3 individuals), IL17RD (n = 8), DUSP6 (n = 5), SPRY4 (n = 14), and FLRT3 (n = 3). Independently, IBAS predicted FGF17 and IL17RD as the two top candidates in the entire proteome on the basis of a statistical test of their protein-protein interaction patterns to proteins known to be altered in CHH. Most of the FGF17 and IL17RD mutations altered protein function in vitro. IL17RD mutations were found only in KS individuals and were strongly linked to hearing loss (6/8 individuals). Mutations in genes encoding components of the FGF pathway are associated with complex modes of CHH inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an oligogenic genetic architecture underlying CHH.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Base Sequence", "Computational Biology", "Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6", "Female", "Fibroblast Growth Factors", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Hypogonadism", "Immunohistochemistry", "Inheritance Patterns", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Male", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Receptors, Interleukin", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Sequence Homology", "Surface Plasmon Resonance"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hichem", "Last Name": "Miraoui", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne in collaboration with Service of Endocrinology, Diabetology, and Metabolism, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Rue du Bugnon 7, Lausanne CH-1005, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Dwyer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gerasimos P", "Last Name": "Sykiotis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lacey", "Last Name": "Plummer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wilson", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bihua", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Beenken", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeff", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tune H", "Last Name": "Pers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Piotr", "Last Name": "Dworzynski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kimberley", "Last Name": "Keefe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marek", "Last Name": "Niedziela", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Taneli", "Last Name": "Raivio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William F", "Last Name": "Crowley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephanie B", "Last Name": "Seminara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Quinton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Virginia A", "Last Name": "Hughes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "Kumanov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jacques", "Last Name": "Young", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Maria A", "Last Name": "Yialamas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janet E", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Guy", "Last Name": "Van Vliet", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Pierre", "Last Name": "Chanoine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Rubenstein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Moosa", "Last Name": "Mohammadi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pei-San", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yisrael", "Last Name": "Sidis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kasper", "Last Name": "Lage", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nelly", "Last Name": "Pitteloud", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "American journal of human genetics", "PubDate": "2013May02"}]
