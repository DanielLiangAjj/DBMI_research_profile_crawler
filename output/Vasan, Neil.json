Globally, the Tyr kinases demonstrate considerable diversity in optimal patterns of residues surrounding the site of phosphorylation, revealing the functional organization of the human Tyr kinome by substrate motif preference. Using this information, Tyr kinases that are most compatible with phosphorylating any Tyr site can be identified. Analysis of mass spectrometry phosphoproteomic datasets using this compendium of kinase specificities accurately identifies specific Tyr kinases that are dysregulated in cells after stimulation with growth factors, treatment with anti-cancer drugs or expression of oncogenic variants. Furthermore, the topology of known Tyr signalling networks naturally emerged from a comparison of the sequence specificities of the Tyr kinases and the SH2 phosphotyrosine\u00a0(pTyr)-binding domains.

Here, we developed a high-throughput approach for high-efficiency and massively parallel adenine and cytosine base-editor screening in primary human T cells. We performed multiple large-scale screens editing 102 genes with central functions in T cells and full-length tiling mutagenesis of selected genes, and read out variant effects on hallmarks of T cell anti-tumor immunity, including activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. We discovered a broad landscape of gain- and loss-of-function mutations, including in PIK3CD and its regulatory subunit encoded by PIK3R1, LCK , AKT1, CTLA-4 and JAK1 . We identified variants that affected several (e.g., PIK3CD C416R) or only selected (e.g. LCK Y505C) hallmarks of T cell activity, and functionally validated several hits by probing downstream signaling nodes and testing their impact on T cell polyfunctionality and proliferation. Using primary human T cells in which we engineered a T cell receptor (TCR) specific to a commonly presented tumor testis antigen as a model for cellular immunotherapy, we demonstrate that base edits identified in our screens can tune specific or broad T cell functions and ultimately improve tumor elimination while exerting minimal off-target activity. In summary, we present the first large-scale base editing screen in primary human T cells and provide a framework for scalable and targeted base editing at high efficiency.

With advances in mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, 90,000 sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation have so far been identified, and several thousand have been associated with human diseases and biological processes3,4. For the vast majority of phosphorylation events, it is not yet known which of the more than 300 protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases encoded in the human genome are responsible3. Here we used synthetic peptide libraries to profile the substrate sequence specificity of 303 Ser/Thr kinases, comprising more than 84% of those predicted to be active in humans. Viewed in its entirety, the substrate specificity of the kinome was substantially more diverse than expected and was driven extensively by negative selectivity. We used our kinome-wide dataset to computationally annotate and identify the kinases capable of phosphorylating every reported phosphorylation site in the human Ser/Thr phosphoproteome. For the small minority of phosphosites for which the putative protein kinases involved have been previously reported, our predictions were in excellent agreement. When this approach was applied to examine the signalling response of tissues and cell lines to hormones, growth factors, targeted inhibitors and environmental or genetic perturbations, it revealed unexpected insights into pathway complexity and compensation. Overall, these studies reveal the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human Ser/Thr kinome, illuminate cellular signalling responses and provide a resource to link phosphorylation events to

Dietary fructose metabolism begins at the epithelium of the small intestine, where fructose is transported by glucose transporter type\u00a05 (GLUT5; encoded by SLC2A5) and phosphorylated by ketohexokinase to form fructose 1-phosphate, which accumulates to high levels in the cell3,4. Although this pathway has been implicated in obesity and tumour promotion, the exact mechanism that drives these pathologies in the intestine remains unclear. Here we show that dietary fructose improves the survival of intestinal cells and increases intestinal villus length in several mouse models. The increase in villus length expands the surface area of the gut and increases nutrient absorption and adiposity in mice that are fed a high-fat diet. In hypoxic intestinal cells, fructose 1-phosphate inhibits the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase to promote cell survival5-7. Genetic ablation of ketohexokinase or stimulation of pyruvate kinase prevents villus elongation and abolishes the nutrient absorption and tumour growth that are induced by feeding mice with high-fructose corn syrup. The ability of fructose to promote cell survival through an allosteric metabolite thus provides additional insights into the excess adiposity generated by a Western diet, and a compelling explanation for the promotion of tumour growth by high-fructose corn syrup.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Survival", "Enzyme Activation", "Female", "Fructokinases", "Fructose", "High Fructose Corn Syrup", "Hypoxia", "Intestinal Absorption", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Lipid Metabolism", "Male", "Mice", "Nutrients", "Pyruvate Kinase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Samuel R", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shakti", "Last Name": "Ramsamooj", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger J", "Last Name": "Liang", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alyna", "Last Name": "Katti", "Affiliation": "Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Pozovskiy", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Vasan", "Affiliation": "Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seo-Kyoung", "Last Name": "Hwang", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Navid", "Last Name": "Nahiyaan", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nancy J", "Last Name": "Francoeur", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emma M", "Last Name": "Schatoff", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jared L", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Manish A", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew J", "Last Name": "Dannenberg", "Affiliation": "Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert P", "Last Name": "Sebra", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lukas E", "Last Name": "Dow", "Affiliation": "Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lewis C", "Last Name": "Cantley", "Affiliation": "Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kyu Y", "Last Name": "Rhee", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus D", "Last Name": "Goncalves", "Affiliation": "Division of Endocrinology, Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. mdg9010@med.cornell.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2021Sep"}, {"PMID": "34259084", "Title": "Treating Alpelisib-Induced Hyperglycemia with Very Low Carbohydrate Diets and Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitors: A Case Series.", "Abstract": "Alpelisib is a \u03b1-selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor approved for treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-), PIK3CA-mutated, advanced breast cancer (ABC).

How tumors co-opt inflammatory signaling while evading immune surveillance remains unknown. Here, we show that the ectonucleotidase ENPP1 promotes metastasis by selectively degrading extracellular cGAMP, an immune-stimulatory metabolite whose breakdown products include the immune suppressor adenosine. ENPP1 loss suppresses metastasis, restores tumor immune infiltration, and potentiates response to immune checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on tumor cGAS and host STING. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type ENPP1, but not an enzymatically weakened mutant, promotes migration and metastasis, in part through the generation of extracellular adenosine, and renders otherwise sensitive tumors completely resistant to immunotherapy. In human cancers, ENPP1 expression correlates with reduced immune cell infiltration, increased metastasis, and resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Thus, cGAMP hydrolysis by ENPP1 enables chromosomally unstable tumors to transmute cGAS activation into an immune-suppressive pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: Chromosomal instability promotes metastasis by generating chronic tumor inflammation. ENPP1 facilitates metastasis and enables tumor cells to tolerate inflammation by hydrolyzing the immunotransmitter cGAMP, preventing its transfer from cancer cells to immune cells.This article is

fusion-positive cancers is largely uncharacterized. In patients with these tumors, we found that TRK xDFG mutations confer resistance to type I next-generation TRK inhibitors designed to maintain potency against several kinase domain mutations. Computational modeling and biochemical assays showed that TRKAG667 and TRKCG696 xDFG substitutions reduce drug binding by generating steric hindrance. Concurrently, these mutations stabilize the inactive (DFG-out) conformations of the kinases, thus sensitizing these kinases to type II TRK inhibitors. Consistently, type II inhibitors impede the growth and TRK-mediated signaling of xDFG-mutant isogenic and patient-derived models. Collectively, these data demonstrate that adaptive conformational resistance can be abrogated by shifting kinase engagement modes. Given the prior identification of paralogous xDFG resistance mutations in other oncogene-addicted cancers, these findings provide insights into rational type II drug design by leveraging inhibitor class affinity switching to address recalcitrant resistant alterations. SIGNIFICANCE: In TRK fusion-positive cancers, TRK xDFG substitutions represent a shared liability for type I TRK inhibitors. In contrast, they represent a potential biomarker of type II TRK inhibitor activity. As all currently available type II agents are multikinase inhibitors, rational drug design should focus on selective type II inhibitor creation.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue

Since the discovery of RAS in the 1960s, numerous studies have elucidated the mechanism of activity, regulation, and intracellular trafficking of the RAS gene products, and of its regulatory pathways. These pathways yielded druggable targets, such as farnesyltransferase, during the 1980s to 1990s. Unfortunately, early clinical trials investigating farnesyltransferase inhibitors yielded disappointing results, and subsequent interest by pharmaceutical companies in targeting RAS waned. However, recent advances including the identification of novel regulatory enzymes (e.g., Rce1, Icmt, Pde\u03b4), siRNA-based synthetic lethality screens, and fragment-based small-molecule screens, have resulted in a \"Ras renaissance,\" signified by new Ras and Ras pathway-targeted therapies that have led to new clinical trials of patients with Ras-driven cancers.

Methods. Fifty-one breast cancers were analyzed, including primary tumor biopsies of 33 stage I-II and 18 stage IV cancers (13 soft tissue, 3 liver, and 2 bone metastases). We assessed 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns in 14 genes often rearranged in cancer for base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The average median sequencing depth was 1,154\u00d7. Results. We observed 158 genomic alterations in 55 genes in 48 of 51 (94%) tumors (mean 3.1, range 0-9). The average number of potentially therapeutically relevant alterations was similar in primary (1.6, range 0-4) and in heavily pretreated metastatic cancers (2.0, range 0-4) (p = .24). The most common actionable alterations were in PIK3CA (n = 9, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K]/mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors), NF1 (n = 7, PI3K/mTOR/mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1-3 (n = 7, PI3K/mTOR/AKT inhibitors), BRCA1/2 (n = 6, poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors), and CCND1,2 and CCNE (n = 8)/cycline dependent kinase (CDK)6 (n = 1) (CDK4/6 inhibitors), KIT (n = 1, imatinib/sunitinib), ALK (n = 1, crizotinib), FGFR1,2 (n = 5, fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors), and EGFR (n = 2, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Our sequencing assay also correctly identified all six cases with HER2 (ERBB2) amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization when tumor content was adequate. In addition, two known activating HER2 mutations were identified, both in unamplified cases. Conclusion. Overall, 84% of cancers harbored at least one genomic alteration linked to potential treatment options.
