Clonal haematopoiesis increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke independently of traditional risk factors1. Among the common genetic variants that give rise to clonal haematopoiesis, the JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) mutation, which increases JAK-STAT signalling, occurs at a younger age and imparts the strongest risk of premature coronary heart disease1,2. Here we show increased proliferation of macrophages and prominent formation of necrotic cores in atherosclerotic lesions in mice that express Jak2VF selectively in macrophages, and in chimeric mice that model clonal haematopoiesis. Deletion of the essential inflammasome components caspase 1 and 11, or of the pyroptosis executioner gasdermin D, reversed these adverse changes. Jak2VF lesions showed increased expression of AIM2, oxidative DNA damage and DNA replication stress, and Aim2 deficiency reduced atherosclerosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of Jak2VF lesions revealed a landscape that was enriched for inflammatory myeloid cells, which were suppressed by deletion of Gsdmd. Inhibition of the inflammasome product interleukin-1\u03b2 reduced macrophage proliferation and necrotic formation while increasing the thickness of fibrous caps, indicating that it stabilized plaques. Our findings suggest that increased proliferation and glycolytic metabolism in Jak2VF macrophages lead to DNA replication stress and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome, thereby aggravating atherosclerosis. Precise application of therapies that target interleukin-1\u03b2 or specific inflammasomes according to clonal haematopoiesis status could substantially reduce cardiovascular risk.", "Keywords": [],

AD TLR3 deficiency can underlie herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE) by impairing cortical neuron-intrinsic type I IFN immunity to HSV-1. TLR3-mutated leukocytes produce normal levels of IFNs in response to IAV. In contrast, TLR3-mutated fibroblasts produce lower levels of IFN-\u03b2 and -\u03bb, and display enhanced viral susceptibility, upon IAV infection. Moreover, the patients' iPSC-derived pulmonary epithelial cells (PECs) are susceptible to IAV. Treatment with IFN-\u03b12b or IFN-\u03bb1 rescues this phenotype. AD TLR3 deficiency may thus underlie IAV-ARDS by impairing TLR3-dependent, type I and/or III IFN-mediated, PEC-intrinsic immunity.

Recessive mutations in some genes implicated in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) cause HPS-associated interstitial pneumonia (HPSIP), a clinical entity that is similar to IPF. We previously reported that HPS1-/- embryonic stem cell-derived 3D lung organoids showed fibrotic changes. Here, we show that the introduction of all HPS mutations associated with HPSIP promotes fibrotic changes in lung organoids, while the deletion of HPS8, which is not associated with HPSIP, does not. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed the upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) in epithelial cells from HPS mutant fibrotic organoids. IL-11 was detected predominantly in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in end-stage IPF, but was expressed more broadly in HPSIP. Finally, IL-11 induced fibrosis in WT organoids, while its deletion prevented fibrosis in HPS4-/- organoids, suggesting IL-11 as a therapeutic target. hPSC-derived 3D lung organoids are, therefore, a valuable resource to model fibrotic lung disease.", "Keywords": ["Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome", "disease modeling", "human pluripotent stem cells", "interleukin-11", "lung", "organoids", "pulmonary fibrosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Carrier Proteins", "Female", "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Hermanski-Pudlak Syndrome", "Humans", "Interleukin-11", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Organoids", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Pulmonary Fibrosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexandros", "Last Name": "Strikoudis", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Critical Care, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Cie\u015blak", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Critical Care, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lucas", "Last Name": "Loffredo", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ya-Wen", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Critical Care, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anjali", "Last Name": "Saqi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Lederer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Willem", "Last Name": "Snoeck", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Human Development, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Allergy, and Critical Care, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Prdm16 is expressed as full-length (fPrdm16) and short (sPrdm16) isoforms, the latter lacking the N-terminal PR domain. The role of both isoforms in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is unclear. We show here that fPrdm16 was critical for HSC maintenance, induced multiple genes involved in GTPase signaling, and repressed inflammation, while sPrdm16 supported B cell development biased toward marginal zone B cells and induced an inflammatory signature. In a mouse model of human MLL-AF9 leukemia, fPrdm16 extended latency, while sPrdm16 shortened latency and induced a strong inflammatory signature, including several cytokines and chemokines that are associated with myelodysplasia and with a worse prognosis in human AML. Finally, in human NPM1-mutant and in MLL-translocated AML, high expression of PRDM16, which negatively impacts outcome, was associated with inflammatory gene expression, thus corroborating the mouse data.

We show that activated lymphocytes yield sibling cells with unequal elimination of aged mitochondria. Disparate mitochondrial clearance impacts cell fate and reflects larger constellations of opposing metabolic states. Differentiation driven by an anabolic constellation of PI3K/mTOR activation, aerobic glycolysis, inhibited autophagy, mitochondrial stasis, and ROS production is balanced with self-renewal maintained by a catabolic constellation of AMPK activation, mitochondrial elimination, oxidative metabolism, and maintenance of FoxO1 activity. Perturbations up and down the metabolic pathways shift the balance of nutritive constellations and cell fate owing to self-reinforcement and reciprocal inhibition between anabolism and catabolism. Cell fate and metabolic state are linked by transcriptional regulators, such as IRF4 and FoxO1, with dual roles in lineage and metabolic choice.

Overexpression and deletion studies, including single-cell transplantation assays, revealed that Mfn2 is specifically required for the maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential, but not, or less so, for the maintenance of myeloid-dominant HSCs. Mfn2 increased buffering of intracellular Ca(2+), an effect mediated through its endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria tethering activity, thereby negatively regulating nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (Nfat). Nfat inhibition rescued the effects of Mfn2 deletion in HSCs, demonstrating that negative regulation of Nfat is the prime downstream mechanism of Mfn2 in the maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential.

Subsequently, lung-biased anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) is specified by sequential inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and Wnt signaling.

In addition, significant advances in the generation of respiratory epithelium from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) now provide a novel and powerful platform for understanding lung development, modeling pulmonary diseases, and implementing drug screening. Finally, breakthroughs have been made in the generation of decellularized lung matrices that can serve as a scaffold for repopulation with respiratory cells derived from either postnatal or PSCs. These studies are a critical step forward towards the still distant goal of stem cell-based regenerative medicine for diseases of lung and airways.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Epithelial Cells", "Epithelium", "Humans", "Respiratory System", "Stem Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael D", "Last Name": "Green", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sarah X L", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hans-Willem", "Last Name": "Snoeck", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology", "PubDate": "2013Mar"}]
