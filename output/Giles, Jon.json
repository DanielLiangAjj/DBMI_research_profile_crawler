Peptidylarginine deiminase IV (PAD4), one of the key enzymatic drivers of citrullination in the RA joint, is expressed by granulocytes and monocytes; however, the subcellular localization and contribution of monocyte-derived PAD4 to the generation of citrullinated autoantigens remain underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that PAD4 displays a widespread cellular distribution in monocytes, including expression on the cell surface. Surface PAD4 was enzymatically active and capable of citrullinating extracellular fibrinogen and endogenous surface proteins in a calcium dose-dependent manner. Fibrinogen citrullinated by monocyte-surface PAD4 could be specifically recognized over native fibrinogen by a panel of eight human monoclonal ACPAs. Several unique PAD4 substrates were identified on the monocyte surface via mass spectrometry, with citrullination of the CD11b and CD18 components of the Mac-1 integrin complex being the most abundant. Citrullinated Mac-1 was found to be a target of ACPAs in 25% of RA patients, and Mac-1 ACPAs were significantly associated with HLA-DRB1 shared epitope alleles, higher C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels, and more erosive joint damage.

HF is preceded subclinically by left ventricular (LV) remodeling in the general population. There is a relative absence of prospective studies following RA patients from pre-clinical to clinical HF as well as prospective studies of LV remodeling in RA without clinical HF. In our study, 158 RA patients without clinical HF were enrolled and underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at baseline and on follow-up between 4 and 6\u00a0years. Extensive characterization of RA disease activity and cardiovascular risk factors were performed. LV remodeling was prevalent at 40% at baseline and increased to 60% over time. Higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL 6) were associated with concentric LV remodeling on follow-up.

In the general population, inflammation is an established independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and much interest is placed on controlling inflammation to reduce cardiovascular events. As inflammation encompasses numerous pathways, the development of targeted therapies in RA provides an opportunity to understand the downstream effect of inhibiting specific pathways on cardiovascular risk. Data from these studies can inform cardiovascular risk management in patients with RA, and in the general population. This Review focuses on pro-inflammatory pathways targeted by existing therapies in RA and with mechanistic data from the general population on cardiovascular risk. Specifically, the discussions include the IL-1, IL-6 and TNF pathways, as\u00a0well as the\u00a0Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathway, and the role of these pathways in RA pathogenesis in the joint alongside the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

However, reports of its use and subsequent fatal arrhythmias in patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have raised concern regarding its cardiovascular (CV) safety. Therefore, we examined the relationship between HCQ use and corrected QT (QTc) length in SLE and RA patients without clinical CV disease (CVD).MethodsOne SLE (n=352) and two RA cohorts (n=178) with electrocardiograms (ECGs) collected as part of study data were analyzed. RA cohort participants were recruited from tertiary referral centers with additional referrals from community rheumatologists, while SLE subjects originated from the Columbia University Lupus Cohort. All patients met American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE or RA, and lacked known CVD. The exposure of interest was HCQ use and main outcome measure was QTc length [continuous or categorical (\u2265440 ms and \u2265500 ms)]. ResultsOf the combined SLE and RA cohorts (n=530), 70% were HCQ users and 44% had a QTc\u2265 440 ms. The adjusted mean QTc length was comparable between HCQ users vs non-users (438 ms vs 437 ms). In multivariable logistic models, HCQ use was not a significant predictor of a QTc\u2265440 ms for the entire cohort (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.48-1.23; p=0.27). Importantly, a QTc\u2265500 ms was inversely associated with HCQ use and not associated with arrhythmias or deaths. A significant interaction was found between HCQ use and use of anti-psychotics. Ultimately, the use of HCQ combined with any QTc prolonging medication as a group was associated with a QTc length (434 ms; 95%CI 430, 439) which was comparable to that of use of HCQ alone (433 ms; 95% CI 429, 437).

Early in the pandemic, several small clinical and in vitro studies from France and China reported on the efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against SARS-CoV-2 infections, which generated global attention towards these decades-old antimalarials (AM) and heralded numerous studies investigating their role in treating COVID-19. Despite several observational studies early in the pandemic affirming their beneficial role in treating COVID-19, 12 clinical studies reported no mortality benefits for CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 patients. The excitement over CQ/HCQ was ultimately quenched after three large randomized clinical trials, the COALITION-I trial in Brazil, the RECOVERY trial in the United Kingdom (UK), and the SOLIDARITY trial from World Health Organization (WHO) consistently reported no beneficial effects for CQ/HCQ in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While initial studies suggested that CQ/HCQ might have a role in treating the early phases of infection, the results from three rigorously designed studies investigating their role in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients were equivocal and inconsistent. Here we review the major social events related to the therapeutic use of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19, and the data from selected clinical studies evaluating their efficacy in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients along with the major safety concerns.", "Keywords": ["Antirheumatic agents", "COVID-19", "Therapeutics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Leila", "Last Name": "Khalili", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jon", "Last Name": "Giles", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yevgeniya", "Last Name": "Gartshteyn", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teja", "Last Name": "Kapoor", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cathy", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tommy", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Theodore", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anca", "Last Name": "Askanase", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ada20@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Rheumatology and therapy", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33932148", "Title": "Testing the Effects of Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs on Vascular Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Rationale and Design of the TARGET Trial.", "Abstract": "Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events relative to the general population, potentially mediated by atherosclerotic plaques that are more inflamed and rupture prone. We sought to address whether RA immunomodulators reduce vascular inflammation, thereby reducing ASCVD risk, and whether such reduction depends on the type of immunomodulator. The TARGET (Treatments Against RA and Effect on 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose [18 F-FDG] Positron Emission Tomography [PET]/Computed Tomography [CT]) trial (NCT02374021) will enroll 150 patients with RA with active disease and an inadequate response to methotrexate. Participants will be randomized to add either a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (etanercept or adalimumab) or sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine to their background methotrexate. Participants will undergo full-body 18 F-FDG-labelled PET scanning at baseline and after 6 months. Efficacy and safety evaluations will occur every 6 weeks, with therapy modified in a treat-to-target approach. The primary outcome is the comparison of change in arterial inflammation in the wall of the aorta and carotid arteries between the randomized treatment groups, specifically, the change in the mean of the maximum target-to-background ratio of arterial 18 F-FDG uptake in the most diseased segment of either the aorta and carotid arteries. A secondary analysis will compare the effects of achieving low disease activity or remission with those of moderate to high disease activity on vascular inflammation. The TARGET trial will test, for the first time, whether RA treatments reduce arterial inflammation and whether such reduction differs according to treatment strategy with either TNF inhibitors or a combination of nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jon T", "Last Name": "Giles", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Pamela M", "Last Name": "Rist", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Katherine P", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Ahmed", "Last Name": "Tawakol", "Affiliation": "Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston."}, {"First Name": "Zahi A", "Last Name": "Fayad", "Affiliation": "Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York."}, {"First Name": "Venkatesh", "Last Name": "Mani", "Affiliation": "Translational and Molecular Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York."}, {"First Name": "Nina P", "Last Name": "Paynter", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Paul M", "Last Name": "Ridker", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Robert J", "Last Name": "Glynn", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Fengxin", "Last Name": "Lu", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Rachel", "Last Name": "Broderick", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Meredith", "Last Name": "Murray", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen M M", "Last Name": "Vanni", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Daniel H", "Last Name": "Solomon", "Affiliation": "Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Joan M", "Last Name": "Bathon", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "ACR open rheumatology", "PubDate": "2021Jun"}, {"PMID": "33844978", "Title": "Adiposity and Interstitial Lung Abnormalities in Community-Dwelling Adults: The MESA Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Obesity is associated with restrictive ventilatory defects and a faster rate of decline in FVC.

These extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities can also contribute to the physical disability and psychological morbidity of RA that lead to reduced quality of life, higher direct and indirect costs, and societal burden of the disease. Although the expansion of RA treatment options and adoption of treat-to-target approaches has reduced the incidence and severity of several nonarticular manifestations of RA, such as rheumatoid vasculitis and cardiovascular disease events, this does not seem to be shared by all RA comorbidities. Moreover, a number of highly prevalent and impactful RA-driven comorbidities, such as accelerated atherosclerosis, interstitial lung disease, and sarcopenia, can present clinically in the years before the manifestation of joint pain or observable synovitis. A larger proportion of patients with RA have atherosclerosis, myocardial dysfunction, interstitial lung disease, and sarcopenia that is subclinical in the preclinical and earliest clinical phases of RA, emphasizing the importance of targeting the pre-RA phase for the prevention of comorbidities that are often poorly responsive to treatment once they develop.

Anti-PAD4 antibodies that cross-react with PAD3 (anti-PAD3/4) have been identified and are associated with severe joint and lung disease. Here, we examined whether anti-PAD2 antibodies were present in patients with RA and defined their clinical significance. Patients and Methods: A PAD2 ELISA was established to screen for anti-PAD2 IgG in sera from RA patients from a prospective observational cohort study (n = 184) and healthy controls (n = 100). RA patient characteristics were compared according to anti-PAD2 antibody status. Multivariable models were constructed to explore the independent associations of anti-PAD2 antibodies with clinical variables. Results: Anti-PAD2 antibodies were found in 18.5% of RA patients and 3% of healthy controls (p < 0.001). Among RA patients, anti-PAD2 antibodies were not associated with traditional genetic or serologic RA risk factors, including HLA-DR\u03b21 shared epitope alleles, ACPA, rheumatoid factor (RF), or anti-PAD3/4 antibodies. In addition, antibodies to PAD2 were associated with fewer swollen joints, a lower prevalence of interstitial lung disease, and less progression of joint damage. In subset analyses in which patients were stratified by the baseline presence of ACPA/RF or anti-PAD3/4 antibodies, anti-PAD2 antibodies provided additional value in identifying patients with the least progressive joint disease.

We tested the hypotheses that: 1) metabolic activity in the amygdala (AmygA), a key center involved in the neurobiological response to stress, associates with subsequent DM risk, and 2) this association is independent of adiposity. AmygA and adipose tissue volumes were measured, and serial blood assessments for DM were obtained in 232 subjects who underwent combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) imaging. Higher baseline AmygA predicted subsequent, new-onset DM, independently of adiposity and other DM risk factors. Furthermore, higher adiposity only increased DM risk in the presence of higher AmygA. In a separate cross-sectional cohort, higher AmygA associated with higher insulin resistance. Accordingly, the current study shows, for the first time, that activity in a stress-responsive neural region predicts the onset of DM. Further, we observed that this neurobiological activity acts independently of, but also synergistically with adiposity to increase DM risk.

Despite this seminal observation, the main focus of research and drug development programs has been cholesterol alone, and inflammation received less attention over time. However, during the past several decades extensive observations supported the importance of inflammation in the development and destabilization of atherosclerosis. Studies in patients affected by rheumatological diseases suggested an interaction between chronic inflammation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Randomized clinical studies with lipid lowering agents suggested that part of the beneficial effect may have been related to reduction in inflammation. More recently, a few studies were designed to directly address the role of anti-inflammatory treatments in reducing risk of atherosclerotic heart disease beyond traditional risk factors. In this article, we review the pathophysiologic contribution of inflammation to atherosclerosis, biomarkers of inflammation and the evidence collected in observational studies regarding the role of chronic inflammation in the development of atherosclerotic heart disease.

Recent studies implicate mucosal surfaces as sites of disease initiation. The common occurrence of periodontal dysbiosis in RA suggests that oral pathogens may trigger the production of disease-specific autoantibodies and arthritis in susceptible individuals. We used mass spectrometry to define the microbial composition and antigenic repertoire of gingival crevicular fluid in patients with periodontal disease and healthy controls. Periodontitis was characterized by the presence of citrullinated autoantigens that are primary immune targets in RA. The citrullinome in periodontitis mirrored patterns of hypercitrullination observed in the rheumatoid joint, implicating this mucosal site in RA pathogenesis. Proteomic signatures of several microbial species were detected in hypercitrullinated periodontitis samples. Among these, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), but not other candidate pathogens, induced hypercitrullination in host neutrophils. We identified the pore-forming toxin leukotoxin A (LtxA) as the molecular mechanism by which Aa triggers dysregulated activation of citrullinating enzymes in neutrophils, mimicking membranolytic pathways that sustain autoantigen citrullination in the RA joint. Moreover, LtxA induced changes in neutrophil morphology mimicking extracellular trap formation, thereby releasing the hypercitrullinated cargo. Exposure to leukotoxic Aa strains was confirmed in patients with RA and was associated with both anticitrullinated protein antibodies and rheumatoid factor. The effect of human lymphocyte antigen-DRB1 shared epitope alleles on autoantibody positivity was limited to RA patients who were exposed to Aa These studies identify the periodontal pathogen Aa as a candidate bacterial trigger of autoimmunity in RA.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans", "Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid",

Many autoantigens are substrates for the protease granzyme B (GrB), but the mechanistic significance of this association is unknown. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is a frequent target of autoantibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a substrate for GrB. RA is strongly associated with specific MHC class II alleles, and elevated levels of GrB and PAD4 are found in the joints of RA patients, suggesting that GrB may alter the presentation of PAD4 by RA-associated class II alleles. In this study, complementary proteomic and immunologic approaches were utilized to define the effects of GrB cleavage on the structure, processing, and immunogenicity of PAD4. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange and a cell-free MHC class II antigen processing system revealed that proteolysis of PAD4 by GrB induced discrete structural changes in PAD4 that promoted enhanced presentation of several immunogenic peptides capable of stimulating PAD4-specific CD4+ T cells from patients with RA. This work demonstrates the existence of PAD4-specific T cells in patients with RA and supports a mechanistic role for GrB in enhancing the presentation of autoantigenic CD4+ T cell epitopes.", "Keywords": ["antigen presentation", "antigen processing", "autoantigen", "autoimmunity", "epitope", "hydrogen\u2212deuterium exchange", "mass spectrometry", "peptidylarginine deiminase", "rheumatoid arthritis", "shared epitope"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Antigen Presentation", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Autoantibodies", "Autoantigens", "Binding Sites", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Case-Control Studies", "Deuterium Exchange Measurement", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "Escherichia coli", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Granzymes", "Humans", "Hydrolases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical", "Protein Conformation, beta-Strand", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein-Arginine Deiminase Type 4", "Protein-Arginine Deiminases", "Proteolysis", "Recombinant Proteins", "Substrate Specificity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erika", "Last Name": "Darrah", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21224, United States."}, {"First Name": "AeRyon", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore Maryland 21205, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xi", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute , Jupiter, Florida 33458, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tatiana", "Last Name": "Boronina", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore Maryland 21205, United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert N", "Last Name": "Cole", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Chemistry, Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Facility, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore Maryland 21205, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Fava", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21224, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jon T", "Last Name": "Giles", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Clifton O", "Last Name": "Bingham III", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21224, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Chalmers", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute , Jupiter, Florida 33458, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patrick R", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Therapeutics, The Scripps Research Institute , Jupiter, Florida 33458, United States."}, {"First Name": "Scheherazade", "Last Name": "Sadegh-Nasseri", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore Maryland 21205, United States."}, {"First Name": "Antony", "Last Name": "Rosen", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21224, United States."}], "Journal": "Journal of proteome research", "PubDate": "2017Jan06"}, {"PMID": "27696788", "Title": "Coronary Artery Calcification and Rheumatoid Arthritis: Lack of Relationship to Risk Alleles for Coronary Artery Disease in the General Population.", "Abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population is characterized by an increased frequency of particular susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

This technique has not been applied to the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population where associated ILD is highly prevalent. The association between cumulative cigarette smoking and volume of areas of high attenuation (HAA: >-600 and <-250 Hounsfield Units) on full inspiratory CT was compared in 172 RA participants and 3,969 controls in a general population sample. Multivariable regression models were used to adjust for demography, anthropometrics, percent emphysema, and CT parameters. The mean cumulative cigarette smoking exposure was 25 (IQR 10-42) and 15(IQR 5-31) pack-years for the RA and non-RA cohorts, respectively. Mean HAA was 153(\u00b157) cm3 and 129(\u00b150) cm3 in the RA and non-RA cohorts, respectively. Each 10 cigarette pack-year increment was associated with a higher HAA by 0.03% (95% CI, 0.007-0.05%) in RA patients and by 0.008% (95% CI, 0.003-0.01%) in those without RA (interaction p = 0.001). Cigarette smoking was associated with higher lung attenuation; with a magnitude of association more pronounced in those with RA than in the general population.

We first discuss the results from comparing the HLA typing of two PsO cohorts: one cohort providing the dermatologic perspective, consisting of patients with PsO without evidence of arthritic disease; and the second cohort providing the rheumatologic perspective, consisting of patients with PsA. We show that these two cohorts differ considerably in their predominant HLA alleles, indicating the heterogeneity of the overall PsO phenotype. Moreover, the genotype of patients in the PsA cohort was shown to be heterogeneous with significant elevations in the frequency of haplotypes containing HLA-B*08, HLA-C*06:02, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*38 and HLA-B*39. Because different genetic susceptibility genes imply different disease mechanisms, and possibly different clinical courses and therapeutic responses, we then review the evidence for a phenotypic difference among patients with PsA who have inherited different HLA alleles. We provide evidence that different alleles and, more importantly, different haplotypes implicated in determining PsA susceptibility are associated with different phenotypic characteristics that appear to be subphenotypes.

The association between lipid measures and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in RA appears to be paradoxical, whereby lower levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and atherogenic ratios are associated with higher CVD risk. This may be due to the lipid-lowering effects of RA-related systemic inflammation. Therefore, standard CVD risk calculators have been shown to underperform in RA. Data also suggest that lipoprotein particle sizes and the apolipoprotein cargo of lipoproteins skew toward atherogenic dyslipidemia in RA and may contribute to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Inflammatory burden in RA may also alter the anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective roles associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Adipose tissue is quantitatively increased in RA patients compared with matched non-RA controls and may be more inflamed and metabolically dysfunctional compared with an otherwise similar non-RA patient. In vitro, animal, and a handful of non-RA human, studies suggest that inflamed, metabolically dysfunctional adipose tissue contributes directly to lower HDL-C levels.
