CSNs modulating forelimb behavior fractionate into caudal forelimb area (CFA) and rostral forelimb area (RFA) motor cortical populations. Despite their prominence, the full diversity of spinal neurons targeted by CFA and RFA CSNs is uncharted. Here, we use anatomical and RNA sequencing methods to show that CSNs synapse onto a remarkably selective group of spinal cell types, favoring inhibitory populations that regulate motoneuron activity and gate sensory feedback. CFA and RFA CSNs target similar spinal neuron types, with notable exceptions that suggest that these populations differ in how they influence behavior. Finally, axon collaterals of CFA and RFA CSNs target similar brain regions yet receive highly divergent inputs.

As mice learn to reach the target, they refine their variable joystick trajectories into controlled reaches, which depend on the sensorimotor cortex.

However, other aspects of movement vigor are also affected in PD; for example, movement sequences are typically shorter. However, the relationship between the activity of DANs and the length of movement sequences is unknown. We imaged activity of SNc DANs in mice trained in a freely moving operant task, which relies on individual forelimb sequences. We uncovered a similar proportion of SNc DANs increasing their activity before either ipsilateral or contralateral sequences. However, the magnitude of this activity was higher for contralateral actions and was related to contralateral but not ipsilateral sequence length. In contrast, the activity of reward-modulated DANs, largely distinct from those modulated by movement, was not lateralized. Finally, unilateral dopamine depletion impaired contralateral, but not ipsilateral, sequence length.

Dopamine release after encountering a reward is critical for reinforcing reward-producing actions1-3. However, it has been challenging to understand how credit is assigned to the exact action that produced the dopamine release during continuous behaviour. Here we investigated this problem in mice using a self-stimulation paradigm in which specific spontaneous movements triggered optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. Dopamine self-stimulation rapidly and dynamically changes the structure of the entire behavioural repertoire. Initial stimulations reinforced not only the stimulation-producing target action, but also actions similar to the target action and actions that occurred a few seconds before stimulation. Repeated pairings led to a gradual refinement of the behavioural repertoire to home in on the target action. Reinforcement of action sequences revealed further temporal dependencies of refinement. Action pairs spontaneously separated by long time intervals promoted a stepwise credit assignment, with early refinement of actions most proximal to stimulation and subsequent refinement of more distal actions. Thus, a retrospective reinforcement mechanism promotes not only reinforcement, but also gradual refinement of the entire behavioural repertoire to assign credit to specific actions and action sequences that lead to dopamine release.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Decision Making", "Dopamine", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Learning", "Optogenetics", "Reinforcement, Psychology", "Reward", "Time Factors", "Models, Psychological", "Models, Neurological"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan C Y", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vitor", "Last Name": "Paixao", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Filipe", "Last Name": "Carvalho", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Artur", "Last Name": "Silva", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Klaus", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Joaquim Alves", "Last Name": "da Silva", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme, Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal."}, {"First Name": "Rui M", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. rui.costa@alleninstitute.org."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2024Feb"}, {"PMID": "37402376", "Title": "Invariant neural dynamics drive commands to control different movements.", "Abstract": "It has been proposed that the nervous system has the capacity to generate a wide variety of movements because it reuses some invariant code.

Here, we test whether invariant dynamics of neural populations are actually used to issue the commands that direct movement. Using a brain-machine interface (BMI) that transforms rhesus macaques' motor-cortex activity into commands for a neuroprosthetic cursor, we discovered that the same command is issued with different neural-activity patterns in different movements. However, these different patterns were predictable, as we found that the transitions\u00a0between activity patterns are governed by the same dynamics across movements. These invariant dynamics are low dimensional, and critically, they align with the BMI, so that they predict the specific component of neural activity that actually issues the next command. We introduce a model of optimal feedback control (OFC) that shows that invariant dynamics can help transform movement feedback into commands, reducing the input that the neural population needs to control movement.

Despite several pharmacological advances in the use of L-DOPA, a high proportion of chronically treated patients continues to suffer disabling involuntary movements, namely, L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). As part of the effort to stop these unwanted side effects, the present study used a rodent model to identify and manipulate the striatal outflow circuitry responsible for LIDs. To do so, optogenetic technology was used to activate separately the striatal direct (D1R- expressing) and indirect (D2R- expressing) pathways in a mouse model of PD. Firstly, D1-cre or A2a-cre animals received unilateral injections of neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to simulate the loss of dopamine observed in PD patients. The effects of independently stimulating each pathway were tested to see if experimental dyskinesias could be induced. Secondly, dopamine depleted A2a-cre animals received systemic L-DOPA to evoke dyskinetic movements. The ability of indirect pathway optogenetic stimulation to suppress pre-established LIDs was then tested. Selective manipulation of direct pathway evoked optodyskinesias both in dopamine depleted and intact animals, but optical inhibition of these neurons failed to suppress LIDs. On the other hand, selective activation of indirect striatal projection neurons produced an immediate and reliable suppression of LIDs. Thus, a functional dissociation has been found here whereby activation of D1R- and D2R-expressing projection neurons evokes and inhibits LIDs respectively, supporting the notion of tight interaction between the two striatal efferent systems in both normal and pathological conditions. This points to the importance of maintaining an equilibrium in the activity of both striatal pathways to produce normal movement. Finally, the ability of selective indirect pathway optogenetic activation to block the expression of LIDs in an animal model of PD sheds light on intrinsic mechanisms responsible for striatal-based dyskinesias and identifies a potential therapeutic target for suppressing LIDs in PD patients.", "Keywords": ["Dyskinesia", "LIDs", "Optogenetics", "Parkinson's disease", "Striatum"], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Levodopa", "Dopamine", "Parkinson Disease", "Dyskinesias", "Corpus Striatum", "Oxidopamine", "Antiparkinson Agents", "Disease Models, Animal"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Iv\u00e1n", "Last Name": "Castela", "Affiliation": "HM-CINAC, (Centro Integral de Neurociencias Abarca Campal), Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain; Network Center for Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid, Spain; PhD Program in Neuroscience, Autonoma de Madrid University, Madrid 28029, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Raquel", "Last Name": "Casado-Polanco", "Affiliation": "HM-CINAC, (Centro Integral de Neurociencias Abarca Campal), Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Yaiza Van-Waes", "Last Name": "Rubio", "Affiliation": "HM-CINAC, (Centro Integral de Neurociencias Abarca Campal), Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Joaquim Alves", "Last Name": "da Silva", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon 1400-038, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Raquel", "Last Name": "Marquez", "Affiliation": "HM-CINAC, (Centro Integral de Neurociencias Abarca Campal), Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain; Network Center for Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Pro", "Affiliation": "HM-CINAC, (Centro Integral de Neurociencias Abarca Campal), Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain; Network Center for Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Rosario", "Last Name": "Moratalla", "Affiliation": "Instituto Cajal-CSIC, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Redgrave", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK."}, {"First Name": "Rui M", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon 1400-038, Spain; Departments of Neuroscience and Neurology, Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9", "Last Name": "Obeso", "Affiliation": "HM-CINAC, (Centro Integral de Neurociencias Abarca Campal), Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain; Network Center for Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid, Spain; Universidad CEU-San Pablo, Madrid, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Ledia F", "Last Name": "Hernandez", "Affiliation": "HM-CINAC, (Centro Integral de Neurociencias Abarca Campal), Hospital Universitario HM Puerta del Sur, HM Hospitales, Madrid, Spain; Network Center for Biomedical Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIBERNED), Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid, Spain; Universidad CEU-San Pablo, Madrid, Spain.

In further analyses of 56 eligible lesion images, while findings should be considered cautiously given the potential for selection bias of published lesion images, right-sided predominance of lesions was confirmed across multiple brain regions, including the temporal lobe, fusiform gyrus and thalamus. These, and several frontal lobe areas, were also identified as preferential lesion sites in comparisons with control lesions. Such pooled-analyses, based on the most comprehensive dataset of lesional mania available to date, confirm a preferential association with right-hemisphere lesions, while suggesting that several brain areas/circuits, relevant to mood regulation, are most frequently affected.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebral Cortex", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mania", "Temporal Lobe"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "J Bernardo", "Last Name": "Barahona-Corr\u00eaa", "Affiliation": "Champalimaud Clinical Centre, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Av.

The activity of VTA dopamine neurons increases significantly after administration of intragastric sucrose, and deletion of the NMDA receptor in these neurons, which affects bursting and plasticity, abolishes lever pressing for postingestive sucrose delivery. Furthermore, lesions of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve significantly impair postingestive-dependent VTA dopamine neuron activity and food seeking, whereas optogenetic stimulation of left vagus nerve neurons significantly increases VTA dopamine neuron activity.

We found that enteric ILC3s display circadian expression of clock genes and ILC3-related transcription factors. ILC3-autonomous ablation of the circadian regulator Arntl led to disrupted gut ILC3 homeostasis, impaired epithelial reactivity, a deregulated microbiome, increased susceptibility to bowel infection and disrupted lipid metabolism. Loss of ILC3-intrinsic Arntl shaped the gut 'postcode receptors' of ILC3s. Strikingly, light-dark cycles, feeding rhythms and microbial cues differentially regulated ILC3 clocks, with light signals being the major entraining cues of ILC3s. Accordingly, surgically or genetically induced deregulation of brain rhythmicity led to disrupted circadian ILC3 oscillations, a deregulated microbiome and altered lipid metabolism.

Foxp2 loss in each region impacted behaviour differently, with striatal and Purkinje cell disruptions affecting the variability and the speed of lever-press sequences, respectively. Mice lacking Foxp2 in Purkinje cells showed a prominent phenotype involving slowed lever pressing as well as deficits in skilled locomotion. In vivo recordings from Purkinje cells uncovered an increased simple spike firing rate and decreased modulation of firing during limb movements. This was caused by increased intrinsic excitability rather than changes in excitatory or inhibitory inputs.

Here, we show that rats and mice can learn to produce arbitrary patterns of neural activity in their primary visual cortex to control an auditory cursor and obtain reward. Furthermore, learning was prevented when neurons in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which receives input from visual cortex, were optogenetically inhibited, but not during inhibition of nearby neurons in the dorsolateral striatum.

Seeking evidence for a neural law of effect, we found that mice learn to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity patterns that trigger optogenetic VTA self-stimulation.

Loss of dopamine neurons (DANs) of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in patients with Parkinson's disease causes deficits in movement initiation and slowness of movement. The role of DANs in self-paced movement has mostly been attributed to their tonic activity, whereas phasic changes in DAN activity have been linked to reward prediction. This model has recently been challenged by studies showing transient changes in DAN activity before or during self-paced movement initiation. Nevertheless, the necessity of this activity for spontaneous movement initiation has not been demonstrated, nor has its relation to initiation versus ongoing movement been described. Here we show that a large proportion of SNc DANs, which did not overlap with reward-responsive DANs, transiently increased their activity before self-paced movement initiation in mice. This activity was not action-specific, and was related to the vigour of future movements. Inhibition of DANs when mice were immobile reduced the probability and vigour of future movements. Conversely, brief activation of DANs when mice were immobile increased the probability and vigour of future movements. Manipulations of dopamine activity after movement initiation did not affect ongoing movements. Similar findings were observed for the initiation and execution of learned action sequences.

Activity in both pathways showed predominantly local but also some long-range correlations. Using a novel approach to cluster and quantify behaviors based on continuous accelerometer and video data, we found that SPN ensembles active during specific actions were spatially closer and more correlated overall. Furthermore, similarity between different actions corresponded to the similarity between SPN ensemble patterns, irrespective of movement speed. Consistently, the accuracy of decoding behavior from SPN ensemble patterns was directly related to the dissimilarity between behavioral clusters.

We disambiguated among these possibilities by investigating how subjects learned de novo to control a brain-machine interface using neurons from motor cortex. We decomposed population activity into the sum of private and shared signals, which produce uncorrelated and correlated neural variance, respectively, and examined how these signals' evolution causally shapes behavior. We found that initially large trial-to-trial movement and private neural variability reduce over learning.
