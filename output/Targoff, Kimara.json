[{"PMID": "37289866", "Title": "Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging.", "Abstract": "Aging is associated with changes in circulating levels of various molecules, some of which remain undefined. We find that concentrations of circulating taurine decline with aging in mice, monkeys, and humans. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and health span in monkeys. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine concentrations correlated with several age-related diseases and taurine concentrations increased after acute endurance exercise. Thus, taurine deficiency may be a driver of aging because its reversal increases health span in worms, rodents, and primates and life span in worms and rodents. Clinical trials in humans seem warranted to test whether taurine deficiency might drive aging in humans.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mice", "Aging", "Cellular Senescence",

Nkx2.5 is a key causative transcription factor associated with human congenital heart disease and one of the earliest markers of cardiac progenitors, thus it serves as a promising candidate.

Moreover, Nkx2.5 targets embedded in these distinct gene regulatory modules coordinate appropriate, multi-faceted injury responses.

The evolutionarily conserved chromatin factor Gon4-like (Gon4l), encoded by the zebrafish ugly duckling (udu) locus, has previously been implicated in cell proliferation, cell survival, and specification of mesoderm-derived tissues including blood and somites, but its role in heart formation has not been studied. Here we report two distinct roles of Gon4l/Udu in heart development: regulation of cell proliferation and maintenance of ventricular identity. We show that zygotic loss of udu expression causes a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte number at one day post fertilization that becomes exacerbated during later development. We present evidence that the cardiomyocyte deficiency in udu mutants results from reduced cell proliferation, unlike hematopoietic deficiencies attributed to TP53-dependent apoptosis. We also demonstrate that expression of the G1/S-phase cell cycle regulator, cyclin E2 (ccne2), is reduced in udu mutant hearts, and that the Gon4l protein associates with regulatory regions of the ccne2 gene during early embryogenesis. Furthermore, udu mutant hearts exhibit a decrease in the proportion of ventricular cardiomyocytes compared to atrial cardiomyocytes, concomitant with progressive reduction of nkx2.5 expression. We further demonstrate that udu and nkx2.5 interact to maintain the proportion of ventricular cardiomyocytes during development. However, we find that ectopic expression of nkx2.5 is not sufficient to restore ventricular chamber identity suggesting that Gon4l regulates cardiac chamber patterning via multiple pathways.

Within the broad vibrational spectra of C-D bonds, we discover lipid-, protein-, and DNA-specific Raman shifts and develop spectral unmixing methods to obtain C-D signals with macromolecular selectivity. DO-SRS microscopy enables us to probe de novo lipogenesis in animals, image protein biosynthesis without tissue bias, and simultaneously visualize lipid and protein metabolism and reveal their different dynamics. DO-SRS microscopy, being noninvasive, universally applicable, and cost-effective, can be adapted to a broad range of biological systems to study development, tissue homeostasis, aging, and tumor heterogeneity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "COS Cells", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Carbon", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Contrast Media", "Deuterium", "Deuterium Oxide", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lipids", "Macromolecular Substances", "Metabolism", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Optical Imaging", "Scattering, Radiation", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lingyan", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chaogu", "Last Name": "Zheng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yihui", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhixing", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edilson S", "Last Name": "Silveira", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Luyuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mian", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chang", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carmen", "Last Name": "de Sena-Tomas", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kimara", "Last Name": "Targoff", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Min", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA. wm2256@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2018Aug06"}, {"PMID": "29361575", "Title": "Nkx genes establish second heart field cardiomyocyte progenitors at the arterial pole and pattern the venous pole through Isl1 repression.", "Abstract": "NKX2-5 is the most commonly mutated gene associated with human congenital heart defects (CHDs), with a predilection for cardiac pole abnormalities.

A rate-limiting step in this crucial signaling pathway is the conversion of immature EDN1 into a mature active form by Endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE1).

We show here that Nkx2.5 is required for proper craniofacial development in zebrafish and acts in part by upregulating ece1 expression.

Unexpectedly, cell ablation shows that the tcf21+; nkx2.5+ PAA progenitors are not required for PAA formation.

However, noninvasive and global visualization of protein metabolism has proven to be highly challenging, especially in live systems. Recently, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy coupled with metabolic labeling of deuterated amino acids (D-AAs) was demonstrated for use in imaging newly synthesized proteins in cultured cell lines. Herein, we significantly generalize this notion to develop a comprehensive labeling and imaging platform for live visualization of complex protein metabolism, including synthesis, degradation, and pulse-chase analysis of two temporally defined populations. First, the deuterium labeling efficiency was optimized, allowing time-lapse imaging of protein synthesis dynamics within individual live cells with high spatial-temporal resolution. Second, by tracking the methyl group (CH3) distribution attributed to pre-existing proteins, this platform also enables us to map protein degradation inside live cells. Third, using two subsets of structurally and spectroscopically distinct D-AAs, we achieved two-color pulse-chase imaging, as demonstrated by observing aggregate formation of mutant hungtingtin proteins. Finally, going beyond simple cell lines, we demonstrated the imaging ability of protein synthesis in brain tissues, zebrafish, and mice in vivo.
