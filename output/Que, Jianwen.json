However, the\u00a0hormone activating estrogen receptor (ERs) \u03b1 can cause major safety concerns due to\u00a0the\u00a0enrichment of ER\u03b1 in female tissues and certain malignancies. In contrast, ER\u03b2 is more broadly\u00a0expressed in metabolic tissues and the skin. Thus, it is desirable to generate selective ER\u03b2 agonist conjugates for maximizing the therapeutic effects of ERs while minimizing the risks of ER\u03b1 activation. Here, we report the design and production of small molecule conjugates containing selective non-steroid ER\u03b2 agonists Gtx878 or genistein. Treatment of aged mice with our synthesized conjugates improved aging-associated declines in insulin sensitivity, visceral adipose integrity, skeletal muscle function, and skin health, with validation in\u00a0vitro. We further uncovered the benefits of ER\u03b2 conjugates in the skin using\u00a0two inducible skin injury mouse models, showing increased skin basal cell proliferation, epidermal thickness, and wound healing.

While the mechanisms by which circulating populations are recruited to infection sites have been extensively characterized, the molecular basis for the recirculation of tissue-resident cells is less understood. Here, we show that helminth infection- or IL-25-induced redistribution of intestinal group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) requires access to the lymphatic vessel network. Although the secondary lymphoid structure is an essential signal hub for adaptive lymphocyte differentiation and dispatch, it is redundant for ILC2 migration and effector function. Upon IL-25 stimulation, a dramatic change in epigenetic landscape occurs in intestinal ILC2s, leading to the expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs). Among the various S1PRs, we found that S1PR5 is critical for ILC2 exit from intestinal tissue to lymph. By contrast, S1PR1 plays a dominant role in ILC2 egress from mesenteric lymph nodes to blood circulation and then to distal tissues including the lung where the redistributed ILC2s contribute to tissue repair. The requirement of two S1PRs for ILC2 migration is largely due to the dynamic expression of the tissue-retention marker CD69, which mediates S1PR1 internalization. Thus, our study demonstrates a stage-specific requirement of different S1P receptors for ILC2 redistribution during infection. We therefore propose a fundamental paradigm that innate and adaptive lymphocytes utilize a shared vascular network frame and specialized navigation cues for migration.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Takamasa", "Last Name": "Ito", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yoshihiro", "Last Name": "Ishida", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yingyu", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Guichard", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wanwei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Guckian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jerold", "Last Name": "Chun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Allen", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph F", "Last Name": "Urban", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuefeng", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May14"}, {"PMID": "38529320", "Title": "Single Cell Analysis of Lung Lymphatic Endothelial Cells and Lymphatic Responses during Influenza Infection.", "Abstract": "Tissue lymphatic vessels network plays critical roles in immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis in response to pathogen invasion, but how lymphatic system per se is remolded during infection is less understood.

Here, employing human bronchial epithelium models generated from tracheal aspirate-derived basal stem cells of neonates and adults, we investigated whether age regulates RSV-epithelium interaction to determine disease severity. We show that following RSV infection, only neonatal epithelium model exhibited cytopathy and mucus hyperplasia, and neonatal epithelium had more robust viral spread and inflammatory responses than adult epithelium. Mechanistically, RSV-infected neonatal ciliated cells displayed age-related impairment of STAT3 activation, rendering susceptibility to apoptosis, which facilitated viral spread. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection of ciliated cells had no effect on STAT3 activation and was not affected by age.

Deletion of p63 results in extensive neuroendocrine differentiation in the developing mouse esophagus and esophageal progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells.

However, the adipose-intrinsic regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, the dynamics of PPAR\u03b3\u00a0acetylation in adipose tissue are shown to orchestrate metabolic oscillation in daily rhythms. Acetylation of PPAR\u03b3 displays a diurnal rhythm in young healthy mice, with the peak at zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) and the trough at ZT18. This rhythmic pattern is deranged in pathological conditions such as obesity, aging, and circadian disruption. The adipocyte-specific acetylation-mimetic mutation of PPAR\u03b3 K293Q (aKQ) restrains adipose plasticity during calorie restriction and diet-induced obesity, associated with proteolysis of a core circadian component BMAL1.

Furthermore, the PPAR\u03b3 acetylation-sensitive downstream target adipsin is revealed as a novel diurnal factor that destabilizes BMAL1 and mediates metabolic rhythms.

In syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck SCCs, NSD1-deficient tumors exhibit immune exclusion and reduced interferon response despite high retrotransposon expression.

The differentiation of tuft cells from EBCs is promoted by Wnt inhibition while suppressed by Notch inhibition. Although progenitor functions have been suggested in other organs, pulmonary tuft cells don't proliferate or give rise to other cell lineages. Consistent with previous reports, Trp63CreERT2 and KRT5-CreERT2-labeled ectopic EBCs do not exhibit alveolar regeneration potential.

Infection with H. pylori can lead to diverse pathological conditions, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and cancer. The latter is the most severe consequence of H. pylori infection. According to epidemiological studies, gastric infection with H. pylori is the strongest known risk factor for non-cardia gastric cancer (GC), which remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, it still remains to be poorly understood how host-microbe interactions result in cancer development in the human stomach. Here we focus on the H. pylori bacterial factors that affect the host ubiquitin proteasome system. We investigated E3 ubiquitin ligases SIVA1 and ULF that regulate p14ARF (p19ARF in mice) tumor suppressor. ARF plays a key role in regulation of the oncogenic stress response and is frequently inhibited during GC progression. Expression of ARF, SIVA1 and ULF proteins were investigated in gastroids, H. pylori-infected mice and human gastric tissues. The role of the H. pylori type IV secretion system was assessed using various H. pylori isogenic mutants. Our studies demonstrated that H. pylori infection results in induction of ULF, decrease in SIVA1 protein levels, and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of p14ARF tumor suppressor. Bacterial CagA protein was found to sequentially bind to SIVA1 and ULF proteins. This process is regulated by CagA protein phosphorylation at the EPIYA motifs. Downregulation of ARF protein leads to inhibition of cellular apoptosis and oncogenic stress response that may promote gastric carcinogenesis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Apoptosis", "Bacterial Proteins", "Carcinogenesis", "Gastric Mucosa", "Helicobacter Infections", "Helicobacter pylori", "Mice", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF", "Ubiquitins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Manikandan", "Last Name": "Palrasu", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Elena", "Last Name": "Zaika", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kodisundaram", "Last Name": "Paulrasu", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ravindran", "Last Name": "Caspa Gokulan", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Giovanni", "Last Name": "Suarez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Wael", "Last Name": "El-Rifai", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Peek", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Monica", "Last Name": "Garcia-Buitrago", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Alexander I", "Last Name": "Zaika", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "35750470", "Title": "Activation of NOTCH signaling via DLL1 is mediated by APE1-redox-dependent NF-\u03baB activation in oesophageal adenocarcinoma.", "Abstract": "Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) arises in the setting of Barrett's oesophagus, an intestinal metaplastic precursor lesion that can develop in patients with chronic GERD.

Inhibition of PARP1 with 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA) or shRNA knockdown reduced the proliferation of ESCCs, accompanied by decreased protein levels of SOX2. RNA sequencing demonstrated that PARP1 inhibition affected multiple signaling pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, 3-ABA synergistically suppressed the growth of ESCC cells when combined with cisplatin, and metformin potentiated the suppressive effect of 3-ABA on ESCC cell growth.

Targeting inflammatory innate immunity pathways holds therapeutic promise, but effective molecular targets remain elusive. Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4) and its mouse homolog, caspase-11 (CASP11), are up-regulated in SARS\u2013CoV-2 infections and that CASP4 expression correlates with severity of SARS\u2013CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS\u2013CoV-2\u2013infected Casp11\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the caspase downstream effector gasdermin-D (Gsdmd\u2212/\u2212). Notably, viral titers were similar regardless of CASP11 knockout. Global transcriptomics of SARS\u2013CoV-2\u2013infected WT, Casp11\u2212/\u2212, and Gsdmd\u2212/\u2212 lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in Casp11\u2212/\u2212 mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and CXCL1, as well as neutrophil functions, were reduced in Casp11\u2212/\u2212 lungs. Additionally, Casp11\u2212/\u2212 lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity. Overall, our results demonstrate that CASP4/11 promotes detrimental SARS\u2013CoV-2\u2013induced inflammation and coagulopathy, largely independently of GSDMD, identifying CASP4/11 as a promising drug

Our results reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein contributes to the viral activation of NF-\u03baB signaling. Nsp14 caused the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. Nsp14 induced the upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8, which also occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. IL-8 upregulation was further confirmed in lung tissue samples from COVID-19 patients. A previous proteomic screen identified the putative interaction of Nsp14 with host Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) protein, which is known to regulate NF-\u03baB signaling. We confirmed the Nsp14-IMPDH2 protein interaction and found that IMPDH2 knockdown or chemical inhibition using ribavirin (RIB) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) abolishes Nsp14-mediated NF-\u03baB activation and cytokine induction. Furthermore, IMDPH2 inhibitors (RIB, MPA) efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that IMDPH2, and possibly NF-\u03baB signaling, is beneficial to viral replication.

Unexpectedly, we have uncovered a previously undescribed pathway promoting mucous metaplasia that involves VEGFa and its receptor KDR. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis coupled with genetic mouse modeling demonstrates that loss of epithelial VEGFa, KDR, or MEK/ERK kinase promotes excessive club-to-goblet transdifferentiation during development and regeneration. Sox9 is required for goblet cell differentiation following Kdr inhibition in both mouse and human club cells. Significantly, airway mucous metaplasia in asthmatic and CF patients is also associated with reduced KDR signaling and increased SOX9 expression.

The incidence of EAC has been rising rapidly during the past four decades. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the main precancerous condition for EAC, where a metaplastic columnar epithelium replaces normal squamous mucosa of the lower esophagus. The primary risk factor for BE and EAC are chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obesity and smoking. During the BE-dysplasia-EAC sequence, esophageal cells are under a tremendous burden of accumulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. While normal cells have intact antioxidant machinery to maintain a balanced anti-tumorigenic physiological response, the antioxidant capacity is compromised in neoplastic cells with a pro-tumorigenic development antioxidant response. The accumulation of ROS, during the neoplastic progression of the GERD-BE-EAC sequence, induces DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. Neoplastic cells adapt to oxidative stress by developing a pro-tumorigenic antioxidant response that keeps oxidative damage below lethal levels while promoting tumorigenesis, progression, and resistance to therapy. In this review, we will summarize the recent findings on oxidative stress in tumorigenesis in the context of the GERD-BE-EAC process. We will discuss how EAC cells adapt to increased ROS.

Previous studies have identified a small number of rare genetic variants causing syndromes associated with EA/TEF. We performed a pilot exome sequencing study of 45 unrelated simplex trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF. Thirteen had isolated and 32 had nonisolated EA/TEF; none had a family history of EA/TEF. We identified de novo variants in protein-coding regions, including 19 missense variants predicted to be deleterious (D-mis) and 3 likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants. Consistent with previous studies of structural birth defects, there is a trend of increased burden of de novo D-mis in cases (1.57-fold increase over the background mutation rate), and the burden is greater in constrained genes (2.55-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.003). There is a frameshift de novo variant in EFTUD2, a known EA/TEF risk gene involved in mRNA splicing. Strikingly, 15 out of 19 de novo D-mis variants are located in genes that are putative target genes of EFTUD2 or SOX2 (another known EA/TEF gene), much greater than expected by chance (3.34-fold, p value\u2009=\u20097.20e-5). We estimated that 33% of patients can be attributed to de novo deleterious variants in known and novel genes. We identified APC2, AMER3, PCDH1, GTF3C1, POLR2B, RAB3GAP2, and ITSN1 as plausible candidate genes in the etiology of EA/TEF.

Lacking effective and targeted therapy contributes to the poor 5-year survival rate. Recent studies showed that about 30% of ESCC cases have high levels of SOX2. Herein, we aim to target this transcription factor with aptamer. We established a peptide aptamer library and then performed an unbiased screening to identify several peptide aptamers including P42 that can bind and inhibit SOX2 downstream target genes. We further found that P42 overexpression or incubation with a synthetic peptide 42 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells. Moreover, peptide 42 treatment inhibited the growth and metastasis of ESCC xenografts in mouse and zebrafish. Further analysis revealed that P42 overexpression led to alternations in the levels of proteins that are important for the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells.

Identifying these interactions is important for the functional analysis of proteins. Previously, we reported the parallel analysis of translated ORFs (PLATO) to couple ribosome display of full-length ORFs with affinity enrichment of mRNA/protein/ribosome complexes for the \"bait\" molecules, followed by the deep sequencing analysis of mRNA. However, the sample processing, from extraction of precipitated mRNA to generation of DNA libraries, includes numerous steps, which is tedious and may cause the loss of materials. Barcoded PLATO (PLATO-BC), an improved platform was further developed to test its application for protein interaction discovery. In this report, we tested the antisera-antigen interaction using serum samples from patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM). Tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21) was identified as a potentially new IBM autoantigen. We also expanded the application of PLATO-BC to identify protein interactions for JQ1, single ubiquitin peptide, and NS5 protein of Zika virus. From PLATO-BC analyses, we identified new protein interactions for these \"bait\" molecules. We demonstrate that Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) binds to JQ1 and their interactions may interrupt the EWSR1 association with acetylated histone H4.

These HIV-1 latent reservoirs remain a major obstacle for clearance of HIV-1. Investigation of host factors regulating HIV-1 latency is critical for developing novel antiretroviral reagents to eliminate HIV-1 latent reservoirs. From our recently accomplished CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA screens, we identified that the histone demethylase, MINA53, is potentially a novel HIV-1 latency-promoting gene (LPG). We next validated MINA53's function in maintenance of HIV-1 latency by depleting MINA53 using the alternative RNAi approach. We further identified that in vitro MINA53 preferentially demethylates the histone substrate, H3K36me3 and that in cells MINA53 depletion by RNAi also increases the local level of H3K36me3 at LTR. The effort to map the downstream effectors unraveled that H3K36me3 has the cross-talk with another epigenetic mark H4K16ac, mediated by KAT8 that recognizes the methylated H3K36 and acetylated H4K16. Removing the MINA53-mediated latency mechanisms could benefit the reversal of post-integrated latent HIV-1 proviruses for purging of reservoir cells. We further demonstrated that a pan jumonji histone demethylase inhibitor, JIB-04, inhibits MINA53-mediated demethylation of H3K36me3, and JIB-04 synergizes with other latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to reactivate latent HIV-1.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aminopyridines", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cells, Cultured", "Demethylation", "Dioxygenases", "Gene Expression Regulation, Viral", "HEK293 Cells", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors", "Histone Demethylases", "Histones", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Hydrazones", "Methylation", "Nuclear Proteins", "RNA Interference", "Virus Latency"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huachao", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Weili", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maxime", "Last Name": "Jean", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guillaume", "Last Name": "Fiches", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dawei", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tsuyoshi", "Last Name": "Hayashi", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Netty", "Last Name": "Santoso", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA."}], "Journal": "Nucleic acids research", "PubDate": "2019Aug22"}, {"PMID": "31125642", "Title": "Etiology, cancer stem cells and potential diagnostic biomarkers for esophageal cancer.", "Abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) has been a leading cause of cancer death worldwide in part due to late detection and lack of precision treatment.

In response to regenerative stimuli, SCs in the intestinal epithelium of the fly and in the tracheal epithelium of mice exhibit transient activation of TOR signaling. Although this activation is required for SCs to rapidly proliferate in response to damage, repeated rounds of damage lead to SC loss.

Here, we demonstrate that Notch1 activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are coupled to promote SCC tumor initiation in concert with transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 present in the tumor microenvironment. We find that TGF\u03b2 activates the transcription factor ZEB1 to repress Notch3, thereby limiting terminal differentiation. Concurrently, TGF\u03b2 drives Notch1-mediated EMT to generate tumor initiating cells characterized by high CD44 expression.

several organ systems, the transitional zone between different types of epithelium is a hotspot for pre-neoplastic metaplasia and malignancy, but the cells of origin for these metaplastic epithelia and subsequent malignancies remain unknown. In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63+KRT5+KRT7+) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63+KRT5+KRT7+ basal cells in this zone are the

In the presence of cART, viral reservoirs remain latent, impeding the cure of HIV-1/AIDS. Recently, latency-reversing agents (LRAs) have been developed with the intent of purging latent HIV-1, providing an intriguing strategy for the eradication of the residual viral reservoirs. Our earlier studies show that the first-generation, methyl-triazolo bromodomain, and extra-terminal domain inhibitor (BETi), JQ1, facilitates the reversal of HIV-1 latency. BETis have emerged as a new class of compounds that are promising for this HIV-1 \"shock and kill\" eradication approach. However, when used as a single drug, JQ1 only modestly reverses HIV-1 latency, which complicates studying the underlining mechanisms. Meanwhile, it has been widely discussed that the induction of latent proviruses is stochastic (Ho et al., 2013). Thus, new BETis are currently under active development with focus on improving potency, ease of synthesis and structural diversity. Using fluorous-tagged multicomponent reactions, we developed a novel second-generation, 3,5-dimethylisoxazole BETi based on an imidazo[1,2-a] pyrazine scaffold, UMB-32. Furthermore, we screened 37 UMB-32 derivatives and identified that one, UMB-136, reactivates HIV-1 in multiple cell models of HIV-1 latency with better efficiency than either JQ1 or UMB-32. UMB-136 enhances HIV-1 transcription and increases viral production through the release of P-TEFb. Importantly, UMB-136 enhances the latency-reversing effects of PKC agonists (prostratin, bryostatin-1) in CD8-depleted PBMCs containing latent viral reservoirs. Our results illustrate that structurally improved BETis, such as UMB-136, may be useful as promising LRAs for HIV-1 eradication.", "Keywords": ["BETi", "BRD4", "HIV-1", "JQ1", "LRA", "UMB-136", "latency", "reactivation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Huachao", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Shuai", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts BostonBoston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maxime", "Last Name": "Jean", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sydney", "Last Name": "Simpson", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "He", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology, Stony Brook UniversityStony Brook, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Merkley", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tsuyoshi", "Last Name": "Hayashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Weili", "Last Name": "Kong", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Irene", "Last Name": "Rodr\u00edguez-S\u00e1nchez", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xiaofeng", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts BostonBoston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hailemichael O", "Last Name": "Yosief", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts BostonBoston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hongyu", "Last Name": "Miao", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science CenterHouston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical CenterNew York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "James J", "Last Name": "Kobie", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Bradner", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer InstituteBoston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Netty G", "Last Name": "Santoso", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts BostonBoston, MA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jian", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester Medical CenterRochester, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in microbiology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28583825", "Title": "A Summary of the 2016 James W.

The G-protein coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5) has been associated with the development of gastrointestinal cancer. However, little is known regarding the role of TGR5 in esophageal carcinoma and precancerous lesions. We analyzed genomic DNA from 116 EACs for copy number aberrations via Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarrays. The TGR5 gene locus was amplified in 12.7% (14/116) of the EACs. The TGR5 protein expression was also assessed using immunohistochemistry from tissue microarrays, including Barrett's esophagus (BE), low-(LGD) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), columnar cell metaplasia (CM), squamous epithelium (SE), EAC and squamous cell carcinoma. The TGR5 protein was highly expressed in 71% of EAC (75/106), 100% of HGD (11/11), 72% of LGD (13/18), 66% of BE (23/35), 84% of CM (52/62), and 36% of SE (30/83). The patients with high expression of TGR5 exhibited significantly worse overall survival compared to the patients with nonhigh expression. TGR5 high expression was significantly increased in the males compared to the females in all cases with an odds ratio of 1.9 times. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) was significantly correlated with TGR5 expression. Our findings indicated that TGR5 may play an important role in the development and prognosis of EAC through a bile acid ligand. Gender differences in TGR5 and VDR expression may explain why males have a higher incidence of EAC compared to females.", "Keywords": ["Barrett\u2019s esophagus", "TGR5", "amplification", "bile acid receptor", "esophageal adenocarcinoma"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chunhong", "Last Name": "Pang", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "LaLonde", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY."}, {"First Name": "Tony E", "Last Name": "Godfrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Development; Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tong Tong", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY."}, {"First Name": "Zhongren", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine."}], "Journal": "Clinical and experimental gastroenterology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "28007661", "Title": "Development and stem cells of the esophagus.", "Abstract": "The esophagus is derived from the anterior portion of the developmental intermediate foregut, a structure that also gives rise to other organs including the trachea, lung, and stomach.

Here, we show that the distal-most of these subdomains, the distal cap, is marked by expression of the transcription factor Hand1 (H1) and gives rise to the ectomesenchymal derivatives of the lower incisors. We uncover a H1 enhancer sufficient to drive reporter gene expression within the crNCCs of the distal cap. We show that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling and the transcription factor HAND2 (H2) synergistically regulate H1 distal cap expression.

Disruption of this balance is associated with pathological conditions, including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), in which basal progenitor cells become hyperplastic upon proinflammatory stimulation. However, how basal cells respond to the inflammatory environment at the molecular level remains undetermined. We previously reported that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is critical for epithelial morphogenesis in the embryonic esophagus. Here, we address how this pathway regulates tissue homeostasis and EoE development in the adult esophagus. BMP signaling was specifically activated in differentiated squamous epithelium, but not in basal progenitor cells, which express the BMP antagonist follistatin. Previous reports indicate that increased BMP activity promotes Barrett's intestinal differentiation; however, in mice, basal progenitor cell-specific expression of constitutively active BMP promoted squamous differentiation. Moreover, BMP activation increased intracellular ROS levels, initiating an NRF2-mediated oxidative response during basal progenitor cell differentiation. In both a mouse EoE model and human biopsies, reduced squamous differentiation was associated with high levels of follistatin and disrupted BMP/NRF2 pathways. We therefore propose a model in which normal squamous differentiation of basal progenitor cells is mediated by BMP-driven NRF2 activation and basal cell hyperplasia is promoted by disruption of BMP signaling in EoE.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I", "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Eosinophilic Esophagitis", "Epithelial Cells", "Esophagus", "Follistatin", "Genes, Reporter", "Humans", "Hyperplasia", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Morphogenesis", "NF-E2-Related Factor 2", "Oxidative Stress", "Protein Precursors", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Wei-Yao", "Last Name": "Ku", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhongren", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Evan S", "Last Name": "Dellon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gary W", "Last Name": "Falk", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hiroshi", "Last Name": "Nakagawa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mei-Lun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kuancan", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David A", "Last Name": "Katzka", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey H", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Xiaopeng", "Last Name": "Lan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jianwen", "Last Name": "Que", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2015Apr"}, {"PMID": "25727889", "Title": "The initial establishment and epithelial morphogenesis of the esophagus: a new model of tracheal-esophageal separation and transition of simple columnar into stratified squamous epithelium in the developing esophagus.", "Abstract": "The esophagus and trachea are tubular organs that initially share a single common lumen in the anterior foregut.

Using ChIP-seq analysis, we compared SOX2-regulated gene profiles in multiple SCC cell lines to ES cell profiles and determined that SOX2 binds to distinct genomic loci in SCCs. In SCCs, SOX2 preferentially interacts with the transcription factor p63, as opposed to the transcription factor OCT4, which is the preferred SOX2 binding partner in ES cells. SOX2 and p63 exhibited overlapping genomic occupancy at a large number of loci in SCCs; however, coordinate binding of SOX2 and p63 was absent in ES cells. We further demonstrated that SOX2 and p63 jointly regulate gene expression, including the oncogene ETV4, which was essential for SOX2-amplified SCC cell survival. Together, these findings demonstrate that the action of SOX2 in SCC differs substantially from its role in pluripotency.

Deletion of epithelial Gpr177 reduces Wnt signaling activity in both the epithelium and mesenchyme, resulting in severe hemorrhage and abnormal vasculature, accompanied by branching defects and abnormal epithelial differentiation. We then used multiple mouse models to demonstrate that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is not only required for the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchyme, but also is important for the maintenance of smooth muscle cells through the regulation of the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (Klf2).
