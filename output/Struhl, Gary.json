Both proteins are produced by defined subpopulations of cells and spread outwards, forming gradients that control gene expression and cell pattern as a function of concentration. They also control growth, but how is unknown. Most studies have focused on Dpp and yielded disparate models in which cells throughout the wing grow at similar rates in response to the grade or temporal change in Dpp concentration or to the different amounts of Dpp \"equalized\" by molecular or mechanical feedbacks. In contrast, a model for Wg posits that growth is governed by a progressive expansion in morphogen range, via a mechanism in which a minimum threshold of Wg sustains the growth of cells within the wing and recruits surrounding \"pre-wing\" cells to grow and enter the wing. This mechanism depends on the capacity of Wg to fuel the autoregulation of vestigial (vg)-the selector gene that specifies the wing state-both to sustain vg expression in wing cells and by a feed-forward (FF) circuit of Fat (Ft)/Dachsous (Ds) protocadherin signaling to induce vg expression in neighboring pre-wing cells. Here, we have subjected Dpp to the same experimental tests used to elucidate the Wg model and find that it behaves indistinguishably.

Yet, the mechanisms that stop growth when organs reach the right size are unknown. Growth of the Drosophila wing-a classic paradigm-is governed by two morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt). Wing growth during larval life ceases when the primordium attains full size, concomitant with the larval-to-pupal molt orchestrated by the steroid hormone ecdysone. Here, we block the molt by genetically dampening ecdysone production, creating an experimental paradigm in which the wing stops growing at the correct size while the larva continues to feed and gain body mass. Under these conditions, we show that wing growth is limited by the ranges of Dpp and Wg, and by ecdysone, which regulates the cellular response to their signaling activities. Further, we present evidence that growth terminates because of the loss of two distinct modes of morphogen action: 1) maintenance of growth within the wing proper and 2) induced growth of surrounding \"pre-wing\" cells and their recruitment into the wing.

Two classes of explanation for this unusual requirement are (1) recycling models, in which the ligand must be endocytosed to be modified or repositioned before it binds Notch and (2) pulling models, in which the ligand must be endocytosed after it binds Notch to exert force that exposes an otherwise buried site for cleavage. We demonstrate in\u00a0vivo that ligands that cannot enter the Epsin pathway nevertheless bind Notch but fail to activate the receptor because they cannot exert sufficient force.

How cells integrate these distinct inputs to generate organs of the appropriate size and shape is largely unknown. The transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki, a YES-Associated Protein, or YAP) acts downstream of patterning morphogens and other tissue-intrinsic signals to promote organ growth. Yki activity is regulated primarily by the Warts/Hippo (Wts/Hpo) tumour suppressor pathway, which impedes nuclear access of Yki by a cytoplasmic tethering mechanism. Here, we show that the TOR pathway regulates Yki by a separate and novel mechanism in the Drosophila wing. Instead of controlling Yki nuclear access, TOR signaling governs Yki action after it reaches the nucleus by allowing it to gain access to its target genes. When TOR activity is inhibited, Yki accumulates in the nucleus but is sequestered from its normal growth-promoting target genes--a phenomenon we term \"nuclear seclusion.\" Hence, we posit that in addition to its well-known role in stimulating cellular metabolism in response to nutrients, TOR also promotes wing growth by liberating Yki from nuclear seclusion, a parallel pathway that we propose contributes to the scaling of wing size with nutrient availability.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Active Transport, Cell Nucleus", "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Caloric Restriction", "Cell Nucleus", "Drosophila Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Larva", "Luminescent Proteins", "MicroRNAs", "Mutation", "Nuclear Proteins", "Peptide Fragments", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "RNA Interference", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Trans-Activators", "Wings, Animal", "YAP-Signaling Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Parker", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America; Division of Biology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Gary", "Last Name": "Struhl", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS biology", "PubDate": "2015Oct"}, {"PMID": "26011623", "Title": "Notch is required in adult Drosophila sensory neurons for morphological and functional plasticity of the olfactory circuit.", "Abstract": "Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) convey odor information to the central brain, but like other sensory neurons were thought to play a passive role in memory formation and storage.

Specifically, we show that Notch activity in ORNs is necessary for the odor specific increase in the volume of glomeruli that occurs as a consequence of prolonged odor exposure. Calcium imaging experiments indicate that Notch in ORNs is also required for the chronic odor induced changes in the physiology of ORNs and the ensuing changes in the physiological response of their second order projection neurons (PNs). We further show that Notch in ORNs acts by both canonical cleavage-dependent and non-canonical cleavage-independent pathways.
