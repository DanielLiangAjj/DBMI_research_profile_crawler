[{"PMID": "38746175", "Title": "\"Tumor-selective treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer with an engineered, probiotic living drug\".", "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses significant challenges for effective treatment, with systemic chemotherapy often proving inadequate due to poor drug delivery and the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment. Engineered bacteria present a novel approach to target PDAC, leveraging their ability to colonize tumors and deliver therapeutic payloads. Here, we engineered probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to produce the pore-forming Theta toxin (Nis-Theta) and evaluated its efficacy in a preclinical model of PDAC. Probiotic administration resulted in selective colonization of tumor tissue, leading to improved overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, this strain exhibited cytotoxic effects on both primary and distant tumor lesions while sparing normal tissues. Importantly, treatment also modulated the tumor microenvironment by increasing anti-tumor immune cell populations and reducing immunosuppressive markers. These findings demonstrate the potential of engineered probiotic bacteria as a safe and effective therapeutic approach for PDAC, offering promise for improved patient outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda R", "Last Name": "Decker-Farrell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen A", "Last Name": "Sastra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tetsuhiro", "Last Name": "Harimoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marie C", "Last Name": "Hasselluhn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmine F", "Last Name": "Palermo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edward R", "Last Name": "Ballister", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Badgley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Danino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May05"}, {"PMID": "38372353", "Title": "Efficient Generation of Murine Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T Cells.", "Abstract": "Engineered cell therapies utilizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have achieved remarkable effectiveness in individuals with hematological malignancies and are presently undergoing development for the treatment of diverse solid tumors.

Using a bacteria-spheroid co-culture system (BSCC), analysis of differentially expressed transcripts and gene set enrichment revealed significant changes in at least 10 signaling pathways with bacteria-producing theta toxin. We assessed combinatorial treatment of small molecule pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting 5 signaling molecules and of 2 chemotherapy drugs along with bacterially-produced theta toxin and showed improved dose-dependent response. This combination strategy was further tested and confirmed, with AKT signaling as an example, in a mouse model of lung cancer. In summary, we developed a pipeline to rapidly characterize bacterial therapies and integrate them with current targeted therapies for lung cancer.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Mice", "Animals", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Lung Neoplasms", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Bacteria"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dhruba", "Last Name": "Deb", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yangfan", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Coker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tetsuhiro", "Last Name": "Harimoto", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruoqi", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Danino", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA. tal.danino@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2022Dec13"}, {"PMID": "36505801", "Title": "Assessing chemotherapy dosing strategies in a spatial cell culture model.", "Abstract": "Predicting patient responses to chemotherapy regimens is a major challenge in cancer treatment.

We subjected cell populations to varied dose and frequency of chemotherapy and measured colony growth. We then built a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of both chemosensitive and chemoresistant populations, where we determined which number of doses can produce the smallest tumor size based on parameters in the system.

These genetic constructs often express a therapeutic substance constitutively, but others could be regulated externally by specific substrates, making the production of their treatment more efficient. Additionally, certain probiotics detecting specific biomarkers in situ and responding by generating a therapeutic substance are beginning to be developed. While most studies are still in the laboratory stage, a few modified probiotics have been tested in humans. These advances indicate that live biotherapeutics could have great potential as new treatments for inflammatory intestinal diseases.", "Keywords": ["biosensors", "gut microbiome", "inflammatory bowel disease", "intestinal inflammation", "live biotherapeutics", "probiotics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria", "Last Name": "Barra", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Danino", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Garrido", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32051224", "Title": "Engineered probiotics for local tumor delivery of checkpoint blockade nanobodies.", "Abstract": "Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy but only work in a subset of patients and can lead to a multitude of toxicities, suggesting the need for more targeted delivery systems.

A single injection of this engineered system demonstrated an enhanced therapeutic response compared to analogous clinically relevant antibodies, resulting in tumor regression in syngeneic mouse models. Supporting the potentiation of a systemic immune response, we observed a relative increase in activated T cells, an abscopal effect, and corresponding increases in systemic T cell memory populations in mice treated with probiotically delivered checkpoint inhibitors.

It is perhaps inevitable that some bacteria would evolve to preferentially grow in environments that harbor disease and thus provide a natural platform for the development of engineered therapies. Such therapies could benefit from bacteria that are programmed to limit bacterial growth while continually producing and releasing cytotoxic agents in situ. Here we engineer a clinically relevant bacterium to lyse synchronously ata threshold population density and to release genetically encoded cargo. Following quorum lysis, a small number of surviving bacteria reseed the growing population, thus leading to pulsatile delivery cycles. We used microfluidic devices to characterize the engineered lysis strain and we demonstrate its potential as a drug delivery platform via co-culture with human cancer cells in vitro. Asa proof of principle, we tracked the bacterial population dynamics in ectopic syngeneic colorectal tumours in mice via a luminescent reporter. The lysis strain exhibits pulsatile population dynamics in vivo, with mean bacterial luminescence that remained two orders of magnitude lower than an unmodified strain. Finally, guided by previous findings that certain bacteria can enhance the efficacy of standard therapies, we orally administered the lysis strain alone or in combination with a clinical chemotherapeutic to a syngeneic mouse transplantation model of hepatic colorectal metastases. We found that the combination of both circuit-engineered bacteria and chemotherapy leads to a notable reduction of tumour activity along with a marked survival benefit over either therapy alone.Our approach establishes a methodology for leveraging the tools of synthetic biology to exploit the natural propensity for certain bacteria to colonize disease sites.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Bacteriolysis", "Coculture Techniques", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Computer Simulation", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Liver Neoplasms", "Luminescence", "Mice", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Quorum Sensing", "Salmonella", "Synthetic Biology", "Transplantation, Isogeneic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "M Omar", "Last Name": "Din", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Danino", "Affiliation": "Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA."}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Prindle", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matt", "Last Name": "Skalak", "Affiliation": "Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA."}, {"First Name": "Jangir", "Last Name": "Selimkhanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaitlin", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA."}, {"First Name": "Ellixis", "Last Name": "Julio", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eta", "Last Name": "Atolia", "Affiliation": "Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA."}, {"First Name": "Lev S", "Last Name": "Tsimring", "Affiliation": "BioCircuits Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sangeeta N", "Last Name": "Bhatia", "Affiliation": "Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA."}, {"First Name": "Jeff", "Last Name": "Hasty", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2016Aug04"}, {"PMID": "26019220", "Title": "Programmable probiotics for detection of cancer in urine.", "Abstract": "Rapid advances in the forward engineering of genetic circuitry in living cells has positioned synthetic biology as a potential means to solve numerous biomedical problems, including disease diagnosis and therapy. One challenge in exploiting synthetic biology for translational applications is to engineer microbes that are well tolerated by patients and seamlessly integrate with existing clinical methods. We use the safe and widely used probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to develop an orally administered diagnostic that can noninvasively indicate the presence of liver metastasis by producing easily detectable signals in urine. Our microbial diagnostic generated a high-contrast urine signal through selective expansion in liver metastases (10(6)-fold enrichment) and high expression of a lacZ reporter maintained by engineering a stable plasmid system. The lacZ reporter cleaves a substrate to produce a small molecule that can be detected in urine. E. coli Nissle 1917 robustly colonized tumor tissue in rodent models of liver metastasis after oral delivery but did not colonize healthy organs or fibrotic liver tissue. We saw no deleterious health effects on the mice for more than 12 months after oral delivery. Our results demonstrate that probiotics can be programmed to safely and selectively deliver synthetic gene circuits to diseased tissue microenvironments in vivo.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Disease Models, Animal", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Humans", "Liver Neoplasms", "Mice, Nude", "Neoplasms", "Plasmids", "Probiotics", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Time Factors", "beta-Galactosidase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Danino", "Affiliation": "Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arthur", "Last Name": "Prindle", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gabriel A", "Last Name": "Kwong", "Affiliation": "Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Skalak", "Affiliation": "Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Howard", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaitlin", "Last Name": "Allen", "Affiliation": "Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeff", "Last Name": "Hasty", "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.

Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (AGO) during HCV infection showed robust AGO binding on the HCV 5'UTR at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced AGO binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection. This miR-122 \"sponge\" effect was relieved and redirected to miR-15 targets by swapping the miRNA tropism of the virus. Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and site number. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV-induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Argonaute Proteins", "Base Sequence", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Eukaryotic Initiation Factors", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Liver", "MicroRNAs", "Molecular Sequence Data", "RNA, Viral", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph M", "Last Name": "Luna", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA; Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Troels K H", "Last Name": "Scheel", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA; Copenhagen Hepatitis C Program (CO-HEP), Department of Infectious Disease and Clinical Research Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, and Department of International Health, Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Danino", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA; Health Sciences and Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katharina S", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Aldo", "Last Name": "Mele", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "John J", "Last Name": "Fak", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eiko", "Last Name": "Nishiuchi", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Constantin N", "Last Name": "Takacs", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA; Laboratory of Cellular Biophysics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria Teresa", "Last Name": "Catanese", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ype P", "Last Name": "de Jong", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA; Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ira M", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charles M", "Last Name": "Rice", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA.

We transformed attenuated strains of S. typhimurium bacteria (ELH430:SL1344 phoPQ- (1)) with a constitutively expressed luciferase (luxCDABE) plasmid for visualization(2). These strains specifically colonize tumors while remaining essentially non-virulent to the mouse(1).
