Here, we show that combined germinal center (GC)-specific haploinsufficiency of Crebbp and Kmt2d synergizes in\u00a0vivo to promote the expansion of abnormally polarized GCs, a common preneoplastic event. These enzymes form a biochemical complex on select enhancers/superenhancers that are critical for the delivery of immune signals in the GC light zone and are only corrupted upon dual Crebbp/Kmt2d loss, both in mouse GC B cells and in human DLBCL. Moreover, CREBBP directly acetylates KMT2D in GC-derived B cells, and, consistently, its inactivation by FL/DLBCL-associated mutations abrogates its ability to catalyze KMT2D acetylation. Genetic and pharmacologic loss of CREBBP and the consequent decrease in KMT2D acetylation lead to reduced levels of H3K4me1, supporting a role for this posttranslational modification in modulating KMT2D activity. Our data identify a direct biochemical and functional interaction between CREBBP and KMT2D in the GC, with implications for their role as tumor suppressors in FL/DLBCL and for the development of precision medicine approaches targeting enhancer defects induced by their combined loss.", "Keywords": ["B cell lymphoma", "CREBBP", "KMT2D", "acetylation", "germinal center"], "MeSH terms":

non-Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40% of patients. Efforts to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic targets1-5. However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and specifically hypermutated in 92% of samples from individuals with DLBCL, display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1 (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of therapeutic relevance.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Down-Regulation", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse", "Mutation", "Oncogenes", "Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6", "Receptors, CXCR4", "Receptors, Glucocorticoid", "Repressor Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elodie", "Last Name": "Bal", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rahul", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mohammad", "Last Name": "Hadigol", "Affiliation": "Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Antony B", "Last Name": "Holmes", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura K", "Last Name": "Hilton", "Affiliation": "Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jui Wan", "Last Name": "Loh", "Affiliation": "Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kostiantyn", "Last Name": "Dreval", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jasper C H", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Sofija", "Last Name": "Vlasevska", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Clarissa", "Last Name": "Corinaldesi", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh Kumar", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Proteomics and Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katia", "Last Name": "Basso", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ryan D", "Last Name": "Morin", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Khiabanian", "Affiliation": "Center for Systems and Computational Biology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Pasqualucci", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. lp171@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Dalla-Favera", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. rd10@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2022Jul"}, {"PMID": "35095922", "Title": "Tracking Immunoglobulin Repertoire and Transcriptomic Changes in Germinal Center B Cells by Single-Cell Analysis.", "Abstract": "In response to T-cell-dependent antigens, mature B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs are stimulated to form germinal centers (GCs), which are histological structures deputed to antibody affinity maturation, a process associated with immunoglobulin gene editing by somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). GC B cells are heterogeneous and transition across multiple stages before being eliminated by apoptosis or committing to post-GC differentiation as memory B cells or plasma cells. In order to explore the dynamics of SHM and CSR during the GC reaction, we identified GC subpopulations by single-cell (sc) transcriptomics and analyzed the load of immunoglobulin variable (V) region mutations as well as the isotype class distribution in each subpopulation. The results showed that the large majority of GC B cells display a quantitatively similar mutational load in the V regions and analogous IGH isotype class distribution, except for the precursors of memory B cells (PreM) and plasma cells (PBL).

However, the role of CREBBP inactivation in lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that CREBBP regulates enhancer/super-enhancer networks with central roles in GC/post-GC cell fate decisions, including genes involved in signal transduction by the B-cell receptor and CD40 receptor, transcriptional control of GC and plasma cell development, and antigen presentation. Consistently, Crebbp-deficient B cells exhibit enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation. Although GC-specific loss of Crebbp was insufficient to initiate malignant transformation, compound Crebbp-haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human diseases. These findings establish CREBBP as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene in GC B cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis.Significance: Loss-of-function mutations of CREBBP are common and early lesions in FL and DLBCL, suggesting a prominent role in lymphoma initiation. Our studies identify the cellular program by which reduced CREBBP dosage facilitates malignant transformation, and have direct implications for targeted lymphoma therapy based on drugs affecting CREBBP-mediated chromatin acetylation.

A comparative analysis of microRNAs expressed in normal and malignant GC B cells identified microRNA 28 (miR-28) as significantly down-regulated in BL, as well as in other GC-derived B-NHL. We show that reexpression of miR-28 impairs cell proliferation and clonogenic properties of BL cells by modulating several targets including MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1, MAD2L1, a component of the spindle checkpoint whose down-regulation is essential in mediating miR-28-induced proliferation arrest, and BCL2-associated athanogene, BAG1, an activator of the ERK pathway. We identify the oncogene MYC as a negative regulator of miR-28 expression, suggesting that its deregulation by chromosomal translocation in BL leads to miR-28 suppression. In addition, we show that miR-28 can inhibit MYC-induced transformation by directly targeting genes up-regulated by MYC.

Screening of recurrently mutated genes in 48 additional FR-CLLs revealed that ~70% of FR-CLLs carry \u22651 mutation in genes previously associated with CLL clinical course, including TP53 (27.5%), NOTCH1 (24.1%), SF3B1 (18.9%), and BIRC3 (15.5%). In addition, this analysis showed that 10.3% of FR-CLL cases display mutations of the FAT1 gene, which encodes for a cadherin-like protein that negatively regulates Wnt signaling, consistent with a tumor suppressor role. The frequency of FAT1-mutated cases was significantly higher in FR-CLL than in unselected CLLs at diagnosis (10.3% vs 1.1%, P = .004), suggesting a role in the development of a high-risk phenotype.

Beyond the sheer numerical diversity of RNA species, recent studies have begun to uncover hints of even greater functional complexity. An increasing number of RNA molecules, including those from classic, well-studied classes, have been found to act in previously unanticipated regulatory roles, or as substrate for the biogenesis of functionally distinct RNA molecules, or both. Thus, these molecules can fulfill multiple, parallel functions, compounding the already rich landscape of RNA biology, and potentially connecting disparate biological regulatory networks in unexpected ways.

Mutation of MEF2B resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity of MEF2B either through disruption of its interaction with the corepressor CABIN1 or by rendering it insensitive to inhibitory signaling events mediated by phosphorylation and sumoylation. Consequently, the transcriptional activity of Bcl-6 was deregulated in DLBCLs with MEF2B mutations. Thus, somatic mutations of MEF2B may contribute to lymphomagenesis by deregulating BCL6 expression, and MEF2B may represent an alternative target for blocking Bcl-6 activity in DLBCLs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Proliferation", "Cluster Analysis", "Computational Biology", "Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Germinal Center", "Humans", "Lymphoma, Follicular", "Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse", "MADS Domain Proteins", "MEF2 Transcription Factors", "Mice", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Mutation", "Myogenic Regulatory Factors", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Proto-Oncogene Mas", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6", "Sumoylation", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carol Y", "Last Name": "Ying", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Dominguez-Sola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Melissa", "Last Name": "Fabi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ivo C", "Last Name": "Lorenz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shafinaz", "Last Name": "Hussein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mukesh", "Last Name": "Bansal", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Pasqualucci", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Katia", "Last Name": "Basso", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Riccardo", "Last Name": "Dalla-Favera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature immunology", "PubDate": "2013Oct"}, {"PMID": "23531283", "Title": "MutComFocal: an integrative approach to identifying recurrent and focal genomic alterations in tumor samples.", "Abstract": "Most tumors are the result of accumulated genomic alterations in somatic cells.

Here, we demonstrate that one such tRNA-derived fragment, cloned from human mature B cells and designated CU1276, in fact possesses the functional characteristics of a microRNA, including a DICER1-dependent biogenesis, physical association with Argonaute proteins, and the ability to repress mRNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Expression of CU1276 is abundant in normal germinal center B cells but absent in germinal center-derived lymphomas, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, CU1276 represses endogenous RPA1, an essential gene involved in many aspects of DNA dynamics, and consequently, expression of this tRNA-derived microRNA in a lymphoma cell line suppresses proliferation and modulates the molecular response to DNA damage.

By integrating mutational and cytogenetic analysis in 1274 CLL samples and using both a training-validation and a time-dependent design, 4 CLL subgroups were hierarchically classified: (1) high-risk, harboring TP53 and/or BIRC3 abnormalities (10-year survival: 29%); (2) intermediate-risk, harboring NOTCH1 and/or SF3B1 mutations and/or del11q22-q23 (10-year survival: 37%); (3) low-risk, harboring +12 or a normal genetics (10-year survival: 57%); and (4) very low-risk, harboring del13q14 only, whose 10-year survival (69.3%) did not significantly differ from a matched general population. This integrated mutational and cytogenetic model independently predicted survival, improved CLL prognostication accuracy compared with FISH karyotype (P < .0001), and was externally validated in an independent CLL cohort. Clonal evolution from lower to higher risk implicated the emergence of NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3 abnormalities in addition to TP53 and 11q22-q23 lesions. By taking into account clonal evolution through time-dependent analysis, the genetic model maintained its prognostic relevance at any time from diagnosis.
