We assembled the Spina Bifida Sequencing Consortium to identify causes. Exome and genome sequencing of 715 parent-offspring trios identified six patients with chromosomal 22q11.2 deletions, suggesting a 23-fold increased risk compared with the general population. Furthermore, analysis of a separate 22q11.2 deletion cohort suggested a 12- to 15-fold increased NTD risk of meningomyelocele. The loss of Crkl, one of several neural tube-expressed genes within the minimal deletion interval, was sufficient to replicate NTDs in mice, where both penetrance and expressivity were exacerbated by maternal folate deficiency. Thus, the common 22q11.2 deletion confers substantial meningomyelocele risk, which is partially alleviated by folate supplementation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Humans",

"Title": "Thrombosis risk in single- and double-heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A in FinnGen and the UK Biobank.", "Abstract": "The factor V Leiden (FVL; rs6025) and prothrombin G20210A (PTGM; rs1799963) polymorphisms are 2 of the most well-studied genetic risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, double heterozygosity (DH) for FVL and PTGM remains poorly understood, with previous studies showing marked disagreement regarding thrombosis risk conferred by the DH genotype. Using multidimensional data from the UK Biobank (UKB) and FinnGen biorepositories, we evaluated the clinical impact of DH carrier status across 937\u2009939 individuals. We found that 662 participants (0.07%) were DH carriers. After adjustment for age, sex, and ancestry, DH individuals experienced a markedly elevated risk of VTE compared with wild-type individuals (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 5.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.01-6.84; P\u00a0= 4.8\u00a0\u00d7 10-34), which approximated the risk conferred by FVL homozygosity. A secondary analysis restricted to UKB participants (N\u00a0= 445\u2009144) found that effect size estimates for the DH genotype remained largely unchanged (OR\u00a0= 4.53; 95% CI, 3.42-5.90; P\u00a0< 1\u00a0\u00d7 10-16) after adjustment for commonly cited VTE risk factors, such as body mass index, blood type, and markers of inflammation. In contrast, the DH genotype was not associated with a significantly higher risk of any arterial thrombosis phenotype, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease. In summary, we leveraged population-scale genomic data sets to conduct, to our knowledge, the largest study to date on the DH genotype and were able to establish far more precise effect size estimates than previously possible. Our findings indicate that the DH genotype may occur as frequently as FVL homozygosity and may confer a similarly increased risk of VTE.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Prothrombin",

Two coding variants (G1 and G2) in the APOL1 gene play a major role in this disparity.

Here, we show that the presence of the APOL1 p.N264K missense variant, when co-inherited with the G2 APOL1 risk allele, substantially reduces the penetrance of the G1G2 and G2G2 high-risk genotypes by rendering these genotypes low-risk. These results align with prior functional evidence showing that the p.N264K variant reduces the toxicity of the APOL1 high-risk alleles.

Two coding variants (G1 and G2) in the APOL1 gene play a major role in this disparity. While 13% of Black Americans carry the high-risk recessive genotypes, only a fraction of these individuals develops FSGS or kidney failure, indicating the involvement of additional disease modifiers. Here, we show that the presence of the APOL1 p.N264K missense variant, when co-inherited with the G2 APOL1 risk allele, substantially reduces the penetrance of the G1G2 and G2G2 high-risk genotypes by rendering these genotypes low-risk. These results align with prior functional evidence showing that the p.N264K variant reduces the toxicity of the APOL1 high-risk alleles.

Here we performed a genome-wide association study of 10,146 kidney-biopsy-diagnosed IgAN cases and 28,751 controls across 17 international cohorts. We defined 30 genome-wide significant risk loci explaining 11% of disease risk. A total of 16 loci were new, including TNFSF4/TNFSF18, REL, CD28, PF4V1, LY86, LYN, ANXA3, TNFSF8/TNFSF15, REEP3, ZMIZ1, OVOL1/RELA, ETS1, IGH, IRF8, TNFRSF13B and FCAR. The risk loci were enriched in gene orthologs causing abnormal IgA levels when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed a positive genetic correlation between IgAN and serum IgA levels. High polygenic score for IgAN was associated with earlier onset of kidney failure. In a comprehensive functional annotation analysis of candidate causal genes, we observed convergence of biological candidates on a common set of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine ligand-receptor pairs, prioritizing potential new drug targets.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Glomerulonephritis, IGA", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Immunoglobulin A"],

"Title": "Multi-population genome-wide association study implicates immune and non-immune factors in pediatric steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.", "Abstract": "Pediatric steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (pSSNS) is the most common childhood glomerular disease. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a risk locus in the HLA Class II region and three additional independent risk loci. But the genetic architecture of pSSNS, and its genetically driven pathobiology, is largely unknown. Here, we conduct a multi-population GWAS meta-analysis in 38,463 participants (2440 cases). We then conduct conditional analyses and population specific GWAS. We discover twelve significant associations-eight from the multi-population meta-analysis (four novel), two from the multi-population conditional analysis (one novel), and two additional novel loci from the European meta-analysis. Fine-mapping implicates specific amino acid haplotypes in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 driving the HLA Class II risk locus. Non-HLA loci colocalize with eQTLs of monocytes and numerous T-cell subsets in independent datasets. Colocalization with kidney eQTLs is lacking but overlap with kidney cell open chromatin suggests an uncharacterized disease mechanism in kidney cells. A polygenic risk score (PRS) associates with earlier disease onset. Altogether, these discoveries expand our knowledge of pSSNS genetic architecture across populations and provide cell-specific insights into its molecular drivers. Evaluating these associations in additional cohorts will refine our understanding of population specificity, heterogeneity, and clinical and molecular associations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

"Abstract": "Neural differentiation, synaptic transmission, and action potential propagation depend on membrane sphingolipids, whose metabolism is tightly regulated. Mutations in the ceramide transporter CERT (CERT1), which is involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis, are associated with intellectual disability, but the pathogenic mechanism remains obscure. Here, we characterize 31 individuals with de novo missense variants in CERT1. Several variants fall into a previously uncharacterized dimeric helical domain that enables CERT homeostatic inactivation, without which sphingolipid production goes unchecked. The clinical severity reflects the degree to which CERT autoregulation is disrupted, and inhibiting CERT pharmacologically corrects morphological and motor abnormalities in a Drosophila model of the disease, which we call ceramide transporter (CerTra) syndrome. These findings uncover a central role for CERT autoregulation in the control of sphingolipid biosynthetic flux, provide unexpected insight into the structural organization of CERT, and suggest a possible therapeutic approach for patients with CerTra syndrome.", "Keywords": ["Cell Biology", "Genetics", "Lipid rafts", "Neurodevelopment"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Ceramides", "Homeostasis",

microbial ecosystem, whose composition affects various physiological traits of the host. Next-generation sequencing-based metagenomic approaches demonstrated how the interplay of host genetics, bacteria, and environmental factors shape complex traits and clinical outcomes. However, the role of fungi in these complex interactions remains understudied. Here, using 228 males and 363 females from an advanced-intercross mouse line, we provide evidence that fungi are regulated by host genetics. In addition, we map quantitative trait loci associated with various fungal species to single genes in mice using whole genome sequencing and genotyping. Moreover, we show that diet and its' interaction with host genetics alter the composition of fungi in outbred mice, and identify fungal indicator species associated with different dietary regimes. Collectively, in this work, we uncover an association of the intestinal fungal community with host genetics and a regulatory role of diet in this ecological niche.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Female", "Animals", "Mice", "Mycobiome", "Ecosystem", "Diet", "Quantitative Trait Loci", "Bacteria", "Fungi", "Mammals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yask", "Last Name": "Gupta", "Affiliation": "L\u00fcbeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anna Lara", "Last Name": "Ernst", "Affiliation": "L\u00fcbeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Artem", "Last Name": "Vorobyev", "Affiliation": "L\u00fcbeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Foteini", "Last Name": "Beltsiou", "Affiliation": "L\u00fcbeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Detlef", "Last Name": "Zillikens", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Katja", "Last Name": "Bieber", "Affiliation": "L\u00fcbeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Sanna-Cherchi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Christiano", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian D", "Last Name": "Sadik", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ralf J", "Last Name": "Ludwig", "Affiliation": "L\u00fcbeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany. ralf.ludwig@uksh.de."}, {"First Name": "Tanya", "Last Name": "Sezin", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck, L\u00fcbeck, Germany. ts3391@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2023Feb14"}, {"PMID": "36631543", "Title": "ParseCNV2: a versatile and integrated tool for copy number variation association studies.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Gene Dosage"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tze Y", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Verbitsky", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Sanna-Cherchi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. ss2517@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "European journal of human genetics : EJHG", "PubDate": "2023Mar"}, {"PMID": "36302597", "Title": "Genomic Disorders in CKD across the Lifespan.", "Abstract": "Pathogenic structural genetic variants, also known as genomic disorders, have been associated with pediatric CKD.

Of those who completed genetic testing, a positive diagnostic finding was identified in 27.1%, a candidate diagnostic finding was identified in 6.7% of patients, and a nondiagnostic positive finding was identified in an additional 8.6% of patients, resulting in an overall yield of 42.4% for clinically relevant genetic findings in tested patients. A genetic diagnosis had implications for medical management, family member testing, and eligibility for clinical trials. With the utilization of telemedicine, genetic services reached a diverse geographic and patient population.

However, despite a sharp incline of CAKUT reports in the literature within the past 2 decades, there remains a plateau in the genetic diagnostic yield that is disproportionate to the accelerated ability to generate robust genome-wide data. Explanations for this observation include (i) diverse inheritance patterns with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, (ii) rarity of single-gene drivers such that large sample sizes are required to meet the burden of proof, and (iii) multigene interactions that might produce either intra- (e.g., copy number variants) or inter- (e.g., effects in trans) locus effects. These challenges present an opportunity for the community to implement innovative genetic and molecular avenues to explain the missing heritability and to better elucidate the mechanisms that underscore CAKUT. Here, we review recent multidisciplinary approaches at the intersection of genetics, genomics, in\u00a0vivo modeling, and in\u00a0vitro systems toward refining a blueprint for overcoming the diagnostic hurdles that are pervasive in urinary tract malformation cohorts. These approaches will not only benefit clinical management by reducing age at molecular diagnosis and prompting early evaluation for comorbid features but will also serve as a springboard for therapeutic development.", "Keywords": ["CAKUT", "copy number variant", "embryonic development", "genomics", "kidney organoid", "zebrafish"], "MeSH terms": ["DNA Copy Number Variations", "Genomics", "Humans", "Kidney", "Urinary Tract", "Urogenital Abnormalities"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kamal", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Center for Human Disease Modeling, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA; Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute, Ann & Robert H.

Monogenic forms of pediatric SRNS are predominantly caused by recessive mutations, while the contribution of de novo variants (DNVs) to this trait is poorly understood. Using exome sequencing (ES) in a proband with FSGS/SRNS, developmental delay, and epilepsy, we discovered a nonsense DNV in TRIM8, which encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing 8. To establish whether TRIM8 variants represent a cause of FSGS, we aggregated exome/genome-sequencing data for 2,501 pediatric FSGS/SRNS-affected individuals and 48,556 control subjects, detecting eight heterozygous TRIM8 truncating variants in affected subjects but none in control subjects (p = 3.28\u00a0\u00d7 10-11). In all six cases with available parental DNA, we demonstrated de novo inheritance (p\u00a0=\u00a02.21\u00a0\u00d7 10-15). Reverse phenotyping revealed neurodevelopmental disease in all eight families. We next analyzed ES from 9,067 individuals with epilepsy, yielding three additional families with truncating TRIM8 variants. Clinical review revealed FSGS in all. All TRIM8 variants cause protein truncation clustering within the last exon between residues 390 and 487 of the 551 amino acid protein, indicating a correlation between this syndrome and loss of the TRIM8 C-terminal region. Wild-type TRIM8 overexpressed in immortalized human podocytes and neuronal cells localized to nuclear bodies, while constructs harboring patient-specific variants mislocalized diffusely to the nucleoplasm. Co-localization studies demonstrated that Gemini and Cajal bodies frequently abut a TRIM8 nuclear body. Truncating TRIM8 DNVs cause a neuro-renal syndrome via aberrant TRIM8 localization, implicating nuclear bodies in FSGS and developmental brain disease.", "Keywords": ["FSGS", "SRNS", "TRIM8", "epilepsy", "genomics", "monogenic", "nuclear body"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Animals", "Carrier Proteins", "Cell Line", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Codon, Nonsense", "Developmental Disabilities", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental", "Humans", "Intranuclear Space", "Kidney", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "Nephrotic Syndrome", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Phenotype", "Podocytes", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patricia L", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amar J", "Last Name": "Majmundar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kamal", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Center for Disease Modeling, Duke University, Durham, NC 27701, USA; Advanced Center for Translational and Genetic Medicine (ACT-GeM), Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute, Ann & Robert H.

Despite the discovery of dozens of monogenic causes of CAKUT, most pathogenic pathways remain elusive. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 551 individuals with CAKUT and identified a heterozygous de novo stop-gain variant in ZMYM2 in two different families with CAKUT. Through collaboration, we identified in total 14 different heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ZMYM2 in 15 unrelated families. Most mutations occurred de novo, indicating possible interference with reproductive function. Human disease features are replicated in X.\u00a0tropicalis larvae with morpholino knockdowns, in which expression of truncated ZMYM2 proteins, based on individual mutations, failed to rescue renal and craniofacial defects. Moreover, heterozygous Zmym2-deficient mice recapitulated features of CAKUT with high penetrance. The ZMYM2 protein is a component of a transcriptional corepressor complex recently linked to the silencing of developmentally regulated endogenous retrovirus elements. Using protein-protein interaction assays, we show that ZMYM2 interacts with additional epigenetic silencing complexes, as well as confirming that it binds to FOXP1, a transcription factor that has also been linked to CAKUT. In summary, our findings establish that loss-of-function mutations of ZMYM2, and potentially that of other proteins in its interactome, as causes of human CAKUT, offering new routes for studying the pathogenesis of the disorder.", "Keywords": ["FIM", "ZMYM2", "ZNF198", "congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract", "extra-renal features", "genetic kidney disease", "genomic analysis", "syndromic CAKUT", "transcription regulator", "whole-exome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Amphibian Proteins", "Animals", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Family", "Female", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Infant", "Larva", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Morpholinos", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Protein Binding", "Repressor Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Urinary Tract", "Urogenital Abnormalities", "Exome Sequencing", "Xenopus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Dervla M", "Last Name": "Connaughton", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital - London Health Sciences Centre, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, 339 Windermere Road, London, ON N6A 5A5, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Rufeng", "Last Name": "Dai", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Nephrology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, 201102 Shanghai, China."}, {"First Name": "Danielle J", "Last Name": "Owen", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Marquez", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Genomics Discovery Program, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adda L", "Last Name": "Graham-Paquin", "Affiliation": "Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre and Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC H3A 1A3, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Makiko", "Last Name": "Nakayama", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}, {"First Name": "Etienne", "Last Name": "Coyaud", "Affiliation": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network & Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; Univ.

Human 16p11.2 deletions have been associated with CAKUT, but the responsible molecular mechanism remains to be illuminated. To explore this, we investigated 102 carriers of 16p11.2 deletion from multi-center cohorts, among which we retrospectively ascertained kidney morphologic and functional data from 37 individuals (12 Chinese and 25 Caucasian/Hispanic). Significantly higher CAKUT rates were observed in 16p11.2 deletion carriers (about 25% in Chinese and 16% in Caucasian/Hispanic) than those found in the non-clinically ascertained general populations (about 1/1000 found at autopsy). Furthermore, we identified seven additional individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function variants in TBX6, a gene that maps to the 16p11.2 region. Four of these seven cases showed obvious CAKUT. To further investigate the role of TBX6 in kidney development, we engineered mice with mutated Tbx6 alleles. The Tbx6 heterozygous null (i.e., loss-of-function) mutant (Tbx6+/\u2012) resulted in 13% solitary kidneys. Remarkably, this incidence increased to 29% in a compound heterozygous model (Tbx6mh/\u2012) that reduced Tbx6 gene dosage to below haploinsufficiency, by combining the null allele with a novel mild hypomorphic allele (mh). Renal hypoplasia was also frequently observed in these Tbx6-mutated mouse models. Thus, our findings in patients and mice establish TBX6 as a novel gene involved in CAKUT and its gene dosage insufficiency as a potential driver for kidney defects observed in the 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.", "Keywords": ["16p11.2 deletion", "CNV", "allelic series", "compound inheritance", "gene dosage", "gene expression", "kidney development"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Kidney", "Mice", "Retrospective Studies", "Scoliosis", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Urogenital Abnormalities", "Vesico-Ureteral Reflux"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nan", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, NHC Key Laboratory of Reproduction Regulation (Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research), State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering at School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China;

Our previous linkage and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) generated strong evidence for aetiological contributions from inherited genetic variants at different population frequencies, including both rare mutations and common polymorphisms. Additionally, we conducted gene expression (GE) studies on scalp biopsies of 96 patients and controls\u00a0to establish signatures of active disease. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis on these two datasets to test the hypothesis that rare CNVs in patients with AA could be leveraged to identify drivers of disease in our AA GE signatures. We analysed copy number variants (CNVs) in a case-control cohort of 673\u00a0patients with AA and 16 311\u00a0controls independent of the case-control cohort of 96 research participants used in our GE study. Using an integrative computational analysis, we identified 14 genes whose expression levels were altered by CNVs in a consistent direction of effect, corresponding to gene expression changes in lesional skin of patients. Four of these genes were affected by CNVs in three or more unrelated patients with AA, including ATG4B and SMARCA2, which are involved in autophagy and chromatin remodelling, respectively. Our findings identified new classes of genes with potential contributions to AA pathogenesis.", "Keywords": ["alopecia areata", "autophagy", "copy number variants", "integrative genomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Alopecia Areata", "Autophagy", "Autophagy-Related Proteins", "Cysteine Endopeptidases", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Gene Dosage", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Hair", "Hair Follicle", "Humans", "Mutation", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Scalp", "Transcription Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Petukhova", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Aakash V", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Rachel K", "Last Name": "Rigo", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Bian", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Miguel", "Last Name": "Verbitsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Sanna-Cherchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie O", "Last Name": "Erjavec", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Alexa R", "Last Name": "Abdelaziz", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jane E", "Last Name": "Cerise", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ali", "Last Name": "Jabbari", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Angela M", "Last Name": "Christiano", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York."}], "Journal": "Experimental dermatology", "PubDate": "2020Mar"}, {"PMID": "31085678", "Title": "Exome-Based Rare-Variant Analyses in CKD.", "Abstract": "Studies have identified many common genetic associations that influence renal function and all-cause CKD, but these explain only a small fraction of variance in these traits.

Genitourinary tract abnormalities have been noted to be present in up to 30-40% of patients. At our institution, an internationally recognized, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary 22q11.2DS care center has been providing care to these children. We sought to report on the incidence of genitourinary tract anomalies in this large cohort and, therefore, retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent a complete evaluation from 1992 to March 2017. We identified all children with any genital or urinary tract anomaly. For all children with a diagnosis of hydronephrosis, the underlying etiology was determined, when possible. Overall, 1,073 of 1,267 children with 22q11.2DS underwent renal evaluations at our institution. Hundered Sixty-Two (15.1%) children had structural abnormalities of their kidneys/urinary tracts. The majority of children with hydronephrosis (63%) had isolated upper tract dilation without any additional diagnoses. Boys were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a genital abnormality than girls (7.7 vs. 0.5%, p <\u20090.001). Of the 649 boys in the entire cohort, 24 (3.7%) had cryptorchidism and 24 (3.7%) had hypospadias, which was noted to be mild in all except one boy. Overall, findings of hydronephrosis, unilateral renal agenesis, and multicystic dysplastic kidney occur at higher rates than expected in the general population. Given these findings, in addition to routine physical examination, we believe that all patients with 22q11.2DS warrant screening RBUS at time of diagnosis.", "Keywords": ["22q11.2 deletion syndrome", "DiGeorge syndrome", "genitourinary", "pediatrics", "renal", "urology"], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Child, Preschool", "DiGeorge Syndrome", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Loci", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Phenotype", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Urogenital Abnormalities"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jason P", "Last Name": "Van Batavia", "Affiliation": "Division of Urology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Terrence B", "Last Name": "Crowley", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Evanette", "Last Name": "Burrows", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Elaine H", "Last Name": "Zackai", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Sanna-Cherchi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Donna M", "Last Name": "McDonald-McGinn", "Affiliation": "Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Thomas F", "Last Name": "Kolon", "Affiliation": "Division of Urology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}], "Journal": "American journal of medical genetics.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2,824 cases and 21,498 controls. Affected individuals carried a significant burden of rare exonic (that is, affecting coding regions) CNVs and were enriched for known genomic disorders (GD). Kidney anomaly (KA) cases were most enriched for exonic CNVs, encompassing GD-CNVs and novel deletions; obstructive uropathy (OU) had a lower CNV burden and an intermediate prevalence of GD-CNVs; and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) had the fewest GD-CNVs but was enriched for novel exonic CNVs, particularly duplications. Six loci (1q21, 4p16.1-p16.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.11, 17q12 and 22q11.2) accounted for 65% of patients with GD-CNVs. Deletions at 17q12, 4p16.1-p16.3 and 22q11.2 were specific for KA; the 16p11.2 locus showed extensive pleiotropy.

We investigated a family with five affected siblings for which no loss-of-function variants were identified by whole exome sequencing analysis. SNP genotyping and linkage analysis narrowed the candidate regions to \u223c8% of the genome, which included two published PCLD genes in close proximity to each other, GANAB and LRP5. Based on these findings, we re-evaluated the exome sequencing data and identified a novel intronic nine base pair deletion in the vicinity of the GANAB exon 24 splice donor that had initially been discarded by the sequence analysis pipelines. We used a minigene assay to show that this deletion leads to skipping of exon 24 in cell lines and primary human cholangiocytes.

We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 202 case subjects with RHD and identified diagnostic mutations in genes known to be associated with RHD in 7/202 case subjects. In an additional affected individual with RHD and a congenital heart defect, we found a homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) variant in SLIT3, recapitulating phenotypes reported with Slit3 inactivation in the mouse. To identify genes associated with RHD, we performed an exome-wide association study with 195 unresolved case subjects and 6,905 control subjects. The top signal resided in GREB1L, a gene implicated previously in Hoxb1 and Shha signaling in zebrafish. The significance of the association, which was p = 2.0\u00a0\u00d7 10-5 for novel LOF, increased to p = 4.1\u00a0\u00d7 10-6 for LOF and deleterious missense variants combined, and augmented further after accounting for segregation and de novo inheritance of rare variants (joint p = 2.3\u00a0\u00d7 10-7). Finally, CRISPR/Cas9 disruption or knockdown of greb1l in zebrafish caused specific pronephric defects, which were rescued by wild-type human GREB1L mRNA, but not mRNA containing alleles identified in case subjects. Together, our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of kidney malformations in humans, presents multiple candidates, and identifies SLIT3 and GREB1L as genes implicated in the pathogenesis of RHD.", "Keywords": ["CAKUT", "EYA1", "GATA3", "HNF1B", "HSPA4L", "PAX2", "SETBP1", "SIX5", "T", "WNT5A"], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Case-Control Studies", "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats", "Congenital Abnormalities", "Exome", "Female", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Heredity", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Phenotype", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Urinary Tract", "Urogenital Abnormalities", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Sanna-Cherchi", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

However, for most patients with CAKUT, the causative mutation remains unknown. We identified a kindred with an autosomal dominant form of CAKUT. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified a heterozygous truncating mutation (c.279delG, p.Trp93fs*) of the nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 gene (NRIP1) in all seven affected members. NRIP1 encodes a nuclear receptor transcriptional cofactor that directly interacts with the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to modulate retinoic acid transcriptional activity. Unlike wild-type NRIP1, the altered NRIP1 protein did not translocate to the nucleus, did not interact with RAR\u03b1, and failed to inhibit retinoic acid-dependent transcriptional activity upon expression in HEK293 cells. Notably, we also showed that treatment with retinoic acid enhanced NRIP1 binding to RAR\u03b1 RNA in situ hybridization confirmed Nrip1 expression in the developing urogenital system of the mouse. In explant cultures of embryonic kidney rudiments, retinoic acid stimulated Nrip1 expression, whereas a pan-RAR antagonist strongly reduced it. Furthermore, mice heterozygous for a null allele of Nrip1 showed a CAKUT-spectrum phenotype. Finally, expression and knockdown experiments in Xenopus laevis confirmed an evolutionarily conserved role for NRIP1 in renal development. These data indicate that dominant NRIP1 mutations can cause CAKUT by interference with retinoic acid transcriptional signaling, shedding light on the well documented association between abnormal vitamin A levels and renal malformations in humans, and suggest a possible gene-environment pathomechanism in this disease.", "Keywords": ["CAKUT", "NRIP1", "retinoic acid"], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Mice", "Mutation", "Nuclear Proteins", "Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1", "Signal Transduction", "Tretinoin", "Urinary Tract"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Asaf", "Last Name": "Vivante", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Mann", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and."}, {"First Name": "Hagith", "Last Name": "Yonath", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine A and Genetics Institute, Sheba Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Anna-Carina", "Last Name": "Weiss", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Maike", "Last Name": "Getwan", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Renal Division, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Michael M", "Last Name": "Kaminski", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Renal Division, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, and."}, {"First Name": "Tobias", "Last Name": "Bohnenpoll", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Teyssier", "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche en Canc\u00e9rologie de Montpellier (IRCM), Montpellier, France;

Recent studies indicate a strong genetic component in the determination of CAKUT. The genetic architecture of these malformations involves both point mutations and structural variants. The recent improvement in next-generation sequencing technologies resulted in a boost on discovery of new genes involved in CAKUT. Results from micro-array study have demonstrated that rare structural variants are an important source of genetic variation in patients with CAKUT. Moreover, these structural variants have been proven to be associated with developmental disorders that develop later in life, especially neurodevelopment diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and others.

Here we studied the role of rare copy number variations in 80 patients from the KIMONO study cohort for which pathogenic mutations in three genes commonly implicated in CAKUT were excluded. In total, 13 known or novel genomic imbalances in 11 of 80 patients were absent or extremely rare in 23,362 population controls. To identify the most likely genetic drivers for the CAKUT phenotype underlying these rare copy number variations, we used a systematic in silico approach based on frequency in a large data set of controls, annotation with publicly available databases for developmental diseases, tolerance and haploinsufficiency scores, and gene expression profile in the developing kidney and urinary tract. Five novel candidate genes for CAKUT were identified that showed specific expression in the human and mouse developing urinary tract. Among these genes, DLG1 and KIF12 are likely novel susceptibility genes for CAKUT in humans.

Identification of single-gene mutations that cause CAKUT permits the first insights into related disease mechanisms. However, for most cases the underlying defect remains elusive. We identified a kindred with an autosomal-dominant form of CAKUT with predominant ureteropelvic junction obstruction. By whole exome sequencing, we identified a heterozygous truncating mutation (c.1010delG) of T-Box transcription factor 18 (TBX18) in seven affected members of the large kindred. A screen of additional families with CAKUT identified three families harboring two heterozygous TBX18 mutations (c.1570C>T and c.487A>G). TBX18 is essential for developmental specification of the ureteric mesenchyme and ureteric smooth muscle cells. We found that all three TBX18 altered proteins still dimerized with the wild-type protein but had prolonged protein half life and exhibited reduced transcriptional repression activity compared to wild-type TBX18. The p.Lys163Glu substitution altered an amino acid residue critical for TBX18-DNA interaction, resulting in impaired TBX18-DNA binding. These data indicate that dominant-negative TBX18 mutations cause human CAKUT by interference with TBX18 transcriptional repression, thus implicating ureter smooth muscle cell development in the pathogenesis of human CAKUT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Base Sequence", "Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay", "Exome", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genes, Dominant", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Immunoprecipitation", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Muscle, Smooth", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Ureter", "Urinary Tract"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Asaf", "Last Name": "Vivante", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA;

Here, we have shown that A-ICs also serve as both sentinels and effectors in the defense against urinary infections. In a murine urinary tract infection model, A-ICs bound uropathogenic E. coli and responded by acidifying the urine and secreting the bacteriostatic protein lipocalin 2 (LCN2; also known as NGAL). A-IC-dependent LCN2 secretion required TLR4, as mice expressing an LPS-insensitive form of TLR4 expressed reduced levels of LCN2. The presence of LCN2 in urine was both necessary and sufficient to control the urinary tract infection through iron sequestration, even in the harsh condition of urine acidification. In mice lacking A-ICs, both urinary LCN2 and urinary acidification were reduced, and consequently bacterial clearance was limited. Together these results indicate that A-ICs, which are known to regulate acid-base metabolism, are also critical for urinary defense against pathogenic bacteria.

The discovery of this novel mechanism has potential implications for the treatment of infants with aHUS, who are increasingly treated with complement blocking agents. In this study, we used homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing to identify a novel truncating mutation in DGKE (p.K101X) in a consanguineous family with patients affected by thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by significant serum complement activation and consumption of the complement fraction C3. Aggressive plasma infusion therapy controlled systemic symptoms and prevented renal failure, suggesting that this treatment can significantly affect the natural history of this aggressive disease.

Children with a solitary functioning kidney form an important subgroup of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract patients, and a significant fraction of these children is at risk for progression to CKD. However, challenges remain in distinguishing patients with a high risk for disease progression from those patients without a high risk of disease progression. Although it is hypothesized that glomerular hyperfiltration in the lowered number of nephrons underlies the impaired renal prognosis in the solitary functioning kidney, the high proportion of ipsilateral congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract in these patients may further influence clinical outcome. Pathogenic genetic and environmental factors in renal development have increasingly been identified and may play a crucial role in establishing a correct diagnosis and prognosis for these patients. With fetal ultrasound now enabling prenatal identification of individuals with a solitary functioning kidney, an early evaluation of risk factors for renal injury would allow for differentiation between patients with and without an increased risk for CKD.
