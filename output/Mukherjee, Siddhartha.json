[{"PMID": "38885699", "Title": "Microplastics in the soil-water-food nexus: Inclusive insight into global research findings.", "Abstract": "Nuisance imposed by biotic and abiotic stressors on diverse agroecosystems remains an area of focus for the scientific fraternity. However, emerging contaminants such as microplastics (MP) have imposed additional dimension (alone or in combinations with other stressors) in agroecosystems and keep escalating the challenges to achieve sustainability. MP are recognized as persistent anthropogenic contaminants, fetch global attention due to their unique chemical features that keeps themselves unresponsive to the decaying process. This review has been theorized to assess the current research trends (along with possible gap areas), widespread use of MP, enhancement of the harshness of heavy metals (HMs), complex interactions with physico-chemical constituents of arable soil, accumulation in the edible parts of field crops, dairy products, and other sources to penetrate the food web. So far, the available review articles are oriented to a certain aspect of MP and lack a totality when considered from in soil-water-food perspective. In short, a comprehensive perspective of the adverse effects of MP on human health has been assessed. Moreover, an agro-techno-socio-health prospective-oriented critical assessment of policies and remedial measures linked with MP has provided an extra edge over other similar articles in influential future courses of research.", "Keywords": ["Crops", "Health hazard", "Microplastics", "Policy", "Remediation", "Scientometrics", "Soil", "Water"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sourav", "Last Name": "Garai", "Affiliation": "Division of Agronomy, School of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India."}, {"First Name": "Chandrima", "Last Name": "Bhattacharjee", "Affiliation": "Division of Agronomy, School of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India."}, {"First Name": "Sukamal", "Last Name": "Sarkar", "Affiliation": "Division of Agronomy, School of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

We present a simple construction of local multifractality and find that much of the dissipation field remains surprisingly monofractal \u00e0\u00a0la Kolmogorov. Multifractality appears as small islands in this calm sea, its strength growing logarithmically with the local fluctuations in energy dissipation-a seemingly universal feature.

To unlock the full potential of AML therapies, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to genetically ablate the myeloid protein CD33 from healthy donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), creating tremtelectogene empogeditemcel (trem-cel). Trem-cel is a HSPC transplant product designed to provide a reconstituted hematopoietic compartment that is resistant to anti-CD33 drug cytotoxicity. Here, we describe preclinical studies and process development of clinical-scale manufacturing of trem-cel. Preclinical data showed proof-of-concept with loss of CD33 surface protein and no impact on myeloid cell differentiation or function. At clinical scale, trem-cel could be manufactured reproducibly, routinely achieving >70% CD33 editing with no effect on cell viability, differentiation, and function. Trem-cel pharmacology studies using mouse xenograft models showed long-term engraftment, multilineage differentiation, and persistence of gene editing. Toxicology assessment revealed no adverse findings, and no significant or reproducible off-target editing events. Importantly, CD33-knockout myeloid cells were resistant to the CD33-targeted agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin in\u00a0vitro and in vivo.

In a mouse model of minimal residual disease, we showed that the novel IgGlue-BiTE greatly extended survival, and mice of this treatment group were free of leukemia in the bone marrow. These findings suggest that the IgGlue-BiTE allows for robust simultaneous engagement with both antigens of interest in a manner conducive to T cell cytotoxicity against AML.

While some \"real world\" experiences with various vaccines have been reported, to our knowledge, few have examined comparative outcomes of various vaccines in one country as new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged. Here we present an analysis of COVID-19 related outcomes from a national database in Bahrain, a country with a total population of 1.51 million, where four vaccines were deployed (total vaccinated\u2009=\u20091,003,960 adults): AstraZeneca (AZ/Covishield), Pfizer/BioNtech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V. We compare the four vaccines, based on the following post-vaccination outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths, compared to unvaccinated individuals. We conclude that the four vaccines used in Bahrain were effective in significantly reducing all four COVID-19 related outcomes compared to unvaccinated individuals, prior to, and during the period when the Delta variant predominated in the country. However, compared to the three other vaccines, individuals vaccinated with Sinopharm vaccine had a higher risk of post-vaccination infections, hospitalisations and ICU admissions (e.g., 6.94%, 2.24%, 1.99% and 1.52% of COVID-19 cases of Sinopharm, Sputnik V, Pfizer and Covishield recipients, respectively, required hospitalisation versus 13.66% of COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated individuals); however, given the confounding factors, this needs to be confirmed by further studies. We find no evidence of biased selection for any vaccine, but note waning protection of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine during the January to June 2021 period in the age\u2009>\u200960 y cohort; however, this cannot be distinguished from the overall fall in hospitalisations overall.

AML progression requires the presence of serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B) in osteoblasts and is driven by AML-secreted kynurenine, which acts as an oncometabolite and HTR1B ligand. AML cells utilize kynurenine to induce a proinflammatory state in osteoblasts that, through the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA), acts in a positive feedback loop on leukemia cells by increasing expression of IDO1-the rate-limiting enzyme for kynurenine synthesis-thereby enabling AML progression.

However, functional evidence linking SF3B1 mutations to the anemia described in MDS patients harboring this genetic aberration is weak, and the underlying mechanism is completely unknown. Using isogenic SF3B1 WT and mutant cell lines, normal human CD34 cells, and MDS patient cells, we define a previously unrecognized role of the kinase MAP3K7, encoded by a known mutant SF3B1-targeted transcript, in controlling proper terminal erythroid differentiation, and show how MAP3K7 missplicing leads to the anemia characteristic of SF3B1-mutated MDS, although not to ringed sideroblast formation. We found that p38 MAPK is deactivated in SF3B1 mutant isogenic and patient cells and that MAP3K7 is an upstream positive effector of p38 MAPK. We demonstrate that disruption of this MAP3K7-p38 MAPK pathway leads to premature down-regulation of GATA1, a master regulator of erythroid differentiation, and that this is sufficient to trigger accelerated differentiation, erythroid hyperplasia, and ultimately apoptosis.

Current communication deals with a novel approach to identify a suitable management option for rejuvenating the contaminated soils. In this background, a 60-days incubation experiment was conducted with different fly ash-soil mixtures (50 + 50%, A1; 75 + 25%, A2; 100 + 0%, A3) along with four ameliorants, namely, lime (T1), sodium sulphide (T2), di-ammonium phosphate (T3), and humic acid (T4) at 30 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C to assess the ability of different fly ash-soil-ameliorant mixtures in reducing bio-availability of HMs. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable bio-available HM contents for lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) and their respective ratios to total HM contents under the influence of different treatments were estimated at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days of incubation. Further, the eco-toxicological impact of different treatments on soil microbial properties was studied after 60 days of experimentation. A1T1 significantly recorded the lowest bio-availability of HMs (~49-233% lower) followed by A2T1 (~35-133%) among the treatments. The principal component analysis also confirmed the superiority of A1T1 and A2T1 in this regard.

With the success of adoptive cell therapies including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in treating certain B-cell malignancies, these therapeutic approaches are also being tested for myeloid malignancies, but the preclinical and limited clinical trial data suggest there are significant challenges. The principal hurdle to efficient targeted immunotherapy approaches is the lack of a unique targetable antigen on cancer cells leading to off-target effects including myelosuppression due to depletion of normal myeloid cells.

However, upon DNA damage, levels of p53 dramatically increase for its activation. Although robust stabilization of p53 serves as a \"trademark\" for DNA damage responses, the requirement for such dramatic protein stabilization in tumor suppression has not been well addressed. Here we generated a mutant p53KQ mouse where all the C-terminal domain lysine residues were mutated to glutamines (K to Q mutations at K367, K369, K370, K378, K379, K383, and K384) to mimic constitutive acetylation of the p53 C-terminus. Because of p53 activation, p53KQ/KQ mice were perinatal lethal, yet this lethality was averted in p53KQ/- mice, which displayed normal postnatal development. Nevertheless, p53KQ/- mice died prematurely due to anemia and hematopoiesis failure. Further analyses indicated that expression of the acetylation-mimicking p53 mutant in vivo induces activation of p53 targets in various tissues without obviously increasing p53 levels. In the well-established pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) mouse model, expression of the acetylation-mimicking p53-mutant protein effectively suppressed K-Ras-induced PDAC development in the absence of robust p53 stabilization. Together, our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that p53-mediated transcriptional function and tumor suppression can be achieved independently of its robust stabilization and reveal an alternative approach to activate p53 function for therapeutic purposes.

To date, the nature and cellular composition of the BM tumor microenvironment and the critical factors which drive tumor progression remain imprecisely defined. Our studies show that Gremlin1 (Grem1), a highly conserved protein, which is abundantly secreted by a subset of BM mesenchymal stromal cells, plays a critical role in MM disease development. Analysis of human and mouse BM stromal samples by quantitative PCR showed that GREM1/Grem1 expression was significantly higher in the MM tumor-bearing cohorts compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Additionally, BM-stromal cells cultured with 5TGM1 MM PC line expressed significantly higher levels of Grem1, compared to stromal cells alone (p < 0.01, t-test), suggesting that MM PCs promote increased Grem1 expression in stromal cells. Furthermore, the proliferation of 5TGM1 MM PCs was found to be significantly increased when co-cultured with Grem1-overexpressing stromal cells (p < 0.01, t-test). To examine the role of Grem1 in MM disease in vivo, we utilized the 5TGM1/KaLwRij mouse model of MM.

Leukemic cell dependence on Aldh3a2 was seen across multiple mouse and human myeloid leukemias.

Intriguingly, cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles can manifest either anti- or pro-oxidant activity as a function of differential pH of various subcellular localizations. In an acidic pH environment, for example, in extracellular milieu of cancer cells, CeO2 would function as a pro-oxidant. Based on this concept, the present study is designed to investigate the pro-oxidant activities of CeO2 in human colorectal carcinoma cell line (HCT 116). For comparison, we have also studied the effect of ceria nanoparticles on human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Dose-dependent viability of cancerous as well as normal cells has been assessed by treating them independently with CeO2 nanoparticles of different concentrations (5-100 \u03bcg/mL) in the culture media. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of nanoceria for HCT 116 is found to be 50.48 \u03bcg/mL while that for the HEK 293 cell line is 92.03 \u03bcg/mL. To understand the intricate molecular mechanisms of CeO2-induced cellular apoptosis, a series of experiments have been conducted. The apoptosis-inducing ability of nanoceria has been investigated by Annexin V-FITC staining, caspase 3/9 analysis, cytochrome c release, intracellular ROS analysis, and mitochondrial membrane potential analysis using flow cytometry. Experimental data suggest that CeO2 treatment causes DNA fragmentation through enhanced generation of ROS, which ultimately leads to cellular apoptosis through the p53-dependent mitochondrial signaling pathway.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aparna", "Last Name": "Datta", "Affiliation": "School of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, Jadavpur University, 188, Raja S.C.

Here, we present an approach to treat AML by targeting the lineage-specific myeloid antigen CD33. Our approach combines CD33-targeted CAR-T cells, or the ADC Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin with the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells that have been engineered to ablate CD33 expression using genomic engineering methods. We show highly efficient genetic ablation of CD33 antigen using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in human stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and provide evidence that the deletion of CD33 in HSPC doesn't impair their ability to engraft and to repopulate a functional multilineage hematopoietic system in vivo. Whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing analysis revealed no detectable off-target mutagenesis and no loss of functional p53 pathways. Using a human AML cell line (HL-60), we modeled a postremission marrow with minimal residual disease and showed that the transplantation of CD33-ablated HSPCs with CD33-targeted immunotherapy leads to leukemia clearance, without myelosuppression, as demonstrated by the engraftment and recovery of multilineage descendants of CD33-ablated HSPCs.

While a judicious patterning of surface charges may obviate some of the concerning challenges, the consequent improvement in solute dispersion may turn out to be marginal. Here, we show that by exploiting a unique coupling of patterned surface charges with intrinsically induced thermal gradients, it may be possible to realize giant augmentations in solute dispersion in electro-osmotic flows. This is effectively mediated by the phenomena of Joule heating and surface heat dissipation, so as to induce local variations in electrical properties. Combined with the rheological premises of a viscoelastic fluid that are typically reminiscent of common biofluids handled in lab-on-a-chip-based micro-devices, our results demonstrate that the consequent electro-hydrodynamic forcing may open up favourable windows for augmented hydrodynamic dispersion, which has not yet been unveiled.", "Keywords": ["dispersion", "electrothermal effect", "viscoelastic fluid"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Advanced Technology Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India."}, {"First Name": "Jayabrata", "Last Name": "Dhar", "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India."}, {"First Name": "Sunando", "Last Name": "DasGupta", "Affiliation": "Advanced Technology Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India."}, {"First Name": "Suman", "Last Name": "Chakraborty", "Affiliation": "Advanced Technology Development Center, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India."}], "Journal": "Proceedings.

However, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has resulted in variable clinical responses, raising the possibility of an inherent mechanism of resistance to treatment. As p110\u03b1 mediates virtually all cellular responses to insulin, targeted inhibition of this enzyme disrupts glucose metabolism in multiple tissues. For example, blocking insulin signalling promotes glycogen breakdown in the liver and prevents glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in transient hyperglycaemia within a few hours of PI3K inhibition. The effect is usually transient because compensatory insulin release from the pancreas (insulin feedback) restores normal glucose homeostasis3. However, the hyperglycaemia may be exacerbated or prolonged in patients with any degree of insulin resistance and, in these cases, necessitates discontinuation of therapy3-6. We hypothesized that insulin feedback induced by PI3K inhibitors may reactivate the PI3K-mTOR signalling axis in tumours, thereby compromising treatment effectiveness7,8. Here we show, in several model tumours in mice, that systemic glucose-insulin feedback caused by targeted inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to activate PI3K signalling, even in the presence of PI3K inhibitors. This insulin feedback can be prevented using dietary or pharmaceutical approaches, which greatly enhance the efficacy/toxicity ratios of PI3K inhibitors.

In addition, the role of the bone marrow stroma in regulating clinical responses to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) is also poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a DNA methylome analysis of bone marrow-derived stromal cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and observed widespread aberrant cytosine hypermethylation occurring preferentially outside CpG islands. Stroma derived from 5-azacytidine-treated patients lacked aberrant methylation and DNMTi treatment of primary MDS stroma enhanced its ability to support erythroid differentiation. An integrative expression analysis revealed that the WNT pathway antagonist FRZB was aberrantly hypermethylated and underexpressed in MDS stroma. This result was confirmed in an independent set of sorted, primary MDS-derived mesenchymal cells. We documented a WNT/\u03b2-catenin activation signature in CD34+ cells from advanced cases of MDS, where it associated with adverse prognosis. Constitutive activation of \u03b2-catenin in hematopoietic cells yielded lethal myeloid disease in a NUP98-HOXD13 mouse model of MDS, confirming its role in disease progression. Our results define novel epigenetic changes in the bone marrow microenvironment, which lead to \u03b2-catenin activation and disease progression of MDS.

facilitating tumor escape from immunoediting. We have identified a genetically and functionally distinct subset of dynamic bone marrow myeloid cells that are characterized by histidine decarboxylase (HDC) expression. Lineage tracing in Hdc-CreERT2;R26-LSL-tdTomato mice revealed that in homeostasis, there is a strong bias by HDC+ myeloid cells toward the CD11b+Ly6Ghi granulocytic lineage, which was accelerated during azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced colonic carcinogenesis. More importantly, HDC+ myeloid cells strongly promoted colonic tumorigenesis, and colon tumor progression was profoundly suppressed by diphtheria toxin A (DTA)-mediated depletion of HDC+ granulocytic myeloid cells. In addition, tumor infiltration by Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) was markedly impaired following HDC+ myeloid cell depletion. We identified an HDC+ myeloid-derived Cxcl13/Cxcr5 axis that mediated Foxp3 expression and Treg proliferation. Ablation of HDC+ myeloid cells or disruption of the Cxcl13/Cxcr5 axis by gene knockdown impaired the production and recruitment of Tregs. Cxcl13 induction of Foxp3 expression in Tregs during tumorigenesis was associated with Stat3 phosphorylation. Overall, HDC+ granulocytic myeloid cells affect CD8+ T cells directly and indirectly through the modulation of Tregs and thus appear to play key roles in suppressing tumoricidal immunity.", "Keywords": ["Colitis-associated colorectal cancer", "Cxcl13/Cxcr5 axis", "HDC+ myeloid cells", "immunosuppression", "regulatory T cells"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaowei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yoshihiro", "Last Name": "Takemoto", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Surgery and Clinical Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Huan", "Last Name": "Deng", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Pathology, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}, {"First Name": "Moritz", "Last Name": "Middelhoff", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Friedman", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy H", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Churchill", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yan", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karan K", "Last Name": "Nagar", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yagnesh H", "Last Name": "Tailor", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Disease, Department of Medicine and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Oncoimmunology", "PubDate": "2017"}, {"PMID": "27841873", "Title": "DNMT3A mutations promote anthracycline resistance in acute myeloid leukemia via impaired nucleosome remodeling.", "Abstract": "Although the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initially respond to chemotherapy, many of them subsequently relapse, and the mechanistic basis for AML persistence following chemotherapy has not been determined. Recurrent somatic mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), most frequently at arginine 882 (DNMT3AR882), have been observed in AML and in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis in the absence of leukemic transformation. Patients with DNMT3AR882 AML have an inferior outcome when treated with standard-dose daunorubicin-based induction chemotherapy, suggesting that DNMT3AR882 cells persist and drive relapse. We found that Dnmt3a mutations induced hematopoietic stem cell expansion, cooperated with mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (Flt3ITD) and the nucleophosmin gene (Npm1c) to induce AML in vivo, and promoted resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. In patients with AML, the presence of DNMT3AR882 mutations predicts minimal residual disease, underscoring their role in AML chemoresistance. DNMT3AR882 cells showed impaired nucleosome eviction and chromatin remodeling in response to anthracycline treatment, which resulted from attenuated recruitment of histone chaperone SPT-16 following anthracycline exposure. This defect led to an inability to sense and repair DNA torsional stress, which resulted in increased mutagenesis.

Therapies that overcome differentiation arrest represent a powerful treatment strategy. We leveraged the observation that the majority of AML, despite their genetically heterogeneity, share in the expression of HoxA9, a gene normally downregulated during myeloid differentiation. Using a conditional HoxA9 model system, we performed a high-throughput phenotypic screen and defined compounds that overcame differentiation blockade. Target identification led to the unanticipated discovery that inhibition of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enables myeloid differentiation in human and mouse AML models. In\u00a0vivo, DHODH inhibitors reduced leukemic cell burden, decreased levels of leukemia-initiating cells, and improved survival. These data demonstrate the role of DHODH as a metabolic regulator of differentiation and point to its inhibition as a strategy for overcoming differentiation blockade in AML.", "Keywords": ["HoxA9", "acute myeloid leukemia", "brequinar", "differentiation", "dihydroorotate dehydrogenase", "high-throughput screen", "leukemia-initiating cell", "metabolic inhibitor", "phenotypic screen"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Differentiation", "Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Mice", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Myeloid Cells", "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors", "Pyrimidines", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Sykes", "Affiliation": "Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.

There is no effective treatment available partly because of the complexity of the system. Implementation of multifunctional micro- and nano-device based combinatorial therapeutics can provide biocompatible and tunable approaches to perform on-demand release of specific drugs. This can help the damaged cells to improve neuronal survival, regeneration of axons, and their reconnection to appropriate targets. Nano-topological features induced rapid cell growth is especially important towards the design of effective platforms to facilitate damaged neural circuit reconstruction. In this study, for the first time, feasibility of neuron-like PC12 cell growth on untreated and easy to prepare nanotextured surfaces has been carried out. The PC12 neuron-like cells were cultured on micro reactive ion etched\u00a0 nanotextured glass coverslips. The effect of nanotextured topology as physical cue for the growth of PC12 cells was observed exclusively, eliminating the possible influence(s) of the enhanced concentration of coated materials on the surface. The cell density was observed to increase by almost 200% on nanotextured coverslips compared to plain coverslips. The morphology study indicated that PC12 cell attachment and growth on the nanotextured substrates did not launch any apoptotic machinery of the cell. Less than 5% cells deformed and depicted condensed nuclei with apoptotic bodies on nanotextured surfaces which is typical for the normal cell handling and culture. Enhanced PC12 cell proliferation by such novel and easy to prepare substrates is not only attractive for neurite outgrowth and guidance, but may be used to increase the affinity of similar cancerous cells (ex: B35 neuroblastoma) and rapid proliferation thereafter-towards the development of combinatorial theranostics to diagnose and treat aggressive cancers like neuroblastoma.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Neurons", "PC12 Cells", "Rats"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Muhymin", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "Nano-Bio Lab, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA.

This longer Atg7 mRNA is translated inefficiently, leading to decreased ATG7 levels and an autophagy defect that predisposes cells to secondary mutations, resulting in transformation. MDS and acute myeloid leukemia patient samples harboring U2AF35(S34F) have a similar increased use of the ATG7 distal CP site, and previous studies have shown that mice with hematopoietic cells lacking Atg7 develop an MDS-like syndrome.

While mast cells (MC) store and secrete histamine, immature myeloid cells (IMC) are the major site of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) expression, the enzyme responsible for histamine production. From our earlier work, we hypothesized that histamine is central to the association between allergy and colorectal carcinogenesis through its influence on the MC-MDSC axis. Here, we show that in wild type (WT) mice, ovalbumin (OVA) immunization elicits a typical TH2 response. In contrast, in HDC-/- mice, the response to OVA allergy is skewed towards infiltration by IL-17 expressing MCs. This response is inhibited by histamine treatment. The HDC-/- allergic IL-17-expressing MCs promote MDSC proliferation and upregulation of Cox-2 and Arg-1. OVA allergy in HDC-/- mice increases the growth of colon tumor cells in both the MC38 tumor cell implantation model and the AOM/DSS carcinogenesis model. Taken together, our results show that histamine represses IL-17-expressing MCs and their subsequent activation of MDSCs, attenuating the risk of colorectal cancer in the setting of food allergy.

SRSF2 mutations are frequently found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and certain leukemias, but how these mutations affect SRSF2 function has only begun to be examined. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease to introduce the P95H mutation to SRSF2 in K562 leukemia cells, generating an isogenic model so that splicing alterations can be attributed solely to mutant SRSF2. We found that SRSF2 (P95H) misregulates 548 splicing events (<1% of total). Of these events, 374 involved the inclusion of cassette exons, and the inclusion was either increased (206) or decreased (168). We detected a specific motif (UCCA/UG) enriched in the more-included exons and a distinct motif (UGGA/UG) in the more-excluded exons. RNA gel shift assays showed that a mutant SRSF2 derivative bound more tightly than its wild-type counterpart to RNA sites containing UCCAG but bound less tightly to UGGAG sites. Thus in most cases the pattern of exon inclusion or exclusion correlated with stronger or weaker RNA binding, respectively. We further show that the P95H mutation does not affect other functions of SRSF2, i.e., protein-protein interactions with key splicing factors. Our results thus demonstrate that the P95H mutation positively or negatively alters the binding affinity of SRSF2 for cognate RNA sites in target transcripts, leading to misregulation of exon inclusion.

A novel mutation caused resistance, suggesting a binding site distinct from known Eg5 inhibitors, and BRD9876 inhibited only microtubule-bound Eg5. Eg5 phosphorylation, which increases microtubule binding, uniquely enhanced BRD9876 activity. MM cells have greater phosphorylated Eg5 than hematopoietic cells, consistent with increased vulnerability specifically to BRD9876's mode of action.

Herein, we show that homozygous deletion of the miR-29a/b-1 bicistron results in decreased numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), decreased HSC self-renewal, and increased HSC cell cycling and apoptosis. The HSPC phenotype is specifically due to loss of miR-29a, because miR-29b expression is unaltered in miR-29a/b-1-null HSCs, and only ectopic expression of miR-29a restores HSPC function both in vitro and in vivo. HSCs lacking miR-29a/b-1 exhibit widespread transcriptional dysregulation and adopt gene expression patterns similar to normal committed progenitors. A number of predicted miR-29 target genes, including Dnmt3a, are significantly upregulated in miR-29a/b-1-null HSCs. The loss of negative regulation of Dnmt3a by miR-29a is a major contributor to the miR-29a/b-1-null HSPC phenotype, as both in vitro Dnmt3a short hairpin RNA knockdown assays and a genetic haploinsufficiency model of Dnmt3a restored the frequency and long-term reconstitution capacity of HSCs from miR-29a/b-1-deficient mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that miR-29a is critical for maintaining HSC function through its negative regulation of Dnmt3a.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases", "DNA Methyltransferase 3A", "Flow Cytometry", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hematopoiesis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "MicroRNAs", "Phenotype", "RNA, Messenger", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wenhuo", "Last Name": "Hu", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Dooley", "Affiliation": "Autoimmune Genetics Laboratory, Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut Voor Biotechnologie, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium;"}, {"First Name": "Stephen S", "Last Name": "Chung", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Dhruva", "Last Name": "Chandramohan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Luisa", "Last Name": "Cimmino", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York University, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Siddhartha", "Last Name": "Mukherjee", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Mason", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;"}, {"First Name": "Bart", "Last Name": "de Strooper", "Affiliation": "Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut Voor Biotechnologie, Center for the Biology of Disease, Leuven, Belgium; Center for Human Genetics and Leuven Institute for Neuroscience and Disease, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; and."}, {"First Name": "Adrian", "Last Name": "Liston", "Affiliation": "Autoimmune Genetics Laboratory, Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut Voor Biotechnologie, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium;"}, {"First Name": "Christopher Y", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2015Apr02"}, {"PMID": "25594183", "Title": "Gremlin 1 identifies a skeletal stem cell with bone, cartilage, and reticular stromal potential.", "Abstract": "The stem cells that maintain and repair the postnatal skeleton remain undefined.

Further, genetic depletion of osteoblasts in mouse models of acute leukemia increased circulating blasts and tumor engraftment in the marrow and spleen leading to higher tumor burden and shorter survival.

Here we show that an activating mutation of \u03b2-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated \u03b2-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased \u03b2-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anemia", "Animals", "Base Sequence", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage",

high-throughput screening systems that reflect the complex physiology of the disease, including leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and supportive interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment. The therapeutic targeting of LSCs is challenging because LSCs are highly similar to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and are protected by stromal cells in vivo. We screened 14,718 compounds in a leukemia-stroma co-culture system for inhibition of cobblestone formation, a cellular behavior associated with stem-cell function. Among those compounds that inhibited malignant cells but spared HSPCs was the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Lovastatin showed anti-LSC activity in vitro and in an in vivo bone marrow transplantation model. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effect was on target, via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. These results illustrate the power of merging physiologically relevant models with high-throughput screening.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug
