SPOUT1/CENP-32 depletion leads to centrosome detachment from the spindle poles and chromosome misalignment. Aided by gene matching platforms, we identified 24 individuals with neurodevelopmental delays from 18 families with bi-allelic variants in SPOUT1/CENP-32 detected by exome/genome sequencing. Zebrafish spout1/cenp-32 mutants showed reduction in larval head size with concomitant apoptosis likely associated with altered cell cycle progression. In vivo complementation assays in zebrafish indicated that SPOUT1/CENP-32 missense variants identified in humans are pathogenic. Crystal structure analysis of SPOUT1/CENP-32 revealed that most disease-associated missense variants mapped to the catalytic domain. Additionally, SPOUT1/CENP-32 recurrent missense variants had reduced methyltransferase activity in vitro and compromised centrosome tethering to the spindle poles in human cells. Thus, SPOUT1/CENP-32 pathogenic variants cause an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder: SpADMiSS ( SPOUT1 Associated Development delay Microcephaly Seizures Short stature) underpinned by

Through international clinical matchmaking and interrogation of public variant databases we assembled a database of 90 rare CLCN4 missense variants in 90 families: 41 unique and 18 recurrent variants in 49 families. For 43 families, including 22 males and 33 females, we collated detailed clinical and segregation data. To confirm causality of variants and to obtain insight into disease mechanisms, we investigated the effect on electrophysiological properties of 59 of the variants in Xenopus oocytes using extended voltage and pH ranges. Detailed analyses revealed new pathophysiological mechanisms: 25% (15/59) of variants demonstrated LOF, characterized by a \"shift\" of the voltage-dependent activation to more positive voltages, and nine variants resulted in a toxic gain-of-function, associated with a disrupted gate allowing inward transport at negative voltages. Functional results were not always in line with in silico pathogenicity scores, highlighting the complexity of pathogenicity assessment for accurate genetic counselling. The complex neurocognitive and psychiatric manifestations of this condition, and hitherto under-recognized impacts on growth, gastrointestinal function, and motor control are discussed. Including published cases, we summarize features in 122 individuals from 67 families with CLCN4-related neurodevelopmental condition and suggest future research directions with the aim of improving the integrated care for individuals with this diagnosis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Female", "Humans", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Mutation, Missense", "Genes, X-Linked",

Pathogenic somatic variants have been identified in many genes within the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-signalling pathway in individuals with hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia (type II), and more recently in SLC35A2 in individuals with focal cortical dysplasia (type I) or non-dysplastic epileptic cortex. Given the expanding role of somatic variants across different brain malformations, we sought to delineate the landscape of somatic variants in a large cohort of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery with hemimegalencephaly or focal cortical dysplasia. We evaluated samples from 123 children with hemimegalencephaly (n\u2009=\u200916), focal cortical dysplasia type I and related phenotypes (n\u2009=\u200948), focal cortical dysplasia type II (n\u2009=\u200944), or focal cortical dysplasia type III (n\u2009=\u200915). We performed high-depth exome sequencing in brain tissue-derived DNA from each case and identified somatic single nucleotide, indel and large copy number variants. In 75% of individuals with hemimegalencephaly and 29% with focal cortical dysplasia type II, we identified pathogenic variants in PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes. Four of 48 cases with focal cortical dysplasia type I (8%) had a likely pathogenic variant in SLC35A2. While no other gene had multiple disease-causing somatic variants across the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort, four individuals in this group had a single pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variant in CASK, KRAS, NF1 and NIPBL, genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. No rare pathogenic or likely pathogenic somatic variants in any neurological disease genes like those identified in the focal cortical dysplasia type I cohort were found in 63 neurologically normal controls (P\u2009=\u20090.017), suggesting a role for these novel variants. We also identified a somatic loss-of-function variant in the known epilepsy gene, PCDH19, present in a small number of alleles in the dysplastic tissue from a female patient with focal cortical dysplasia IIIa with hippocampal sclerosis. In contrast to focal cortical dysplasia type II, neither focal cortical dysplasia type I nor III had somatic variants in genes that converge on a unifying biological pathway, suggesting greater genetic heterogeneity compared to type II. Importantly, we demonstrate that focal cortical dysplasia types I, II and III are associated with somatic gene variants across a broad range of genes, many associated with epilepsy in clinical syndromes caused by germline variants, as well as including some not previously associated with radiographically evident cortical brain malformations.", "Keywords": ["epilepsy", "exome sequencing",

Information about developmental outcomes has been limited by the young age and short follow-up for many of the previously reported cases, and further delineation of the spectrum of associated phenotypes is needed. We present 25 new patients with variants in CSNK2B and refine the associated NDD and epilepsy phenotypes. CSNK2B variants were identified by research or clinical exome sequencing, and investigators from different centers were connected via GeneMatcher. Most individuals had developmental delay and generalized epilepsy with onset in the first 2 years. However, we found a broad spectrum of phenotypic severity, ranging from early normal development with pharmacoresponsive seizures to profound intellectual disability with intractable epilepsy and recurrent refractory status epilepticus. These findings suggest that CSNK2B should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with a broad range of NDD with treatable or intractable seizures.", "Keywords": ["CSNK2A1", "CK2",

KCNQ2 variants account for the majority of pedigrees with BFNE and KCNQ3 variants are responsible for a much smaller subgroup, but the reasons for this imbalance remain unclear. Analysis of additional pedigrees is needed to further clarify the nature of this genetic heterogeneity and to improve prediction of pathogenicity for novel variants. We identified a BFNE family with two siblings and a parent affected. Exome sequencing on samples from both parents and siblings revealed a novel KCNQ3 variant (c.719T>G; p.M240R), segregating in the three affected individuals. The M240 residue is conserved among human Kv7.2-5 and lies between the two arginines (R5 and R6) closest to the intracellular side of the voltage-sensing S4 transmembrane segment. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells revealed that homomeric Kv7.3 M240R channels were not functional, whereas heteromeric channels incorporating Kv7.3 M240R mutant subunits with Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 displayed a depolarizing shift of about 10 mV in activation gating. Molecular modeling results suggested that the M240R substitution preferentially stabilized the resting state and possibly destabilized the activated state of the Kv7.3 subunits, a result consistent with functional data. Exposure to \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body generated during the ketogenic diet (KD), reversed channel dysfunction induced by the M240R variant. In conclusion, we describe the first missense loss-of-function (LoF) pathogenic variant within the S4 segment of Kv7.3 identified in patients with BFNE. Studied under conditions mimicking heterozygosity, the M240R variant mainly affects the voltage sensitivity, in contrast to previously analyzed BFNE Kv7.3 variants that reduce current density. Our pharmacological results provide a rationale for the use of KD in patients carrying LoF variants in Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 subunits.", "Keywords": ["BFNE", "KCNQ", "channelopathies", "encephalopathy", "ketogenic diet"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Miceli", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Naples \"Federico II\", Naples, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Lidia", "Last Name": "Carotenuto", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Naples \"Federico II\", Naples, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo", "Last Name": "Barrese", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Naples \"Federico II\", Naples, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Maria Virginia", "Last Name": "Soldovieri", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and Health Science, University of Molise, Campobasso, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Erin L", "Last Name": "Heinzen", "Affiliation": "Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States."}, {"First Name": "Arthur M", "Last Name": "Mandel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Natalie", "Last Name": "Lippa", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Louise", "Last Name": "Bier", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "David B", "Last Name": "Goldstein", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Edward C", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology, Neuroscience, and Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States."}, {"First Name": "Maria Roberta", "Last Name": "Cilio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Institute of Experimental and Clinical Research, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Maurizio", "Last Name": "Taglialatela", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Naples \"Federico II\", Naples, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Tristan T", "Last Name": "Sands", "Affiliation": "Institute for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in physiology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32611646", "Title": "Association of guideline publication and delays to treatment in pediatric status epilepticus.", "Abstract": "To determine whether publication of evidence on delays in time to treatment shortens time to treatment in pediatric refractory convulsive status epilepticus (rSE), we compared time to treatment before (2011-2014) and after (2015-2019) publication of evidence of delays in treatment of rSE in the Pediatric Status Epilepticus Research Group (pSERG) as assessed by patient interviews and record review.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Anticonvulsants", "Benzodiazepines", "Cerebral Palsy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Developmental Disabilities", "Emergency Medical Services", "Epilepsy", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Hospital Mortality", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Infant", "Infusions, Intravenous", "Intellectual Disability", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Professional Practice Gaps", "Retrospective Studies", "Status Epilepticus", "Time-to-Treatment", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Iv\u00e1n", "Last Name": "S\u00e1nchez Fern\u00e1ndez", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Epilepsy and Clinical Neurophysiology (I.S.F., M.A.-G., C.B.A., J.C., M.G.-L., A.V., T.L.), Department of Neurology, and Department of Neurology (R.C.T.), Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, MA;

First described 60 years ago, RE continues to present challenges in diagnosis and management. RE causes a unilateral focal epilepsy in children that typically becomes medically refractory, results in significant hemiparesis, and causes progressive cognitive decline. The etiology is a cell-mediated immune attack on one cerebral hemisphere, though the inciting antigen remains unknown. While the underlying histopathology is unilateral and RE is described as \"unihemispheric,\" studies have demonstrated (1) atrophy of the unaffected hemisphere, (2) electroencephalographic abnormalities (slowing and spikes) in the unaffected hemisphere, and (3) cognitive decline referable to the unaffected hemisphere. These secondary contralateral effects likely reflect the impact of uncontrolled epileptic activity (i.e., epileptic encephalopathy). Hemispheric disconnection (HD) renders 70 to 80% of patients seizure free. While it has the potential to limit the influence of seizures and abnormal electrical activity emanating from the pathological hemisphere, HD entails hemiparesis and hemianopia, as well as aphasia for patients with dominant HD. With the recent expansion of available immunomodulatory therapies, there has been interest in identifying an alternative to HD, though evidence for disease modification is limited to date.

indication for diagnostic genetic testing. Within the larger ClinGen framework, the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel is tasked with connecting two increasingly separate fields: the domain of traditional clinical epileptology, with its own established language and classification criteria, and the rapidly evolving area of diagnostic genetic testing that adheres to formal criteria for gene and variant curation. We identify critical components unique to the epilepsy gene curation effort, including: (a) precise phenotype definitions within existing disease and phenotype ontologies; (b) consideration of when epilepsy should be curated as a distinct disease entity; (c) strategies for gene selection; and (d) emerging rules for evaluating functional models for seizure disorders. Given that de novo variants play a prominent role in many of the epilepsies, sufficient genetic evidence is often awarded early in the curation process. Therefore, the emphasis of gene curation is frequently shifted toward an iterative precuration process to better capture phenotypic associations. We demonstrate that within the spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, gene curation for epilepsy-associated genes is feasible and suggest epilepsy-specific conventions, laying the groundwork for a curation process of all major epilepsy-associated genes.", "Keywords": ["ClinGen/Clinical Genome Resource", "clinical validity", "epilepsy", "epileptic encephalopathy", "gene-disease association"], "MeSH terms": ["Epilepsy", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Mutation", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ingo", "Last Name": "Helbig", "Affiliation": "Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erin Rooney", "Last Name": "Riggs", "Affiliation": "Autism & Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carrie-Anne", "Last Name": "Barry", "Affiliation": "Autism & Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karl Martin", "Last Name": "Klein", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Epilepsy Center Frankfurt Rhine-Main, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Dyment", "Affiliation": "Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Courtney", "Last Name": "Thaxton", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bekim", "Last Name": "Sadikovic", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Western University Molecular Genetic Laboratory, London Health Sciences, London, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Tristan T", "Last Name": "Sands", "Affiliation": "Division of Child Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jacy L", "Last Name": "Wagnon", "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."}, {"First Name": "Khalida", "Last Name": "Liaquat", "Affiliation": "Quest Diagnostics, Athena Diagnostics, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria Roberta", "Last Name": "Cilio", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics and Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ghayda", "Last Name": "Mirzaa", "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Brain Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA."}, {"First Name": "Erika", "Last Name": "Axeen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Butler", "Affiliation": "GeneDx, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tanya M", "Last Name": "Bardakjian", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pasquale", "Last Name": "Striano", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Neurology and Muscular Diseases Unit, DINOGMI-Department of Neurosciences, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, \"G.

with GNB1 mutations: Clinical data on 18 newly identified patients and review of the literature.", "Abstract": "De novo germline mutations in GNB1 have been associated with a neurodevelopmental phenotype. To date, 28 patients with variants classified as pathogenic have been reported. We add 18 patients with de novo mutations to this cohort, including a patient with mosaicism for a GNB1 mutation who presented with a milder phenotype. Consistent with previous reports, developmental delay in these patients was moderate to severe, and more than half of the patients were non-ambulatory and nonverbal. The most observed substitution affects the p.Ile80 residue encoded in exon 6, with 28% of patients carrying a variant at this residue. Dystonia and growth delay were observed more frequently in patients carrying variants in this residue, suggesting a potential genotype-phenotype correlation. In the new cohort of 18 patients, 50% of males had genitourinary anomalies and 61% of patients had gastrointestinal anomalies, suggesting a possible association of these findings with variants in GNB1. In addition, cutaneous mastocytosis, reported once before in a patient with a GNB1 variant, was observed in three additional patients, providing further evidence for an association to GNB1. We will review clinical and molecular data of these new cases and all previously reported cases to further define the phenotype and establish possible genotype-phenotype correlations.", "Keywords":

This defect may disrupt cortical development (e.g., lissencephaly, focal cortical dysplasia), lead to metabolic changes (e.g., pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, sulfite oxidase deficiency) or lead to cortical dysfunction without metabolic or macroscopic structural changes (e.g., channelopathies, STXBP1). Historically, studies on treatment response and long-term consequences of neonatal seizures have lumped all etiologies together. However, etiology has been consistently shown to be the most important determinant of outcome. Here, we address the elements differentiating neonatal-onset epilepsies from acute symptomatic seizures. We review some common neonatal-onset epilepsies and emphasize how pathognomonic electro-clinical phenotypes such as the ones associated with KCNQ2 or KCNT1 gene mutation, when recognized early, can lead to targeted diagnostic testing and precision medicine treatment, enabling the possibility of improved outcome.", "Keywords": ["Epilepsy", "Genetic diseases", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Metabolic diseases", "Newborn", "Seizure"], "MeSH terms": ["Anticonvulsants", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Marie-Coralie", "Last Name": "Cornet", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tristan T", "Last Name": "Sands", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria Roberta", "Last Name": "Cilio", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.
