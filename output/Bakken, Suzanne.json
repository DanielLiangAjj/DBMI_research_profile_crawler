As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods.

Incongruencies in communication styles between patients with limited English proficiency (LEP), interpreters, and providers contribute to significant disparities in pain care and outcomes. This study's purpose is to evaluate and refine a culturally appropriate InfoViz pain quality assessment tool for LEP Hmong patients. We conducted a three-part iterative user-centered study with LEP Hmong, bilingual Hmong, and Hmong interpreters with (1) participatory design sessions to evaluate and refine pain infographics for inclusion on the tool, (2) card-sorting to organize the infographics to match the mental models of LEP patients, and (3) a tool assessment to identify which tool accurately represented LEP patients' mental models and was preferred in clinical settings. Fifty-five participants provided three common themes for pain infographics refinement: culturally-relevant colors, infographics resembling human anatomy, and action-specific squiggle lines.

Developing culturally appropriate national public health services for Hispanic persons remains a challenge. This study examined the association of heritage and language preference with COVID-19 testing (tested vs. not tested) and vaccination (vaccinated vs. not vaccinated) outcomes among Hispanic participants from 18 Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics-Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) projects (n\u00a0=\u00a03308; mean age\u00a0=\u00a044.1\u00a0years [SD\u00a0=\u00a014.9], 60% women; 83% spoke other than English at home). Generalized estimating equation models adjusted for age, gender, education level, income, insurance coverage, geographic region, comorbidities, and prior infection. Relative to Mexican heritage, individuals identifying as Puerto Rican or Dominican were more likely to test for COVID-19, and South American heritage was associated with higher testing and vaccination rates. Speaking Spanish or another language at home was associated with increased testing compared with speaking English at home for individuals who preferred not to report their heritage, and increased vaccination for those with Mexican, Cuban, or Central American heritage. This study highlights heterogeneity in testing and vaccination behaviors among Hispanic populations based on heritage and language preference, underscoring the diversity within the U.S. Hispanic community. In contrast to other studies on linguistic acculturation and health care utilization, our study found that a language other than English spoken at home was associated with greater vaccine uptake. That is, enculturation - the retention of Spanish language and presumably of Hispanic cultural norms - was linked with being vaccinated.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "Heritage", "Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish", "Testing", "Vaccination", "Vulnerable populations"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily M", "Last Name": "D'Agostino", "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Occupational Therapy Doctorate Division, Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jorge Ramirez", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Oregon Research Institute & Prevention Science Institute, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne R", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa", "Last Name": "Wruck", "Affiliation": "Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ester Kim", "Last Name": "Nilles", "Affiliation": "Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Troy A", "Last Name": "Stefano", "Affiliation": "Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haley R", "Last Name": "Martin", "Affiliation": "Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Annette", "Last Name": "Hungler", "Affiliation": "Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rebecca E", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Krista M", "Last Name": "Perreira", "Affiliation": "Department of Social Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marianna K", "Last Name": "Baum", "Affiliation": "Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Brown", "Affiliation": "Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA."}], "Journal": "Preventive medicine reports", "PubDate": "2023Oct"}, {"PMID": "37337923", "Title": "AI in health: keeping the human in the loop.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Artificial Intelligence"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA", "PubDate": "2023Jun20"}, {"PMID": "37205729", "Title": "Informatics and data science approaches address significant public health problems.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Public Health", "Data Science", "Medical Informatics", "Public Health Informatics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA", "PubDate": "2023May19"}, {"PMID": "37073766", "Title": "Quantitative and qualitative methods advance the science of clinical workflow research.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Workflow", "Qualitative Research", "Research Design"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Department of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA", "PubDate": "2023Apr19"}, {"PMID": "36989473", "Title": "Older Adult Engagement With Symptom Reporting in a COVID-19 Citizen Science Application.", "Abstract": "The current study examined the frequency and predictors of older adults' engagement with symptom reporting in COVIDWATCHER, a mobile health (mHealth) citizen science application.

We arranged codes by shared meaning into categories and constructed themes that reflected shared findings from inductive categories and deductive codes. Twenty-six persons living with HIV participated. They provided rich descriptions of their experiences represented by four cross-cutting themes, which informed the explanatory model.

This study aims to computationally describe symptom documentation from electronic nursing notes and compare symptom clusters among patients diagnosed with four chronic conditions-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Nursing notes (N\u2009=\u2009504,395; 133,977 patients) were obtained for the 2016 calendar year from a single medical center. We used NimbleMiner, a natural language processing application, to identify the presence of 56 symptoms. We calculated symptom documentation prevalence by note and patient for the corpus. Then, we visually compared documentation for a subset of patients (N\u2009=\u200922,657) diagnosed with COPD (n\u2009=\u20093339), heart failure (n\u2009=\u20096587), diabetes (n\u2009=\u200912,139), and cancer (n\u2009=\u20097269) and conducted multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering to discover underlying groups of patients who have similar symptom profiles (i.e., symptom clusters) for each condition. As expected, pain was the most frequently documented symptom. All conditions had a group of patients characterized by no symptoms. Shared clusters included cardiovascular symptoms for heart failure and diabetes; pain and other symptoms for COPD, diabetes, and cancer; and a newly-identified cognitive and neurological symptom cluster for heart failure, diabetes, and cancer. Cancer (gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue) and COPD (mental health symptoms) each contained a unique cluster. In summary, we report both shared and distinct, as well as established and novel, symptom clusters across chronic conditions. Findings support the use of electronic health record-derived notes and NLP methods to study symptoms and symptom clusters to advance symptom science.", "Keywords": ["chronic conditions", "natural

We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and provides; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work.

Death was found to be the most common adverse event reported overall, manifesting in 44% of all reported incidents. The most frequent source of mortality was found to be hemorrhaging in the perioperative period rather than incidents of device malfunction or structural damage from surgery. This was found to be similar to the results of other published series for transoral ablative surgery.

We next evaluated the association of GeneLiFT scores with the comprehension of limitations of genomic medicine in participants undergoing genetic testing in the NIH-sponsored eMERGE III study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.

A diverse cohort of 724 participants completed the survey (60% women, 45% less than 40\u00a0years old, and 53% self-reported White non-Hispanic ancestry). The GeneLiFT was validated using known group differences based on education, health literacy, and numeracy, and with questions assessing genetic knowledge. GeneLiFT identified multiple standard genetics terms, that is, jargon, not recognized by more than 50% of participants (including actionability and pathogenicity). Low genetic literacy, identified in 210 participants (29%), was significantly associated with poor understanding of the limitations of genetic testing (p-values\u00a0<\u00a010-9 ). This association was independent of education, health literacy, and numeracy levels, highlighting the importance of directly measuring genetic literacy. Low genetic literacy was also associated with low satisfaction with the informed consent process.

A comprehensive search was executed across five electronic databases (January 2005-March 2016). Of the 1911 identified studies, nine met the inclusion criteria of quantitative or mixed methods design, technology-enabled adherence and or retention intervention for US HIV-infected youth. The majority were small pilots. Intervention dose varied between studies applying similar technology platforms with more than half not informed by a theoretical framework.

They hold considerable promise for enhancing the electronic-health-records (EHRs) user experience. We previously described this novel approach to EHR design and our illustrative system, MedWISE. The purpose of this paper is to describe clinician users' intelligent uses of space during completion of real patient case studies in a laboratory setting using MedWISE. Thirteen clinicians at a quaternary academic medical center used the system to review four real patient cases. We analyzed clinician utterances, behaviors, screen layouts (i.e., interface designs), and their perceptions associated with completing patient case studies. Clinicians effectively used the system to review all cases. Two coding schemata pertaining to human-computer interaction and diagnostic reasoning were used to analyze the data. Users adopted three main interaction strategies: rapidly gathering items on screen and reviewing ('opportunistic selection' approach); creating highly structured screens ('structured' approach); and interacting with small groups of items in sequence as their case review progressed ('dynamic stage' approach). They also used spatial arrangement in ways predicted by theory and research on workplace spatial arrangement. This includes assignment of screen regions for particular purposes (24% of spatial codes), juxtaposition to facilitate calculation or other cognitive tasks ('epistemic action'), and grouping elements with common meanings or relevance to the diagnostic facets of the case (20.3%). A left-to-right progression of orienting materials, data, and action items or reflection space was a commonly observed pattern. Widget selection was based on user assessment of what information was useful or relevant. We developed and tested an illustrative system that gives clinicians greater control of the EHR, and demonstrated its feasibility for case review by typical clinicians. Producing the simplifying inventions, such as user-composable platforms that shift control to the user, may serve to promote productive EHR use and enhance its value as an instrument of patient care.", "Keywords": ["Electronic health record", "Electronic medical record", "Human\u2013computer interaction", "MedWISE", "User-composable EHR", "User-configurable EHR"], "MeSH terms": ["Electronic Health Records", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Medical Informatics", "User-Computer Interface"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yalini", "Last Name": "Senathirajah", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics, New York, NY 10032, USA.

To address this problem, this paper presents a two-phase evaluation framework involving usability experts (phase 1) and end-users (phase 2). In phase 1, a cross-system functionality alignment between expert-derived user needs and system functions was performed to inform the choice of \"the best available\" comparison system to enable a cognitive walkthrough in phase 1 and a comparative effectiveness evaluation in phase 2. During phase 2, five quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods are mixed to assess usability: time-motion analysis, software log, questionnaires - System Usability Scale and the Unified Theory of Acceptance of Use of Technology, think-aloud protocols, and unstructured interviews. Each method contributes data for a unique measure (e.g., time motion analysis contributes task-completion-time; software log contributes action transition frequency). The measures are triangulated to yield complementary insights regarding user-perceived ease-of-use, functionality integration, anxiety during use, and workflow impact. To illustrate its use, we applied this framework in a formative evaluation of a software called Integrated Model for Patient Care and Clinical Trials (IMPACT). We conclude that this mixed-methods evaluation framework enables an integrated assessment of user needs satisfaction and user-perceived usefulness and usability of a novel design. This evaluation framework effectively bridges the gap between co-evolving user needs and technology designs during iterative prototyping and is particularly useful when it is difficult for users to articulate their needs for technology support due to the lack of a baseline.", "Keywords": ["Clinical trials", "Evaluation studies", "Medical informatics", "Needs assessment", "Workflow"], "MeSH terms": ["Biomedical Research", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Humans", "Medical Informatics", "Needs Assessment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mary Regina", "Last Name": "Boland", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Rusanov", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yat", "Last Name": "So", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Lopez-Jimenez", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Linda", "Last Name": "Busacca", "Affiliation": "The Clinical Trials Office, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard C", "Last Name": "Steinman", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; The Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Suzanne", "Last Name": "Bakken", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; School of Nursing, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; The Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "J Thomas", "Last Name": "Bigger", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; The Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunhua", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; The Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.
