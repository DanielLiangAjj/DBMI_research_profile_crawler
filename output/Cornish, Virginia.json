Here, we demonstrated that the protease could be reintroduced to the biosensor to provide a simple mechanism for distinguishing single-amino-acid changes in peptide ligands that, otherwise, would likely be difficult to detect using binding-based assays. We characterized the dose-response curves for five fungal pheromone G-protein-coupled receptors, peptides, and proteases-Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Schizosaccharomyces octosporus, and Schizosaccharomyces japonicus. Alanine scanning was carried out for the most selective of these-S. cerevisiae and C. albicans-with and without the protease. Two peptide variants were discovered, which showed diminished cleavage by the protease (CaPep2A and CaPep2A13A). Those peptides were then distinguished by utilizing the biosensor strains with and without the protease, which selectively cleaved and altered the apparent concentration of peptide required for half-maximal activation for 2 peptides-CaPep and CaPep13A, respectively-by more than one order of magnitude. These results support the hypothesis that the living yeast biosensor with a sequence-specific protease can translate single-amino-acid changes into more than one order of magnitude apparent shift in the concentration of peptide required for half-maximal activation. With further engineering by computational modeling and directed evolution, the biosensor could likely distinguish a wide variety of peptide sequences beyond the alanine scanning carried out here. In the future, we envision incorporating proteases into our living yeast biosensor for use as a point of care diagnostic, a scalable communication language, and other applications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tea", "Last Name": "Crnkovi\u0107", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin J", "Last Name": "Bokor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mead E", "Last Name": "Lockwood", "Affiliation": "School of General Studies, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Biodesign research", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "35699947", "Title": "High-Titer Production of the Fungal Anhydrotetracycline, TAN-1612, in Engineered Yeasts.", "Abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a growing global health threat, demanding urgent responses. Tetracyclines, a widely used antibiotic class, are increasingly succumbing to antibiotic resistance; generating novel analogues is therefore a top priority for public health. Fungal tetracyclines provide structural and enzymatic diversity for novel tetracycline analogue production in tractable heterologous hosts, like yeasts, to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Here, we successfully engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and Saccharomyces boulardii (probiotic yeast) to produce the nonantibiotic fungal anhydrotetracycline, TAN-1612, in synthetic defined media\u2500necessary for clean purifications\u2500through heterologously expressing TAN-1612 genes mined from the fungus, Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015. This was accomplished via (i) a promoter library-based combinatorial pathway optimization of the biosynthetic TAN-1612 genes coexpressed with a putative TAN-1612 efflux pump, reducing TAN-1612 toxicity in yeasts while simultaneously increasing supernatant titers and (ii) the development of a medium-throughput UV-visible spectrophotometric assay that facilitates TAN-1612 combinatorial library screening. Through this multipronged approach, we optimized TAN-1612 production, yielding an over 450-fold increase compared to previously reported S. cerevisiae yields. TAN-1612 is an important tetracycline analogue precursor, and we thus present the first step toward generating novel tetracycline analogue therapeutics to combat current and emerging antibiotic resistance. We also report the first heterologous production of a fungal polyketide, like TAN-1612, in the probiotic S. boulardii. This highlights that engineered S. boulardii can biosynthesize complex natural products like tetracyclines, setting the stage to equip probiotic yeasts with synthetic therapeutic functionalities to generate living therapeutics or biocontrol agents for clinical and agricultural applications.", "Keywords": ["Saccharomyces boulardii", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "TAN-1612", "anhydrotetracycline", "efflux pumps"], "MeSH terms": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Tetracyclines", "Yeasts"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pedro A", "Last Name": "Baldera-Aguayo", "Affiliation": "Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Studies, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, United States."}, {"First Name": "Arden", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 550 W 120th Street, Northwest Corner Building 1206, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 550 W 120th Street, Northwest Corner Building 1206, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS synthetic biology", "PubDate": "2022Jul15"}, {"PMID": "35023728", "Title": "Peptide-Dependent Growth in Yeast via Fine-Tuned Peptide/GPCR-Activated Essential Gene Expression.", "Abstract": "Building multicellular microbial consortia that communicate with each other and perform programmed functionalities is the next milestone for synthetic biology. Achieving cell-cell communication within these communities requires programming of the transduction of an extracellular signal into a customized intracellular response. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are attractive candidates for engineering signal transduction as they can sense extracellular events with high sensitivity and specificity and transduce them into complex intracellular programs. We recently developed a scalable cell-cell communication language based on fungal mating GPCRs and their secreted peptide ligands. This language allows the assembly of engineered yeast strains into multicellular communication networks and allows them to be made interdependent by peptide signaling. In peptide signaling, one cell secretes a peptide that supports the growth of another cell at nanomolar concentrations, a scalable approach for engineering interdependence. Here we address the challenge of correlating the doubling time of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with an increasing external peptide concentration by linking GPCR activation to the expression of an essential gene. The required fine-tuning of downstream signaling is achieved via the transcriptional titration of a set of orthogonal GPCR-activated transcription factors, a series of corresponding promoters with different output dynamics, and the use of chemically recoded peptide ligands with varying activation potentials. As such, our work establishes three control points that allow the tuning of the basal and maximal activation of the GPCR response, fold change activation, and response sensitivity.

Tetracyclines, one of the most important classes of antibiotics, have fallen prey to antibiotic resistance, necessitating the generation of new analogs. Many tetracycline analogs have been accessed through both total synthesis and semisynthesis, but key C-ring tetracycline analogs remain inaccessible. New methods are needed to unlock access to these analogs, and heterologous biosynthesis in a tractable host such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a candidate method. C-ring analog biosynthesis can mimic nature's biosynthesis of tetracyclines from anhydrotetracyclines, but challenges exist, including the absence of the unique cofactor F420 in common heterologous hosts. Toward this goal, this paper describes the biosynthesis of tetracycline from anhydrotetracycline in S. cerevisiae heterologously expressing three enzymes from three bacterial hosts: the anhydrotetracycline hydroxylase OxyS, the dehydrotetracycline reductase CtcM, and the F420 reductase FNO. This biosynthesis of tetracycline is enabled by OxyS performing just one hydroxylation step in S. cerevisiae despite its previous characterization as a double hydroxylase. This single hydroxylation enabled us to purify and structurally characterize a hypothetical intermediate in oxytetracycline biosynthesis that can explain structural differences between oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline. We show that Fo, a synthetically accessible derivative of cofactor F420, can replace F420 in tetracycline biosynthesis. Critically, the use of S. cerevisiae for the final steps of tetracycline biosynthesis described herein sets the stage to achieve a total biosynthesis of tetracycline as well as novel tetracycline analogs in S. cerevisiae with the potential to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alcohol Oxidoreductases", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Fungal Proteins", "Hydroxylation", "Mixed Function Oxygenases", "NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Tetracycline", "Tetracyclines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ehud", "Last Name": "Herbst", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Arden", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Tang", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, United States."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Snyder", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2021Aug20"}, {"PMID": "34196546", "Title": "Genetic Code Expansion: A Brief History and Perspective.", "Abstract": "Since the establishment of site-specific mutagenesis of single amino acids to interrogate protein function in the 1970s, biochemists have sought to tailor protein structure in the native cell environment.

Previously, we demonstrated that d-amino acids are successfully incorporated into the C-terminus of the nascent polypeptide chain. Ribosomes carrying the resulting peptidyl-d-aminoacyl-tRNA (peptidyl-d-aa-tRNA) donor substrate, however, partition into subpopulations that either undergo translation arrest through inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center (PTC) or remain translationally competent. The proportion of each subpopulation is determined by the identity of the d-amino acid side chain. Here, we demonstrate that the identity of the aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) acceptor substrate that is delivered to ribosomes carrying a peptidyl-d-aa-tRNA donor further modulates this partitioning. Our discovery demonstrates that it is the pairing of the peptidyl-d-aa-tRNA donor and the aa-tRNA acceptor that determines the activity of the PTC. Moreover, we provide evidence that both the amino acid and tRNA components of the aa-tRNA\u00a0acceptor\u00a0contribute synergistically to the extent of arrest. The results of this work deepen our understanding of the mechanism of d-amino acid-mediated translation arrest and how cells avoid this precarious obstacle, reveal similarities to other translation arrest mechanisms involving the PTC, and provide a new route for improving the yields of engineered proteins containing d-amino acids.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acids", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Protein Biosynthesis", "RNA, Bacterial", "RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl", "Ribosome Subunits"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachel C", "Last Name": "Fleisher", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Ruben L", "Last Name": "Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 , United States."}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2018Jul24"}, {"PMID": "29956923", "Title": "A Yeast Three Hybrid Assay for Metabolic Engineering of Tetracycline Derivatives.", "Abstract": "Metabolic engineering stands to transform the discovery and production of a wide range of chemicals, but metabolic engineering currently demands considerable resource investments that restrict commercial application. To facilitate the applicability of metabolic engineering, general high-throughput and readily implemented technologies are needed to assay vast libraries of strains producing desirable chemicals. Toward this end, we describe here the development of a yeast three hybrid (Y3H) assay as a general, high-throughput, versatile and readily implemented approach for the detection of target molecule biosynthesis. Our system detects target molecule biosynthesis through a change in reporter gene transcription that results from the binding of the target molecule to a modular protein receptor. We demonstrate the use of the Y3H assay for detecting the biosynthesis of tetracyclines, a major class of antibiotics, based on the interaction between tetracyclines and the tetracycline repressor protein (TetR). Various tetracycline derivatives can be detected using our assay, whose versatility enables its use both as a screen and a selection to match the needs and instrumentation of a wide range of end users. We demonstrate the applicability of the Y3H assay to metabolic engineering by differentiating between producer and nonproducer strains of the natural product tetracycline TAN-1612. The Y3H assay is superior to state-of-the-art HPLC-MS methods in throughput and limit of detection of tetracycline derivatives. Finally, our establishment of the Y3H assay for detecting the biosynthesis of a tetracycline supports the generality of the Y3H assay for detecting the biosynthesis of many other target molecules.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Metabolic Engineering", "Protein Interaction Mapping", "Tetracyclines"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ehud", "Last Name": "Herbst", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Pedro A", "Last Name": "Baldera-Aguayo", "Affiliation": "Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Studies , Columbia University , New York , New York 10032 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Hyunwook", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 , United States."}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2018Aug07"}, {"PMID": "29239359", "Title": "Ronald Breslow (1931-2017).", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Biochemistry", "Chemistry, Organic", "Coenzymes", "Cyclodextrins", "History, 20th Century", "Hydroxamic Acids", "Mentoring", "Molecular Biology", "New Jersey", "New York City", "Thiamine", "Thiamine Pyrophosphate", "Vorinostat", "Women's Rights"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2017Dec14"}, {"PMID": "28841306", "Title": "Fluorescence Polarization Assay for Small Molecule Screening of FK506 Biosynthesized in 96-Well Microtiter Plates.", "Abstract": "The fluorescence polarization (FP) assay has been widely used to study enzyme kinetics, antibody-antigen interactions, and other biological interactions.

There, the development of high-yield strains is often a costly and time-consuming process. This problem can be addressed by generating and testing large mutant strain libraries. However, a current key bottleneck is the lack of high-throughput screens to detect the small molecule products. The FP assay is quantitative, sensitive, fast, and cheap. As a proof of principle, we established the FP assay to screen for FK506 (tacrolimus) produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis, which was cultivated in 96-well plates.

Even though existing methods have successfully been used to explore structure-function relationships in nervous systems, to profile RNA in situ, to reveal the heterogeneity of tumour microenvironments and to study dynamic macromolecular assembly, it remains challenging to image many species with high selectivity and sensitivity under biological conditions. For instance, fluorescence microscopy faces a 'colour barrier', owing to the intrinsically broad (about 1,500 inverse centimetres) and featureless nature of fluorescence spectra that limits the number of resolvable colours to two to five (or seven to nine if using complicated instrumentation and analysis). Spontaneous Raman microscopy probes vibrational transitions with much narrower resonances (peak width of about 10 inverse centimetres) and so does not suffer from this problem, but weak signals make many bio-imaging applications impossible. Although surface-enhanced Raman scattering offers high sensitivity and multiplicity, it cannot be readily used to image specific molecular targets quantitatively inside live cells. Here we use stimulated Raman scattering under electronic pre-resonance conditions to image target molecules inside living cells with very high vibrational selectivity and sensitivity (down to 250 nanomolar with a time constant of 1 millisecond). We create a palette of triple-bond-conjugated near-infrared dyes that each displays a single peak in the cell-silent Raman spectral window; when combined with available fluorescent probes, this palette provides 24 resolvable colours, with the potential for further expansion.

The ubiquity of L-amino acids in proteins has led to the hypothesis that D-amino acids are not substrates for the TM. Supporting this view, protein engineering efforts to incorporate D-amino acids into proteins using the TM have thus far been unsuccessful. Nonetheless, a mechanistic understanding of why D-aa-tRNAs are poor substrates for the TM is lacking. To address this deficiency, we have systematically tested the translation activity of D-aa-tRNAs using a series of biochemical assays. We find that the TM can effectively, albeit slowly, accept D-aa-tRNAs into the ribosomal aa-tRNA binding (A) site, use the A-site D-aa-tRNA as a peptidyl-transfer acceptor, and translocate the resulting peptidyl-D-aa-tRNA into the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA binding (P) site. During the next round of continuous translation, however, we find that ribosomes carrying a P-site peptidyl-D-aa-tRNA partition into subpopulations that are either translationally arrested or that can continue translating. Consistent with its ability to arrest translation, chemical protection experiments and molecular dynamics simulations show that P site-bound peptidyl-D-aa-tRNA can trap the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center in a conformation in which peptidyl transfer is impaired.

We measure SM photon flux, survival lifetime, and total photon output under conditions that mimic the live cell environment and demonstrate that the A-TMP-tag complements the advantageous SM imaging properties of Atto655 and Alexa647. We also measure the ensemble properties of quantum yield and photostability lifetime, revealing a correlation between SM and ensemble properties.

Although the Y3H assay has been successfully applied as a positive selection to discover novel drug targets and to evolve proteins with improved functions, its expansion into applications requiring a high-throughput, versatile selection against transcriptional activation has been hindered by its limited dynamic range as a counter selection.

The Tet Y3H counter selection has an improved dynamic range and provides enrichment from mock libraries of up to 10\u2076, a 10\u2074-fold improvement over our original Y3H counter selection.

The trimethoprim-based chemical tag (TMP-tag) was initially developed based on the high affinity interaction between E. coli dihydrofolate reductase and the antibiotic trimethoprim and was subsequently rendered covalent and fluorogenic via proximity-induced protein labeling reactions.

However, the theoretical challenge in using chemical tags as opposed to fluorescent proteins for high-resolution imaging is background noise from unbound and/or nonspecifically bound ligand-fluorophore. We envisioned we could overcome this limit by engineering fluorogenic trimethoprim-based chemical tags (TMP-tags) in which the fluorophore is quenched until binding with E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR)-tagged protein displaces the quencher. Thus, we began by building a nonfluorogenic, covalent TMP-tag based on a proximity-induced reaction known to achieve rapid and specific labeling both in vitro and inside of living cells. Here we take the final step and render the covalent TMP-tag fluorogenic. In brief, we designed a trimeric TMP-fluorophore-quencher molecule (TMP-Q-Atto520) with the quencher attached to a leaving group that, upon TMP binding to eDHFR, would be cleaved by a cysteine residue (Cys) installed just outside the binding pocket of eDHFR. We present the in vitro experiments showing that the eDHFR:L28C nucleophile cleaves the TMP-Q-Atto520 rapidly and efficiently, resulting in covalent labeling and remarkable fluorescence enhancement. Most significantly, while only our initial design, TMP-Q-Atto520 achieved the demanding goal of not only labeling highly abundant, localized intracellular proteins but also less abundant, more dynamic cytoplasmic proteins. These results suggest that the fluorogenic TMP-tag can significantly impact high-resolution live cell imaging and further establish the potential of proximity-induced reactivity and organic chemistry more broadly as part of the growing toolbox for synthetic biology and cell engineering.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Azo Compounds", "Cell Line", "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Molecular Probes", "Molecular Structure", "Optical Imaging", "Rhodamines", "Rosaniline Dyes", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Trimethoprim"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chaoran", "Last Name": "Jing", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 550 West 120th Street, MC 4854, NWC Building, New York, New York 10027, United States."}, {"First Name": "Virginia W", "Last Name": "Cornish", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2013Aug16"}, {"PMID": "23423898", "Title": "Gene assembly and combinatorial libraries in S. cerevisiae via reiterative recombination.", "Abstract": "While mutagenesis of single genes is now common practice in molecular biology, engineering multiple target genes still requires complex cloning techniques and thus is limited to expert laboratories.
