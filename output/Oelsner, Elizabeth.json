[{"PMID": "38935874", "Title": "Dysanapsis Genetic Risk Predicts Lung Function Across the Lifespan.", "Abstract": "Rationale Dysanapsis refers to a mismatch between airway tree caliber and lung size arising early in life. Dysanapsis assessed by computed tomography (CT) is evident by early adulthood and associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk later in life. Objective By examining the genetic factors associated with CT-assessed dysanapsis, we aimed to elucidate its molecular underpinnings and physiological significance across the lifespan. Methods We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CT-assessed dysanapsis in 11,951 adults, including individuals from two population-based and two COPD-enriched studies. We applied colocalization analysis to integrate GWAS and gene expression data from whole blood and lung. Genetic variants associated with dysanapsis were combined into a genetic risk score that was applied to examine association with lung function in children from a population-based birth cohort (n=1,278) and adults from the UK Biobank (n=369,157). Measurements and Main Results CT-assessed dysanapsis was associated with genetic variants from 21 independent signals in 19 gene regions, implicating HHIP, DSP, and NPNT as potential molecular targets based on colocalization of their expression. Higher dysanapsis genetic risk score was associated with obstructive spirometry among 5 year old children and among adults in the 5th, 6th and 7th decades of life. Conclusions CT-assessed dysanapsis is associated with variation in genes previously implicated in lung development and dysanapsis genetic risk is associated with obstructive lung function from early life through older adulthood. Dysanapsis may represent an endo-phenotype link between the genetic variations associated with lung function and COPD.", "Keywords": ["COPD", "airflow obstruction", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "lung growth &amp;

correlates of anti-S1 antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination in a U.S. population-based meta-cohort of adults participating in longstanding NIH-funded cohort studies. Anti-S1 antibodies were measured from dried blood spots collected between February 2021-August 2022 using Luminex-based microsphere immunoassays. Of 6245 participants, mean age was 73 years (range, 21-100), 58% were female, and 76% were non-Hispanic White. Nearly 52% of participants received the BNT162b2 vaccine and 48% received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Lower anti-S1 antibody levels are associated with age of 65 years or older, male sex, higher body mass index, smoking, diabetes, COPD and receipt of BNT16b2 vaccine (vs mRNA-1273). Participants with a prior infection, particularly those with a history of hospitalized illness, have higher anti-S1 antibody levels. These results suggest that adults with certain socio-demographic and clinical characteristics may have less robust antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination and could be prioritized for more frequent re-vaccination.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Female", "Male", "Aged", "2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273", "Antibody Formation", "BNT162 Vaccine", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Vaccines",

"Investigating Associations of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Lung Function Decline, and Airway Obstruction.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Inflammation contributes to lung function decline and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Omega-3 fatty acids have antiinflammatory properties and may benefit lung health. Objectives: To investigate associations of omega-3 fatty acids with lung function decline and incident airway obstruction in a diverse sample of adults from general-population cohorts. Methods: Complementary study designs: 1) longitudinal study of plasma phospholipid omega-3 fatty acids and repeated FEV1 and FVC measures in the NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study and 2) two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study of genetically predicted omega-3 fatty acids and lung function parameters. Measurements and Main Results: The longitudinal study found that higher omega-3 fatty acid levels were associated with attenuated lung function decline in 15,063 participants, with the largest effect sizes for the most metabolically downstream omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). An increase in DHA of 1% of total fatty acids was associated with attenuations of 1.4 ml/yr for FEV1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8) and 2.0 ml/yr for FVC (95% CI, 1.6-2.4) and a 7% lower incidence of spirometry-defined airway obstruction (95% CI, 0.89-0.97). DHA associations persisted across sexes and smoking histories and in Black, White, and Hispanic participants, with associations of the largest magnitude in former smokers and Hispanic participants. The MR study showed similar trends toward positive associations of genetically predicted downstream omega-3 fatty acids with FEV1 and FVC. Conclusions: The longitudinal and MR studies provide evidence supporting beneficial effects of higher levels of downstream omega-3 fatty acids, especially DHA, on lung health.", "Keywords": ["Mendelian randomization", "epidemiology", "nutrition", "spirometry"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Fatty Acids, Omega-3", "Longitudinal Studies", "Lung", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Airway Obstruction", "Docosahexaenoic Acids"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Bonnie K", "Last Name": "Patchen", "Affiliation": "Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York."}, {"First Name": "Pallavi", "Last Name": "Balte", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Traci M", "Last Name": "Bartz", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Departments of Medicine, Epidemiology, and Health Systems and Population Health."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Myriam", "Last Name": "Fornage", "Affiliation": "Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Mariaelisa", "Last Name": "Graff", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Jacobs", "Affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Ravi", "Last Name": "Kalhan", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and Preventative Medicine, Northwestern Medicine, Chicago, Illinois."}, {"First Name": "Rozenn N", "Last Name": "Lemaitre", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Departments of Medicine, Epidemiology, and Health Systems and Population Health."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "O'Connor", "Affiliation": "Pulmonary, Allergy, Sleep and Critical Care Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Psaty", "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Departments of Medicine, Epidemiology, and Health Systems and Population Health."}, {"First Name": "Jungkyun", "Last Name": "Seo", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Michael Y", "Last Name": "Tsai", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."}, {"First Name": "Alexis C", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service Children Nutrition Research Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Hanfei", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Jingwen", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts."}, {"First Name": "Sina A", "Last Name": "Gharib", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."}, {"First Name": "Ani", "Last Name": "Manichaikul", "Affiliation": "Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Kari", "Last Name": "North", "Affiliation": "Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Lyn M", "Last Name": "Steffen", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9e", "Last Name": "Dupuis", "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service Children Nutrition Research Center, Houston, Texas."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Oelsner", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Dana B", "Last Name": "Hancock", "Affiliation": "RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and."}, {"First Name": "Patricia A", "Last Name": "Cassano", "Affiliation": "Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York."}], "Journal": "American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine", "PubDate": "2023Oct15"}, {"PMID": "37268414", "Title": "Pulmonary emphysema subtypes defined by unsupervised machine learning on CT scans.", "Abstract": "Treatment and preventative advances for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been slow due, in part, to limited subphenotypes.

improve resolution of genes and pathways influencing lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk.", "Abstract": "Lung-function impairment underlies chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and predicts mortality. In the largest multi-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of lung function to date, comprising 580,869 participants, we identified 1,020 independent association signals implicating 559 genes supported by \u22652 criteria from a systematic variant-to-gene mapping framework. These genes were enriched in 29 pathways. Individual variants showed heterogeneity across ancestries, age and smoking groups, and collectively as a genetic risk score showed strong association with COPD across ancestry groups. We undertook phenome-wide association studies for selected associated variants as well as trait and pathway-specific genetic risk scores to infer possible consequences of intervening in pathways underlying lung function. We highlight new putative causal variants, genes, proteins and pathways, including those targeted by existing drugs. These findings bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms underlying lung function and COPD, and should inform functional genomics experiments and potentially future COPD therapies.", "Keywords":

We developed a new approach, TESLA (multi-ancestry integrative study using an optimal linear combination of association statistics), to integrate an eQTL dataset with a multi-ancestry GWAS. By exploiting shared phenotypic effects between ancestries and accommodating potential effect heterogeneities, TESLA improves power over other TWAS methods. When applied to tobacco use phenotypes, TESLA identified 273 new genes, up to 55% more compared with alternative TWAS methods. These hits and subsequent fine mapping using TESLA point to target genes with biological relevance.

Associated with Common Genetic Variants and Limited Rare Variants.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, irreversible, and progressive disease of the lungs. Common genetic variants, in addition to nongenetic factors, have been consistently associated with IPF. Rare variants identified by candidate gene, family-based, and exome studies have also been reported to associate with IPF. However, the extent to which rare variants, genome-wide, may contribute to the risk of IPF remains unknown. Objectives: We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the role of rare variants, genome-wide, on IPF risk. Methods: As part of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program, we sequenced 2,180 cases of IPF. Association testing focused on the aggregated effect of rare variants (minor allele frequency \u2a7d0.01) within genes or regions. We also identified individual rare variants that are influential within genes and estimated the heritability of IPF on the basis of rare and common variants. Measurements and Main Results: Rare variants in both TERT and RTEL1 were significantly associated with IPF. A single rare variant in each of the TERT and RTEL1 genes was found to consistently influence the aggregated test statistics. There was no significant evidence of association with other previously reported rare variants. The SNP heritability of IPF was estimated to be 32% (SE\u2009=\u20093%). Conclusions: Rare variants within the TERT and RTEL1 genes and well-established common variants have the largest contribution to IPF risk overall. Efforts in risk profiling or the development of therapies for IPF that focus on TERT, RTEL1, common variants, and environmental risk factors are likely to have the largest impact on this complex disease.", "Keywords": ["TOPMed", "genetic association studies", "interstitial lung disease", "telomerase", "whole-genome sequencing"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Whole Genome Sequencing", "Exome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna L", "Last Name": "Peljto", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Rachel Z", "Last Name": "Blumhagen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Avram D", "Last Name": "Walts", "Affiliation": "National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Cardwell", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Powers", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Tamera J", "Last Name": "Corte", "Affiliation": "Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Joanne L", "Last Name": "Dickinson", "Affiliation": "Menzies Institute of Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Ian", "Last Name": "Glaspole", "Affiliation": "Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology Clinic, Alfred Health, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Yuben P", "Last Name": "Moodley", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Martina Koziar", "Last Name": "Vasakova", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Thomayer Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth", "Last Name": "Bendstrup", "Affiliation": "Center for Rare Lung Diseases, Department of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Jesper R", "Last Name": "Davidsen", "Affiliation": "South Danish Center for Interstitial Lung Diseases, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Raphael", "Last Name": "Borie", "Affiliation": "Service de Pneumologie A and."}, {"First Name": "Bruno", "Last Name": "Crestani", "Affiliation": "Service de Pneumologie A and."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Dieude", "Affiliation": "Service de Rhumatologie, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Francesco", "Last Name": "Bonella", "Affiliation": "Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases, Ruhrlandklinik University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Ulrich", "Last Name": "Costabel", "Affiliation": "Center for Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases, Ruhrlandklinik University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gunnar", "Last Name": "Gudmundsson", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Seamas C", "Last Name": "Donnelly", "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Jim", "Last Name": "Egan", "Affiliation": "National Lung Transplantation Centre, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Henry", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Keane", "Affiliation": "St. Vincent's University Hospital, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Marcus P", "Last Name": "Kennedy", "Affiliation": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Cormac", "Last Name": "McCarthy", "Affiliation": "St. Vincent's University Hospital, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Aoife N", "Last Name": "McElroy", "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Joshua A", "Last Name": "Olaniyi", "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Katherine M A", "Last Name": "O'Reilly", "Affiliation": "Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Richeldi", "Affiliation": "Fondazione Policlinico A.

"Title": "Genetic diversity fuels gene discovery for tobacco and alcohol use.", "Abstract": "Tobacco and alcohol use are heritable behaviours associated with 15% and 5.3% of worldwide deaths, respectively, due largely to broad increased risk for disease and injury1-4. These substances are used across the globe, yet genome-wide association studies have focused largely on individuals of European ancestries5. Here we leveraged global genetic diversity across 3.4 million individuals from four major clines of global ancestry (approximately 21% non-European) to power the discovery and fine-mapping of genomic loci associated with tobacco and alcohol use, to inform function of these loci via ancestry-aware transcriptome-wide association studies, and to evaluate the genetic architecture and predictive power of polygenic risk within and across populations. We found that increases in sample size and genetic diversity improved locus identification and fine-mapping resolution, and that a large majority of the 3,823 associated variants (from 2,143 loci) showed consistent effect sizes across ancestry dimensions. However, polygenic risk scores developed in one ancestry performed poorly in others, highlighting the continued need to increase sample sizes of diverse ancestries to realize any potential benefit of polygenic prediction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Risk

We performed a genome-wide association study of serum IgA levels in 41,263 individuals of diverse ancestries and identified 20 genome-wide significant loci, including 9 known and 11 novel loci. Co-localization analyses with expression QTLs prioritized candidate genes for 14 of 20 significant loci. Most loci encoded genes that produced immune defects and IgA abnormalities when genetically manipulated in mice. We also observed positive genetic correlations of serum IgA levels with IgA nephropathy, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, and negative correlations with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and several infections. Mendelian randomization supported elevated serum IgA as a causal factor in IgA nephropathy. African ancestry was consistently associated with higher serum IgA levels and greater frequency of IgA-increasing alleles compared to other ancestries. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of IgA levels and its potential role in human disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Mice", "Animals",

"Abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema are characterized by functional and structural damage which increases the spaces for gaseous diffusion and impairs oxygen exchange. Here we explore the potential for hyperpolarized (HP) 3He MRI to characterize lung structure and function in a large-scale population-based study. Participants (n = 54) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study, a nested case-control study of COPD among participants with 10+ packyears underwent HP 3He MRI measuring pAO2, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and ventilation. HP MRI measures were compared to full-lung CT and pulmonary function testing. High ADC values (>0.4 cm2/s) correlated with emphysema and heterogeneity in pAO2 measurements. Strong correlations were found between the heterogeneity of global pAO2 as summarized by its standard deviation (SD) (p < 0.0002) and non-physiologic pAO2 values (p < 0.0001) with percent emphysema on CT. A regional study revealed a strong association between pAO2 SD and visual emphysema severity (p < 0.003) and an association with the paraseptal emphysema subtype (p < 0.04) after adjustment for demographics and smoking status.

Across four smoking traits, single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based heritability ([Formula: see text]) was estimated from 0.13 to 0.28 (s.e., 0.10-0.13) in European ancestries, with 35-74% of it attributable to rare variants with minor allele frequencies between 0.01% and 1%. These heritability estimates are 1.5-4 times higher than past estimates based on common variants alone and accounted for 60% to 100% of our pedigree-based estimates of narrow-sense heritability ([Formula: see text], 0.18-0.34). In the African ancestry samples, [Formula: see text] was estimated from 0.03 to 0.33 (s.e., 0.09-0.14) across the four smoking traits.

function improve cross-ethnic portability of prediction in the NHLBI TOPMed program.", "Abstract": "While polygenic risk scores (PRSs) enable early identification of genetic risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), predictive performance is limited when the discovery and target populations are not well matched. Hypothesizing that the biological mechanisms of disease are shared across ancestry groups, we introduce a PrediXcan-derived polygenic transcriptome risk score (PTRS) to improve cross-ethnic portability of risk prediction. We constructed the PTRS using summary statistics from application of PrediXcan on large-scale GWASs of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s [FEV1] and its ratio to forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC]) in the UK Biobank. We examined prediction performance and cross-ethnic portability of PTRS through smoking-stratified analyses both on 29,381 multi-ethnic participants from TOPMed population/family-based cohorts and on 11,771 multi-ethnic participants from TOPMed COPD-enriched studies. Analyses were carried out for two dichotomous COPD traits (moderate-to-severe and severe COPD) and two quantitative lung function traits (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC). While the proposed PTRS showed weaker associations with disease than PRS for European ancestry, the PTRS showed stronger association with COPD than PRS for African Americans (e.g., odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 1.24 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.43] for PTRS versus 1.10 [0.96-1.26] for PRS among heavy smokers with \u2265 40 pack-years of smoking) for moderate-to-severe COPD. Cross-ethnic portability of the PTRS was significantly higher than the PRS (paired t test p\u00a0<\u00a02.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-16 with portability gains ranging from 5% to 28%) for both dichotomous COPD traits and across all smoking strata.

Starting as early as 1971, investigators in the C4R cohort studies have collected data on clinical and subclinical diseases and their risk factors, including behavior, cognition, biomarkers, and social determinants of health. C4R links this pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) phenotyping to information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and acute and postacute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the United States. C4R ascertains SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey conducted via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations and high-quality event surveillance. Extensive prepandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these data will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings. This resource will allow evaluation of risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including postacute sequelae, and assessment of the social and behavioral impact of the pandemic

(COPD) is a public health priority. Airflow obstruction is the single most important risk factor for adverse COPD outcomes, but spirometry is not routinely recommended for screening. Objectives: To describe the burden of subclinical airflow obstruction (SAO) and to develop a probability score for SAO to inform potential detection and prevention programs. Methods: Lung function and clinical data were harmonized and pooled across nine U.S. general population cohorts. Adults with respiratory symptoms, inhaler use, or prior diagnosis of COPD or asthma were excluded. A probability score for prevalent SAO (forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity\u2009<\u20090.70) was developed via hierarchical group-lasso regularization from clinical variables in strata of sex and smoking status, and its discriminative accuracy for SAO was assessed in the pooled cohort as well as in an external validation cohort (NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey] 2011-2012). Incident hospitalizations and deaths due to COPD (respiratory events) were defined by adjudication or administrative criteria in four of nine cohorts. Results: Of 33,546 participants (mean age 52 yr, 54% female, 44% non-Hispanic White), 4,424 (13.2%) had prevalent SAO. The incidence of respiratory events (Nat-risk\u2009=\u200914,024) was threefold higher in participants with SAO versus those without (152 vs. 39 events/10,000 person-years). The probability score, which was based on six commonly available variables (age, sex, race and/or ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, and smoking pack-years) was well calibrated and showed excellent discrimination in both the testing sample (C-statistic, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.82) and in NHANES (C-statistic, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.80-0.86).

Objectives: To determine whether race/ethnicity-based spirometry reference equations improve the prediction of incident chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) events and mortality compared with race/ethnicity-neutral equations. Methods: The MESA Lung Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, performed standardized spirometry from 2004 to 2006. Predicted values for spirometry were calculated using race/ethnicity-based equations following guidelines and, alternatively, race/ethnicity-neutral equations without terms for race/ethnicity. Participants were followed for events through 2019. Measurements and Main Results: The mean age of 3,344 participants was 65 years, and self-reported race/ethnicity was 36% White, 25% Black, 23% Hispanic, and 17% Asian. There were 181 incident CLRD-related events and 547 deaths over a median of 11.6 years. There was no evidence that percentage predicted FEV1 or FVC calculated using race/ethnicity-based equations improved the prediction of CLRD-related events compared with those calculated using race/ethnicity-neutral equations (difference in C statistics for FEV1, -0.005; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.013 to 0.003; difference in C statistic for FVC, -0.008; 95% CI, -0.016 to -0.0006). Findings were similar for mortality (difference in C statistics for FEV1, -0.002; 95% CI, -0.008 to 0.003; difference in C statistics for FVC, -0.004; 95% CI, -0.009 to 0.001).

associated with age and smoking, but other determinants of the disease are incompletely understood. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-related state in which somatic mutations in clonal blood populations induce aberrant inflammatory responses. Patients with CHIP have an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, but the association of CHIP with COPD remains unclear. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing data to detect CHIP in 48\u2009835 patients, of whom 8444 had moderate to very severe COPD, from four separate cohorts with COPD phenotyping and smoking history. We measured emphysema in murine models in which Tet2 was deleted in hematopoietic cells. In the COPDGene cohort, individuals with CHIP had risks of moderate-to-severe, severe, or very severe COPD that were 1.6 (adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.2) and 2.2 (adjusted 95% CI, 1.5-3.2) times greater than those for noncarriers. These findings were consistently observed in three additional cohorts and meta-analyses of all patients. CHIP was also associated with decreased FEV1% predicted in the COPDGene cohort (mean between-group differences, -5.7%; adjusted 95% CI, -8.8% to -2.6%), a finding replicated in additional cohorts. Smoke exposure was associated with a small but significant increased risk of having CHIP (odds ratio, 1.03 per 10 pack-years; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05 per 10 pack-years) in the meta-analysis of all patients. Inactivation of Tet2 in mouse hematopoietic cells exacerbated the development of emphysema and inflammation in models of cigarette smoke exposure.

The most statistically significant signal that replicated was a previously reported low-frequency signal in GPR126, distinct from common variant associations in this gene. Although only nominal replication was obtained for a top rare variant signal rs142935352 in one of the two studies, interaction and joint tests for current smoking and PDE3B were significantly associated with FEV1. This study investigates the utility of assessing gene-by-smoking interactions and underscores their effects on potential pulmonary function.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80

We projected life expectancy after observed follow-up in SPRINT using SPRINT-eligible participants in the NHLBI-PCS (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pooled Cohorts Study). Methods and Results We used propensity scores to weight SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants to resemble SPRINT participants. In SPRINT participants, we estimated in-trial survival (<4\u00a0years) using a time-based flexible parametric survival model. In SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants, we estimated posttrial survival (\u22654\u00a0years) using an age-based flexible parametric survival model and applied the formula to SPRINT participants to predict posttrial survival. We projected overall life expectancy for each SPRINT participant and compared it to parametric regression (eg, Gompertz) projections based on SPRINT data alone. We included 8584 SPRINT and 10\u00a0593 SPRINT-eligible NHLBI-PCS participants. After propensity weighting, mean (SD) age was 67.9 (9.4) and 68.2 (8.8) years, and 35.5% and 37.6% were women in SPRINT and NHLBI-PCS, respectively. Using the NHLBI-PCS-based method, projected mean life expectancy from randomization was 21.0 (7.4) years with intensive and 19.1 (7.2) years with standard treatment. Using the Gompertz regression, life expectancy was 11.2 (2.3) years with intensive and 10.5 (2.2) years with standard treatment.

Whether circulating coagulation cascade factors are linked to lung inflammation and scarring among community-dwelling adults is unknown. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that higher baseline D-dimer concentrations are associated with markers of early lung injury and scarring. Methods: Using the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort (n = 6,814), we examined associations of baseline D-dimer concentrations with high attenuation areas from examination 1 (2000-2002; n = 6,184) and interstitial lung abnormalities from examination 5 computed tomographic (CT) scans (2010-2012; n = 2,227), and serum MMP-7 (matrix metalloproteinase-7) and SP-A (surfactant protein-A) from examination 1 (n = 1,098). We examined longitudinal change in forced vital capacity (FVC) from examinations 3-6 (2004-2018, n = 3,562). We used linear logistic regression and linear mixed models to examine associations and adjust for potential confounders. Results: The mean (standard deviation) age of the cohort was 62 (10) years, and the D-dimer concentration was 0.35 (0.69) ug/ml. For every 10% increase in D-dimer concentration, there was an increase in high attenuation area percentage of 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.47) after adjustment for covariates. Associations were stronger among those older than 65 years (P values for interaction < 0.001). A 10% increase in D-dimer concentration was associated with an odds ratio of 1.05 for interstitial lung abnormalities (95% CI, 0.99-1.11). Higher D-dimer concentrations were associated with higher serum MMP-7 and a faster decline in FVC. D-dimer was not associated with SP-A.

prospective study of adults at risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) comprising 14 established United States (US) prospective cohort studies. For decades, C4R cohorts have collected extensive data on clinical and subclinical diseases and their risk factors, including behavior, cognition, biomarkers, and social determinants of health. C4R will link this pre-COVID phenotyping to information on SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute and post-acute COVID-related illness. C4R is largely population-based, has an age range of 18-108 years, and broadly reflects the racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the US. C4R is ascertaining severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 illness using standardized questionnaires, ascertainment of COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths, and a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey via dried blood spots. Master protocols leverage existing robust retention rates for telephone and in-person examinations, and high-quality events surveillance. Extensive pre-pandemic data minimize referral, survival, and recall bias. Data are being harmonized with research-quality phenotyping unmatched by clinical and survey-based studies; these will be pooled and shared widely to expedite collaboration and scientific findings. This unique resource will allow evaluation of risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 severity and outcomes, including post-acute sequelae, and assessment of the social and behavioral impact of the pandemic on long-term trajectories of health and aging.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Oelsner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name":

weight and lung function is complex. Using a dyadic multilevel linear modeling approach, treating body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) and lung function as paired, within-person outcomes, we tested the hypothesis that persons with more rapid increase in BMI exhibit more rapid decline in lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and their ratio (FEV1:FVC). Models included random intercepts and slopes and adjusted for sociodemographic and smoking-related factors. A sample of 9,115 adults with paired measurements of BMI and lung function taken at \u22653 visits were selected from a pooled set of 5 US population-based cohort studies (1983-2018; mean age at baseline = 46 years; median follow-up, 19 years). At age 46 years, average annual rates of change in BMI, FEV1, FVC, and FEV1:FVC ratio were 0.22 kg/m2/year, -25.50 mL/year, -21.99 mL/year, and\u00a0-0.24%/year, respectively. Persons with steeper BMI increases had faster declines in FEV1 (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.16) and FVC (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.26) and slower declines in FEV1:FVC ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a00.11) (all P\u00a0values <\u00a00.0001). Results were similar in subgroup analyses. Residual correlations were negative (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), suggesting additional interdependence between BMI and lung function.

The Strong Heart Study.", "Abstract": "Rationale: Permanent lung function impairment after active tuberculosis infection is relatively common. It remains unclear which spirometric pattern is most prevalent after tuberculosis.Objectives: Our objective was to elucidate the impact of active tuberculosis survival on lung health in the Strong Heart Study (SHS), a population of American Indians historically highly impacted by tuberculosis. As arsenic exposure has also been related to lung function in the SHS, we also assessed the joint effect between arsenic exposure and past active tuberculosis.Methods: The SHS is an ongoing population-based, prospective study of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in American Indian adults. This study uses tuberculosis data and spirometry data from the Visit 2 examination (1993-1995). Prior active tuberculosis was ascertained by a review of medical records. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC were measured by spirometry. An additional analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential association between active tuberculosis and arsenic exposure.Results: A history of active tuberculosis was associated with reduced percent predicted FVC and FEV1, an increased odds of airflow obstruction (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.45, 95% confidence interval\u2009= 1.08-1.95), and spirometric restrictive pattern (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.73, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.24-2.40). These associations persisted after adjustment for diabetes and other risk factors, including smoking. We also observed the presence of cough, phlegm, and exertional dyspnea after a history of active tuberculosis. In the additional analysis, increasing urinary arsenic concentrations were associated with decreasing lung function in those with a history of active tuberculosis, but a reduced odds of active tuberculosis was found with elevated arsenic.Conclusions: Our findings support existing knowledge that a history of active tuberculosis is a risk factor for long-term respiratory impairment. Arsenic exposure, although inversely associated with prior active tuberculosis, was associated with a further decrease in lung function among those with a prior active tuberculosis history. The possible interaction between arsenic and tuberculosis, as well as the reduced odds of tuberculosis associated with arsenic exposure, warrants further investigation, as many populations at risk of developing active tuberculosis are also exposed to arsenic-contaminated water.", "Keywords": ["American Indian", "Strong Heart Study", "arsenic", "spirometry", "tuberculosis"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged",

Between 2000 and 2002, 6,814 white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults from 6 US cities were enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We included 2,250 participants who had spirometry data, 2,557 with full-lung computed tomography (CT) scans, and 5,710 with cardiac CT scans. Rice consumption and 310 participants with urinary arsenic were assessed at baseline. Spirometry and full-lung CT-derived measures of total lung capacity and high attenuation area (HAA), and interstitial lung abnormalities were measured at examination 5. Cardiac CT-derived HAA was measured at 1-3 visits. Twelve percent of participants reported eating at least 1 serving of rice daily. Comparing data between that group with those who ate less than 1 serving weekly, the mean difference for forced vital capacity was -102 (95% confidence interval (CI): -198, -7) mL, and for forced expiratory volume in 1 second was -90 (95% CI: -170, -11) mL after adjustment for demographics, anthropometrics, dietary factors, and smoking. The cross-sectional adjusted percent difference for total lung capacity was -1.33% (95% CI: -4.29, 1.72) and for cardiac-based HAA was 3.66% (95% CI: 1.22, 6.15).

A weighted GRS was calculated from 83 SNPs that were previously associated with lung function. Lung density, spatially matched airway dimensions, and airway counts were assessed on full-lung CT. Generalized linear models were adjusted for age, age squared, sex, height, principal components of genetic ancestry, smoking status, pack-years, CT model, milliamperes, and total lung volume.Measurements and Main Results: MESA Lung and SPIROMICS contributed 2,517 and 2,339 participants, respectively. Higher GRS was associated with lower lung function and increased COPD risk, as well as lower lung density, smaller airway lumens, and fewer small airways, without effect modification by smoking. Adjustment for CT lung structure, particularly small airway measures, attenuated associations between the GRS and FEV1/FVC by 100% and 60% in MESA and SPIROMICS, respectively. Lung structure (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not the GRS (P\u2009>\u20090.10), improved discrimination of moderate-to-severe COPD cases relative to clinical factors alone.Conclusions: A GRS associated with COPD susceptibility was associated with CT lung structure.

"Abstract": "Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs) are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. To support investigations into CLRD risk determinants and new approaches to primary prevention, we aimed to harmonize and pool respiratory data from US general population-based cohorts. Data were obtained from prospective cohorts that performed prebronchodilator spirometry and were harmonized following 2005 ATS/ERS standards. In cohorts conducting follow-up for noncardiovascular events, CLRD events were defined as hospitalizations/deaths adjudicated as CLRD-related or assigned relevant administrative codes. Coding and variable names were applied uniformly. The pooled sample included 65,251 adults in 9 cohorts followed-up for CLRD-related mortality over 653,380 person-years during 1983-2016. Average baseline age was 52 years; 56% were female; 49% were never-smokers; and racial/ethnic composition was 44% white, 22% black, 28% Hispanic/Latino, and 5% American Indian. Over 96% had complete data on smoking, clinical CLRD diagnoses, and dyspnea. After excluding invalid spirometry examinations (13%), there were 105,696 valid examinations (median, 2 per participant). Of 29,351 participants followed for CLRD hospitalizations, median follow-up was 14 years; only 5% were lost to follow-up at 10 years. The NHLBI Pooled Cohorts Study provides a harmonization standard applied to a large, US population-based sample that may be used to advance epidemiologic research on CLRD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Associations with Pulmonary Symptoms and Function in Tobacco Smokers Enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS).", "Abstract": "Background: Marijuana is often smoked via a filterless cigarette and contains similar chemical makeup as smoked tobacco. There are few publications describing usage patterns and respiratory risks in older adults or in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of current and former tobacco smokers from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study assessed associations between marijuana use and pulmonary outcomes. Marijuana use was defined as never, former (use over 30 days ago), or current (use within 30 days). Respiratory health was assessed using quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, pulmonary function tests and questionnaire responses about respiratory symptoms. Results: Of the total 2304 participants, 1130 (49%) never, 982 (43%) former, and 192 (8%) current marijuana users were included. Neither current nor former marijuana use was associated with increased odds of wheeze (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, OR 0.97), cough (OR 1.22; OR 0.93) or chronic bronchitis (OR 0.87; OR 1.00) when compared to never users. Current and former marijuana users had lower quantitative emphysema (P=0.004, P=0.03), higher percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%) (P<0.001, P<0.001), and percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) (p<0.001, P<0.001). Current marijuana users exhibited higher total tissue volume (P=0.003) while former users had higher air trapping (P<0.001) when compared to never marijuana users. Conclusions: Marijuana use was found to have little to no association with poor pulmonary health in older current and former tobacco smokers after adjusting for covariates. Higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) was observed among current marijuana users. However, higher joint years was associated with more chronic bronchitis symptoms (e.g., wheeze), and this study cannot determine if long-term heavy marijuana smoking in the absence of tobacco smoking is associated with lung symptoms, airflow obstruction, or emphysema, particularly in those who have never smoked tobacco cigarettes.", "Keywords": ["Lung", "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "computed tomography scan", "cross-sectional", "emphysema", "epidemiology", "forced expiratory volume", "forced vital capacity", "marijuana", "pulmonary", "respiratory", "smoking", "tobacco"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Madeline A", "Last Name": "Morris", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Sean R", "Last Name": "Jacobson", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Gregory L", "Last Name": "Kinney", "Affiliation": "2-Department of Epidemiology, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora."}, {"First Name": "Donald P", "Last Name": "Tashkin", "Affiliation": "3-Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles."}, {"First Name": "Prescott G", "Last Name": "Woodruff", "Affiliation": "4-Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep and Allergy, Department of Medicine and Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Hoffman", "Affiliation": "5-Departments of Radiology, Medicine and Biomedical Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City."}, {"First Name": "Richard E", "Last Name": "Kanner", "Affiliation": "6-University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City."}, {"First Name": "Christopher B", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "3-Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles."}, {"First Name": "M Brad", "Last Name": "Drummond", "Affiliation": "8-Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."}, {"First Name": "R Graham", "Last Name": "Barr", "Affiliation": "9-Columbia University, Division of General Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Oelsner", "Affiliation": "9-Columbia University, Division of General Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Barry J", "Last Name": "Make", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "MeiLan K", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "10-University Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor."}, {"First Name": "Nadia N", "Last Name": "Hansel", "Affiliation": "11-Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Wanda K", "Last Name": "O'Neal", "Affiliation": "8-Division of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."}, {"First Name": "Russell P", "Last Name": "Bowler", "Affiliation": "1-National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado."}], "Journal": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Miami, Fla.)", "PubDate": "2018Jan24"}, {"PMID": "29529382", "Title": "Prognostic Significance of Large Airway Dimensions on Computed Tomography in the General Population.

We assessed the association of lung function with 2100 genes selected for cardiovascular diseases among 20 077 European-Americans and 6900 African-Americans. We performed replication of significant loci in the other racial group and an independent consortium of Europeans, tested the associations of significant loci with per cent emphysema and examined gene expression in an independent sample. We then tested the association of a related lipid biomarker with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and per cent emphysema. We identified one new polymorphism for FEV1/FVC (rs805301) in European-Americans (p=1.3\u00d710(-6)) and a second (rs707974) in the combined European-American and African-American analysis (p=1.38\u00d710(-7)). Both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flank the gene for apolipoprotein M (APOM), a component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Both were replicated in an independent cohort. SNPs in a second gene related to apolipoprotein M and HDL, PCSK9, were associated with FEV1/FVC ratio among African-Americans. rs707974 was associated with per cent emphysema among European-Americans and African-Americans and APOM expression was related to FEV1/FVC ratio and per cent emphysema. Higher HDL levels were associated with lower FEV1/FVC ratio and greater per cent emphysema.
