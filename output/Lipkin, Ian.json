[{"PMID": "38368384", "Title": "COVID-19 immune signatures in Uganda persist in HIV co-infection and diverge by pandemic phase.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in sub-Saharan Africa, where severe COVID-19 fatality rates are among the highest in the world and the immunological landscape is unique. In a prospective cohort study of 306 adults encompassing the entire clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Uganda, we profile the peripheral blood proteome and transcriptome to characterize the immunopathology of COVID-19 across multiple phases of the pandemic. Beyond the prognostic importance of myeloid cell-driven immune activation and lymphopenia, we show that multifaceted impairment of host protein synthesis and redox imbalance define core biological signatures of severe COVID-19, with central roles for IL-7, IL-15, and lymphotoxin-\u03b1 in COVID-19 respiratory failure. While prognostic signatures are generally consistent in SARS-CoV-2/HIV-coinfection, type I interferon responses uniquely scale with COVID-19 severity in persons living with HIV. Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 severity peaked during phases dominated by A.23/A.23.1 and Delta B.1.617.2/AY variants. Independent of clinical severity, Delta phase COVID-19 is distinguished by exaggerated pro-inflammatory myeloid cell and inflammasome activation, NK and CD8+ T cell depletion, and impaired host protein synthesis. Combining these analyses with a contemporary Ugandan cohort of adults hospitalized with influenza and other severe acute respiratory infections, we show that activation of epidermal and platelet-derived growth factor pathways are distinct features of COVID-19, deepening translational understanding of mechanisms potentially underlying SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, our findings provide biological rationale for use of broad and targeted immunotherapies for severe COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa, illustrate the relevance of local viral and host factors to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology, and highlight underemphasized yet therapeutically exploitable immune pathways driving COVID-19 severity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans",

Among 8 samples from known CNS infections in group 1, VirCapSeq and BacCapSeq confirmed 3 expected diagnoses (42.8%), were negative in 2 (25%), yielded an alternative result in 1 (11.1%), and did not detect 2 expected negative pathogens. The confirmed cases identified HHV-6, HSV-2, and VZV while the negative samples included JCV and HSV-2. In groups 2 and 3, 11/26 samples (42%) were positive for at least one pathogen; however, 27% of the total samples (7/26) were positive for commensal organisms.

Here, we identified a human AstV of the VA1 genotype, HAstV-NIH, as the cause of fatal encephalitis in an immunocompromised adult. We investigated the cells targeted by AstV, neurophysiological changes, and host responses by analyzing gene expression, protein expression, and cellular morphology in brain tissue from three cases of AstV neurologic disease (AstV-ND). We demonstrate that neurons are the principal cells targeted by AstV in the brain and that the cerebellum and brainstem have the highest burden of infection. Detection of VA1 AstV in interconnected brain structures such as thalamus, deep cerebellar nuclei, Purkinje cells, and pontine nuclei indicates that AstV may spread between connected neurons transsynaptically. We found transcriptional dysregulation of neural functions and disruption of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic innervation of infected neurons. Importantly, transcriptional dysregulation of neural functions occurred in fatal cases, but not in a patient that survived AstV-ND. We show that the innate, but not adaptive immune response was transcriptionally driving host defense in the brain of immunocompromised patients with AstV-ND. Both transcriptome and molecular pathology studies showed that most of the cellular changes were associated with CNS-intrinsic cells involved in phagocytosis and injury repair (microglia, perivascular/parenchymal border macrophages, and astrocytes), but not CNS-extrinsic cells (T and B cells), suggesting an imbalance of innate and adaptive immune responses to AstV infection in the brain as a result of the underlying immunodeficiencies. These results show that VA1 AstV infection of the brain in immunocompromised humans is associated with imbalanced host defense responses, disruption of neuronal somatodendritic compartments and synapses and increased phagocytic cellular activity. Improved understanding of the response to viral infections of the human CNS may provide clues for how to manipulate these processes to improve outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Humans", "Brain", "Central Nervous System", "Astroviridae Infections", "Neurons", "Immunity"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Olga A", "Last Name": "Maximova", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Melodie L", "Last Name": "Weller", "Affiliation": "Secretory Physiology Section, Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Tammy", "Last Name": "Krogmann", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Daniel E", "Last Name": "Sturdevant", "Affiliation": "Research Technologies Branch, Genomics Unit, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Stacy", "Last Name": "Ricklefs", "Affiliation": "Research Technologies Branch, Genomics Unit, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kimmo", "Last Name": "Virtaneva", "Affiliation": "Research Technologies Branch, Genomics Unit, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Craig", "Last Name": "Martens", "Affiliation": "Research Technologies Branch, Genomics Unit, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Kurt", "Last Name": "Wollenberg", "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch, Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Mahnaz", "Last Name": "Minai", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease Pathogenesis Section, Comparative Medicine Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ian N", "Last Name": "Moore", "Affiliation": "Infectious Disease Pathogenesis Section, Comparative Medicine Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Craig S", "Last Name": "Sauter", "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Juliet N", "Last Name": "Barker", "Affiliation": "Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Seilhean", "Affiliation": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Avindra", "Last Name": "Nath", "Affiliation": "Infections of the Nervous System Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeffrey I", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PLoS pathogens", "PubDate": "2023Aug"}, {"PMID": "37548511", "Title": "A Transcriptomic Classifier Model Identifies High-Risk Endotypes in a Prospective Study of Sepsis in Uganda.", "Abstract": "In high-income countries (HICs), sepsis endotypes defined by distinct pathobiological mechanisms, mortality risks, and responses to corticosteroid treatment have been identified using blood transcriptomics.

We characterized metabolomic profiles in ASD using plasma samples collected in the Norwegian Autism Birth Cohort from mothers at weeks 17-21 gestation (maternal mid-gestation, MMG, n\u2009=\u2009408) and from children on the day of birth (cord blood, CB, n\u2009=\u2009418). We analyzed associations using sex-stratified adjusted logistic regression models with Bayesian analyses. Chemical enrichment analyses (ChemRICH) were performed to determine altered chemical clusters. We also employed machine learning algorithms to assess the utility of metabolomics as ASD biomarkers. We identified ASD associations with a variety of chemical compounds including arachidonic acid, glutamate, and glutamine, and metabolite clusters including hydroxy eicospentaenoic acids, phosphatidylcholines, and ceramides in MMG and CB plasma that are consistent with inflammation, disruption of membrane integrity, and impaired neurotransmission and neurotoxicity. Girls with ASD have disruption of ether/non-ether phospholipid balance in the MMG plasma that is similar to that found in other neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD boys in the CB analyses had the highest number of dysregulated chemical clusters. Machine learning classifiers distinguished ASD cases from controls with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values ranging from 0.710 to 0.853.

In this context, patient stratification based on biomarkers of a dysregulated host response may identify subgroups more likely to respond to targeted immunomodulatory therapeutics. In a prospective cohort of adults hospitalized with suspected sepsis in Uganda, we applied machine learning methods to develop a prediction model for 30-day mortality that integrates physiology-based risk scores with soluble biomarkers reflective of key domains of sepsis immunopathology. After model evaluation and internal validation, whole-blood RNA sequencing data were analyzed to compare biological pathway enrichment and inferred immune cell profiles between patients assigned differential model-based risks of mortality. Of 260 eligible adults (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 26-43 years; 59.2% female, 53.9% living with HIV), 62 (23.8%) died by 30 days after hospital discharge. Among 14 biomarkers, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) demonstrated the greatest importance for mortality prediction in machine learning models. A clinicomolecular model integrating sTNFR1 and Ang-2 with the Universal Vital Assessment (UVA) risk score optimized 30-day mortality prediction across multiple performance metrics. Patients assigned to the high-risk, UVA-based clinicomolecular subgroup exhibited a transcriptional profile defined by proinflammatory innate immune and necroptotic pathway activation, T-cell exhaustion, and expansion of key immune cell subsets including regulatory and gamma-delta T cells. Clinicomolecular stratification of adults with suspected sepsis in Uganda enhanced 30-day mortality prediction and identified a high-risk subgroup with a therapeutically targetable immunological profile.

The molecular mechanisms surrounding the effects of viral infection on the host RNA machinery remain poorly characterized. We used a comparative transcriptomics approach to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the host mRNA and sRNA expression machinery in a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) and an African green monkey kidney cell line\u00a0(Vero-E6). Upon infection, we observed global changes in host gene expression and differential expression of dozens of host miRNAs, many with known links to viral infection and immune response. Additionally, we discovered an expanded landscape of more than a hundred SARS-CoV-2-derived small viral RNAs (svRNAs) predicted to interact with differentially expressed host mRNAs and miRNAs. svRNAs are derived from distinct regions of the viral genome and sequence signatures suggest they are produced by a non-canonical biogenesis pathway. 52 of the 67 svRNAs identified in Calu-3 cells are predicted to interact with differentially expressed miRNAs, with many svRNAs having multiple targets. Accordingly, we speculate that these svRNAs may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 propagation by modulating post-transcriptional gene regulation, and that methods for antagonizing them may have therapeutic value.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Humans", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "MicroRNAs", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19", "Lung", "RNA, Viral", "Gene Expression"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zachary T", "Last Name": "Neeb", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology and Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alexander J", "Last Name": "Ritter", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lokendra V", "Last Name": "Chauhan", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sol", "Last Name": "Katzman", "Affiliation": "UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nischay", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. nm2641@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy R", "Last Name": "Sanford", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology and Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA. jsanfor2@ucsc.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2022Dec15"}, {"PMID": "36448028", "Title": "Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants characterized during different COVID-19 waves in Mali.", "Abstract": "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants may have contributed to prolonging the pandemic, and increasing morbidity and mortality related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We analyzed clinical samples that were opportunistically collected from eight immunocompromised individuals for mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers against different SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the identification of immunoreactive epitopes using a high-throughput coronavirus peptide array. The viral genome analysis revealed two SARS-CoV-2 variants (20A from a deceased patient and an Alpha variant from a recovered patient) with an eight amino-acid (aa) deletion within the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the surface glycoprotein.

This challenge is dramatically evident in tilapia lake virus (TiLV), an emerging \"orthomyxo-like\" virus that threatens the global tilapia aquaculture and food security of millions of people. The majority of TiLV proteins have no homology to known sequences, impeding functionality assessments. Using a novel bioinformatics approach, we predicted that TiLV's Protein 4 encodes the nucleoprotein, a factor essential for viral RNA replication. Multiple methodologies revealed the expected properties of orthomyxoviral nucleoproteins. A modified yeast three-hybrid assay detected Protein 4-RNA interactions, which were independent of the RNA sequence, and identified specific positively charged residues involved. Protein 4-RNA interactions were uncovered by R-DeeP and XRNAX methodologies. Immunoelectron microscopy found that multiple Protein 4 copies localized along enriched ribonucleoproteins. TiLV RNA from cells and virions coimmunoprecipitated with Protein 4. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected Protein 4 in the cytoplasm and nuclei, and nuclear Protein 4 increased upon CRM1 inhibition, suggesting CRM1-dependent nuclear export of TiLV RNA. Together, these data reveal TiLV's nucleoprotein and highlight the ability to infer protein functionality, including novel RNA-binding proteins, in emerging pathogens. These are important in light of the expected discovery of many unknown viruses and the zoonotic potential of such pathogens. IMPORTANCE Tilapia is an important source of dietary protein, especially in developing countries. Massive losses of tilapia were identified worldwide, risking the food security of millions of people. Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) is an emerging pathogen responsible for these disease outbreaks. TiLV's genome encodes 10 major proteins, 9 of which show no homology to other known viral or cellular proteins, hindering functionality assessment of these proteins. Here, we describe a novel bioinformatics approach to infer the functionality of TiLV proteins, which predicted Protein 4 as the nucleoprotein, a factor essential for viral RNA replication. We provided experimental support for this prediction by applying multiple molecular, biochemical, and imaging approaches. Overall, we illustrate a strategy for functional analyses in viral discovery.

Infection with members of a subgroup of viruses within this genus, the nonpoliovirus enteroviruses (NPEVs), can result in a broad spectrum of serious illnesses, including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like childhood paralysis; neonatal sepsis; aseptic meningitis; myocarditis; and hand-foot-mouth disease. Despite the diverse primary sites of virus infection, including the respiratory and alimentary tracts, and an array of diseases associated with these infections, there is significant genetic and antigenic similarity among NPEVs. This conservation results in the induction of cross-reactive antibodies that are either able to bind and neutralize or bind but not neutralize multiple NPEVs. Using plaque reduction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based binding assays, we define the antigenic relationship among poliovirus and NPEVs, including multiple isolates of EV-D68, EV-A71, EV-D70, EV-94, EV-111, Coxsackievirus A24v, and rhinovirus. The results reveal extensive cross-reactivity among EVs that cannot be predicted from phylogenetic analysis. Determining the immunologic relationship among EVs is critical to understanding the humoral response elicited during homologous and heterologous virus infections. IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses (EVs) are common human pathogens. Although infection with EVs leads to cross-reactive antibodies, the clinical relevance of these antibodies is unclear given the estimated incidence of EV infections in the general population of one per year. The hypothesis that anti-EV cross-reactive antibodies can bind and neutralize heterologous EVs was investigated using polyclonal sera collected from animals immunized with individual EVs. Both binding and neutralization activities against heterologous EVs was observed in these sera, and we speculate that cross-reactive antibodies may modulate infection and disease severity.

First isolated from a forest worker in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955, the arbovirus OROV has since been detected throughout the Amazon basin with an estimated 500,000 human infections over 60\u2009years. Like other members of the family Peribunyaviridae, the viral genome exists as 3 single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. The medium-sized segment encodes a viral glycoprotein complex (GPC) that is proteolytically processed into two viral envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, responsible for attachment and membrane fusion. There are no therapeutics or vaccines to combat OROV infection, and we have little understanding of protective immunity to infection. Here, we generated a replication competent chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the endogenous glycoprotein was replaced by the GPC of OROV. Serum from mice immunized by intramuscular injection with VSV-OROV specifically neutralized wild-type OROV, and using peptide arrays we mapped multiple epitopes within an N-terminal variable region of Gc recognized by the immune sera. VSV-OROV lacking this variable region of Gc was also immunogenic in mice producing neutralizing sera that recognize additional regions of Gc. Challenge of both sets of immunized mice with wild-type OROV shows that the VSV-OROV chimeras reduce wild-type viral infection and suggest that antibodies that recognize the variable N terminus of Gc afford less protection than those that target more conserved regions of Gc. IMPORTANCE Oropouche virus (OROV), an orthobunyavirus found in Central and South America, is an emerging public health challenge that causes debilitating febrile illness. OROV is transmitted by arthropods, and increasing mobilization has the potential to significantly increase the spread of OROV globally. Despite this, no therapeutics or vaccines have been developed to combat infection. Using vesicular stomatitis (VSV) as a backbone, we developed a chimeric virus bearing the OROV glycoproteins (VSV-OROV) and tested its ability to elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Our results demonstrate that VSV-OROV produces a strong neutralizing antibody response that is at least partially targeted to the N-terminal region of Gc. Importantly, vaccination with VSV-OROV reduces viral loads in mice challenged with wild-type virus. These data provide novel evidence that targeting the OROV glycoproteins may be an effective vaccination strategy to combat OROV infection.", "Keywords": ["Oropouche virus", "arbovirus", "bunyavirus", "emerging infectious diseases", "vaccines"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Bunyaviridae Infections", "Genome, Viral", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Orthobunyavirus", "Vesicular Stomatitis", "Vesiculovirus", "Viral Envelope Proteins", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah Hulsey", "Last Name": "Stubbs", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical Schoolgrid.471403.5, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marjorie", "Last Name": "Cornejo Pontelli", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nischay", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Changhong", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical Schoolgrid.471403.5, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Juliano", "Last Name": "de Paula Souza", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Rosa Maria", "Last Name": "Mendes Viana", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "David M", "Last Name": "Knipe", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Harvard Medical Schoolgrid.471403.5, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eurico", "Last Name": "Arruda", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Sean P J", "Last Name": "Whelan", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2021Aug31"}, {"PMID": "34175230", "Title": "Insights from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome may help unravel the pathogenesis of postacute COVID-19 syndrome.", "Abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause chronic and acute disease.

In Bangladesh, infection occurs when people drink date-palm sap contaminated with bat excreta. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the influence of viral dynamics in bats on their temporal and spatial distribution is poorly understood. We analyzed data on host ecology, molecular epidemiology, serological dynamics, and viral genetics to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of NiV dynamics in its wildlife reservoir, Pteropus medius bats, in Bangladesh. We found that NiV transmission occurred throughout the country and throughout the year. Model results indicated that local transmission dynamics were modulated by density-dependent transmission, acquired immunity that is lost over time, and recrudescence. Increased transmission followed multiyear periods of declining seroprevalence due to bat-population turnover and individual loss of humoral immunity. Individual bats had smaller host ranges than other Pteropus species (spp.), although movement data and the discovery of a Malaysia-clade NiV strain in eastern Bangladesh suggest connectivity with bats east of Bangladesh. These data suggest that discrete multiannual local epizootics in bat populations contribute to the sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks in South Asia. At the same time, the broad spatial and temporal extent of NiV transmission, including the recent outbreak in Kerala, India, highlights the continued risk of spillover to humans wherever they may interact with pteropid bats and the importance of limiting opportunities for spillover throughout Pteropus's range.", "Keywords": ["Nipah virus", "Pteropus", "bats", "disease modeling", "henipavirus"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Asia", "Bangladesh", "Chiroptera", "Disease Outbreaks", "Female", "Henipavirus Infections", "Host Specificity", "Humans", "Immunity", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Nipah Virus", "Phylogeny", "Zoonoses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan H", "Last Name": "Epstein", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018; epstein@ecohealthalliance.org."}, {"First Name": "Simon J", "Last Name": "Anthony", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Ariful", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}, {"First Name": "A Marm", "Last Name": "Kilpatrick", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064."}, {"First Name": "Shahneaz", "Last Name": "Ali Khan", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}, {"First Name": "Maria D", "Last Name": "Balkey", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Noam", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}, {"First Name": "Ina", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Geelong, VIC 3219, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Zambrana-Torrelio", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}, {"First Name": "Yun", "Last Name": "Tao", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}, {"First Name": "Ausraful", "Last Name": "Islam", "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Phenix Lan", "Last Name": "Quan", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Kevin J", "Last Name": "Olival", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}, {"First Name": "M Salah Uddin", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Emily S", "Last Name": "Gurley", "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "M Jahangir", "Last Name": "Hossein", "Affiliation": "Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Banjul, The Gambia."}, {"First Name": "Hume E", "Last Name": "Field", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}, {"First Name": "Mark D", "Last Name": "Fielder", "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Science, Engineering and Computing Faculty, Kingston University, London KT1 2EE, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Briese", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Mahmudur", "Last Name": "Rahman", "Affiliation": "Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research, Government of Bangladesh, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "Christopher C", "Last Name": "Broder", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814."}, {"First Name": "Gary", "Last Name": "Crameri", "Affiliation": "CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Geelong, VIC 3219, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Lin-Fa", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857."}, {"First Name": "Stephen P", "Last Name": "Luby", "Affiliation": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Daszak", "Affiliation": "EcoHealth Alliance, New York, NY 10018."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2020Nov17"}, {"PMID": "32998967", "Title": "Paenibacillus infection with frequent viral coinfection contributes to postinfectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants.", "Abstract": "Postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH), which often follows neonatal sepsis, is the most common cause of pediatric hydrocephalus worldwide, yet the microbial pathogens underlying this disease remain to be elucidated. Characterization of the microbial agents causing PIH would enable a shift from surgical palliation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation to prevention of the disease. Here, we examined blood and CSF samples collected from 100 consecutive infant cases of PIH and control cases comprising infants with non-postinfectious hydrocephalus in Uganda. Genomic sequencing of samples was undertaken to test for bacterial, fungal, and parasitic DNA; DNA and RNA sequencing was used to identify viruses; and bacterial culture recovery was used to identify potential causative organisms. We found that infection with the bacterium Paenibacillus, together with frequent cytomegalovirus (CMV) coinfection, was associated with PIH in our infant cohort. Assembly of the genome of a facultative anaerobic bacterial isolate recovered from cultures of CSF samples from PIH cases identified a strain of Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus This strain, designated Mbale, was lethal when injected into mice in contrast to the benign reference Paenibacillus strain. These findings show that an unbiased pan-microbial approach enabled characterization of Paenibacillus in CSF samples from PIH cases, and point toward a pathway of more optimal treatment and prevention for PIH and other proximate neonatal infections.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Child", "Coinfection", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus", "Infant", "Mice", "Paenibacillus", "Uganda"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joseph N", "Last Name": "Paulson", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Product Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent L", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Hehnly", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nischay", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shamim A", "Last Name": "Sinnar", "Affiliation": "Center for Neural Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lijun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Personalized Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paddy", "Last Name": "Ssentongo", "Affiliation": "Center for Neural Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edith", "Last Name": "Mbabazi-Kabachelor", "Affiliation": "CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda, Plot 97-105, Bugwere Road, P.O.

New Jersey polyomavirus (NJPyV) was identified via a muscle biopsy in an organ transplant recipient with systemic vasculitis, myositis, and retinal blindness, and human polyomavirus 12 (HPyV12) was detected in human liver tissue. The evolutionary origins and potential diseases are not well understood for either virus. In order to define their receptor engagement strategies, we first used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to establish that the major capsid proteins (VP1) of both viruses bind to sialic acid in solution. We then solved crystal structures of NJPyV and HPyV12 VP1 alone and in complex with sialylated glycans. NJPyV employs a novel binding site for a \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid, whereas HPyV12 engages terminal \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids in an exposed site similar to that found in Trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV). Gangliosides or glycoproteins, featuring in mammals usually terminal sialic acids, are therefore receptor candidates for both viruses. Structural analyses show that the sialic acid-binding site of NJPyV is conserved in chimpanzee polyomavirus (ChPyV) and that the sialic acid-binding site of HPyV12 is widely used across the entire polyomavirus family, including mammalian and avian polyomaviruses. A comparison with other polyomavirus-receptor complex structures shows that their capsids have evolved to generate several physically distinct virus-specific receptor-binding sites that can all specifically engage sialylated glycans through a limited number of contacts. Small changes in each site may have enabled host-switching events during the evolution of polyomaviruses.IMPORTANCE Virus attachment to cell surface receptors is critical for productive infection. In this study, we have used a structure-based approach to investigate the cell surface recognition event for New Jersey polyomavirus (NJPyV) and human polyomavirus 12 (HPyV12). These viruses belong to the polyomavirus family, whose members target different tissues and hosts, including mammals, birds, fish, and invertebrates. Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses, and the receptor-binding site is located in their capsid protein VP1. The NJPyV capsid features a novel sialic acid-binding site that is shifted in comparison to other structurally characterized polyomaviruses but shared with a closely related simian virus. In contrast, HPyV12 VP1 engages terminal sialic acids in a manner similar to the human Trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus. Our structure-based phylogenetic analysis highlights that even distantly related avian polyomaviruses possess the same exposed sialic acid-binding site. These findings complement phylogenetic models of host-virus codivergence and may also reflect past host-switching events.", "Keywords": ["evolution", "glycan receptor", "host-pathogen interactions", "polyomavirus", "sialic acid", "virus tropism"], "MeSH terms": ["Binding Sites", "Capsid Proteins", "Crystallography", "Evolution, Molecular", "Humans", "N-Acetylneuraminic Acid", "Phylogeny", "Polyomavirus", "Polyomavirus Infections", "Polysaccharides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Receptors, Virus", "Virus Attachment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luisa J", "Last Name": "Str\u00f6h", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nils H", "Last Name": "Rustmeier", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "B\u00e4rbel S", "Last Name": "Blaum", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Josephine", "Last Name": "Botsch", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philip", "Last Name": "R\u00f6\u00dfler", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Wedekink", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nischay", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thilo", "Last Name": "Stehle", "Affiliation": "Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany thilo.stehle@uni-tuebingen.de."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2020Jul28"}, {"PMID": "32709241", "Title": "Characterization of a Monanema nematode in Ixodes scapularis.", "Abstract": "Metagenomic studies have revealed the presence of a filarial nematode in Ixodes scapularis.

"Maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can have profound teratogenic effects including microcephaly and intracranial calcification. In adults, infection may cause acute inflammatory polyneuropathy. These complications appear after resolution of viremia. Thus, molecular assays of blood are typically insufficient to make the link between ZIKV infection and disease. An alternative approach to testing for ZIKV exposure is serology. However, specific serological implication of ZIKV can be confounded by cross-reactivity with closely related flaviviruses. We used high-density peptide arrays that tile the proteomes of a selection of arboviruses to search for ZIKV-specific linear epitopes that would enable the development of accurate serological tests. We identified a 20-amino-acid-long diagnostic peptide sequence in the NS2B protein of ZIKV that was immunoreactive with sera from patients with a confirmed history of infection with ZIKV but not other flaviviruses. We then established a ZIKV peptide ELISA (ZIKV-NS2B-concat ELISA) that enables sensitive and specific diagnosis of exposure to ZIKV.", "Keywords": ["Arboviruses", "Emerging infectious diseases", "Flavivirus", "Peptide ELISA", "Serology", "ZIKV-NS2B-concat ELISA", "Zika virus"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Viral", "Antibody Specificity", "Biotinylation", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Epitopes", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Peptide Fragments", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Infectious", "Serologic Tests", "Viral Nonstructural Proteins", "Zika Virus", "Zika Virus Infection"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Nischay", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. nm2641@cumc.columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Riddhi", "Last Name": "Thakkar", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "32327489", "Title": "Neurologic manifestations in an infant with COVID-19.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Betacoronavirus", "Brain", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Testing", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Coinfection", "Coronavirus Infections", "Electroencephalography", "Enterovirus", "Humans", "Infant", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Pandemics", "Picornaviridae Infections", "Pneumonia, Viral", "Procalcitonin", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "SARS-CoV-2"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rachelle", "Last Name": "Dugue", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Neurology (R.D., K.C.C.-M., K.T.T., D.K.M., J.M.B.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center;

Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains.IMPORTANCE Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.", "Keywords": ["MERS-CoV", "PDF2180", "coronavirus", "emergence", "spike", "zoonotic"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Caco-2 Cells", "Chiroptera", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Coronavirus Infections", "Humans", "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus", "Receptors, Virus", "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "Trypsin", "Vero Cells", "Zoonoses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Vineet D", "Last Name": "Menachery", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth H", "Last Name": "Dinnon", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Boyd L", "Last Name": "Yount", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eileen T", "Last Name": "McAnarney", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lisa E", "Last Name": "Gralinski", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Hale", "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel L", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Trevor", "Last Name": "Scobey", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simon J", "Last Name": "Anthony", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lingshu", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Barney", "Last Name": "Graham", "Affiliation": "Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Scott H", "Last Name": "Randell", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, and Marsico Lung Institute/Cystic Fibrosis Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ralph S", "Last Name": "Baric", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA Rbaric@email.unc.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2020Feb14"}, {"PMID": "31636001", "Title": "Identification of immunoreactive linear epitopes of Borrelia miyamotoi.", "Abstract": "Borrelia miyamotoi is an emerging tick-borne spirochete transmitted by ixodid ticks.

Accurate host identification can be difficult in assays of complex samples that contain more than one potential host. Using unbiased metagenomic sequencing, we investigated wild house mice (Mus musculus) and brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) from New York City to determine the aetiology of liver disease. Light microscopy was used to characterize liver disease, and fluorescent microscopy with in situ hybridization was employed to identify viral cell tropism. Sequences representing two novel negative-sense RNA viruses were identified in homogenates of wild house mouse liver tissue: Amsterdam virus and Fulton virus. In situ hybridization localized viral RNA to Capillaria hepatica, a parasitic nematode that had infected the mouse liver.

Enlarged lymph nodes demonstrating CD histopathology can occur in isolation (unicentric CD; UCD) sometimes accompanied by mild symptoms, or at multiple sites (multicentric CD, MCD) with systemic inflammation and cytokine-driven multi-organ dysfunction. The discovery that Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 drives MCD in a subset of patients has led to the hypotheses that UCD and MCD patients with negative HHV-8 testing by conventional methods may represent false negatives, or that these cases are driven by another virus, known or unknown. To investigate these hypotheses, the virome capture sequencing for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) platform was employed to detect RNA transcripts from known and novel viruses in fresh frozen lymph node tissue from CD patients (12 UCD, 11 HHV-8-negative MCD [idiopathic MCD; iMCD], and two HHV-8-positive MCD) and related diseases (three T cell lymphoma and three Hodgkin lymphoma). This assay detected HHV-8 in both HHV-8-positive cases; however, HHV-8 was not found in clinically HHV-8-negative iMCD or UCD cases. Additionally, no novel viruses were discovered, and no single known virus was detected with apparent association to HHV-8-negative CD cases. Herpesviridae family members, notably including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), were detected in 7 out of 12 UCD and 5 of 11 iMCD cases with apparent correlations with markers of disease severity in iMCD. Analysis of a separate cohort of archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissue by In situ hybridization revealed significantly fewer EBV-positive cells in UCD and iMCD compared to tissue from HHV-8-positive MCD and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. In an additional cohort, quantitative testing for EBV by PCR in peripheral blood during disease flare did not detect systemic EBV viremia, suggesting detection lymph node tissue is due to occult, local reactivation in UCD and iMCD. This study confirms that HHV-8 is not present in UCD and iMCD patients. Further, it fails to establish a clear association between any single virus, novel or known, and CD in HHV-8-negative cases.

We used one such approach, the virome capture sequencing for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) platform, on 21 samples originating from six dead Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) from Ta\u00ef National Park, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. We detected the presence of an orthohepadnavirus in one animal and characterized its 3128 bp genome. The highest viral copy numbers were detected in the spleen, followed by the lung, blood, and liver, with the lowest copy numbers in the kidney and heart; the virus was not detected in the jejunum. Viral copy numbers in the blood were in the range known from humans with active chronic infections leading to liver histolytic damage, suggesting this virus could be pathogenic in duikers, though many orthohepadnaviruses appear to be apathogenic in other hosts, precluding a formal test of this hypothesis. The virus was not detected in 29 other dead duiker samples from the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Central African Republic, suggesting either a spillover event or a low prevalence in these populations. Phylogenetic analysis placed the virus as a divergent member of the mammalian clade of orthohepadnaviruses, though its relationship to other orthohepadnaviruses remains uncertain. This represents the first orthohepadnavirus described in an artiodactyl.

We identified 129 viruses as differentially abundant between the gut of cases and controls, including 5 EV-A types significantly more abundant in the cases. Our findings further support EV's hypothesised contribution to IA and corroborate the proposal that viral load may be an important parameter in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, our data indicate a previously unrecognised association of IA with higher EV-A abundance in the gut of children and provide a catalog of viruses to be interrogated further to determine a causal link between virus infection and type 1 diabetes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Autoimmunity", "Biodiversity", "Case-Control Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Disease Susceptibility", "Enterovirus", "Enterovirus Infections", "Feces", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Islets of Langerhans", "Male", "Prevalence", "Viral Load"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ki Wook", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jessica L", "Last Name": "Horton", "Affiliation": "School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Chi Nam Ignatius", "Last Name": "Pang", "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology and Biomedical Sciences, University of New South Wales Faculty of Science, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Komal", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Preston", "Last Name": "Leung", "Affiliation": "Systems Medicine, Inflammation and Infection Research Centre, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Sonia R", "Last Name": "Isaacs", "Affiliation": "School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Rowena A", "Last Name": "Bull", "Affiliation": "Systems Medicine, Inflammation and Infection Research Centre, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Fabio", "Last Name": "Luciani", "Affiliation": "Systems Medicine, Inflammation and Infection Research Centre, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Marc R", "Last Name": "Wilkins", "Affiliation": "School of Biotechnology and Biomedical Sciences, University of New South Wales Faculty of Science, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jacki", "Last Name": "Catteau", "Affiliation": "Institute of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "William D", "Last Name": "Rawlinson", "Affiliation": "School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Briese", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Maria E", "Last Name": "Craig", "Affiliation": "School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine, Sydney, Australia. m.craig@unsw.edu.au."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2019Feb11"}, {"PMID": "30665502", "Title": "Interpreting New Evidence on Prenatal Infections and Mental Disorders.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Denmark", "Female", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Parents", "Pregnancy", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ezra", "Last Name": "Susser", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York; New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York.

In adults, infection may trigger autoimmune inflammatory polyneuropathy. Transmission most commonly follows the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes but may also occur through sexual intercourse or receipt of blood products. Definitive diagnosis through detection of viral RNA is possible in serum or plasma within 10\u00a0days of disease onset, in whole blood within 3\u00a0weeks of onset, and in semen for up to 3\u00a0months. Serological diagnosis is nonetheless critical because few patients have access to molecular diagnostics during the acute phase of infection and infection may be associated with only mild or inapparent disease that does not prompt molecular testing. Serological diagnosis is confounded by cross-reactivity of immune sera with other flaviviruses endemic in the areas where ZIKV has recently emerged. Accordingly, we built a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0%) and specificity (95.9%) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3\u00a0weeks after onset of symptomatic infection).IMPORTANCE The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a teratogen is a profound challenge to global public health. Molecular diagnosis of infection is straightforward during the 3-week period when patients are viremic.

Each assay contains approximately 170,000 12-mer linear peptides that tile along the protein sequence of the major antigens from each agent with 11 amino acid overlap. This permits accurate identification of a wide range of specific immunodominant IgG and IgM epitopes that can then be used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and integrate differential diagnosis into a single assay. To test the performance of the TBD-Serochip, we examined sera from patients with confirmed Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Powassan virus disease. We identified a wide range of specific discriminatory epitopes that facilitated accurate diagnosis of each disease. We also identified previously undiagnosed infections.

Additionally, Norway rats were more likely to be infected with Bartonella than roof rats in New Orleans.

Among hepaciviruses, the closest known HCV relative is the equine non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV). Here, we used Argonaute cross-linking immunoprecipitation (AGO-CLIP) to confirm AGO binding to the single predicted miR-122 site in the NPHV 5'UTR in vivo. To study miR-122 requirements in the absence of NPHV-permissive cell culture systems, we generated infectious NPHV/HCV chimeric viruses with the 5' end of NPHV replacing orthologous HCV sequences. These chimeras were viable even in cells lacking miR-122, although miR-122 presence enhanced virus production. No other miRNAs bound this region. By random mutagenesis, we isolated HCV variants partially dependent on miR-122 as well as robustly replicating NPHV/HCV variants completely independent of any miRNAs. These miRNA independent variants even replicate and produce infectious particles in non-hepatic cells after exogenous delivery of apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Our findings suggest that miR-122 independent HCV and NPHV variants have arisen and been sampled during evolution, yet miR-122 dependence has prevailed.

In the absence of immunocompetent models with robust HCV infection, homolog hepaciviruses in their natural host could potentially provide useful surrogate models. We isolated a rodent hepacivirus from wild rats (Rattus norvegicus), RHV-rn1; acquired the complete viral genome sequence; and developed an infectious reverse genetics system. RHV-rn1 resembles HCV in genomic features including the pattern of polyprotein cleavage sites and secondary structures in the viral 5' and 3' untranslated regions. We used site-directed and random mutagenesis to determine that only the first of the two microRNA-122 seed sites in the viral 5' untranslated region is required for viral replication and persistence in rats. Next, we used the clone-derived virus progeny to infect several inbred and outbred rat strains. Our results determined that RHV-rn1 possesses several HCV-defining hallmarks: hepatotropism, propensity to persist, and the ability to induce gradual liver damage. Histological examination of liver samples revealed the presence of lymphoid aggregates, parenchymal inflammation, and macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis in chronically infected rats. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that the intrahepatic response during RHV-rn1 infection in rats mirrors that of HCV infection, including persistent activation of interferon signaling pathways. Finally, we determined that the backbone drug of HCV direct-acting antiviral therapy, sofosbuvir, effectively suppresses chronic RHV-rn1 infection in rats.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alanine Transaminase", "Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C", "Liver Diseases", "MicroRNAs", "RNA, Viral", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Virus Replication"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sheetal", "Last Name": "Trivedi", "Affiliation": "Center for Vaccines and Immunity, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."}, {"First Name": "Satyapramod", "Last Name": "Murthy", "Affiliation": "Center for Vaccines and Immunity, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."}, {"First Name": "Himanshu", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Center for Vaccines and Immunity, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."}, {"First Name": "Alex S", "Last Name": "Hartlage", "Affiliation": "Center for Vaccines and Immunity, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."}, {"First Name": "Arvind", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Center for Vaccines and Immunity, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."}, {"First Name": "Sashi V", "Last Name": "Gadi", "Affiliation": "College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Simmonds", "Affiliation": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Lokendra V", "Last Name": "Chauhan", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Troels K H", "Last Name": "Scheel", "Affiliation": "Copenhagen Hepatitis C Program, Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, and Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}, {"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Billerbeck", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Peter D", "Last Name": "Burbelo", "Affiliation": "Dental Clinical Research Core, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Charles M", "Last Name": "Rice", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kurt", "Last Name": "Vandegrift", "Affiliation": "Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA."}, {"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Cullen", "Affiliation": "College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC."}, {"First Name": "Amit", "Last Name": "Kapoor", "Affiliation": "Center for Vaccines and Immunity, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."}], "Journal": "Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)", "PubDate": "2018Aug"}, {"PMID": "28726621", "Title": "Characterization of Fitzroy River Virus and Serologic Evidence of Human and Animal Infection.", "Abstract": "In northern Western Australia in 2011 and 2012, surveillance detected a novel arbovirus in mosquitoes.

To address this uncertainty, we obtained information from questionnaires and samples from the Autism Birth Cohort, a prospective birth cohort comprising mothers, fathers, and offspring recruited in Norway in 1999 to 2008. Through questionnaires, referrals, and linkages to the Norwegian National Patient Registry, we identified 338 mothers of children with ASD and 348 frequency-matched controls for whom plasma samples that had been collected midpregnancy and after delivery were available for influenza virus serology via luciferase immunoprecipitation and hemagglutinin inhibition assays for influenza virus strains circulating during the study period. Assay data were combined to define serological status and integrated with self-reports of influenza-like illness to estimate ASD risk. Neither influenza A nor influenza B virus infection was associated with increased ASD risk. Integration of reports of symptoms of influenza-like illness with serology revealed an increase in risk for seropositive women with symptoms, but this increase did not achieve statistical significance (a level of P < 0.05) in the comparison with seronegative women without symptoms (adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 3.89; P = 0.068). Although chance may explain our findings, the magnitude of the potential association may be of biological importance, and dismissing our findings could result in failure to detect a bona fide association (type II error). If the association is true, we posit that the risk is due to activation of the maternal immune system following infection rather than direct fetal infection. Data on levels of cytokines or other mediators of inflammation would allow us to test the validity of this hypothesis. IMPORTANCE The causes of most cases of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are unknown. Some epidemiological studies suggest that maternal gestational influenza virus infection may increase the risk of ASD in offspring. Here, we describe an analysis of a large birth cohort with results based on questionnaires that prospectively addressed subjective reports of influenza-like illness and serological assays for objective determination of influenza virus infection. Although serologic evidence of gestational influenza virus infection alone was not associated with risk, positive serology and symptoms of influenza-like illness cannot yet be definitely ruled out as a risk factor.", "Keywords": ["autism", "birth cohort", "infection", "influenza virus", "prenatal", "serology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Milada", "Last Name": "Mahic", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyu", "Last Name": "Che", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ezra", "Last Name": "Susser", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Levin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ted", "Last Name": "Reichborn-Kjennerud", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Per", "Last Name": "Magnus", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Camilla", "Last Name": "Stoltenberg", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Lokendrasingh", "Last Name": "Chauhan", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Briese", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michaeline", "Last Name": "Bresnahan", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "P\u00e5l", "Last Name": "Sur\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Mady", "Last Name": "Hornig", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Siri", "Last Name": "Mjaaland", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2017May-Jun"}, {"PMID": "28639396", "Title": "The influence of parental concern on the utility of autism diagnostic instruments.", "Abstract": "The parental report-based Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the clinician observation-based Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) have been validated primarily in U.S. clinics specialized in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in which most children are referred by their parents because of ASD concern. This study assessed diagnostic agreement of the ADOS-2 and ADI-R toddler algorithms in a more broadly based sample of 679 toddlers (age 35-47 months) from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort. We also examined whether parental concern about ASD influenced instrument performance, comparing toddlers identified based on parental ASD concern (n\u2009=\u200948) and parent-reported signs of developmental problems (screening) without a specific concern about ASD (n\u2009=\u2009400). The ADOS cutoffs showed consistently well-balanced sensitivity and specificity. The ADI-R cutoffs demonstrated good specificity, but reduced sensitivity, missing 43% of toddlers whose parents were not specifically concerned about ASD. The ADI-R and ADOS dimensional scores agreed well with clinical diagnoses (area under the curve\u2009\u2265\u20090.85), contributing additively to their prediction. On the ADI-R, different cutoffs were needed according to presence or absence of parental ASD concern, in order to achieve comparable balance of sensitivity and specificity. These results highlight the importance of taking parental concern about ASD into account when interpreting scores from parental report-based instruments such as the ADI-R. While the ADOS cutoffs performed consistently well, the additive contributions of ADI-R and ADOS scores to the prediction of ASD diagnosis underscore the value of combining instruments based on parent accounts and clinician observation in evaluation of ASD.

Neuroactive metabolites generated from the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation have been implicated in several human neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report that brain expression of key enzymes in the kynurenine pathway are significantly, but differentially, altered in neonatal and adult rats with BDV infection. Gene expression analysis of rat brains following neonatal infection showed increased expression of kynurenine amino transferase II (KATII) and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) enzymes. Additionally, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression was only modestly increased in a brain region- and time-dependent manner in neonatally infected rats; however, its expression was highly increased in adult infected rats. The most dramatic impact on gene expression was seen for KMO, whose activity promotes the production of neurotoxic quinolinic acid. KMO expression was persistently elevated in brain regions of both newborn and adult BDV-infected rats, with increases reaching up to 86-fold. KMO protein levels were increased in neonatally infected rats and colocalized with neurons, the primary target cells of BDV infection. Furthermore, quinolinic acid was elevated in neonatally infected rat brains. We further demonstrate increased expression of KATII and KMO, but not IDO, in vitro in BDV-infected C6 astroglioma cells. Our results suggest that BDV directly impacts the kynurenine pathway, an effect that may be exacerbated by inflammatory responses in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, experimental models of BDV infection may provide new tools for discriminating virus-mediated from immune-mediated impacts on the kynurenine pathway and their relative contribution to neurodegeneration.IMPORTANCE BDV causes persistent, noncytopathic infection in vitro yet still elicits widespread neurodegeneration of infected neurons in both immunoincompetent and immunocompetent hosts. Here, we show that BDV infection induces expression of key enzymes of the kynurenine pathway in brains of newborn and adult infected rats and cultured astroglioma cells, shunting tryptophan degradation toward the production of neurotoxic quinolinic acid. Thus, our findings newly implicate this metabolic pathway in BDV-induced neurodegeneration. Given the importance of the kynurenine pathway in a wide range of human infections and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, animal models of BDV infection may serve as important tools for contrasting direct viral and indirect antiviral immune-mediated impacts on kynurenine pathway dysregulation and the ensuing neurodevelopmental and neuropathological consequences.", "Keywords": ["Borna disease virus", "central nervous system", "kynurenine", "neonatal", "neurodegeneration", "quinolinic acid", "tryptophan"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Borna Disease", "Borna disease virus", "Brain", "Cell Line", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Kynurenine", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Quinolinic Acid", "Rats"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Simone", "Last Name": "Formisano", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mady", "Last Name": "Hornig", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kavitha", "Last Name": "Yaddanapudi", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mansi", "Last Name": "Vasishtha", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Loren H", "Last Name": "Parsons", "Affiliation": "Committee on the Neurobiology of Addictive Disorders, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Briese", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Brent L", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA bw2101@cumc.columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of virology", "PubDate": "2017Jul15"}, {"PMID": "28441964", "Title": "Fecal metagenomic profiles in subgroups of patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.", "Abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue, commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, fever, lymphadenopathy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Spectrum Disorder in Male Offspring.", "Abstract": "Maternal infections during pregnancy are associated with risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Proposed pathogenetic mechanisms include fetal infection, placental inflammation, and maternal cytokines or antibodies that cross the placenta. The Autism Birth Cohort comprises mothers, fathers, and offspring recruited in Norway in 1999 to 2008. Through questionnaire screening, referrals, and linkages to a national patient registry, 442 mothers of children with ASD were identified, and 464 frequency-matched controls were selected. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and HSV-2 in plasma collected at midpregnancy and after delivery were measured by multiplexed immunoassays. High levels of HSV-2 IgG antibodies in maternal midpregnancy plasma were associated with increased risk of ASD in male offspring (an increase in HSV-2 IgG levels from 240 to 640 arbitrary units/ml was associated with an odds ratio of 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 4.06; P = 0.03) when adjusted for parity and child's birth year. No association was found between ASD and the presence of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, CMV, or HSV-1. Additional studies are needed to test for replicability of risk and specificity of the sex effect and to examine risk associated with other infections. IMPORTANCE The cause (or causes) of most cases of autism spectrum disorder is unknown. Evidence from epidemiological studies and work in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders suggest that both genetic and environmental factors may be implicated. The latter include gestational infection and immune activation. In our cohort, high levels of antibodies to herpes simplex virus 2 at midpregnancy were associated with an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder in male offspring. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that gestational infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder and have the potential to drive new efforts to monitor women more closely for cryptic gestational infection and to implement suppressive therapy during pregnancy.", "Keywords": ["autism", "birth cohort", "herpes simplex virus", "infection", "prenatal", "serology"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Milada", "Last Name": "Mahic", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Siri", "Last Name": "Mjaaland", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Hege Marie", "Last Name": "B\u00f8velstad", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Gunnes", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Ezra", "Last Name": "Susser", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michaeline", "Last Name": "Bresnahan", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anne-Siri", "Last Name": "\u00d8yen", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway; Nic Waals Institute, Lovisenberg Hospital, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Levin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyu", "Last Name": "Che", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Hirtz", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ted", "Last Name": "Reichborn-Kjennerud", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Synnve", "Last Name": "Schj\u00f8lberg", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway; Nic Waals Institute, Lovisenberg Hospital, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Per", "Last Name": "Magnus", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Camilla", "Last Name": "Stoltenberg", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway; Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway."}, {"First Name": "P\u00e5l", "Last Name": "Sur\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway."}, {"First Name": "Mady", "Last Name": "Hornig", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mSphere", "PubDate": "2017Jan-Feb"}, {"PMID": "27974544", "Title": "Detection of Tilapia Lake Virus in Clinical Samples by Culturing and Nested Reverse Transcription-PCR.", "Abstract": "Tilapia are an important group of farmed fish that serve as a significant protein source worldwide.

We determined and analyzed the genome sequences of five Australian viruses isolated from mosquitoes collected during routine arbovirus surveillance in Western Australia (K10441, SW27571, K13190, and K42904) and New South Wales (12005). Based on matching sequences of all three genome segments to prototype MRM3630 of Trubanaman virus (TRUV), NB6057 of Gan Gan virus (GGV), and MK7532 of Maprik virus (MPKV), isolates K13190 and SW27571 were identified as TRUV, 12005 as GGV, and K42904 as a Mapputta group virus from Western Australia linking GGV and MPKV. The results confirmed serum neutralization data that had linked SW27571 to TRUV. The fifth virus, K10441 from Willare, was most closely related to Batai orthobunyavirus, presumably representing an Australian variant of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed the close relationship of our TRUV and GGV isolates to two other recently described Australian viruses, Murrumbidgee virus and Salt Ash virus, respectively. Our findings indicate that TRUV has a wide circulation throughout the Australian continent, demonstrating for the first time its presence in Western Australia. Similarly, the presence of a virus related to GGV, which had been linked to human disease and previously known only from the Australian southeast, was demonstrated in Western Australia. Finally, a Batai virus isolate was identified in Western Australia. The expanding availability of genomic sequence for novel Australian bunyavirus variants supports the identification of suitably conserved or diverse primer-binding target regions to establish group-wide as well as virus-specific nucleic acid tests in support of specific diagnostic and surveillance efforts throughout Australasia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arboviruses", "Bunyaviridae", "Culicidae", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Papua New Guinea", "Phylogeny", "RNA, Viral", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Western Australia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Briese", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "David T", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "CSIRO, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Vishal", "Last Name": "Kapoor", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Sinead M", "Last Name": "Diviney", "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Certoma", "Affiliation": "CSIRO, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Jianning", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "CSIRO, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl A", "Last Name": "Johansen", "Affiliation": "The Arbovirus Surveillance and Research Laboratory, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Rashmi", "Last Name": "Chowdhary", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Mackenzie", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27660213", "Title": "Viral Diversity, Prey Preference, and Bartonella Prevalence in Desmodus rotundus in Guatemala.", "Abstract": "Certain bat species serve as natural reservoirs for pathogens in several key viral families including henipa-, lyssa-, corona-, and filoviruses, which may pose serious threats to human health.

Previous studies have investigated rabies dynamics in D. rotundus, yet the diversity of other viruses, bacteria, and other microbes that these bats may carry remains largely unknown. We screened 396 blood, urine, saliva, and fecal samples from D. rotundus captured in Guatemala for 13 viral families and genera.

The virus is morphologically and structurally similar to HAV. The pattern of its codon usage bias is also consistent with that of HAV. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MHHAV groups with known HAVs but forms an independent branch, and represents a new species in the genus Hepatovirus within the family Picornaviridae. Antigenic site analysis suggested MHHAV has a new antigenic property to other HAVs. Further evolutionary analysis of MHHAV and primate HAVs led to a most recent common ancestor estimate of 1,000 years ago, while the common ancestor of all HAV-related viruses including phopivirus can be traced back to 1800 years ago.

Here, we describe the development of a virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) that increases the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and characterization. The system uses ~2 million probes that cover the genomes of members of the 207 viral taxa known to infect vertebrates, including humans. A biotinylated oligonucleotide library was synthesized on the NimbleGen cleavable array platform and used for solution-based capture of viral nucleic acids present in complex samples containing variable proportions of viral and host nucleic acids. The use of VirCapSeq-VERT resulted in a 100- to 10,000-fold increase in viral reads from blood and tissue homogenates compared to conventional Illumina sequencing using established virus enrichment procedures, including filtration, nuclease treatments, and RiboZero rRNA subtraction. VirCapSeq-VERT had a limit of detection comparable to that of agent-specific real-time PCR in serum, blood, and tissue extracts. Furthermore, the method identified novel viruses whose genomes were approximately 40% different from the known virus genomes used for designing the probe library. The VirCapSeq-VERT platform is ideally suited for analyses of virome composition and dynamics. IMPORTANCE\u2002: VirCapSeq-VERT enables detection of viral sequences in complex sample backgrounds, including those found in clinical specimens, such as serum, blood, and tissue. The highly multiplexed nature of the system allows both the simultaneous identification and the comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The operational simplicity and efficiency of the VirCapSeq-VERT platform may facilitate transition of high-throughput sequencing to clinical diagnostic as well as research applications.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Microbiota", "Nucleic Acid Hybridization", "Oligonucleotide Probes", "Vertebrates", "Virology", "Virus Diseases", "Viruses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Briese", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amit", "Last Name": "Kapoor", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nischay", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Komal", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Arvind", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Omar J", "Last Name": "Jabado", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Columbia University, New York, New York, USA Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA Department of Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA wil2001@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2015Sep22"}, {"PMID": "26396247", "Title": "Virome Analysis of Transfusion Recipients Reveals a Novel Human Virus That Shares Genomic Features with Hepaciviruses and Pegiviruses.", "Abstract": "To investigate the transmission of novel infectious agents by blood transfusion, we studied changes in the virome composition of blood transfusion recipients pre- and posttransfusion. Using this approach, we detected and genetically characterized a novel human virus, human hepegivirus 1 (HHpgV-1), that shares features with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human pegivirus (HPgV; formerly called GB virus C or hepatitis G virus). HCV and HPgV belong to the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus of the family Flaviviridae. HHpgV-1 was found in serum samples from two blood transfusion recipients and two hemophilia patients who had received plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates. In the former, the virus was detected only in the posttransfusion samples, indicating blood-borne transmission. Both hemophiliacs were persistently viremic over periods of at least 201 and 1,981\u00a0days. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of HHpgV-1 contained a type IV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), structurally similar to although highly divergent in sequence from that of HCV and other hepaciviruses. However, phylogenetic analysis of nonstructural genes (NS3 and NS5B) showed that HHpgV-1 forms a branch within the pegivirus clade distinct from HPgV and homologs infecting other mammalian species. In common with some pegivirus variants infecting rodents and bats, the HHpgV-1 genome encodes a short, highly basic protein upstream of E1, potentially possessing a core-like function in packaging RNA during assembly.

There are no validated laboratory tests for diagnosis or management despite global efforts to find biomarkers of disease. We considered the possibility that inability to identify such biomarkers reflected variations in diagnostic criteria and laboratory methods as well as the timing of sample collection during the course of the illness. Accordingly, we leveraged two large, multicenter cohort studies of ME/CFS to assess the relationship of immune signatures with diagnosis, illness duration, and other clinical variables. Controls were frequency-matched on key variables known to affect immune status, including season of sampling and geographic site, in addition to age and sex. We report here distinct alterations in plasma immune signatures early in the course of ME/CFS (n = 52) relative to healthy controls (n = 348) that are not present in subjects with longer duration of illness (n = 246).

High seropositivity is found in horses worldwide with \u223c 3% viremic. NPHV natural history and molecular virology remain largely unexplored, however. Here, we show that NPHV, like HCV, can cause persistent infection for over a decade, with high titers and negative strand RNA in the liver. NPHV is a near-universal contaminant of commercial horse sera for cell culture. The complete NPHV 3'-UTR was determined and consists of interspersed homopolymer tracts and an HCV-like 3'-terminal poly(U)-X-tail. NPHV translation is stimulated by miR-122 and the 3'-UTR and, similar to HCV, the NPHV NS3-4A protease can cleave mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein to inactivate the retinoic acid-inducible gene I pathway. Using an NPHV consensus cDNA clone, replication was not observed in primary equine fetal liver cultures or after electroporation of selectable replicons. However, intrahepatic RNA inoculation of a horse initiated infection, yielding high RNA titers in the serum and liver. Delayed seroconversion, slightly elevated circulating liver enzymes and mild hepatitis was observed, followed by viral clearance.

Despite the potential role of rats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, the microbial diversity present in urban rat populations remains unexplored. In this study, we used targeted molecular assays to detect known bacterial, viral, and protozoan human pathogens and unbiased high-throughput sequencing to identify novel viruses related to agents of human disease in commensal Norway rats in New York City. We found that these rats are infected with bacterial pathogens known to cause acute or mild gastroenteritis in people, including atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Salmonella enterica, as well as infectious agents that have been associated with undifferentiated febrile illnesses, including Bartonella spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis, Leptospira interrogans, and Seoul hantavirus. We also identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that contain important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses. The two novel hepaciviruses discovered in this study replicate in the liver of Norway rats and may have utility in establishing a small animal model of human hepatitis C virus infection. The results of this study demonstrate the diversity of microbes carried by commensal rodent species and highlight the need for improved pathogen surveillance and disease monitoring in urban environments. Importance: The observation that most emerging infectious diseases of humans originate in animal reservoirs has led to wide-scale microbial surveillance and discovery programs in wildlife, particularly in the developing world. Strikingly, less attention has been focused on commensal animals like rats, despite their abundance in urban centers and close proximity to human populations. To begin to explore the zoonotic disease risk posed by urban rat populations, we trapped and surveyed Norway rats collected in New York City over a 1-year period. This analysis revealed a striking diversity of known pathogens and novel viruses in our study population, including multiple agents associated with acute gastroenteritis or febrile illnesses in people. Our findings indicate that urban rats are reservoirs for a vast diversity of microbes that may affect human health and indicate a need for increased surveillance and awareness of the disease risks associated with urban rodent infestation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Animals, Wild", "Bacteria", "Biodiversity", "Carrier State", "Female", "Male", "Molecular Sequence Data", "New York City", "Rats", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Viruses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cadhla", "Last Name": "Firth", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA cadhla.firth@csiro.au."}, {"First Name": "Meera", "Last Name": "Bhat", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew A", "Last Name": "Firth", "Affiliation": "Immunology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simon H", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew J", "Last Name": "Frye", "Affiliation": "New York State Integrated Pest Management Program, Cornell University, Elmsford, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Simmonds", "Affiliation": "University of Edinburgh, Centre for Immunology, Infection and Evolution, Ashworth Laboratories, Edinburgh, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Juliette M", "Last Name": "Conte", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Ng", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Garcia", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nishit P", "Last Name": "Bhuva", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bohyun", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyu", "Last Name": "Che", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phenix-Lan", "Last Name": "Quan", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2014Oct14"}, {"PMID": "25214016", "Title": "Long-term storage of blood RNA collected in RNA stabilizing Tempus tubes in a large biobank--evaluation of RNA quality and stability.", "Abstract": "Establishing methods for secure long term storage of RNA is critical to realizing the promise of biobanks in biomedical research.

Examination of hemolymph of diseased clams revealed high levels of reverse transcriptase activity, the hallmark of retroviruses and retroelements. By deep sequencing of RNAs from hemolymph, we identified transcripts of a novel retroelement, here named Steamer. The DNA of the element is marked by long terminal repeats and encodes a single large protein with similarity to mammalian retroviral Gag-Pol proteins. Steamer mRNA levels were specifically elevated in diseased hemocytes, and high expression was correlated with disease status.

Here we describe the transmission, prevalence, and genetic traits of this virus, along with host transcriptional responses to infections. Further, we present RNAi-based strategies for limiting an important mechanism used by IAPV to subvert host defenses. Our study shows that IAPV is established as a persistent infection in honey bee populations, likely enabled by both horizontal and vertical transmission pathways. The phenotypic differences in pathology among different strains of IAPV found globally may be due to high levels of standing genetic variation. Microarray profiles of host responses to IAPV infection revealed that mitochondrial function is the most significantly affected biological process, suggesting that viral infection causes significant disturbance in energy-related host processes. The expression of genes involved in immune pathways in adult bees indicates that IAPV infection triggers active immune responses. The evidence that silencing an IAPV-encoded putative suppressor of RNAi reduces IAPV replication suggests a functional assignment for a particular genomic region of IAPV and closely related viruses from the Family Dicistroviridae, and indicates a novel therapeutic strategy for limiting multiple honey bee viruses simultaneously and reducing colony losses due to viral diseases. We believe that the knowledge and insights gained from this study will provide a new platform for continuing studies of the IAPV-host interactions and have positive implications for disease management

KD is an acute, coronary artery vasculitis of young children, and still a medical mystery after more than 40 y. We used residence times from simulations with the flexible particle dispersion model to pinpoint the source region for KD. Simulations were generated from locations spanning Japan from days with either high or low KD incidence. The postepidemic interval (1987-2010) and the extreme epidemics (1979, 1982, and 1986) pointed to the same source region. Results suggest a very short incubation period (<24 h) from exposure, thus making an infectious agent unlikely. Sampling campaigns over Japan during the KD season detected major differences in the microbiota of the tropospheric aerosols compared with ground aerosols, with the unexpected finding of the Candida species as the dominant fungus from aloft samples (54% of all fungal strains). These results, consistent with the Candida animal model for KD, provide support for the concept and feasibility of a windborne pathogen. A fungal toxin could be pursued as a possible etiologic agent of KD, consistent with an agricultural source, a short incubation time and synchronized outbreaks. Our study suggests that the causative agent of KD is a preformed toxin or environmental agent rather than an organism requiring replication.

Consensus dromedary MERS-CoV genome sequences were the same with either template source and identical to published human MERS-CoV sequences. However, in contrast to individual human cases, where only clonal genomic sequences are reported, detailed population analyses revealed the presence of more than one genomic variant in individual dromedaries. If humans are truly infected only with clonal virus populations, we must entertain a model for interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV wherein only specific genotypes are capable of passing bottleneck selection. IMPORTANCE In most cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the route for human infection with the causative agent, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is unknown. Antibodies to and viral nucleic acids of MERS-CoV have been found in dromedaries, suggesting the possibility that they may serve as a reservoir or vector for human infection. However, neither whole viral genomic sequence nor infectious virus has been isolated from dromedaries or other animals in Saudi Arabia. Here, we report recovery of MERS-CoV from nasal swabs of dromedaries, demonstrate that MERS-CoV whole-genome consensus sequences from dromedaries and humans are indistinguishable, and show that dromedaries can be simultaneously infected with more than one MERS-CoV. Together with data indicating widespread dromedary infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, these findings support the plausibility of a role for dromedaries in human infection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Camelus", "Computational Biology", "Coronavirus Infections", "Genome, Viral", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phylogeny", "RNA, Viral", "Saudi Arabia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Briese", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nischay", "Last Name": "Mishra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Komal", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Iyad S", "Last Name": "Zalmout", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Omar J", "Last Name": "Jabado", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William B", "Last Name": "Karesh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Daszak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Osama B", "Last Name": "Mohammed", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Abdulaziz N", "Last Name": "Alagaili", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "mBio", "PubDate": "2014Apr29"}, {"PMID": "24743730", "Title": "Air travel is associated with intracontinental spread of dengue virus serotypes 1-3 in Brazil.", "Abstract": "Dengue virus and its four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) infect 390 million people and are implicated in at least 25,000 deaths annually, with the largest disease burden in tropical and subtropical regions.

The Simbu serogroup currently consists of a highly diverse group of related arboviruses that infect both humans and economically important livestock species. Here, we report complete genome sequences for 11 viruses within this group, with a focus on the large and poorly characterized Manzanilla and Oropouche species complexes. Phylogenetic and pairwise divergence analyses indicated the presence of high levels of genetic diversity within these two species complexes, on a par with that seen among the five other species complexes in the Simbu serogroup. Based on previously reported divergence thresholds between species, the data suggested that these two complexes should actually be divided into at least five species. Together these five species formed a distinct phylogenetic clade apart from the rest of the Simbu serogroup. Pairwise sequence divergences among viruses of this clade and viruses in other Simbu serogroup species complexes were similar to levels of divergence among the other orthobunyavirus serogroups.

Marine mammals are in contact with a number of influenza reservoirs, including aquatic birds and humans, and this may facilitate transmission among avian and mammalian hosts. Virus isolation, whole genome sequencing, and hemagluttination inhibition assay confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris) in 2010. Nasal swabs were collected from 42 adult female seals in April 2010, just after the animals had returned to the central California coast from their short post-breeding migration in the northeast Pacific. Swabs from two seals tested positive by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, and virus was isolated from each by inoculation into embryonic chicken eggs. Whole genome sequencing revealed greater than 99% homology with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) that emerged in humans from swine in 2009. Analysis of more than 300 serum samples showed that samples collected early in 2010 (n\u200a=\u200a100) were negative and by April animals began to test positive for antibodies against the pH1N1 virus (HI titer of \u22651\u223640), supporting the molecular findings. In vitro characterizations studies revealed that viral replication was indistinguishable from that of reference strains of pH1N1 in canine kidney cells, but replication was inefficient in human epithelial respiratory cells, indicating these isolates may be elephant seal adapted viruses. Thus findings confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 that was circulating in people in 2009 occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals in 2010 off the central California coast.

To enhance our knowledge of the viral diversity present in bats, we initially surveyed 415 sera from African and Central American bats. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of bat-derived viruses related to hepaciviruses and pegiviruses within the family Flaviridae. Subsequent PCR screening of 1,258 bat specimens collected worldwide indicated the presence of these viruses also in North America and Asia.

First, we conceptualized viral capsid assembly as occurring via a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway, in contrast to the classical view of capsid formation by self-assembly. This suggested opportunities for antiviral intervention by targeting previously unappreciated catalytic host proteins, which were pursued. Second, we hypothesized these host proteins to be components of heterogeneous, labile, and dynamic multi-subunit assembly machines, not easily isolated by specific target protein-focused methods. This suggested the need to identify active compounds before knowing the precise protein target. A cell-free translation-based small molecule screen was established to recreate the hypothesized interactions involving newly synthesized capsid proteins as host assembly machine substrates. Hits from the screen were validated by efficacy against infectious rabies virus in mammalian cell culture. Used as affinity ligands, advanced analogs were shown to bind a set of proteins that effectively reconstituted drug sensitivity in the cell-free screen and included a small but discrete subfraction of cellular ATP-binding cassette family E1 (ABCE1), a host protein previously found essential for HIV capsid formation. Taken together, these studies advance an alternate view of capsid formation (as a host-catalyzed biochemical pathway), a different paradigm for drug discovery (whole pathway screening without knowledge of the target), and suggest the existence of labile assembly machines that can be rendered accessible as next-generation drug targets by the means described.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Cell-Free System", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Drug Discovery", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nucleocapsid Proteins", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Rabies virus", "Vero Cells", "Viral Proteins", "Virus Assembly"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Usha F", "Last Name": "Lingappa", "Affiliation": "Prosetta Antiviral Inc., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xianfu", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Amanda", "Last Name": "Macieik", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shao Feng", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andy", "Last Name": "Atuegbu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Corpuz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Francis", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Nichols", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alfredo", "Last Name": "Calayag", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Shi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James A", "Last Name": "Ellison", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Emma K T", "Last Name": "Harrell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vinod", "Last Name": "Asundi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jaisri R", "Last Name": "Lingappa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M Dharma", "Last Name": "Prasad", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Debendranath", "Last Name": "Dey", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clarence R", "Last Name": "Hurt", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vishwanath R", "Last Name": "Lingappa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William J", "Last Name": "Hansen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Charles E", "Last Name": "Rupprecht", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2013Mar05"}, {"PMID": "23403681", "Title": "Association between maternal use of folic acid supplements and risk of autism spectrum disorders in children.", "Abstract": "Prenatal folic acid supplements reduce the risk of neural tube defects in children, but it has not been determined whether they protect against other neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Dietary Supplements", "Female", "Folic Acid", "Humans", "Male", "Norway", "Odds Ratio", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, First", "Prenatal Care", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Regression Analysis", "Risk", "Vitamin B Complex", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "P\u00e5l", "Last Name": "Sur\u00e9n", "Affiliation": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health, PO Box 4404, Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway. pal.suren@fhi.no"}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michaeline", "Last Name": "Bresnahan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Margaretha", "Last Name": "Haugen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mady", "Last Name": "Hornig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Hirtz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kari Kveim", "Last Name": "Lie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "W Ian", "Last Name": "Lipkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Per", "Last Name": "Magnus", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ted", "Last Name": "Reichborn-Kjennerud", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Synnve", "Last Name": "Schj\u00f8lberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Davey Smith", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anne-Siri", "Last Name": "\u00d8yen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ezra", "Last Name": "Susser", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Camilla", "Last Name": "Stoltenberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "JAMA", "PubDate": "2013Feb13"}, {"PMID": "23364187", "Title": "A novel mosquito-borne Orbivirus species found in South-east Asia.", "Abstract": "The genus Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae includes a genetically diverse group of dsRNA arthropod-borne viruses that infect a wide variety of animal species.

Although much work has focused on Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the role of this common childhood infection remains controversial. Animal model studies based on immune and autoantibody findings in TS have demonstrated immunoglobulin (Ig) deposits and stereotypic movements and related behavioral disturbances reminiscent of TS following exposure to GAS, other activators of host anti-microbial responses, soluble immune mediators and anti-GAS or anti-neuronal antibodies. Demonstration of the ability to recreate these abnormalities through passive transfer of serum IgG from GAS-immunized mice into na\u00efve mice and abrogation of this activity through depletion of IgG has provided compelling evidence in support of the autoimmune hypothesis.

In this report, the serologic and phylogenetic relationships of the Uukuniemi group viruses and their relationships with other recently characterized tick-borne phleboviruses are described using full-length genome sequences. We propose that the viruses currently included in the Uukuniemi virus group be assigned to five different species as follows: Uukuniemi virus, EgAn 1825-61 virus, Fin V707 virus, Chiz\u00e9 virus, and Zaliv Terpenia virus would be classified into the Uukuniemi species; Murre virus, RML-105-105355 virus, and Sunday Canyon virus would be classified into a Murre virus species; and Grand Arbaud virus, Precarious Point virus, and Manawa virus would each be given individual species status. Although limited sequence similarity was detected between current members of the Uukuniemi group and Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and Heartland virus, a clear serological reaction was observed between some of them, indicating that SFTSV and Heartland virus should be considered part of the Uukuniemi virus group. Moreover, based on the genomic diversity of the phleboviruses and given the low correlation observed between complement fixation titers and genetic distance, we propose a system for classification of the Bunyaviridae based on genetic as well as serological data.
