[{"PMID": "38746175", "Title": "\"Tumor-selective treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer with an engineered, probiotic living drug\".", "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses significant challenges for effective treatment, with systemic chemotherapy often proving inadequate due to poor drug delivery and the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment. Engineered bacteria present a novel approach to target PDAC, leveraging their ability to colonize tumors and deliver therapeutic payloads. Here, we engineered probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to produce the pore-forming Theta toxin (Nis-Theta) and evaluated its efficacy in a preclinical model of PDAC. Probiotic administration resulted in selective colonization of tumor tissue, leading to improved overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, this strain exhibited cytotoxic effects on both primary and distant tumor lesions while sparing normal tissues. Importantly, treatment also modulated the tumor microenvironment by increasing anti-tumor immune cell populations and reducing immunosuppressive markers. These findings demonstrate the potential of engineered probiotic bacteria as a safe and effective therapeutic approach for PDAC, offering promise for improved patient outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amanda R", "Last Name": "Decker-Farrell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen A", "Last Name": "Sastra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tetsuhiro", "Last Name": "Harimoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Marie C", "Last Name": "Hasselluhn", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carmine F", "Last Name": "Palermo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edward R", "Last Name": "Ballister", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Badgley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Danino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May05"}, {"PMID": "38588697", "Title": "Tumour-selective activity of RAS-GTP inhibition in pancreatic cancer.", "Abstract": "Broad-spectrum RAS inhibition has the potential to benefit roughly a quarter of human patients with cancer whose tumours are driven by RAS mutations1,2.

An incidental finding from prior work on paracrine communication between malignant PDAC cells and fibroblasts revealed that inhibition of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway partially relieved angiosuppression, increasing tumor vascularity through unknown mechanisms. Initial efforts to study this phenotype were hindered by difficulties replicating the complex interactions of multiple cell types in vitro.

Malignant epithelial cells promote HH signaling in fibroblasts, leading to inhibition of noncanonical WNT signaling in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, thereby limiting VEGFR2-dependent activation of endothelial hypersprouting.

We performed a first-of-kind evaluation of two transcriptome-based precision cancer medicine methodologies to predict tumor sensitivity to a comprehensive repertoire of clinically relevant oncology drugs, whose mechanism of action we experimentally assessed in cognate cell lines. We enrolled patients with histologically distinct, poor-prognosis malignancies who had progressed on multiple therapies, and developed low-passage, patient-derived xenograft models that were used to validate 35 patient-specific drug predictions. Both OncoTarget, which identifies high-affinity inhibitors of individual master regulator (MR) proteins, and OncoTreat, which identifies drugs that invert the transcriptional activity of hyperconnected MR modules, produced highly significant 30-day disease control rates (68% and 91%, respectively). Moreover, of 18 OncoTreat-predicted drugs, 15 induced the predicted MR-module activity inversion in vivo. Predicted drugs significantly outperformed antineoplastic drugs selected as unpredicted controls, suggesting these methods may substantively complement existing precision cancer medicine approaches,

a large collection of expression profiles from laser capture microdissected samples of PDAC and benign precursors. We discovered that BMAL2 plays a role in the initiation, progression, post resection survival, and KRAS activity in PDAC. Functional analysis of BMAL2 target genes led us to hypothesize that it plays a role in regulating the response to hypoxia, a critical but poorly understood feature of PDAC physiology. Knockout of BMAL2 in multiple human PDAC cell lines revealed effects on viability and invasion, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Loss of BMAL2 also affected glycolysis and other metabolic processes. We found that BMAL2 directly regulates hypoxia-responsive target genes. We also found that BMAL2 is necessary for the stabilization of HIF1A upon exposure to hypoxia, but destabilizes HIF2A under hypoxia. These data demonstrate that BMAL2 is a master transcriptional regulator of hypoxia responses in PDAC and may serve as a long-sought molecular switch that distinguishes HIF1A- and HIF2A-dependent modes of hypoxic metabolism.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H Carlo", "Last Name": "Maurer", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alvaro", "Last Name": "Garcia-Curiel", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sam R", "Last Name": "Holmstrom", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX."}, {"First Name": "Cristina", "Last Name": "Castillo", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Carmine F", "Last Name": "Palermo", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Sastra", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Anthony", "Last Name": "Andren", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Tessa Y S", "Last Name": "Le Large", "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Amsterdam UMC, Location Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Irina", "Last Name": "Sagalovskiy", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Daniel R", "Last Name": "Ross", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Winston", "Last Name": "Wong", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kaitlin", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Division of GI/Endocrine Surgery, Department of Surgery, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jeanine", "Last Name": "Genkinger", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Alina C", "Last Name": "Iuga", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Roland M", "Last Name": "Schmid", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kristen", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "University of New Hampshire, Manchester, NH."}, {"First Name": "Michael A", "Last Name": "Badgley", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Costas A", "Last Name": "Lyssiotis", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Yatrik", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI."}, {"First Name": "Andrea", "Last Name": "Califano", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jun22"}, {"PMID": "36989344", "Title": "Comprehensive DNA Methylation Analysis Indicates That Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia Lesions Are Acinar-Derived and Epigenetically Primed for Carcinogenesis.", "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is believed to arise from the accumulation of a series of somatic mutations and is also frequently associated with pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions. However, there is still debate as to whether the cell type-of-origin of PanINs and PDACs in humans is acinar or ductal. As cell type identity is maintained epigenetically, DNA methylation changes during pancreatic neoplasia can provide a compelling perspective to examine this question. Here, we performed laser-capture microdissection on surgically resected specimens from 18 patients to isolate, with high purity, DNA for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from four relevant cell types: acini, nonneoplastic ducts, PanIN lesions, and PDAC lesions. Differentially methylated regions (DMR) were identified using two complementary analytical approaches: bsseq, which identifies any DMRs but is particularly useful for large block-like DMRs, and informME, which profiles the potential energy landscape across the genome and is particularly useful for identifying differential methylation entropy. Both global methylation profiles and block DMRs clearly implicated an acinar origin for PanINs. At the gene level, PanIN lesions exhibited an intermediate acinar-ductal phenotype resembling acinar-to-ductal metaplasia.

In a proteomic screen, we identified BACH1 as a cellular factor that recognizes the p53 DNA-binding domain depending on its mutation status. BACH1 strongly interacts with p53R175H but fails to effectively bind wild-type p53 or other hotspot mutants in vivo for functional regulation. Notably, p53R175H acts as a repressor for ferroptosis by abrogating BACH1-mediated downregulation of SLC7A11 to enhance tumor growth; conversely, p53R175H promotes BACH1-dependent tumor metastasis by upregulating expression of pro-metastatic targets. Mechanistically, p53R175H-mediated bidirectional regulation of BACH1 function is dependent on its ability to recruit the histone demethylase LSD2 to target promoters and differentially modulate transcription.

These traits are partially attributable to the highly tumorigenic pancreatic cancer stem cells (PaCSCs). Interestingly, these cells show unique features in order to sustain their identity and functionality, some of them amenable for therapeutic intervention. Screening of phospho-receptor tyrosine kinases revealed that PaCSCs harbored increased activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). We subsequently demonstrated that oncogenic ALK signaling contributes to tumorigenicity in PDAC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) by promoting stemness through ligand-dependent activation. Indeed, the ALK ligands midkine (MDK) or pleiotrophin (PTN) increased self-renewal, clonogenicity and CSC frequency in several in vitro local and metastatic PDX models. Conversely, treatment with the clinically-approved ALK inhibitors Crizotinib and Ensartinib decreased PaCSC content and functionality in vitro and in vivo, by inducing cell death. Strikingly, ALK inhibitors sensitized chemoresistant PaCSCs to Gemcitabine, as the most used chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. Consequently, ALK inhibition delayed tumor relapse after chemotherapy in vivo by effectively decreasing the content of PaCSCs. In summary, our results demonstrate that targeting the MDK/PTN-ALK axis with clinically-approved inhibitors impairs in vivo tumorigenicity and chemoresistance in PDAC suggesting a new treatment approach to improve the long-term survival of PDAC patients.", "Keywords": ["ALK", "Cancer Stem Cells", "Chemoresistance", "Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma", "Receptor Tyrosine Kinases"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Beatriz", "Last Name": "Parejo-Alonso", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Arag\u00f3n (IIS Arag\u00f3n), Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Alba", "Last Name": "Royo-Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Arag\u00f3n (IIS Arag\u00f3n), Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Pilar", "Last Name": "Espiau-Romera", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Arag\u00f3n (IIS Arag\u00f3n), Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Courtois", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Arag\u00f3n (IIS Arag\u00f3n), Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain."}, {"First Name": "\u00c1lvaro", "Last Name": "Curiel-Garc\u00eda", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive Liver Diseases and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sladjana", "Last Name": "Zagorac", "Affiliation": "Center for Stem Cells in Cancer & Ageing (Barts Cancer Institute), London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Isabel", "Last Name": "Villaoslada", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Arag\u00f3n (IIS Arag\u00f3n), Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain; Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive Liver Diseases and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Heeschen", "Affiliation": "Center for Single-Cell Omics and Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Pancreatic Cancer Heterogeneity, Candiolo Cancer Institute - FPO - IRCCS, Candiolo (Torino), Italy."}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Sancho", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Arag\u00f3n (IIS Arag\u00f3n), Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.

Evaluation of EEC abundance in mice lacking Pou2f3 demonstrates that the tuft cell master regulator transcription factor is not required for EEC formation. We compared these data to human neoplasia and PDAC and observed similar trends. Lastly, we confirm that EECs are a normal cellular compartment within the murine and human pancreatic ductal trees.

Existing therapies only moderately improve pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient prognosis. The present study investigates the importance of the polyamine metabolism in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Relative mRNA expression analysis identified differential expression of polyamine biosynthesis, homeostasis, and transport mediators in both pancreatic epithelial and stromal cells from low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN-1) or primary PDAC patient samples. We found dysregulated mRNA levels that encode for proteins associated with the polyamine pathway of PDAC tumors compared to early lesions. Next, bioinformatic databases were used to assess expression of select genes involved in polyamine metabolism and their impact on patient survival. Higher expression of pro-polyamine genes was associated with poor patient prognosis, supporting the use of a polyamine blockade therapy (PBT) strategy for inhibiting pancreatic tumor progression. Moreover, PBT treatment of syngeneic mice injected intra-pancreatic with PAN 02 tumor cells resulted in increased survival and decreased tumor weights of PDAC-bearing mice. Histological assessment of PBT-treated tumors revealed macrophage presence and significantly increased expression of CD86, a T cell co-stimulatory marker.

We previously described a cytosolic aspartate aminotransaminase (GOT1)-driven pathway in pancreatic cancer used to maintain redox balance. Here, we sought to identify metabolic dependencies following GOT1 inhibition to exploit this feature of pancreatic cancer and to provide additional insight into regulation of redox metabolism. Using pharmacological methods, we identify cysteine, glutathione, and lipid antioxidant function as metabolic vulnerabilities following GOT1 withdrawal. We demonstrate that targeting any of these pathways triggers ferroptosis, an oxidative, iron-dependent form of cell death, in GOT1 knockdown cells. Mechanistically, we reveal that GOT1 inhibition represses mitochondrial metabolism and promotes a catabolic state. Consequently, we find that this enhances labile iron availability through autophagy, which potentiates the activity of ferroptotic stimuli.

Our work demonstrates that HIF-2\u03b1 is essential for colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, targeting hypoxic cells is difficult, and tumors rapidly acquire resistance to inhibitors of HIF-2\u03b1. To overcome this limitation, we performed a small molecule screen to identify HIF-2\u03b1-dependent vulnerabilities. Several known ferroptosis activators and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a cell-permeable mitochondrial metabolite derivative, led to selective synthetic lethality in HIF-2\u03b1-expressing tumor enteroids. Our work demonstrated that HIF-2\u03b1 integrated 2 independent forms of cell death via regulation of cellular iron and oxidation. First, activation of HIF-2\u03b1 upregulated lipid and iron regulatory genes in CRC cells and colon tumors in mice and led to a ferroptosis-susceptible cell state. Second, via an iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-independent pathway, HIF-2\u03b1 activation potentiated ROS via irreversible cysteine oxidation and enhanced cell death.

Depletion of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which represented the main source of CAF in mice and patients in our study, or depletion of all CAF decreased tumor growth and mortality in desmoplastic colorectal and pancreatic metastasis but not in nondesmoplastic metastatic tumors. Single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis, as well as studies in immune cell-depleted and HSC-selective knockout mice, uncovered direct CAF-tumor interactions as a tumor-promoting mechanism, mediated by myofibroblastic CAF-secreted (myCAF-secreted) hyaluronan and inflammatory CAF-secreted (iCAF-secreted) HGF. These effects were opposed by myCAF-expressed type I collagen, which suppressed tumor growth by mechanically restraining tumor spread, overriding its own stiffness-induced mechanosignals.

Despite recent advances in treatment, it is important to identify and screen high-risk individuals for cancer prevention. Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) accounts for 4%-10% of pancreatic cancers. Several germline mutations are related to an increased risk and might offer screening and therapy options. In this study, we aimed to identity of a susceptibility gene in a family with FPC.METHODSWhole exome sequencing and PCR confirmation was performed on the surgical specimen and peripheral blood of an index patient and her sister in a family with high incidence of pancreatic cancer, to identify somatic and germline mutations associated with familial pancreatic cancer. Compartment-specific gene expression data and immunohistochemistry were also queried.RESULTSThe identical germline mutation of the PALLD gene (NM_001166108.1:c.G154A:p.D52N) was detected in the index patient with pancreatic cancer and the tumor tissue of her sister. Whole genome sequencing showed similar somatic mutation patterns between the 2 sisters. Apart from the PALLD mutation, commonly mutated genes that characterize pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were found in both tumor samples. However, the 2 patients harbored different somatic KRAS mutations (G12D and G12V). Healthy siblings did not have the PALLD mutation, indicating a disease-specific impact. Compartment-specific gene expression data and IHC showed expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).CONCLUSIONWe identified a germline mutation of the palladin (PALLD) gene in 2 siblings in Europe, affected by familial pancreatic cancer, with a significant overexpression in CAFs, suggesting that stromal palladin could play a role in the development, maintenance, and/or progression of pancreatic cancer.FUNDINGDFG SFB 1321.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Gastroenterology", "Molecular genetics", "Oncology"], "MeSH terms": ["Carcinoma", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Europe", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Humans", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pedigree", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Siblings", "White People", "Exome Sequencing"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lucia", "Last Name": "Liotta", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Lange", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "H Carlo", "Last Name": "Maurer", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rickmer", "Last Name": "Braren", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr diagnostische und interventionelle Radiologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Pfarr", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie und pathologische Anatomie, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sebastian", "Last Name": "Burger", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Muckenhuber", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie und pathologische Anatomie, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Moritz", "Last Name": "Jesinghaus", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie und pathologische Anatomie, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Katja", "Last Name": "Steiger", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie und pathologische Anatomie, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Wilko", "Last Name": "Weichert", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pathologie und pathologische Anatomie, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Helmut", "Last Name": "Friess", "Affiliation": "Chirurgische Klinik, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Roland", "Last Name": "Schmid", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hana", "Last Name": "Alg\u00fcl", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Philipp J", "Last Name": "Jost", "Affiliation": "Deutschen Konsortium f\u00fcr Translationale Krebsforschung (DKTK), Partner site Munich, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Juliane", "Last Name": "Ramser", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Frauenheilkunde, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Fischer", "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Humangenetik, Ruprecht-Karls Universit\u00e4t, Heidelberg, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anne S", "Last Name": "Quante", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Frauenheilkunde, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Maximilian", "Last Name": "Reichert", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Quante", "Affiliation": "Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin II, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}], "Journal": "JCI insight", "PubDate": "2021Mar25"}, {"PMID": "33626746", "Title": "East Tennessee State University James H.

However, knowledge of the contribution of MUC16 to pancreatic tumorigenesis is limited. Here, we show that MUC16 expression is associated with disease progression, basal-like and squamous tumor subtypes, increased tumor metastasis, and short-term survival of PDAC patients. MUC16 enhanced tumor malignancy through the activation of AKT and GSK3\u03b2 oncogenic signaling pathways. Activation of these oncogenic signaling pathways resulted in part from increased interactions between MUC16 and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-type receptors, which were enhanced for aberrant glycoforms of MUC16. Treatment of PDAC cells with monoclonal antibody (mAb) AR9.6 significantly reduced MUC16-induced oncogenic signaling. mAb AR9.6 binds to a unique conformational epitope on MUC16, which is influenced by O-glycosylation. Additionally, treatment of PDAC tumor-bearing mice with either mAb AR9.6 alone or in combination with gemcitabine significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis. We conclude that the aberrant expression of MUC16 enhances PDAC progression to an aggressive phenotype by modulating oncogenic signaling through ErbB receptors.

We then used this index to compare hyper- and hypovascular tumors, enabling the classification of human tumors into 6 vascular microenvironment signatures (VMSs) based on the expression of a panel of 24 vascular \"hub\" genes. The EI and VMS correlated with known tumor vascular features and were independently associated with prognosis in certain cancer types. Retrospective testing of clinical trial data identified VMS2 classification as a powerful biomarker for response to bevacizumab.

Previously, treatment with the DNA hypomethylating drug decitabine (5-aza-dC; DAC) extended survival in the KPC-Brca1 mouse model of PDAC. Here we investigated the effects of DAC in the original KPC model and tested combination therapy with DAC followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Four protocols were tested: PBS vehicle, DAC, ICI (anti-PD-1 or anti-VISTA), and DAC followed by ICI. For each single-agent and combination treatment, tumor growth was measured by serial ultrasound, tumor-infiltrating lymphoid and myeloid cells were characterized, and overall survival was assessed. Single-agent DAC led to increased CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), PD1 expression, and tumor necrosis while slowing tumor growth and modestly increasing mouse survival without systemic toxicity. RNA-sequencing of DAC-treated tumors revealed increased expression of Chi3l3 (Ym1), reflecting an increase in a subset of tumor-infiltrating M2-polarized macrophages. While ICI alone had modest effects, DAC followed by either of ICI therapies additively inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival. The best results were obtained using DAC followed by anti-PD-1, which extended mean survival from 26 to 54 days (P < 0.0001). In summary, low-dose DAC inhibits tumor growth and increases both TILs and a subset of tumor-infiltrating M2-polarized macrophages in the KPC model of PDAC, and DAC followed by anti-PD-1 substantially prolongs survival. Because M2-polarized macrophages are predicted to antagonize antitumor effects, targeting these cells may be important to enhance the efficacy of combination therapy with DAC plus ICI. SIGNIFICANCE: In a pancreatic cancer model, a DNA hypomethylating drug increases tumor-infiltrating effector T cells, increases a subset of M2 macrophages, and significantly prolongs survival in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.See related commentary by Nephew, p. 4610.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Hot Temperature", "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Mice", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tamas A", "Last Name": "Gonda", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York. tamas.gonda@nyulangone.org Benjamin.tycko@hmh-cdi.org."}, {"First Name": "Jarwei", "Last Name": "Fang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Martha", "Last Name": "Salas", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics & Epigenetics, Hackensack-Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Do", "Affiliation": "Division of Genetics & Epigenetics, Hackensack-Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, Nutley, New Jersey."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Hsu", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Zhukovskaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ariel", "Last Name": "Siegel", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ryota", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Zoila A", "Last Name": "Lopez-Bujanda", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Charles G", "Last Name": "Drake", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Gulam A", "Last Name": "Manji", "Affiliation": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Digestive and Liver Diseases, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Tycko", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, New York University, New York, New York. tamas.gonda@nyulangone.org Benjamin.tycko@hmh-cdi.org."}], "Journal": "Cancer research", "PubDate": "2020Nov01"}, {"PMID": "32717220", "Title": "Tuft Cells Inhibit Pancreatic Tumorigenesis in Mice by Producing Prostaglandin D2.", "Abstract": "Development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) involves acinar to ductal metaplasia and genesis of tuft cells.

Methods: In this study, we applied Harmonic Motion Elastography (HME), a quantitative ultrasound-based imaging method to calculate Young's modulus (YM) in PDAC mouse models (n = 30) and human pancreatic resection specimens of PDAC (n=32). We compared the YM to the collagen assessment by Picrosirius red (PSR) stain on corresponding histologic sections. Results: HME is capable of differentiating between different levels of fibrosis in transgenic mice. In mice without pancreatic fibrosis, the measured YM was 4.2 \u00b1 1.3 kPa, in fibrotic murine pancreata, YM was 5.5 \u00b1 2.0 kPa and in murine PDAC tumors, YM was 11.3 \u00b1 1.7 kPa. The corresponding PSR values were 2.0 \u00b1 0.8 %, 9.8 \u00b1 3.4 %, and 13.2 \u00b1 1.2%, respectively. In addition, three regions within each human surgical PDAC specimen were assessed: tumor, which had both the highest Young's modulus (YM > 40 kPa) and collagen density (PSR > 40 %); non-neoplastic adjacent pancreas, which had the lowest Young's modulus (YM < 15 kPa) and collagen density (PSR < 10%) and a transitional peri-lesional region between the tumor and non-neoplastic pancreas with an intermediate value of measured Young's modulus (15 kPa < YM < 40 kPa) and collagen density (15% < PSR < 35 %).

Transplantation biology studies have implicated HLA class I molecules in cell migration, but there has been little evidence presented that they influence cancer cell migration, a contributing factor in metastasis. In this study, we examined the effect of HLA-B on pancreatic cancer cell migration. HLA-B siRNA transfection increased the migration of the S2-013 pancreatic cancer cells but, in contrast, reduced migration of the PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Integrin molecules have previously been implicated in the upregulation of pancreatic cancer cell migration, and knockdown of HLA-B in S2-013\u00a0cells heightened the expression of integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), but in the PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2\u00a0cells HLA-B knockdown diminished ITGB1 expression. A transmembrane sequence in an S2-013 HLA-B heavy chain matches a corresponding sequence in HLA-B in the BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell line, and knockdown of BxPC-3 HLA-B mimics the effect of S2-013 HLA-B knockdown on migration.

APA is frequently disrupted in cancer and promotes tumorigenesis through altered expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Pan-cancer analyses have revealed common APA events across the tumor landscape; however, little is known about tumor type-specific alterations that may uncover novel events and vulnerabilities. Here, we integrate RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to comprehensively analyze APA events in 148 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). We report widespread, recurrent, and functionally relevant 3'-UTR alterations associated with gene expression changes of known and newly identified PDAC growth-promoting genes and experimentally validate the effects of these APA events on protein expression. We find enrichment for APA events in genes associated with known PDAC pathways, loss of tumor-suppressive miRNA binding sites, and increased heterogeneity in 3'-UTR forms of metabolic genes. Survival analyses reveal a subset of 3'-UTR alterations that independently characterize a poor prognostic cohort among PDAC patients. Finally, we identify and validate the casein kinase CSNK1A1 (also known as CK1alpha or CK1a) as an APA-regulated therapeutic target in PDAC. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of CSNK1A1 attenuates PDAC cell proliferation and clonogenic growth.

Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases on July 24, 2019, in Pittsburgh. The workshop included an overview lecture on precision medicine in cancer and 4 sessions: (1) general considerations for the application of bioinformatics and artificial intelligence; (2) omics, the combination of risk factors and biomarkers; (3) precision imaging; and (4) gaps, barriers, and needs to move from precision to personalized medicine for pancreatic disease. Current precision medicine approaches and tools were reviewed, and participants identified knowledge gaps and research needs that hinder bringing precision medicine to pancreatic diseases. Most critical were (a) multicenter efforts to collect large-scale patient data sets from multiple data streams in the context of environmental and social factors; (b) new information systems that can collect, annotate, and quantify data to inform disease mechanisms; (c) novel prospective clinical trial designs to test and improve therapies; and (d) a framework for measuring and assessing the value of proposed approaches to the health care system. With these advances, precision medicine can identify patients early in the course of their pancreatic disease and prevent progression to chronic or fatal illness.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomarkers", "Biomedical Research", "Computational Biology", "Datasets as Topic", "Deep Learning", "Humans", "Metabolomics", "Pancreatic Diseases", "Precision Medicine", "Research"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mark E", "Last Name": "Lowe", "Affiliation": "From the Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Dana K", "Last Name": "Andersen", "Affiliation": "The Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Caprioli", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biochemistry."}, {"First Name": "Jyoti", "Last Name": "Choudhary", "Affiliation": "Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Zobeida", "Last Name": "Cruz-Monserrate", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH."}, {"First Name": "Anil K", "Last Name": "Dasyam", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Forsmark", "Affiliation": "The Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL."}, {"First Name": "Fred S", "Last Name": "Gorelick", "Affiliation": "Departments of Internal Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Joe W", "Last Name": "Gray", "Affiliation": "Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Haupt", "Affiliation": "Ariel Precision Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA."}, {"First Name": "Kimberly A", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA."}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Sylvia K", "Last Name": "Plevritis", "Affiliation": "Departments of Biomedical Data Science."}, {"First Name": "Noa", "Last Name": "Rappaport", "Affiliation": "Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA."}, {"First Name": "Holger R", "Last Name": "Roth", "Affiliation": "Deep Learning for Medical Imaging, NVIDIA Corporation, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Hanno", "Last Name": "Steen", "Affiliation": "Proteomics Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."}, {"First Name": "S Joshua", "Last Name": "Swamidass", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Temel", "Last Name": "Tirkes", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN."}, {"First Name": "Aliye", "Last Name": "Uc", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Stead Family Department of Pediatrics, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA."}, {"First Name": "Kirill", "Last Name": "Veselkov", "Affiliation": "Computational Medicine and Systems Medicine, Department of Digestion, Metabolism and Reproduction, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Whitcomb", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine."}, {"First Name": "Aida", "Last Name": "Habtezion", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA."}], "Journal": "Pancreas", "PubDate": "2019Nov/Dec"}, {"PMID": "31615993", "Title": "The TLR7/8 agonist R848 remodels tumor and host responses to promote survival in pancreatic cancer.", "Abstract": "A priority in cancer research is to innovate therapies that\u00a0are not only effective against tumor progression but also address comorbidities such as cachexia that limit quality and quantity of life. We demonstrate that TLR7/8 agonist R848 induces anti-tumor responses and attenuates cachexia in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In vivo, tumors from two of three cell lines were R848-sensitive, resulting in smaller tumor mass, increased immune complexity, increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activity, and decreased Treg frequency. R848-treated mice demonstrated improvements in behavioral and molecular cachexia manifestations, resulting in a near-doubling of survival duration. Knockout mouse studies revealed that stromal, not neoplastic, TLR7 is requisite for R848-mediated responses. In patient samples, we found Tlr7 is ubiquitously expressed in stroma across all stages of pancreatic neoplasia, but epithelial Tlr7 expression is relatively uncommon.

We recently identified that poly (ADP) ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) is a strong candidate target due to its dependence on the pro-oncogenic mRNA stability factor HuR (ELAVL1). Here, we evaluated PARG as a target in PDAC models using both genetic silencing of PARG and established small-molecule PARG inhibitors (PARGi), PDDX-01/04. Homologous repair-deficient cells compared with homologous repair-proficient cells were more sensitive to PARGi in vitro. In vivo, silencing of PARG significantly decreased tumor growth. PARGi synergized with DNA-damaging agents (i.e., oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil), but not with PARPi therapy. Mechanistically, combined PARGi and oxaliplatin treatment led to persistence of detrimental PARylation, increased expression of cleaved caspase-3, and increased \u03b3H2AX foci. In summary, these data validate PARG as a relevant target in PDAC and establish current therapies that synergize with PARGi.

Chemotherapy has had limited success in extending the life span of patients with advanced PDAC due to poor tumor perfusion and hypoxia-induced resistance. Hypoxia reprograms the gene expression profile and upregulates the expression of multiple genes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which provide survival advantage to PDAC cells. However, the relationships between HO-1, hypoxia, and response to chemotherapy is unclear. Our results showed that hypoxia upregulates the expression of HO-1 in PDAC cells, and HO-1 inhibition using the HO-1 inhibitors zinc protoporphyrin, tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), and HO-1 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 suppresses the proliferation of PDAC cells under hypoxia and sensitize them to gemcitabine under in vitro conditions. Treating orthotopic tumors with SnPP, or SnPP in combination with gemcitabine, significantly reduced the weight of pancreatic tumors (P < 0.05), decreased metastasis and improved the efficacy of gemcitabine treatment (P < 0.05). Mechanistically, inhibition of HO-1 increased the production of reactive oxygen species as demonstrated by increased dihydroethidium, and Mitosox, disrupted glutathione cycle, and enhanced apoptosis. There was significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 staining in tumors after combined treatment with SnPP and gemcitabine comparing to control or gemcitabine alone.

However, whether cholinergic signaling directly regulates progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been defined. Here, we found that subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in LSL-Kras +/G12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice accelerated PDAC development, whereas treatment with the systemic muscarinic agonist bethanechol restored the normal KC phenotype, thereby suppressing the accelerated tumorigenesis caused by vagotomy. In LSL-Kras +/G12D;LSL-Trp53 +/R172H;Pdx1-Cre mice with established PDAC, bethanechol significantly extended survival. These effects were mediated in part through CHRM1, which inhibited downstream MAPK/EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways in PDAC cells. Enhanced cholinergic signaling led to a suppression of the cancer stem cell (CSC) compartment, CD11b+ myeloid cells, TNF\u03b1 levels, and metastatic growth in the liver. Therefore, these data suggest that cholinergic signaling directly and indirectly suppresses growth of PDAC cells, and therapies that stimulate muscarinic receptors may be useful in the treatment of PDAC.Significance: Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or Chrm1 knockout accelerates pancreatic tumorigenesis, in part via expansion of the CSC compartment. Systemic administration of a muscarinic agonist suppresses tumorigenesis through MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, in early stages of tumor growth and in more advanced, metastatic disease. Therefore, CHRM1 may represent a potentially attractive therapeutic target. Cancer Discov; 8(11); 1458-73. \u00a92018 AACR.

Ongoing basic and translational studies are better classifying the disease in hopes of identifying critical pathways that distinguish the unique PDAC subtypes, which will lead to personalized therapies.

However, many underlying mechanisms of tissue stiffening remain unknown, requiring small animal studies and adapted elasticity mapping techniques. Harmonic motion imaging (HMI) assesses tissue viscoelasticity by inducing localized oscillation from a periodic acoustic radiation force. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of HMI for in vivo elasticity mapping of abdominal organs in small animals. Pathological cases, i.e. chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, were also studied in vivo to assess the capability of HMI for detection of the change in mechanical properties. A 4.5 MHz focused ultrasound transducer (FUS) generated an amplitude-modulated beam resulting in 50 Hz harmonic tissue oscillations at its focus. Axial tissue displacement was estimated using 1D-cross-correlation of RF signals acquired with a 7.8 MHz diagnostic transducer confocally aligned with the FUS. In vitro results in canine liver and kidney showed the correlation between HMI displacement and Young's moduli measured by rheometry compression testing. HMI was capable of providing reproducible elasticity maps of the mouse abdominal region in vivo allowing the identification of, from stiffest to softest, the murine kidney, pancreas, liver, and spleen. Finally, pancreata affected by pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer showed HMI displacements 1.7 and 2.2 times lower than in the control case, respectively, indicating higher stiffness. The HMI displacement amplitude was correlated with the extent of fibrosis as well as detecting the very onset of stiffening even before fibrosis could be detected on H&E. This work shows that HMI can produce reliable elasticity maps of mouse abdominal region in vivo, thus providing a potentially critical tool to assess pathologies affecting organ elasticity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Abdomen", "Animals", "Dogs", "Elastic Modulus", "Elasticity Imaging Techniques", "Kidney", "Liver", "Lower Gastrointestinal Tract", "Mice", "Motion", "Transducers"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Payen", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carmine F", "Last Name": "Palermo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stephen A", "Last Name": "Sastra", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hong", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yang", "Last Name": "Han", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth P", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elisa E", "Last Name": "Konofagou", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "PubDate": "2016Aug07"}, {"PMID": "27058937", "Title": "Dclk1 Defines Quiescent Pancreatic Progenitors that Promote Injury-Induced Regeneration and Tumorigenesis.", "Abstract": "The existence of adult pancreatic progenitor cells has been debated. While some favor the concept of facultative progenitors involved in homeostasis and repair, neither a location nor markers for such cells have been defined. Using genetic lineage tracing, we show that Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) labels a rare population of long-lived, quiescent pancreatic cells. In vitro, Dclk1+ cells proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic inflammation. Accordingly, their loss has detrimental effects after cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Expression of mutant Kras in Dclk1+ cells does not affect their quiescence or longevity. However, experimental pancreatitis converts Kras mutant Dclk1+ cells into potent cancer-initiating cells. As a potential effector of Kras, Dclk1 contributes functionally to the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer.

The HMI system consisted of a focused ultrasound transducer, which generated sinusoidal radiation force to induce oscillatory tissue motion at 50 Hz, and a diagnostic ultrasound transducer, which detected the axial tissue displacements based on acquired radio-frequency signals using a 1-D cross-correlation algorithm. For pancreatic tumor detection, HMI images were generated for pancreatic tumors in transgenic mice and normal pancreases in wild-type mice. The obtained HMI images showed a high contrast between normal and malignant pancreases with an average peak-to-peak HMI displacement ratio of 3.2. Histological analysis showed that no tissue damage was associated with HMI when it was used for the sole purpose of elasticity imaging. For pancreatic tumor ablation monitoring, the focused ultrasound transducer was operated at a higher acoustic power and longer pulse length than that used in tumor detection to simultaneously induce HIFU thermal ablation and oscillatory tissue displacements, allowing HMI monitoring without interrupting tumor ablation. HMI monitoring of HIFU ablation found significant decreases in the peak-to-peak HMI displacements before and after HIFU ablation with a reduction rate ranging from 15.8% to 57.0%.

The margins of most cancer types are not well demarcated because the cancer diffusely infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Furthermore, cancers may be multifocal and characterized by the presence of microscopic satellite lesions. Such microscopic foci represent a major reason for persistence of cancer, local recurrences, and metastatic spread, and are usually impossible to visualize with currently available imaging technologies. An imaging method to reveal the true extent of tumors is desired clinically and surgically. We show the precise visualization of tumor margins, microscopic tumor invasion, and multifocal locoregional tumor spread using a new generation of surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) nanoparticles, which are termed SERRS nanostars. The SERRS nanostars feature a star-shaped gold core, a Raman reporter resonant in the near-infrared spectrum, and a primer-free silication method. In genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and sarcoma, and in one human sarcoma xenograft model, SERRS nanostars enabled accurate detection of macroscopic malignant lesions, as well as microscopic disease, without the need for a targeting moiety. Moreover, the sensitivity (1.5 fM limit of detection) of SERRS nanostars allowed imaging of premalignant lesions of pancreatic and prostatic neoplasias. High sensitivity and broad applicability, in conjunction with their inert gold-silica composition, render SERRS nanostars a promising imaging agent for more precise cancer imaging and resection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Humans", "Nanoparticles", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasms", "Pinocytosis", "Precancerous Conditions", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman", "Tissue Distribution"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stefan", "Last Name": "Harmsen", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ruimin", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.

This grim fact has driven substantial research efforts into this disease in recent decades. Unfortunately, the investment has yet to result in a meaningful increase in 5-year survival. This has prompted many pancreatic cancer researchers and advocates to redouble their efforts, but also requires one to step back and ask why the previous efforts were lacking and to consider why pancreatic cancer is so difficult to treat. The difficulties are legion. PDA is characterized by an insidious clinical syndrome, but is rarely diagnosed at a time when surgical resection is feasible. We lack markers of early detection and screening programs remain unproven even in high risk populations. The location of the tumor in the retroperitoneum, the advanced age of patients, and the systemic effects of disease limit the options for local therapy. Chemotherapy may provide a small benefit, but most efforts to improve on the current regimens consistently and stubbornly fail in advanced clinical trials. The molecular and cellular features of ductal pancreatic tumors are aggressive and underlay multiple levels of therapeutic resistance. Non-cell-autonomous features including stromal proliferation, reduced vascular density and immune suppression also contribute to therapeutic resistance. Growing awareness of these the fundamental features of PDA has begun to guide ongoing research efforts. Clinical trials are now specifically targeting these tumor properties and actively focusing on the therapeutic implications of tumor stroma. As reviewed here, reflecting on the fundamental question of why pancreatic cancer is so difficult to treat is a necessary and informative exercise that will aid our efforts to improve patient outcomes.

To test epigenetic therapy against this cancer, we used the DNA demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) in an aggressive mouse model of stromal rich PDAC (KPC-Brca1 mice). In untreated tumors, we found globally decreased 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) in malignant epithelial cells and in cancer-associated myofibroblasts (CAF), along with increased amounts of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-HmC) in CAFs, in progression from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to PDAC. DAC further reduced DNA methylation and slowed PDAC progression, markedly extending survival in an early-treatment protocol and significantly though transiently inhibiting tumor growth when initiated later, without adverse side effects. Escaping tumors contained areas of sarcomatoid transformation with disappearance of CAFs. Mixing-allografting experiments and proliferation indices showed that DAC efficacy was due to inhibition of both the malignant epithelial cells and the CAFs. Expression profiling and immunohistochemistry highlighted DAC induction of STAT1 in the tumors, and DAC plus IFN-\u03b3 produced an additive antiproliferative effect on PDAC cells. DAC induced strong expression of the testis antigen deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) in CAFs. These data show that DAC is effective against PDAC in vivo and provide a rationale for future studies combining hypomethylating agents with cytokines and immunotherapy.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Azacitidine", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "DNA Methylation", "Decitabine", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Stromal Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Reena", "Last Name": "Shakya", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamas", "Last Name": "Gonda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Quante", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Martha", "Last Name": "Salas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jenna", "Last Name": "Brooks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steffen", "Last Name": "Hirsch", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Justine", "Last Name": "Davies", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angelica", "Last Name": "Cullo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kenneth", "Last Name": "Olive", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy C", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Matthias", "Last Name": "Szabolcs", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Tycko", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Ludwig", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Cancer research", "PubDate": "2013Jan15"}]
