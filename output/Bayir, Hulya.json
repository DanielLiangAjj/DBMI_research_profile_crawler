[{"PMID": "38908072", "Title": "Ferroptosis in health and disease.", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is a pervasive non-apoptotic form of cell death highly relevant in various degenerative diseases and malignancies. The hallmark of ferroptosis is uncontrolled and overwhelming peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in membrane phospholipids, which eventually leads to rupture of the plasma membrane. Ferroptosis is unique in that it is essentially a spontaneous, uncatalyzed chemical process based on perturbed iron and redox homeostasis contributing to the cell death process, but that it is nonetheless modulated by many metabolic nodes that impinge on the cells' susceptibility to ferroptosis. Among the various nodes affecting ferroptosis sensitivity, several have emerged as promising candidates for pharmacological intervention, rendering ferroptosis-related proteins attractive targets for the treatment of numerous currently incurable diseases. Herein, the current members of a Germany-wide research consortium focusing on ferroptosis research, as well as key external experts in ferroptosis who have made seminal contributions to this rapidly growing and exciting field of research, have gathered to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review on ferroptosis. Specific topics include: basic mechanisms, in vivo relevance, specialized methodologies, chemical and pharmacological tools, and the potential contribution of ferroptosis to disease etiopathology and progression. We hope that this article will not only provide established scientists and newcomers to the field with an overview of the multiple facets of ferroptosis, but also encourage additional efforts to characterize further molecular pathways modulating ferroptosis, with the ultimate goal to develop novel pharmacotherapies to tackle the various diseases associated with - or caused by - ferroptosis.", "Keywords": ["Cancer", "Cell death", "Iron", "Ischemia/reperfusion", "Lipid peroxidation", "Neurodegeneration"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carsten", "Last Name": "Berndt", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Hamed", "Last Name": "Alborzinia", "Affiliation": "Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM GGmbH), Heidelberg, Germany;

A reduction of pro-tumor Rb high M2-type macrophages from TME in vivo enhanced T cell infiltration and inhibited cancer progression. We demonstrate an increased Rb expression in TAMs in women with ovarian cancer is associated with poorer prognosis. Ex vivo, we show analogous cell death induction by therapeutic Rb targeting in TAMs in post-surgery ascites from ovarian cancer patients.

Here, we evaluated molecular and neurological presentations in the G56S mouse model, which carries a missense mutation in the Sms gene. The lack of SMS protein in the G56S mice resulted in increased spermidine/spermine ratio, failure to thrive, short stature and reduced bone density. They showed impaired learning capacity, increased anxiety, reduced mobility and heightened fear responses, accompanied by reduced total and regional brain volumes.

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent oxidative form of cell death characterized by unrestricted lipid peroxidation in the context of heterogeneous and plastic mechanisms. Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of specific types of autophagy (e.g. ferritinophagy, lipophagy, and clockophagy) in initiating or executing ferroptotic cell death through the selective degradation of anti-injury proteins or organelles. Conversely, other forms of selective autophagy (e.g. reticulophagy and lysophagy) enhance the cellular defense against ferroptotic damage. Dysregulated autophagy-dependent ferroptosis has implications for a diverse range of pathological conditions. This review aims to present an updated definition of autophagy-dependent ferroptosis, discuss influential substrates and receptors, outline experimental methods, and propose guidelines for interpreting the results.Abbreviation: 3-MA:3-methyladenine; 4HNE: 4-hydroxynonenal; ACD: accidentalcell death; ADF: autophagy-dependentferroptosis; ARE: antioxidant response element; BH2:dihydrobiopterin; BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin; BMDMs: bonemarrow-derived macrophages; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CQ:chloroquine; DAMPs: danger/damage-associated molecular patterns; EMT,epithelial-mesenchymal transition; EPR: electronparamagnetic resonance; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRET: F\u00f6rsterresonance energy transfer; GFP: green fluorescent protein;GSH: glutathione;IF: immunofluorescence; IHC: immunohistochemistry; IOP, intraocularpressure; IRI: ischemia-reperfusion injury; LAA: linoleamide alkyne;MDA: malondialdehyde; PGSK: Phen Green\u2122 SK;RCD: regulatedcell death; PUFAs: polyunsaturated fatty acids; RFP: red fluorescentprotein;ROS: reactive oxygen species; TBA: thiobarbituricacid; TBARS: thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; TEM:transmission electron microscopy.", "Keywords": ["Cell death", "ferritinophagy", "iron", "lipid peroxidation", "lipophagy", "lysosome"], "MeSH terms": ["Ferroptosis", "Humans", "Autophagy", "Animals", "Consensus"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Andrey S", "Last Name": "Tsvetkov", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, The University of Texas McGovern Medical School at Houston, Houston, TX, USA."}, {"First Name": "Han-Ming", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}, {"First Name": "Ciro", "Last Name": "Isidoro", "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas T", "Last Name": "Ktistakis", "Affiliation": "Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Andreas", "Last Name": "Linkermann", "Affiliation": "Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine 3, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Werner J H", "Last Name": "Koopman", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Radboud Center for Mitochondrial Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Hans-Uwe", "Last Name": "Simon", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."}, {"First Name": "Lorenzo", "Last Name": "Galluzzi", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Shouqing", "Last Name": "Luo", "Affiliation": "Peninsula Medical School, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daqian", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."}, {"First Name": "Wei", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olivier", "Last Name": "Peulen", "Affiliation": "Metastasis Research Laboratory, GIGA Cancer-University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium."}, {"First Name": "Qian", "Last Name": "Cai", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "David C", "Last Name": "Rubinsztein", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jen-Tsan", "Last Name": "Chi", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA."}, {"First Name": "Donna D", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Pharmacology and Toxicology, R.

"Although the role of ferroptosis in killing tumor cells is well established, recent studies indicate that ferroptosis inducers also sabotage anti-tumor immunity by killing neutrophils and thus unexpectedly stimulate tumor growth, raising a serious issue about whether ferroptosis effectively suppresses tumor development in\u00a0vivo. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screenings, we discover a pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2 (PHLDA2)-mediated ferroptosis pathway that is neither ACSL4-dependent nor requires common ferroptosis inducers. PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis acts through the peroxidation of phosphatidic acid (PA) upon high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS-induced ferroptosis is critical for tumor growth in the absence of common ferroptosis inducers; strikingly, loss of PHLDA2 abrogates ROS-induced ferroptosis and promotes tumor growth but has no obvious effect in normal tissues in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse tumor models. These data demonstrate that PHLDA2-mediated PA peroxidation triggers a distinct ferroptosis response critical for tumor suppression and reveal that PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis occurs naturally in\u00a0vivo without any treatment from ferroptosis inducers.", "Keywords": ["ALOX12", "GPAT3", "PHLDA2", "ROS", "cystine starvation", "ferroptosis", "lipid peroxidation", "phosphatidic acid", "phosphatidylethanolamine", "tumor suppression"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Disease Models, Animal", "Lipid Peroxidation", "Neoplasms", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xin", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhe", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Institute for Cancer Genetics and Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Svetlana N", "Last Name": "Samovich", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health and Departments of Environmental Health, Chemistry, Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA;

The peroxidation of PUFA-PLs, particularly sn2-arachidonoyl(AA)- and sn2-adrenoyl(AdA)-containing phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), has been associated with the execution of ferroptosis, a program of regulated cell death. There is a minor subpopulation (\u22481-2\u2005mol\u2009%) of doubly PUFA-acylated phospholipids (di-PUFA-PLs) whose role in ferroptosis remains enigmatic. Here we report that 15-lipoxygenase (15LOX) exhibits unexpectedly high pro-ferroptotic peroxidation activity towards di-PUFA-PEs. We revealed that peroxidation of several molecular species of di-PUFA-PEs occurred early in ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1, a typical ferroptosis inhibitor, effectively prevented peroxidation of di-PUFA-PEs. Furthermore, co-incubation of cells with di-AA-PE and 15LOX produced PUFA-PE peroxidation and induced ferroptotic death. The decreased contents of di-PUFA-PEs in ACSL4 KO A375 cells was associated with lower levels of di-PUFA-PE peroxidation and enhanced resistance to ferroptosis. Thus, di-PUFA-PE species are newly identified phospholipid peroxidation substrates and regulators of ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic target for many diseases related to ferroptotic death.", "Keywords": ["Cell Death", "Mass Spectrometry", "Oxidation", "Phospholipids", "Redox Lipidomics"], "MeSH terms": ["Phosphatidylethanolamines", "Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase", "Cell Death",

TAZ deficiency leads to accumulation of mono-lyso-CL (MLCL), which forms a peroxidase complex with cytochrome c (cyt c) capable of oxidizing polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing lipids. We hypothesized that accumulation of MLCL facilitates formation of anomalous MLCL-cyt c peroxidase complexes and peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid phospholipids as the primary BTHS pathogenic mechanism. Using genetic, biochemical/biophysical, redox lipidomic and computational approaches, we reveal mechanisms of peroxidase-competent MLCL-cyt c complexation and increased phospholipid peroxidation in different TAZ-deficient cells and animal models and in pre-transplant biopsies from hearts of patients with BTHS. A specific mitochondria-targeted anti-peroxidase agent inhibited MLCL-cyt c peroxidase activity, prevented phospholipid peroxidation, improved mitochondrial respiration of TAZ-deficient C2C12 myoblasts and restored exercise endurance in a BTHS Drosophila model.

the mechanism of which is still to be understood. 15-lipoxygenase (15LOX) complex with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding protein 1 (PEBP1) catalyzes the generation of pro-ferroptotic cell death signals, hydroperoxy-polyunsaturated PE. We focused on gaining new insights into the molecular basis of these pro-ferroptotic interactions using computational modeling and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments. Simulations of 15LOX-1/PEBP1 complex dynamics and interactions with lipids revealed that association with the membrane triggers a conformational change in the complex. This conformational change facilitates the access of stearoyl/arachidonoyl-PE (SAPE) substrates to the catalytic site. Furthermore, the binding of SAPE promotes tight interactions within the complex and induces further conformational changes that facilitate the oxidation reaction. The reaction yields two hydroperoxides as products, 15-HpETE-PE and 12-HpETE-PE, at a ratio of 5:1. A significant effect of PEBP1 is observed only on the predominant product. Moreover, combined experiments and simulations consistently demonstrate the significance of PEBP1 P112E mutation in generating ferroptotic cell death signals.", "Keywords": ["15-Lipoxygenase", "Ferroptosis", "Lipid peroxidation", "Membrane effect", "PEBP1"], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Death", "Ferroptosis", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase", "Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein", "Phosphatidylethanolamines", "Humans", "Animals", "Swine"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thiliban", "Last Name": "Manivarma", "Affiliation": "Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Informatics, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland."}, {"First Name": "Aleksandr A", "Last Name": "Kapralov", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Svetlana N", "Last Name": "Samovich", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care and Hospital Medicine, Redox Health Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yulia Y", "Last Name": "Tyurina", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vladimir A", "Last Name": "Tyurin", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Andrew P", "Last Name": "VanDemark", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wieslaw", "Last Name": "Nowak", "Affiliation": "Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Informatics, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care and Hospital Medicine, Redox Health Center, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ivet", "Last Name": "Bahar", "Affiliation": "Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology and Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Stony Brook University, New York, USA.

noninterfering with biosynthesis of lipid mediators.", "Abstract": "Programmed ferroptotic death eliminates cells in all major organs and tissues with imbalanced redox metabolism due to overwhelming iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation under insufficient control by thiols (Glutathione (GSH)). Ferroptosis has been associated with the pathogenesis of major chronic degenerative diseases and acute injuries of the brain, cardiovascular system, liver, kidneys, and other organs, and its manipulation offers a promising new strategy for anticancer therapy. This explains the high interest in designing new small-molecule-specific inhibitors against ferroptosis. Given the role of 15-lipoxygenase (15LOX) association with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding protein 1 (PEBP1) in initiating ferroptosis-specific peroxidation of polyunsaturated PE, we propose a strategy of discovering antiferroptotic agents as inhibitors of the 15LOX/PEBP1 catalytic complex rather than 15LOX alone. Here we designed, synthesized, and tested a customized library of 26 compounds using biochemical, molecular, and cell biology models along with redox lipidomic and computational analyses. We selected two lead compounds, FerroLOXIN-1 and 2, which effectively suppressed ferroptosis in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo without affecting the biosynthesis of pro-/anti-inflammatory lipid mediators in\u00a0vivo. The effectiveness of these lead compounds is not due to radical scavenging or iron-chelation but results from their specific mechanisms of interaction with the 15LOX-2/PEBP1 complex, which either alters the binding pose of the substrate [eicosatetraenoyl-PE (ETE-PE)] in a nonproductive way or blocks the predominant oxygen channel thus preventing the catalysis of ETE-PE peroxidation.

coordinating metabolism and physiology and can be deleterious to membranes when they accumulate in excessive amounts. Recent Advances: There is an emerging understanding that regulation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) phospholipid peroxidation, particularly of PUFA-phosphatidylethanolamine, is important in a newly discovered type of regulated cell death, ferroptosis. Among the most recently described regulatory mechanisms is the ferroptosis suppressor protein, which controls the peroxidation process due to its ability to reduce coenzyme Q (CoQ). Critical Issues: In this study, we reviewed the most recent data in the context of the concept of free radical reductases formulated in the 1980-1990s and focused on enzymatic mechanisms of CoQ reduction in different membranes (e.g., mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane electron transporters) as well as TCA cycle components and cytosolic reductases capable of recycling the high antioxidant efficiency of the CoQ/vitamin E system. Future Directions: We highlight the importance of individual components of the free radical reductase network in regulating the ferroptotic program and defining the sensitivity/tolerance of cells to ferroptotic death. Complete deciphering of the interactive complexity of this system may be important for designing effective antiferroptotic modalities. Antioxid.

However, in vivo and ex vivo analyses of how cancers reprogram SC functions in different organs of tumor-bearing mice are lacking. We generated Plp1-CreERT/tdTomato mice which harbor fluorescently labeled myelinated and non-myelin forming SCs. We show that this model enables the isolation of the SCs with high purity from the skin and multiple other organs. We used this model to study phenotypic and functional reprogramming of the SCs in the skin adjacent to melanoma tumors. Transcriptomic analyses of the peritumoral skin SCs versus skin SCs from tumor-free mice revealed that the former existed in a repair-like state typically activated during nerve and tissue injury. Peritumoral skin SCs also downregulated pro-inflammatory genes and pathways related to protective anti-tumor responses. In vivo and ex vivo functional assays confirmed immunosuppressive activities of the peritumoral skin SCs. Specifically, melanoma-reprogrammed SCs upregulated 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and increased production of anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and lipoxins A4/B4. Inhibition of 12/15-LOX or COX2 in SCs, or EP4 receptor on lymphocytes reversed SC-dependent suppression of anti-tumor T-cell activation. Therefore, SCs within the skin adjacent to melanoma tumors demonstrate functional switching to repair-like immunosuppressive cells with dysregulated lipid oxidation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of these mechanisms on neuronal death. Patients from the neurosurgical intensive care unit suffering aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were recruited retrospectively from a respective database. In vitro experiments were performed in rat cortex homogenate, primary dissociated neuronal cultures, B35 and NG108-15\u00a0cell lines. We employed methods including high resolution respirometry, electron spin resonance, fluorescent microscopy, kinetic determination of enzymatic activities and immunocytochemistry. We found that elevated levels of extracellular glutamate and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with SAH. In experiments using neuronal cultures we showed that the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC), a key enzyme of the glutamate-dependent segment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is more susceptible to the inhibition by NO than mitochondrial respiration. Inhibition of OGDHC by NO or by succinyl phosphonate (SP), a highly specific OGDHC inhibitor, caused accumulation of extracellular glutamate and neuronal death. Extracellular nitrite did not substantially contribute to this NO action. Reactivation of OGDHC by its cofactor thiamine (TH) reduced extracellular glutamate levels, Ca2+ influx into neurons and cell death rate. Salutary effect of TH against glutamate toxicity was confirmed in three different cell lines.

Ferroptosis is triggered in cells with dysregulated iron and thiol redox metabolism, whereby the initial robust but selective accumulation of hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids is further propagated through enzymatic and non-enzymatic secondary mechanisms, leading to formation of oxidatively truncated electrophilic species and their adducts with proteins.

This necessitates a search for alternative therapeutic modalities to cause cancer cell's demise, among them - ferroptosis. One of the obstacles to using pro-ferroptotic agents to treat cancer is the lack of adequate biomarkers of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is accompanied by peroxidation of polyunsaturated species of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to hydroperoxy- (-OOH) derivatives, which act as death signals. We demonstrate that RSL3-induced death of A375 melanoma cells in vitro was fully preventable by ferrostatin-1, suggesting their high susceptibility to ferroptosis. Treatment of A375\u00a0cells with RSL3 caused a significant accumulation of PE-(18:0/20:4-OOH) and PE-(18:0/22:4-OOH), the biomarkers of ferroptosis, as well as oxidatively truncated products - PE-(18:0/hydroxy-8-oxo-oct-6-enoic acid (HOOA) and PC-(18:0/HOOA). A significant suppressive effect of RSL3 on melanoma growth was observed in vivo (utilizing a xenograft model of inoculation of GFP-labeled A375\u00a0cells into immune-deficient athymic nude mice). Redox phospholipidomics revealed elevated levels of 18:0/20:4-OOH in RSL3-treated group vs controls. In addition, PE-(18:0/20:4-OOH) species were identified as major contributors to the separation of control and RSL3-treated groups, with the highest variable importance in projection predictive score. Pearson correlation analysis revealed an association between tumor weight and contents of PE-(18:0/20:4-OOH) (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.505), PE-18:0/HOOA (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.547) and PE 16:0-HOOA (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.503).

Mutations in the gene encoding spermine synthase (SMS) lead to accumulation of spermidine in an X-linked recessive disorder known as Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS). Presently, no treatments exist for this rare disease that manifests with a spectrum of symptoms including intellectual disability, developmental delay, thin habitus, and low muscle tone. The development of therapeutic interventions for SRS will require a suitable disease-specific animal model that recapitulates many of the abnormalities observed in patients. Here, we characterize the molecular, behavioral, and neuroanatomical features of a mouse model with a missense mutation in Sms gene that results in a glycine-to-serine substitution at position 56 (G56S) of the SMS protein. Mice harboring this mutation exhibit a complete loss of SMS protein and elevated spermidine/spermine ratio in skeletal muscles and the brain. In addition, the G56S mice demonstrate increased anxiety, impaired learning, and decreased explorative behavior in fear conditioning, Morris water maze, and open field tests, respectively. Furthermore, these mice failed to gain weight over time and exhibit abnormalities in brain structure and bone density. Transcriptomic analysis of the cerebral cortex revealed downregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal protein synthesis. Our findings also revealed impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics in fibroblasts isolated from the G56S mice, indicating a correlation between these processes in the affected mice. Collectively, our findings establish the first in-depth characterization of an SRS preclinical mouse model that identifies cellular processes that could be targeted for future therapeutic development.", "Keywords": ["Polyamines", "Spermine synthase", "disease", "neurological", "pathogenesis", "spermine"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Oluwaseun", "Last Name": "Akinyele", "Affiliation": "Div. of Genetic and Genomic Medicine, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anushe", "Last Name": "Munir", "Affiliation": "Div. of Genetic and Genomic Medicine, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marie A", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Div. of Genetic and Genomic Medicine, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}, {"First Name": "Megan S", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Div. of Genetic and Genomic Medicine, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Gao", "Affiliation": "Children's Neuroscience Institute, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jackson R", "Last Name": "Foley", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yijen", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Dept. of Developmental Biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tracy", "Last Name": "Murray-Stewart", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Casero", "Affiliation": "Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hulya", "Last Name": "Bayir", "Affiliation": "Children's Neuroscience Institute, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dwi U", "Last Name": "Kemaladewi", "Affiliation": "Div. of Genetic and Genomic Medicine, Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Feb07"}, {"PMID": "36515827", "Title": "Detecting and Quantifying pADPr In Vivo.", "Abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) participate in diverse biological processes contributing to cellular homeostasis or exacerbating injury.

Overactivation of PARP - reflected by increased poly-ADP-ribosylation and accumulation of pADPr-modified proteins or free pADPr - contributes to depletion of NAD+ and mitochondrial dysfunction, potentially leading to cell death. Thus, PARP overactivation and increases in free pADPr have been identified as key contributors to the pathobiology of many diseases. In stark contrast, PARP inhibitors are in clinical use in cancer patients where they potentiate cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Accordingly, monitoring PARP-1 activation - responsible for up to 80-90% of cellular pADPr synthesis - by detecting and quantifying pADPr may provide valuable mechanistic insights as well as facilitating therapeutic drug monitoring for PARP inhibitors.Several non-isotopic immunodetection methods for quantifying pADPr are discussed: Western blotting of poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins, cellular localization of pADPr by immunohistochemistry, quantification of pADPr by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and small-scale two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.", "Keywords": ["ADP-ribose polymerase", "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase", "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymers", "Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase", "Poly-ADP-ribosylation"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases", "Poly ADP Ribosylation", "Blotting, Western", "Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew M", "Last Name": "Lamade", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaming", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Carla J", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S B", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. clarkrs@ccm.upmc.edu."}], "Journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)", "PubDate": "2023"}, {"PMID": "36204388", "Title": "Endogenous Interleukin-17a Contributes to Normal Spatial Memory Retention but Does Not Affect Early Behavioral or Neuropathological Outcomes after Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury.", "Abstract": "Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine primarily secreted in the brain by inflammatory T lymphocytes and glial cells. IL-17+ T-helper (Th17) cells are increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), and IL-17 levels are increased in serum and brain tissue. We hypothesized that il17a and related gene expression would be increased in brain tissue after TBI in mice and il17a-/- mice would demonstrate neuroprotection versus wild type. The controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult male C57BL6/J mice was used for all experiments. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni correction. A value of p\u2009<\u20090.05 determined significance. Expression of il17a was significantly reduced in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus by day 3 after TBI, and expression remained low at 28 days. There were no differences between il17a-/- and il17a+/+ mice in beam balance, Morris water maze performance, or lesion volume after CCI. Surprisingly, na\u00efve il17a -/- mice performed significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.02) worse than na\u00efve il17a+/+ mice on the probe trial. In conclusion, sustained depression of il17a gene expression was observed in brains after TBI in adult mice. Genetic knockout of IL-17 was not neuroprotective after TBI.

Placebo-treated rats had increased capillary diameters post-CA. The cortex was hypoxic post-CA in both groups. Epinephrine treatment worsened reference memory performance vs. shams. Hippocampal neuron counts did not differ between groups.

"Abstract": "Although DNA damage is intricately linked to metabolism, the metabolic alterations that occur in response to DNA damage are not well understood. We use a DNA repair-deficient model of ERCC1-XPF in Caenorhabditis elegans to gain insights on how genotoxic stress drives aging. Using multi-omic approach, we discover that nuclear DNA damage promotes mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation and drives a global loss of fat depots. This metabolic shift to \u03b2-oxidation generates acetyl-coenzyme A to promote histone hyperacetylation and an associated change in expression of immune-effector and cytochrome genes.

We show that in response to DNA damage, polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid (AA) and AA-related lipid mediators, are elevated and this is dependent on mys-1.

Necroptosis relies on activation of RIP1 and RIP3 kinases. Ferroptosis is triggered by oxidation of polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines (PUFA-PE) by complexes of 15-Lipoxygenase (15LOX) with phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1). The latter, also known as RAF kinase inhibitory protein, displays promiscuity towards multiple proteins. In this study we show that RIP3 K51A kinase inactive mice have increased ferroptotic burden and worse outcome after irradiation and brain trauma rescued by anti-ferroptotic compounds Liproxstatin-1 and Ferrostatin 16-86. Given structural homology between RAF and RIP3, we hypothesized that PEBP1 acts as a necroptosis-to-ferroptosis switch interacting with either RIP3 or 15LOX. Using genetic, biochemical, redox lipidomics and computational approaches, we uncovered that PEBP1 complexes with RIP3 and inhibits necroptosis. Elevated expression combined with higher affinity enables 15LOX to pilfer PEBP1 from RIP3, thereby promoting PUFA-PE oxidation and ferroptosis which sensitizes Rip3K51A/K51A kinase-deficient mice to total body irradiation and brain trauma. This newly unearthed PEBP1/15LOX-driven mechanism, along with previously established switch between necroptosis and apoptosis, can serve multiple and diverse cell death regulatory functions across various human disease states.", "Keywords": ["Ferroptotic death", "Lipid signaling", "Necroptotic death", "Regulated necrosis", "Traumatic brain injury", "Whole body irradiation"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Death", "Ferroptosis", "Mice", "Necrosis", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Andrew M", "Last Name": "Lamade", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 4401 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15224, USA;

Here, we explore the regulatory role of Prok2 in neuronal ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo.

Though GSH/Gpx4 is the predominant system detoxifying phospholipid hydroperoxides (PLOOH) in mammalian cells, recently Gpx4-independent regulators of ferroptosis like ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) in resistant cancer lines and iNOS/NO\u2022 in M1 macrophages have been discovered. We previously reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) utilizes its 15- lipoxygenase (pLoxA) to trigger ferroptotic death in epithelial cells by oxidizing the host arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (ETE-PE) into pro-ferroptotic 15-hydroperoxy- arachidonyl-PE (15-HpETE-PE). Here we demonstrate that PA degrades the host GPx4 defense by activating the lysosomal chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). In response, the host stimulates the iNOS/NO\u2022-driven anti-ferroptotic mechanism to stymie lipid peroxidation and protect GPx4/GSH-deficient cells. By using a co-culture model system, we showed that macrophage-produced NO\u2022 can distantly prevent PA stimulated ferroptosis in epithelial cells as an inter-cellular mechanism. We further established that suppression of ferroptosis in epithelial cells by NO\u2022 is enabled through the suppression of phospholipid peroxidation, particularly the production of pro-ferroptotic 15-HpETE-PE signals. Pharmacological targeting of iNOS (NO\u2022 generation) attenuated its anti-ferroptotic function.

Several studies suggested a possible contribution of mitochondria to ferroptosis although the mechanisms underlying mitochondria-mediated ferroptotic pathways remain elusive. Reduced glutathione (GSH) is a central player in ferroptosis that is required for glutathione peroxidase 4 to eliminate oxidized phospholipids. Mitochondria do not produce GSH, and although the transport of GSH to mitochondria is not fully understood, two carrier proteins, the dicarboxylate carrier (DIC, SLC25A10) and the oxoglutarate carrier (OGC, SLC25A11) have been suggested to participate in GSH transport. Here, we elucidated the role of DIC and OGC as well as mitochondrial bioenergetics in ferroptosis in H9c2 cardioblasts. Results showed that mitochondria are highly sensitive to ferroptotic stimuli displaying fragmentation, and lipid peroxidation shortly after the onset of ferroptotic stimulus. Inhibition of electron transport chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation worsened RSL3-induced ferroptosis. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed a dramatic increase in the levels of pro-ferroptotic oxygenated phosphatidylethanolamine species in mitochondria in response to RSL3 (ferroptosis inducer) and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion. Inhibition of DIC and OGC aggravated ferroptosis and increased mitochondrial ROS, membrane depolarization, and GSH depletion. Dihydrolipoic acid, an essential cofactor for several mitochondrial multienzyme complexes, attenuated ferroptosis and induced direct reduction of pro-ferroptotic peroxidized phospholipids to hydroxy-phospholipids in vitro.

Indeed, a number of signaling functions of (phospho)lipid molecules has been discovered. Among these signaling lipids, a particular group of oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), so called lipid mediators, has been thoroughly investigated over several decades. This group includes oxygenated octadecanoids, eicosanoids, and docosanoids and includes several hundreds of individual species. Oxygenation of PUFA can occur when they are esterified into major classes of phospholipids. Initially, these events have been associated with non-specific oxidative injury of biomembranes. An alternative concept is that these post-synthetically oxidatively modified phospholipids and their adducts with proteins are a part of a redox epiphospholipidome that represents a rich and versatile language for intra- and inter-cellular communications. The redox epiphospholipidome may include hundreds of thousands of individual molecular species acting as meaningful biological signals. This review describes the signaling role of oxygenated phospholipids in programs of regulated cell death. Although phospholipid peroxidation has been associated with almost all known cell death programs, we chose to discuss enzymatic pathways activated during apoptosis and ferroptosis and leading to peroxidation of two phospholipid classes, cardiolipins (CLs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). This is based on the available LC-MS identification and quantitative information on the respective peroxidation products of CLs and PEs. We focused on molecular mechanisms through which two proteins, a mitochondrial hemoprotein cytochrome c (cyt c), and non-heme Fe lipoxygenase (LOX), change their catalytic properties to fulfill new functions of generating oxygenated CL and PE species. Given the high selectivity and specificity of CL and PE peroxidation we argue that enzymatic reactions catalyzed by cyt c/CL complexes and 15-lipoxygenase/phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 (15LOX/PEBP1) complexes dominate, at least during the initiation stage of peroxidation, in apoptosis and ferroptosis. We contrast cell-autonomous nature of CLox signaling in apoptosis correlating with its anti-inflammatory functions vs. non-cell-autonomous ferroptotic signaling facilitating pro-inflammatory (necro-inflammatory) responses. Finally, we propose that small molecule mechanism-based regulators of enzymatic phospholipid peroxidation may lead to highly specific anti-apoptotic and anti-ferroptotic therapeutic modalities.", "Keywords": ["apoptosis", "cardiolipin", "cytochrome c", "ferroptosis", "lipoxygenase", "phospholipid peroxidation", "redox lipidomics", "regulated cell death"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Catalysis", "Cell Death", "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated", "Ferroptosis", "Humans", "Lipidomics", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Phospholipids", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Valerian E", "Last Name": "Kagan", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yulia Y", "Last Name": "Tyurina", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Irina I", "Last Name": "Vlasova", "Affiliation": "World-Class Research Center \"Digital Biodesign and Personalized Healthcare\", Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russia."}, {"First Name": "Alexander A", "Last Name": "Kapralov", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Amoscato", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tamil S", "Last Name": "Anthonymuthu", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Vladimir A", "Last Name": "Tyurin", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Indira H", "Last Name": "Shrivastava", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fatma B", "Last Name": "Cinemre", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Lamade", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael W", "Last Name": "Epperly", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joel S", "Last Name": "Greenberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Donald H", "Last Name": "Beezhold", "Affiliation": "Office of the Director, Health Effects Laboratory Division, NIOSH/CDC, Morgantown, WV, United States."}, {"First Name": "Rama K", "Last Name": "Mallampalli", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States."}, {"First Name": "Apurva K", "Last Name": "Srivastava", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Human Toxicology and Pharmacology, Applied/Developmental Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hulya", "Last Name": "Bayir", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."}, {"First Name": "Anna A", "Last Name": "Shvedova", "Affiliation": "Exposure Assessment Branch, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (NIOSH/CDC), Morgantown, WV, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in endocrinology", "PubDate": "2020"}, {"PMID": "33542532", "Title": "Phospholipase iPLA2\u03b2 averts ferroptosis by eliminating a redox lipid death signal.", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis, triggered by discoordination of iron, thiols and lipids, leads to the accumulation of 15-hydroperoxy (Hp)-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (15-HpETE-PE), generated by complexes of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) and a scaffold protein, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-binding protein (PEBP)1.

Pre-clinical and clinical researchers face challenges with reproducibility that negatively impact translation and therapeutic development for improved TBI patient outcomes. To address this challenge, TBI Pre-clinical Working Groups expanded upon previous efforts and developed common data elements (CDEs) to describe the most frequently used experimental parameters. The working groups created 913 CDEs to describe study metadata, animal characteristics, animal history, injury models, and behavioral tests. Use cases applied a set of commonly used CDEs to address and evaluate the degree of missing data resulting from combining legacy data from different laboratories for two different outcome measures (Morris water maze [MWM]; RotorRod/Rotarod). Data were cleaned and harmonized to Form Structures containing the relevant CDEs and subjected to missing value analysis. For the MWM dataset (358 animals from five studies, 44 CDEs), 50% of the CDEs contained at least one missing value, while for the Rotarod dataset (97 animals from three studies, 48 CDEs), over 60% of CDEs contained at least one missing value. Overall, 35% of values were missing across the MWM dataset, and 33% of values were missing for the Rotarod dataset, demonstrating both the feasibility and the challenge of combining legacy datasets using CDEs. The CDEs and the associated forms created here are available to the broader pre-clinical research community to promote consistent and comprehensive data acquisition, as well as to facilitate data sharing and formation of data repositories.

Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a common ferroptosis inhibitor, is a lipophilic radical scavenger but a poor 15LOX inhibitor arguing against 15LOX having a role in ferroptosis. In the current work, we demonstrate that Fer-1 does not affect 15LOX alone, however, it effectively inhibits HpETE-PE production by the 15LOX/PEBP1 complex. Computational molecular modeling shows that Fer-1 binds to the 15LOX/PEBP1 complex at three sites and could disrupt the catalytically required allosteric motions of the 15LOX/PEBP1 complex.

To clarify the role of LPO in different modes of RCD, we studied in a comprehensive approach the differential involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phospholipid peroxidation products, and lipid ROS flux in the major prototype modes of RCD viz. apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. LC-MS oxidative lipidomics revealed robust peroxidation of three classes of phospholipids during ferroptosis with quantitative predominance of phosphatidylethanolamine species. Incomparably lower amounts of phospholipid peroxidation products were found in any of the other modes of RCD. Nonetheless, a strong increase in lipid ROS levels was detected in non-canonical pyroptosis, but only during cell membrane rupture. In contrast to ferroptosis, lipid ROS apparently was not involved in non-canonical pyroptosis execution nor in the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, while clear dependency on CASP11 and GSDMD was observed. Our data demonstrate that ferroptosis is the only mode of RCD that depends on excessive phospholipid peroxidation for its cytotoxicity.

Under Type 2 inflammatory conditions, human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) generate proferroptotic hydroperoxy-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (HpETE-PEs) as proximate death signals. Production of 15-HpETE-PE depends on activation of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15LO1) in complex with PE-binding protein-1 (PEBP1). We hypothesized that cellular membrane damage induced by these proferroptotic phospholipids triggers compensatory prosurvival pathways, and in particular autophagic pathways, to prevent cell elimination through programmed death. We discovered that PEBP1 is pivotal to driving dynamic interactions with both proferroptotic 15LO1 and the autophagic protein microtubule-associated light chain-3 (LC3). Further, the 15LO1-PEBP1-generated ferroptotic phospholipid, 15-HpETE-PE, promoted LC3-I lipidation to stimulate autophagy. This concurrent activation of autophagy protects cells from ferroptotic death and release of mitochondrial DNA. Similar findings are observed in Type 2 Hi asthma, where high levels of both 15LO1-PEBP1 and LC3-II are seen in HAECs, in association with low bronchoalveolar lavage fluid mitochondrial DNA and more severe disease.

Here we investigated whether the biomarker (signature)directed addition of a third anti-ferroptosis drug further mitigated TBI effects. C57BL/6NTac female mice (30-33 g) received 9.25 Gy TBI, and 24 h or later received JP4-039 (20 mg/kg), necrostatin-1 (1.65 mg/kg) and/or lipoxygenase-15 inhibitor (baicalein) (50 mg/kg) in single-, dual- or three-drug regimens. Some animals were sacrificed at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 7 postirradiation, while the majority in each group were maintained beyond 30 days. For those mice sacrificed at the early time points, femur bone marrow, intestine (ileum), lung and blood plasma were collected and analyzed for radiation-induced and mitigator-modified levels of 33 pro-inflammatory and stress response proteins. Each single mitigator administered [JP4-039 (24 h), necrostatin-1 (48 h) or baicalein (24 h)] improved survival at day 30 after TBI to 25% (P = 0.0432, 0.2816 or 0.1120, respectively) compared to 5% survival of 9.25 Gy TBI controls. Mice were administered the drug individually based on weight (mg/kg). Drug vehicles comprised 30% cyclodextrin for JP4-039 and baicalein, and 10% Cremphor-EL/10% ethanol/80% water for necrostatin-1; thus, dual-vehicle controls were also tested. The dual-drug combinations further enhanced survival: necrostatin-1 (delayed to 72 h) with baicalein 40% (P = 0.0359); JP4-039 with necrostatin-1 50% (P = 0.0062); and JP4-039 with baicalein 60% (P = 0.0064). The three-drug regimen, timed to signature directed evidence of onset after TBI of each death pathway in marrow and intestine, further increased the 30-day survival to 75% (P = 0.0002), and there was optimal normalization to preirradiation levels of inflammatory cytokine and stress response protein levels in plasma, intestine and marrow. In contrast, lung protein levels were minimally altered by 9.25 Gy TBI or mitigators over 7 days. Significantly, elevated intestinal proteins at day 7 after TBI were reduced by necrostatin-1-containing regimens; however, normalization of plasma protein levels at day 7 required the addition of JP4-039 and baicalein.

Genetic or pharmacologic depletion/inactivation of iNOS confers sensitivity on M1 cells, whereas NO\u2022 donors empower resistance of M2 cells to ferroptosis. In vivo, M1 phagocytes, in comparison to M2 phagocytes, exert higher resistance to pharmacologically induced ferroptosis. This resistance is diminished in iNOS-deficient cells in the pro-inflammatory conditions of brain trauma or the tumour microenvironment.

Obtaining comprehensive information about millions of signals encoded by oxidized phospholipids, represented by thousands of interactive reactions and pleiotropic (patho)physiological effects, is a daunting task. However, there is still reasonable hope that significant discoveries, of at least some of the important contributors to the overall overwhelmingly complex network of interactions triggered by inflammation, will lead to the discovery of new small molecule regulators and therapeutic modalities.

CL molecular species display great tissue variation with brain exhibiting a distinct, highly diverse CL population. We recently showed that the appearance of unique brain-type CLs in plasma could serve as a brain-specific marker of mitochondrial/tissue injury in patients after cardiac arrest. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been increasingly implicated as a critical mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, we hypothesized that unique, brain-specific CL species from the injured brain are released to the peripheral circulation after TBI. To test this hypothesis, we performed a high-resolution mass spectrometry based phospholipidomics analysis of post-natal day (PND)17 rat brain and plasma after controlled cortical impact. We found a time-dependent increase in plasma CLs after TBI including the aforementioned brain-specific CL species early after injury, whereas CLs were significantly decreased in the injured brain.

Among the latter are the myriads of oxygenated lipids including a well-studied group of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) - octadecanoids, eicosanoids, and docosanoids. During the last two decades, remarkable progress in liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry has led to significant progress in the characterization of oxygenated PUFA-containing phospholipids, thus designating the emergence of a new field of lipidomics, redox lipidomics. Although non-enzymatic free radical reactions of lipid peroxidation have been mostly associated with the aberrant metabolism typical of acute injury or chronic degenerative processes, newly accumulated evidence suggests that enzymatically catalyzed (phospho)lipid oxygenation reactions are essential mechanisms of many physiological pathways. In this review, we discuss a variety of contemporary protocols applicable for identification and quantitative characterization of different classes of peroxidized (phospho)lipids. We describe applications of different types of LCMS for analysis of peroxidized (phospho)lipids, particularly cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolalmines, in two important types of programmed cell death - apoptosis and ferroptosis. We discuss the role of peroxidized phosphatidylserines in phagocytotic signaling. We exemplify the participation of peroxidized neutral lipids, particularly tri-acylglycerides, in immuno-suppressive signaling in cancer. We also consider new approaches to exploring the spatial distribution of phospholipids in the context of their oxidizability by MS imaging, including the latest achievements in high resolution imaging techniques. We present innovative approaches to the interpretation of LC-MS data, including audio-representation analysis.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases brain energy demands, results in the activation of mitochondrial respiration, associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. This chain of events triggers neuronal apoptosis via oxidation of a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL). One pathway through which cells can avoid apoptosis is via elimination of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy. Previously, we showed that externalization of CL to the mitochondrial surface acts as an elimination signal in cells. Whether CL-mediated mitophagy occurs in vivo or its significance in the disease processes are not known. In this study, we showed that TBI leads to increased mitophagy in the human brain, which was also detected using TBI models in male rats. Knockdown of CL synthase, responsible for de novo synthesis of CL, or phospholipid scramblase-3, responsible for CL translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane, significantly decreased TBI-induced mitophagy. Inhibition of mitochondrial clearance by 3-methyladenine, mdivi-1, or phospholipid scramblase-3 knockdown after TBI led to a worse outcome, suggesting that mitophagy is beneficial. Together, our findings indicate that TBI-induced mitophagy is an endogenous neuroprotective process that is directed by CL, which marks damaged mitochondria for elimination, thereby limiting neuronal death and behavioral deficits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases energy demands leading to activation of mitochondrial respiration associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and resultant damage to mitochondria. We demonstrate that the complete elimination of irreparably damaged organelles via mitophagy is activated as an early response to TBI. This response includes translocation of mitochondria phospholipid cardiolipin from the inner membrane to the outer membrane where externalized cardiolipin mediates targeted protein light chain 3-mediated autophagy of damaged mitochondria. Our data on targeting phospholipid scramblase and cardiolipin synthase in genetically manipulated cells and animals strongly support the essential role of cardiolipin externalization mechanisms in the endogenous reparative plasticity of injured brain cells. Furthermore, successful execution and completion of mitophagy is beneficial in the context of preservation of cognitive functions after TBI.", "Keywords": ["apoptosis", "autophagy", "cardiolipin", "mitophagy", "neuroprotection", "phospholipid"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Brain", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Cardiolipins", "Humans", "Male", "Mitochondrial Membranes", "Mitophagy", "Neurons", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Honglu", "Last Name": "Chao", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Chao", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Qiang", "Last Name": "Zuo", "Affiliation": "Orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China."}, {"First Name": "Yinlong", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Mengqing", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Food Safety Research, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shanghai 200031, China."}, {"First Name": "Xiupeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Zheng", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Zhongyuan", "Last Name": "Bao", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Huimei", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing 210093, China."}, {"First Name": "Yongping", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219."}, {"First Name": "Huiyong", "Last Name": "Yin", "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Food Safety Research, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shanghai 200031, China."}, {"First Name": "Ning", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and."}, {"First Name": "Valerian E", "Last Name": "Kagan", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, bayihx@ccm.upmc.edu jijing@njmu.edu.cn."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurosurgery and bayihx@ccm.upmc.edu jijing@njmu.edu.cn."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Mar06"}, {"PMID": "30531185", "Title": "Ferroptosis Contributes to Neuronal Death and Functional Outcome After Traumatic Brain Injury.", "Abstract": "Traumatic brain injury triggers multiple cell death pathways, possibly including ferroptosis-a recently described cell death pathway that results from accumulation of 15-lipoxygenase-mediated lipid oxidation products, specifically oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine containing arachidonic or adrenic acid.

Among many factors, mitochondrial injury has recently attracted much attention due to the importance of the organelle for bioenergetics as well as intra- and extracellular signaling and cell death. Assuming the essentiality of a mitochondria-unique phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), for the structural and functional organization of mitochondria, here we applied global (phospho) lipidomics and redox lipidomics to reveal and identify CL modifications during controlled cortical impact (CCI). We revealed 2 major pathways activated in the CCI-injured brain as time-specific responses: early accumulation of oxidized CL (CLox) products was followed by hydrolytic reactions yielding monolyso-CLs (mCLs) and free fatty acids. To quantitatively assess possible specific roles of peroxidation and hydrolysis of mitochondrial CL, we performed comparative studies of CL modifications using an animal model of Barth syndrome where deficiency of CL reacylation (Tafazzin [Taz] deficiency) was associated exclusively with the accumulation of mCLs (but not CLox). By comparing the in vitro and in vivo results with genetic manipulation of major CL-, CLox-, and mCL-metabolizing enzymes, calcium-independent phospholipase A2\u03b3 and Taz, we concluded that the 2 processes - CL oxidation and CL hydrolysis - act as mutually synergistically enhancing components of the pathogenic mechanism of mitochondrial injury in traumatic brain injury.

In mammalian cells and tissues, ferroptosis has been pathogenically associated with brain, kidney, and liver injury/diseases. We discovered that a prokaryotic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that does not contain AA-PE can express lipoxygenase (pLoxA), oxidize host AA-PE to 15-hydroperoxy-AA-PE (15-HOO-AA-PE), and trigger ferroptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells. Induction of ferroptosis by clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with persistent lower respiratory tract infections was dependent on the level and enzymatic activity of pLoxA. Redox phospholipidomics revealed elevated levels of oxidized AA-PE in airway tissues from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) but not with emphysema or CF without P. aeruginosa.

"The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes plays a crucial role in cellular and molecular processes including DNA damage detection and repair and transcription; indeed, PARP inhibitors are under clinical evaluation as chemotherapeutic adjuncts given their capacity to impede genomic DNA repair in tumor cells. Conversely, overactivation of PARP can lead to NAD+ depletion, mitochondrial energy failure, and cell death. Since PARP activation facilitates genomic but impedes mitochondrial DNA repair, nonselective PARP inhibitors are likely to have opposing effects in these cellular compartments. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of the mitochondria-targeting PARP inhibitor, XJB-veliparib. Attachment of the hemigramicidin S pentapeptide isostere for mitochondrial targeting using a flexible linker at the primary amide site of veliparib did not disrupt PARP affinity or inhibition. XJB-veliparib was effective at low nanomolar concentrations (10-100 nM) and more potent than veliparib in protection from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in primary cortical neurons. Both XJB-veliparib and veliparib (10 nM) preserved mitochondrial NAD+ after OGD; however, only XJB-veliparib prevented release of NAD+ into cytosol. XJB-veliparib (10 nM) appeared to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymer formation in mitochondria and preserve mitochondrial cytoarchitecture after OGD in primary cortical neurons. After 10 nM exposure, XJB-veliparib was detected by LC-MS in mitochondria but not nuclear-enriched fractions in neurons and was observed in mitoplasts stripped of the outer mitochondrial membrane obtained from HT22 cells. XJB-veliparib was also effective at preventing glutamate-induced HT22 cell death at micromolar concentrations. Importantly, in HT22 cells exposed to H2O2 to produce DNA damage, XJB-veliparib (10 \u03bcM) had no effect on nuclear DNA repair, in contrast to veliparib (10 \u03bcM) where DNA repair was retarded. XJB-veliparib and analogous mitochondria-targeting PARP inhibitors warrant further evaluation in vitro and in vivo, particularly in conditions where PARP overactivation leads to mitochondrial energy failure and maintenance of genomic DNA integrity is desirable, e.g., ischemia, oxidative stress, and radiation exposure.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Benzimidazoles", "Cell Death", "Cell Line", "DNA Repair", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "NAD", "Neurons", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Oligopeptides", "Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tanja", "Last Name": "Krainz", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew M", "Last Name": "Lamade", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, Safar Center for Resuscitation Research , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, Safar Center for Resuscitation Research , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Taber S", "Last Name": "Maskrey", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Calderon", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Center for Biologic Imaging , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Simon C", "Last Name": "Watkins", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Center for Biologic Imaging , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael W", "Last Name": "Epperly", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Institute , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15232 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Joel S", "Last Name": "Greenberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Institute , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15232 , United States."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, Safar Center for Resuscitation Research , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Wipf", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}, {"First Name": "Robert S B", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, Safar Center for Resuscitation Research , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , United States."}], "Journal": "ACS chemical biology", "PubDate": "2018Oct19"}, {"PMID": "30009835", "Title": "Aiming for the target: Mitochondrial drug delivery in traumatic brain injury.", "Abstract": "Mitochondria are a keystone of neuronal function, serving a dual role as sustainer of life and harbinger of death. While mitochondria are indispensable for energy production, a dysregulated mitochondrial network can spell doom for both neurons and the functions they provide. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex and biphasic injury, often affecting children and young adults. The primary pathological mechanism of TBI is mechanical, too rapid to be mitigated by anything but prevention. However, the secondary injury of TBI evolves over hours and days after the initial insult providing a window of opportunity for intervention. As a nexus point of both survival and death during this second phase, targeting mitochondrial pathology in TBI has long been an attractive strategy. Often these attempts are mired by efficacy-limiting unintended off-target effects. Specific delivery to and enrichment of therapeutics at their submitochondrial site of action can reduce deleterious effects and increase potency. Mitochondrial drug localization is accomplished using (1) the mitochondrial membrane potential, (2) affinity of a carrier to mitochondria-specific components (e.g. lipids), (3) piggybacking on the cells own mitochondria trafficking systems, or (4) nanoparticle-based approaches.

Here, we identify withaferin A (WA) as a natural ferroptosis-inducing agent in neuroblastoma, which acts through a novel double-edged mechanism. WA dose-dependently either activates the nuclear factor-like 2 pathway through targeting of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (noncanonical ferroptosis induction) or inactivates glutathione peroxidase 4 (canonical ferroptosis induction). Noncanonical ferroptosis induction is characterized by an increase in intracellular labile Fe(II) upon excessive activation of heme oxygenase-1, which is sufficient to induce ferroptosis.

Newly synthesized CL undergoes acyl remodeling to produce CL species enriched with unsaturated acyl groups. Cld1 is the only identified CL-specific phospholipase in yeast and is required to initiate the CL remodeling pathway. In higher eukaryotes, peroxidation of CL, yielding CLOX, has been implicated in the cellular signaling events that initiate apoptosis. CLOX can undergo enzymatic hydrolysis, resulting in the release of lipid mediators with signaling properties. Our previous findings suggested that CLD1 expression is upregulated in response to oxidative stress, and that one of the physiological roles of CL remodeling is to remove peroxidized CL. To exploit the powerful yeast model to study functions of CLD1 in CL peroxidation, we expressed the H. brasiliensis \u039412-desaturase gene in yeast, which then synthesized poly unsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) that are incorporated into CL species. Using LC-MS based redox phospholipidomics, we identified and quantified the molecular species of CL and other phospholipids in cld1\u0394 vs. WT cells. Loss of CLD1 led to a dramatic decrease in chronological lifespan, mitochondrial membrane potential, and respiratory capacity; it also resulted in increased levels of mono-hydroperoxy-CLs, particularly among the highly unsaturated CL species, including tetralinoleoyl-CL. In addition, purified Cld1 exhibited a higher affinity for CLOX, and treatment of cells with H2O2 increased CLD1 expression in the logarithmic growth phase. These data suggest that CLD1 expression is required to mitigate oxidative stress.

Traditional neuroimaging findings in children who sustain mTBI are often normal, putting them at risk for repeated mTBI (rmTBI). There is a need for more sensitive imaging techniques capable of detecting subtle neurophysiological alterations after injury. We examined neurochemical and white matter changes using diffusion tensor imaging of the whole brain and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the hippocampi at 7 Tesla in 18-day-old male rats at 7 days after mTBI and rmTBI. Traumatic axonal injury was assessed by beta-amyloid precursor protein accumulation using immunohistochemistry. A significant decrease in fractional anisotropy and increase in axial and radial diffusivity were observed in several brain regions, especially in white matter regions, after a single mTBI versus sham and more prominently after rmTBI. In addition, we observed accumulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein in the external capsule after mTBI and rmTBI. mTBI and rmTBI reduced the N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio (NAA/Cr) and increased the myoinositol/creatine ratio (Ins/Cr) versus sham. rmTBI exacerbated the reduction in NAA/Cr versus mTBI. The choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) and (lipid/Macro Molecule 1)/creatine (Lip/Cr) ratios were also decreased after rmTBI versus sham. Diffusion tensor imaging findings along with the decrease in Cho and Lip after rmTBI may reflect damage to axonal membrane. NAA and Ins are altered at 7 days after mTBI and rmTBI likely reflecting neuro-axonal damage and glial response, respectively.

A computational model of coupled apoptosis and autophagy is built here to analyze the underlying signaling and regulatory network dynamics. The model explains the experimentally observed differential deployment of autophagy and apoptosis in response to various stress signals. Autophagic response dominates at low-to-moderate stress; whereas the response shifts from autophagy (graded activation) to apoptosis (switch-like activation) with increasing stress intensity. The model reveals that cytoplasmic Ca2+ acts as a rheostat that fine-tunes autophagic and apoptotic responses. A G-protein signaling-mediated feedback loop maintains cytoplasmic Ca2+ level, which in turn governs autophagic response through an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated feedforward loop. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase \u03b2 (CaMKK\u03b2) emerges as a determinant of the competing roles of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in autophagy regulation.

Inadequate reduction of hydroperoxy-PE due to insufficiency or dysfunction of a selenoperoxidase, GPX4, leads to ferroptosis.

Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents an ancient vulnerability caused by the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cellular membranes, and cells have developed complex systems that exploit and defend against this vulnerability in different contexts. The sensitivity to ferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including amino acid, iron, and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of glutathione, phospholipids, NADPH, and coenzyme Q10. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological cell death associated with degenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases), carcinogenesis, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and kidney degeneration in mammals and is also implicated in heat stress in plants.

We investigated the role of the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline in attenuating HMGB1 translocation, microglial activation, and neuronal injury in a rat model of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). Post-natal day 17 Sprague-Dawley rats underwent moderate-severe controlled cortical impact (CCI). Animals were randomized to treatment with minocycline (90\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or vehicle (saline) at 10\u2009min and 20\u2009h after injury. Shams received anesthesia and craniotomy. We analyzed HMGB1 translocation (protein fractionation and Western blotting), microglial activation (Iba-1 immunohistochemistry), neuronal death (Fluoro-Jade-B [FJB] immunofluorescence), and neuronal cell counts (unbiased stereology). Behavioral assessments included motor and Morris-water maze testing. Nuclear to cytosolic translocation of HMGB1 in the injured brain was attenuated in minocycline versus vehicle-treated rats at 24\u2009h (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

The pathophysiology of TBI is complex involving signaling through multiple cascades, including lipid peroxidation. Oxidized free fatty acids, a prominent product of lipid peroxidation, are potent cellular mediators involved in induction and resolution of inflammation and modulation of vasomotor tone. While previous studies have assessed lipid peroxidation after TBI, to our knowledge no studies have used a systematic approach to quantify the global oxidative changes in free fatty acids. In this study, we identified and quantified 244 free fatty acid oxidation products using a newly developed global liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. This methodology was used to follow the time course of these lipid species in the contusional cortex of our pediatric rat model of TBI. We show that oxidation peaked at 1h after controlled cortical impact and was progressively attenuated at 4 and 24h time points. While enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways were activated at 1h post-TBI, enzymatic lipid peroxidation was the predominant mechanism with 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) contributing to the majority of total oxidized fatty acid content. Pro-inflammatory lipid mediators were significantly increased at 1 and 4h after TBI with return to basal levels by 24h. Anti-inflammatory lipid mediators remained significantly increased across all three time points, indicating an elevated and sustained anti-inflammatory response following TBI.", "Keywords": ["Cardiolipin", "Docosanoids", "Eicosanoids", "Lipid peroxidation", "Octadecanoids", "Pro-resolving mediators"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase", "Brain", "Brain Chemistry", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Fatty Acids, Nonesterified", "Inflammation Mediators", "Male", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Oxidative Stress", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tamil S", "Last Name": "Anthonymuthu", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States; Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, United States; Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth M", "Last Name": "Kenny", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States; Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, United States; Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Amoscato", "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jesse", "Last Name": "Lewis", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States; Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, United States; Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States."}, {"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States; Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, United States; Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, United States."}, {"First Name": "Valerian E", "Last Name": "Kagan", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States; Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, United States; Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, United States; Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, United States.

A combination of enzymatic and chemical treatments was employed to suppress the signals from the most abundant phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) and enhance the signals from the low-abundance CLs and gangliosides to allow their GCIB-SIMS detection at 8 and 16 \u03bcm spatial resolution. Brain CLs have not been observed previously using other contemporary imaging mass spectrometry techniques at better than 50 \u03bcm spatial resolution. High-resolution images of naive and injured brain tissue facilitated the comparison of CL species across three multicell layers in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus. GCIB-SIMS also reliably mapped losses of oxidizable polyunsaturated CL species (but not the oxidation-resistant saturated and monounsaturated gangliosides) to regions including the CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus after CCI. This work extends the detection range for SIMS measurements of intact lipids to above m/z 2000, bridging the mass range gap compared with MALDI.

Recent advances in neuroimmunology and TBI-responsive neuroinflammation are incorporated, including concepts of inflammasomes, mechanisms of microglial polarization, and glymphatic clearance.

An unresolved paradox is the high uniformity of CL molecular species (tetra-linoleoyl-CL) in the heart, liver, and skeletal muscles-in contrast to their high diversification in the brain. Here, we combined liquid chromatography-mass-spectrometry-based phospholipidomics with genetic and nutritional manipulations to explore CLs' biosynthetic vs postsynthetic remodeling processes in S. cerevisiae yeast cells. By applying the differential phospholipidomics analysis, we evaluated the contribution of Cld1 (CL-specific phospholipase A) and Taz1 (acyl-transferase) as the major regulatory mechanisms of the remodeling process. We further established that nutritional \"pressure\" by high levels of free fatty acids triggered a massive synthesis of homoacylated molecular species in all classes of phospholipids, resulting in the preponderance of the respective homoacylated CLs. We found that changes in molecular speciation of CLs induced by exogenous C18-fatty acids (C18:1 and C18:2) in wild-type (wt) cells did not occur in any of the remodeling mutant cells, including cld1\u0394, taz1\u0394, and cld1\u0394taz1\u0394. Interestingly, molecular speciation of CLs in wt and double mutant cells cld1\u0394taz1\u0394 was markedly different. Given that the bioenergetics functions are preserved in the double mutant, this suggests that the accumulated MLCL-rather than the changed CL speciation-are the likely major contributors to the mitochondrial dysfunction in taz1\u0394 mutant cells (also characteristic of Barth syndrome).

Markers of acute physiology, including mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), blood gases/chemistries, and brain oxygenation (PbtO2), were monitored for 90\u2009min on room air followed by 15\u2009min on 100% oxygen. In a second experiment, the protocol was repeated, except mice were resuscitated with PNPH with doses between 2 and 100\u2009mL/kg. ICP and 24\u2009h %-brain water were evaluated. PNPH-resuscitated mice had higher MAP and lower HR post-resuscitation versus blood or LR (p\u2009<\u20090.01). PNPH-resuscitated mice, versus those resuscitated with blood or LR, also had higher pH and lower serum potassium (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Blood-resuscitated mice, however, had higher PbtO2 versus those resuscitated with LR and PNPH, although PNPH had higher PbtO2 versus LR (p\u2009<\u20090.05). PNPH was well tolerated across the dosing range and dramatically reduced fluid requirements in all doses-even 2 or 5\u2009mL/kg (p\u2009<\u20090.001). ICP was significantly lower in PNPH-treated mice for most doses tested versus in LR-treated mice, although %-brain water did not differ between groups. Resuscitation with PNPH, versus resuscitation with LR or blood, improved MAP, HR, and ICP, reduced acidosis and hyperkalemia, and was well tolerated and effective across a wide dosing range, supporting ongoing pre-clinical development of PNPH for TBI resuscitation.", "Keywords": ["brain edema", "intracranial pressure", "secondary insult", "traumatic brain injury"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Transfusion, Autologous", "Brain Edema", "Brain Injuries, Traumatic", "Cattle", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Hemoglobins", "Isotonic Solutions", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Resuscitation", "Ringer's Lactate", "Shock, Hemorrhagic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erik C", "Last Name": "Brockman", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Travis C", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "C Edward", "Last Name": "Dixon", "Affiliation": "2 Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u026ar", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Robert S B", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Vagni", "Affiliation": "2 Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Keri", "Last Name": "Feldman", "Affiliation": "2 Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Byrd", "Affiliation": "2 Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "6 Department of Physics, Georgia Southern University , Statesboro, Georgia ."}, {"First Name": "Carleton", "Last Name": "Hsia", "Affiliation": "7 SynZyme Technologies , LLC, Irvine, California."}, {"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "1 Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "PubDate": "2017Apr01"}, {"PMID": "27842070", "Title": "ACSL4 dictates ferroptosis sensitivity by shaping cellular lipid composition.", "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death controlled by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4).

Mitochondrial ROS generation was quantified by live neuronal imaging using mitoSOX. Nitrite significantly reduced neurologic disability after ACA.

Mitochondrial signaling strongly depends on cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondria-specific structurally unusual anionic phospholipid containing four fatty acyl chains.

Here, we present a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging study which reports regio-specific changes in CL, in a controlled cortical impact model of TBI in rats. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging revealed that TBI caused early decreases in CL in the contusional cortex, ipsilateral hippocampus, and thalamus with the most highly unsaturated CL species being most susceptible to loss. Phosphatidylinositol was the only other lipid species that exhibited a significant decrease, albeit to a lesser extent than CL. Signals for other lipids remained unchanged. This\u00a0is the first study evaluating the spatial distribution of CL loss after acute brain injury.

However, the roles of redox vs lipid regulators of Cygb's structural rearrangements in the context of the protein peroxidase competence are not known. Searching for physiologically relevant lipid regulators of Cygb, here we report that anionic phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositolphosphates, affect structural organization of the protein and modulate its iron state and peroxidase activity both conjointly and/or independently of cysteine oxidation. Thus, different anionic lipids can operate in cysteine-dependent and cysteine-independent ways as inducers of the peroxidase activity. We establish that Cygb's peroxidase activity can be utilized for the catalysis of peroxidation of anionic phospholipids (including phosphatidylinositolphosphates) yielding mono-oxygenated molecular species.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the phospholipids are often the targets for peroxidation. Phospholipids are indispensable for normal structure of membranes. The other important function of phospholipids stems from their role as a source of lipid mediators - oxygenated free fatty acids that are derived from lipid peroxidation. In the CNS, excessive accumulation of either oxidized phospholipids or oxygenated free fatty acids may be associated with damage occurring during acute brain injury and subsequent inflammatory responses. There is a growing body of evidence that lipid peroxidation occurs after severe traumatic brain injury in humans and correlates with the injury severity and mortality. Identification of the products and sources of lipid peroxidation and its enzymatic or non-enzymatic nature is essential for the design of mechanism-based therapies. Recent progress in mass spectrometry-based lipidomics/oxidative lipidomics offers remarkable opportunities for quantitative characterization of lipid peroxidation products, providing guidance for targeted development of specific therapeutic modalities. In this review, we critically evaluate previous attempts to use non-specific antioxidants as neuroprotectors and emphasize new approaches based on recent breakthroughs in understanding of enzymatic mechanisms of lipid peroxidation associated with specific death pathways, particularly apoptosis. We also emphasize the role of different phospholipases (calcium-dependent and -independent) in hydrolysis of peroxidized phospholipids and generation of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators.

The direct effects of ionizing radiation are realized primarily via apoptotic death pathways in rapidly proliferating cells within the initial 1-2days after the exposure. However later in the course of the radiation disease necrotic cell death may ensue via direct and indirect pathways from increased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we evaluated radiomitigative potential of necrostatin-1 after total body irradiation (TBI) and the contribution of necroptosis to cell death induced by radiation. Circulating TNF\u03b1 levels were increased starting on d1 after TBI and associated with increased plasmalemma permeability in ileum of irradiated mice. Necrostatin-1 given iv. 48h after 9.5Gy TBI attenuated radiation-induced receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) serine phosphorylation in ileum and improved survival vs. vehicle. Utilizing apoptosis resistant cytochrome c(-/-) cells, we showed that radiation can induce necroptosis, which is attenuated by RNAi knock down of RIPK1 and RIPK3 or by treatment with necrostatin-1 or -1s whereas 1-methyl-L-tryptophan, an indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor, did not exhibit radiomitigative effect. This suggests that the beneficial effect of necrostatin-1 is likely through inhibition of RIPK1-mediated necroptotic pathway. Overall, our data indicate that necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis, may play a significant role in cell death contributing to radiation disease and mortality. This study provides a proof of principle that necrostatin-1 and perhaps other RIPK1 inhibitors are promising therapeutic agents for radiomitigation after TBI.", "Keywords": ["7-Cl-O-Nec-1", "IL-17", "IL-1\u03b1", "IL-6", "Mitigation", "Propidium iodide"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Female", "Gamma Rays", "Imidazoles", "Indoles", "Mice", "Radiation Injuries, Experimental", "Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Whole-Body Irradiation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zhentai", "Last Name": "Huang", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, United States."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Epperly", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, United States."}, {"First Name": "Simon C", "Last Name": "Watkins", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologic Imaging, Department of Cell Biology, University of Pittsburgh, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joel S", "Last Name": "Greenberger", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, United States."}, {"First Name": "Valerian E", "Last Name": "Kagan", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, United States."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, United States; Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, United States; Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, United States.

Cardiolipin is normally localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane; however, when cardiolipin becomes externalized to the surface of dysregulated mitochondria, it promotes inflammasome activation and stimulates the elimination of damaged or nonfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy. Given the immunogenicity of mitochondrial and bacterial membranes that are released during sterile and pathogen-induced trauma, we hypothesized that cardiolipins might function as \"eat me\" signals for professional phagocytes. In experiments with macrophage cell lines and primary macrophages, we found that membranes with mitochondrial or bacterial cardiolipins on their surface were engulfed through phagocytosis, which depended on the scavenger receptor CD36. Distinct from this process, the copresentation of cardiolipin with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide dampened TLR4-stimulated production of cytokines. These data suggest that externalized, extracellular cardiolipins play a dual role in host-host and host-pathogen interactions by promoting phagocytosis and attenuating inflammatory immune responses.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["CD36 Antigens", "Cardiolipins", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Humans", "Macrophages", "Phagocytosis", "Signal Transduction", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Krishnakumar", "Last Name": "Balasubramanian", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA. kris.balasub@gmail.com bengt.fadeel@ki.se kagan@pitt.edu."}, {"First Name": "Akihiro", "Last Name": "Maeda", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Toxicology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm 171 77, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Janet S", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dariush", "Last Name": "Mohammadyani", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haider Hussain", "Last Name": "Dar", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian Fei", "Last Name": "Jiang", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA."}, {"First Name": "Claudette M", "Last Name": "St Croix", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologic Imaging, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Watkins", "Affiliation": "Center for Biologic Imaging, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vladimir A", "Last Name": "Tyurin", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yulia Y", "Last Name": "Tyurina", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA."}, {"First Name": "Katharina", "Last Name": "Kl\u00f6ditz", "Affiliation": "Division of Molecular Toxicology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm 171 77, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Anastassia", "Last Name": "Polimova", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentyna I", "Last Name": "Kapralova", "Affiliation": "Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zeyu", "Last Name": "Xiong", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA."}, {"First Name": "Prabir", "Last Name": "Ray", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA."}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Klein-Seetharaman", "Affiliation": "Division of Metabolic and Vascular Health, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK."}, {"First Name": "Rama K", "Last Name": "Mallampalli", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Acute Lung Injury Center of Excellence, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.

We have previously shown that LMNB1 gene duplications cause autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD), a fatal adult onset demyelinating disease. The mechanisms by which increased LMNB1 levels cause ADLD are unclear. To address this, we used a transgenic mouse model where Lamin B1 overexpression is targeted to oligodendrocytes. These mice showed severe vacuolar degeneration of the spinal cord white matter together with marked astrogliosis, microglial infiltration, and secondary axonal damage. Oligodendrocytes in the transgenic mice revealed alterations in histone modifications favoring a transcriptionally repressed state. Chromatin changes were accompanied by reduced expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis pathways, many of which are known to play important roles in myelin regulation and are preferentially expressed in oligodendrocytes. Decreased lipogenic gene expression resulted in a significant reduction in multiple classes of lipids involved in myelin formation. Many of these gene expression changes and lipid alterations were observed even before the onset of the phenotype, suggesting a causal role. Our findings establish, for the first time, a link between LMNB1 and lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes, and provide a mechanistic framework to explain the age dependence and white matter involvement of the disease phenotype. These results have implications for disease pathogenesis and may also shed light on the regulation of lipid synthesis pathways in myelin maintenance and turnover.", "Keywords": ["Lamin B1",

accumulating evidence suggests that repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI) may cause long-term cognitive dysfunction in adults, whether rmTBI causes similar deficits in the immature brain is unknown. Here we used an experimental model of rmTBI in the immature brain to answer this question. Post-natal day (PND) 18 rats were subjected to either one, two, or three mild TBIs (mTBI) or an equivalent number of sham insults 24\u2009h apart. After one or two mTBIs or sham insults, histology was evaluated at 7 days. After three mTBIs or sham insults, motor (d1-5), cognitive (d11-92), and histological (d21-92) outcome was evaluated. At 7 days, silver degeneration staining revealed axonal argyrophilia in the external capsule and corpus callosum after a single mTBI, with a second impact increasing axonal injury. Iba-1 immunohistochemistry showed amoeboid shaped microglia within the amygdalae bilaterally after mTBI. After three mTBI, there were no differences in beam balance, Morris water maze, and elevated plus maze performance versus sham. The rmTBI rats, however, showed impairment in novel object recognition and fear conditioning. Axonal silver staining was observed only in the external capsule on d21. Iba-1 staining did not reveal activated microglia on d21 or d92. In conclusion, mTBI results in traumatic axonal injury and microglial activation in the immature brain with repeated impact exacerbating axonal injury. The rmTBI in the immature brain leads to long-term associative learning deficit in adulthood.

Intriguingly, cerebellar Purkinje cells are highly vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia (HI), related at least in part to their high metabolic activity. Whether or not excessive or supraphysiologic autophagy plays a role in Purkinje cell susceptibility to HI is unknown. Accordingly, we evaluated the role of autophagy in the cerebellum after global ischemia produced by asphyxial cardiac arrest in postnatal day (PND) 16-18 rats, using siRNA-targeted inhibition of Atg7, necessary for microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Atg12-Atg5 complex formation. Two days before a 9min asphyxial cardiac arrest or sham surgery, Atg7 or control siRNA was injected intracisternally to target the cerebellum. Treatment with Atg7 siRNA: 1) reduced Atg7 protein expression in the cerebellum by 56%; 2) prevented the typical ischemia-induced formation of LC3-II in the cerebellum 24h after asphyxial cardiac arrest; 3) improved performance on the beam-balance apparatus on days 1-5; and 4) increased calbindin-labeled Purkinje cell survival assessed on day 14. Improved Purkinje cell survival was more consistent in female vs. male rats, and improved beam-balance performance was only seen in female rats. Similar responses to Atg7 siRNA i.e. reduced autophagy and neurodegeneration vs. control siRNA were seen when exposing sex-segregated green fluorescent protein-LC3 tagged mouse primary cortical neurons to oxygen glucose deprivation in vitro. Thus, inhibition of autophagy after global ischemia in PND 16-18 rats leads to increased survival of Purkinje cells and improved motor performance in a sex-dependent manner.", "Keywords": ["Asphyxia", "Atg7", "Cardiac arrest", "Cerebellum", "Hypoxia\u2013ischemia", "Ischemic brain injury", "Oxygen glucose deprivation", "Purkinje neuron", "Small interfering RNA"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alicia K", "Last Name": "Au", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaming", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lina", "Last Name": "Du", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Craig M", "Last Name": "Smith", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mioara D", "Last Name": "Manole", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Sirine A", "Last Name": "Baltagi", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charleen T", "Last Name": "Chu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajesh K", "Last Name": "Aneja", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Center for Free Radical and Antioxidant Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert S B", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

We used a model of global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion characterized by 9\u2009minutes of asphyxia leading to asystole followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation in postnatal day 17 rats. Global ischemia and cardiopulmonary resuscitation resulted in: (1) selective oxidation and hydrolysis of CLs, (2) accumulation of lyso-CLs and oxygenated free FAs, (3) activation of caspase 3/7 in the brain, and (4) motor and cognitive dysfunction. On the basis of these findings, we used a mitochondria targeted nitroxide electron scavenger, which prevented CL oxidation and subsequent hydrolysis, attenuated caspase activation, and improved neurocognitive outcome when administered after cardiac arrest.

Essential in this signalling process is an array of lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the molecular machinery for the production of oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids is localized in the cytosol and their biosynthesis has not been identified in mitochondria. Here we report that a range of diversified polyunsaturated molecular species derived from a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), is oxidized by the intermembrane-space haemoprotein, cytochrome c. We show that a number of oxygenated CL species undergo phospholipase A2-catalysed hydrolysis and thus generate multiple oxygenated fatty acids, including well-known lipid mediators. This represents a new biosynthetic pathway for lipid mediators. We demonstrate that this pathway, which includes the oxidation of polyunsaturated CLs and accumulation of their hydrolysis products (oxygenated linoleic, arachidonic acids and monolysocardiolipins),

As this oxidation occurs within the peroxidase complex of Cyt c with CL, the latter represents a promising target for the discovery and design of drugs with antiapoptotic mechanisms of action. In this work, we designed and synthesized a new group of mitochondria-targeted imidazole-substituted analogs of stearic acid TPP-n-ISAs with various positions of the attached imidazole group on the fatty acid (n = 6, 8, 10, 13, and 14). By using a combination of absorption spectroscopy and EPR protocols (continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance and electron spin echo envelope modulation) we demonstrated that TPP-n-ISAs indeed were able to potently suppress CL-induced structural rearrangements in Cyt c, paving the way to its peroxidase competence. TPP-n-ISA analogs preserved the low-spin hexa-coordinated heme-iron state in Cyt c/CL complexes whereby TPP-6-ISA displayed a significantly more effective preservation pattern than TPP-14-ISA.

Due to their postmitotic nature and metabolic dependence on mitochondria, either insufficient or unchecked mitophagy is detrimental to neurons. To better understand signals that regulate this process, we treated primary rat cortical neurons with the electron transport chain complex I inhibitor rotenone to elicit mitophagy. The lipidomic profiles of mitochondria from control or injured neurons were analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing a significant redistribution of cardiolipin (CL) from the inner mitochondrial membrane to the outer mitochondrial surface. Direct liposome-binding studies, computational modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis indicate that microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3/LC3), a defining protein of autophagic membranes, binds to CL. Preventing this interaction inhibits rotenone-induced mitochondrial delivery to autophagosomes and lysosomes and attenuates mitochondrial loss as assessed by western blot. The CL-LC3 interaction is also important for mitophagy induced by other stimuli including 6-hydroxydopamine, another chemical model of Parkinson disease.

Small molecule pan-PHLPP inhibitors (selective for PHLPP1 and PHLPP2) may offer a translatable method to induce AKT neuroprotection. We tested several recently discovered PHLPP inhibitors (NSC117079 and NSC45586; benzoic acid, 5-[2-[4-[2-(2,4-diamino-5-methylphenyl)diazenyl]phenyl]diazenyl]-2-hydroxy-,sodium salt.) in rat cortical neurons and astrocytes and compared the biochemical response of these agents with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated PHLPP1 knockdown (KD). In neurons, both PHLPP1 KD and experimental PHLPP inhibitors activated AKT and ameliorated staurosporine (STS)-induced cell death. Unexpectedly, in astrocytes, both inhibitors blocked AKT activation, and NSC117079 reduced viability. Only PHLPP2 KD mimicked PHLPP inhibitors on astrocyte biochemistry. This suggests that these inhibitors could have possible detrimental effects on astrocytes by blocking novel PHLPP2-mediated prosurvival signaling mechanisms. Finally, because PHLPP1 levels are reportedly high in the hippocampus (a region prone to ischemic death), we characterized hippocampal changes in PHLPP and several AKT targeting prodeath phosphatases after cardiac arrest (CA)-induced brain injury. PHLPP1 levels increased in rat brains subjected to CA. None of the other AKT inhibitory phosphatases increased after global ischemia (i.e., PHLPP2, PTEN, PP2A, and PP1). Selective PHLPP1 inhibition (such as by shRNA KD) activates AKT survival signaling in neurons and astrocytes. Nonspecific PHLPP inhibition (by NSC117079 and NSC45586) only activates AKT in neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that selective PHLPP1 inhibitors should be developed and may yield optimal strategies to protect injured hippocampal neurons and astrocytes-namely from global brain ischemia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Anthraquinones", "Astrocytes", "Azo Compounds", "Brain Ischemia", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Survival", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "HEK293 Cells", "Heart Arrest", "Humans", "Molecular Structure", "Neurons", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phenylenediamines", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction", "Sulfonamides"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Travis C", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Safar Center for Resuscitation Research (T.C.J., P.M.K., H.B., R.S.C, K.J.F., C.D., T.U.) and Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology (J.D.V., D.G.G., E.K.J.),University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Department of Anesthesiology, Presbyterian Hospital (T.D.), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan D", "Last Name": "Verrier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Drabek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Keri", "Last Name": "Janesko-Feldman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Delbert G", "Last Name": "Gillespie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Uray", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cameron", "Last Name": "Dezfulian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bayir", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edwin K", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "PubDate": "2013Nov"}, {"PMID": "23801241", "Title": "Polynitroxylated-pegylated hemoglobin attenuates fluid requirements and brain edema in combined traumatic brain injury plus hemorrhagic shock in mice.", "Abstract": "Polynitroxylated-pegylated hemoglobin (PNPH), a bovine hemoglobin decorated with nitroxide and polyethylene glycol moieties, showed neuroprotection vs. lactated Ringer's (LR) in experimental traumatic brain injury plus hemorrhagic shock (TBI+HS).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blood Substitutes", "Brain Edema", "Brain Injuries", "Cattle", "Hemoglobins", "Intracranial Pressure", "Mice", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Resuscitation", "Shock, Hemorrhagic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Erik C", "Last Name": "Brockman", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 3434 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA."}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Brian", "Last Name": "Blasiole", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven L", "Last Name": "Shein", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ericka L", "Last Name": "Fink", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cedward", "Last Name": "Dixon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S B", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vincent A", "Last Name": "Vagni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Li", "Last Name": "Ma", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carleton J C", "Last Name": "Hsia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel A", "Last Name": "Tisherman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism", "PubDate": "2013Sep"}, {"PMID": "23637695", "Title": "The potential for bio-mediators and biomarkers in pediatric traumatic brain injury and neurocritical care.", "Abstract": "The use of biomarkers of brain injury in pediatric neurocritical care has been explored for at least 15\u2009years. Two general lines of research on biomarkers in pediatric brain injury have been pursued: (1) studies of \"bio-mediators\" in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children after traumatic brain injury (TBI) to explore the components of the secondary injury cascades in an attempt to identify potential therapeutic targets and (2) studies of the release of structural proteins into the CSF, serum, or urine in order to diagnose, monitor, and/or prognosticate in patients with TBI or other pediatric neurocritical care conditions. Unique age-related differences in brain biology, disease processes, and clinical applications mandate the development and testing of brain injury bio-mediators and biomarkers specifically in pediatric neurocritical care applications. Finally, although much of the early work on biomarkers of brain injury in pediatrics has focused on TBI, new applications are emerging across a wide range of conditions specifically for pediatric neurocritical care including abusive head trauma, cardiopulmonary arrest, septic shock, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, hydrocephalus, and cardiac surgery. The potential scope of the utility of biomarkers in pediatric neurocritical care is thus also discussed.", "Keywords": ["GFAP", "S100\u03b2", "UCH-L1", "abusive head trauma", "cerebrospinal fluid", "myelin basic protein", "neuron specific enolase", "shaken baby syndrome"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rachel P", "Last Name": "Berger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ericka L", "Last Name": "Fink", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alicia K", "Last Name": "Au", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael J", "Last Name": "Bell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C Edward", "Last Name": "Dixon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S B", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23496248", "Title": "Screening of biochemical and molecular mechanisms of secondary injury and repair in the brain after experimental blast-induced traumatic brain injury in rats.", "Abstract": "Abstract Explosive blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the signature insult in modern combat casualty care and has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder, memory loss, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In this article we report on blast-induced mild TBI (mTBI) characterized by fiber-tract degeneration and axonal injury revealed by cupric silver staining in adult male rats after head-only exposure to 35 psi in a helium-driven shock tube with head restraint. We now explore pathways of secondary injury and repair using biochemical/molecular strategies. Injury produced \u223c25% mortality from apnea. Shams received identical anesthesia exposure. Rats were sacrificed at 2 or 24 h, and brain was sampled in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Hippocampal samples were used to assess gene array (RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip; Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) and oxidative stress (OS; ascorbate, glutathione, low-molecular-weight thiols [LMWT], protein thiols, and 4-hydroxynonenal [HNE]). Cortical samples were used to assess neuroinflammation (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) and purines (adenosine triphosphate [ATP], adenosine diphosphate, adenosine, inosine, 2'-AMP [adenosine monophosphate], and 5'-AMP). Gene array revealed marked increases in astrocyte and neuroinflammatory markers at 24 h (glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and complement component 1) with expression patterns bioinformatically consistent with those noted in Alzheimer's disease and long-term potentiation. Ascorbate, LMWT, and protein thiols were reduced at 2 and 24 h; by 24 h, HNE was increased. At 2 h, multiple cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha [MIP-1\u03b1]) were increased; by 24 h, only MIP-1\u03b1 remained elevated. ATP was not depleted, and adenosine correlated with 2'-cyclic AMP (cAMP), and not 5'-cAMP. Our data reveal (1) gene-array alterations similar to disorders of memory processing and a marked astrocyte response, (2) OS, (3) neuroinflammation with a sustained chemokine response, and (4) adenosine production despite lack of energy failure-possibly resulting from metabolism of 2'-3'-cAMP. A robust biochemical/molecular response occurs after blast-induced mTBI, with the body protected from blast and the head constrained to limit motion.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Blast Injuries", "Brain Injuries", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Male", "Nerve Degeneration", "Nerve Regeneration", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Transcriptome"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Patrick M", "Last Name": "Kochanek", "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, USA. kochanekpm@ccm.upmc.edu"}, {"First Name": "C Edward", "Last Name": "Dixon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David K", "Last Name": "Shellington", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Samuel S", "Last Name": "Shin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H\u00fclya", "Last Name": "Bay\u0131r", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Edwin K", "Last Name": "Jackson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Valerian E", "Last Name": "Kagan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hong Q", "Last Name": "Yan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter V", "Last Name": "Swauger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Parks", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David V", "Last Name": "Ritzel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Bauman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert S B", "Last Name": "Clark", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert H", "Last Name": "Garman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Faris", "Last Name": "Bandak", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Geoffrey", "Last Name": "Ling", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Larry W", "Last Name": "Jenkins", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of neurotrauma", "PubDate": "2013Jun01"}]
