Chromosomes affected by aneuploidy are not random, with observed cancer-specific and tissue-specific patterns. Recent advances in genome engineering methods have allowed the creation of models with targeted aneuploidy events. These models can be used to uncover the downstream effects of individual aneuploidies on cancer phenotypes including proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and immune signaling.

CIN causes aneuploidy, a state of abnormal chromosome content differing from a multiple of the haploid. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-known cause of squamous cancers of the oropharynx, cervix, and anus. The HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes have well-known roles in carcinogenesis, but additional genomic events, such as CIN and aneuploidy, are often required for tumor formation. HPV+ squamous cancers have an increased frequency of specific types of CIN, including polar chromosomes. CIN leads to chromosome gains and losses (aneuploidies) specific to HPV+ cancers, which are distinct from HPV- cancers. HPV-specific CIN and aneuploidy may have implications for prognosis and therapeutic response and may provide insight into novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Students speak about campus employment.", "Abstract": "Balancing part-time work and studies has become commonplace for university students in Canada and other countries where the costs of education have risen over time. While there is a substantial literature on the impacts of term-time work on studies, little has been written about campus employment programs, which are becoming more commonplace in North American universities. This paper addresses this gap by considering students' experiences in such a program at a western Canadian university. Focusing primarily on qualitative data from a longitudinal study, we examine the various reasons for the attractiveness of this program, which go beyond the promise of professional, career-related work experience. Our analysis draws on the academic literature on work-study roles, which examines whether term-time work has a more positive or negative effect on student outcomes as well as sociocultural literature that is more attentive to different contextual features of the work-study relationship. We find that university-sponsored jobs are highly valued by students for their workplace relationships, regulation, and flexibility. Positive relationships at work are facilitated by supervisors' recognition of students' academic priorities and opportunities to develop peer-support networks on campus. Other important features for students include the convenience of working where one studies, and the ability to build work schedules around academic schedules. However, the limited access to 'good' campus jobs raises concerns about equity.", "Keywords": ["Campus employment", "Learning cultures", "Workplace experiences"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Educational Studies, University of British Columbia, Education Centre at Ponderosa Commons, 6445 University Boulevard Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z2 Canada."}, {"First Name": "Catalina", "Last Name": "Bobadilla Sandoval", "Affiliation": "Department of Educational Studies, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}], "Journal": "Vocations and learning", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38467663", "Title": "Human immunoglobulin gene allelic variation impacts germline-targeting vaccine priming.", "Abstract": "Vaccine priming immunogens that activate germline precursors for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have promise for development of precision vaccines against major human pathogens.

Through immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genotyping, statistical modeling, quantification of IGHV1-2 allele usage and B cell frequencies in the naive repertoire for each trial participant, and antibody affinity analyses, we found that the difference between dose groups in VRC01-class response frequency was best explained by IGHV1-2 genotype rather than dose and was most likely due to differences in IGHV1-2 B cell frequencies for different genotypes.

Here, we report that colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) expression is upregulated significantly in a p53-R172H-dependent manner in metastatic lung lesions of ESCC. The p53-R172H-dependent CSF-1 signaling, through its cognate receptor CSF-1R, increases tumor cell invasion and lung metastasis, which in turn is mediated in part through Stat3 phosphorylation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In Trp53R172H tumor cells, p53 occupies the Csf-1 promoter. The Csf-1 locus is enriched with histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), which is likely permissive for fostering an interaction between bromodomain-containing domain 4 (BRD4) and p53-R172H to regulate Csf-1 transcription. Inhibition of BRD4 not only reduces tumor invasion and lung metastasis but also reduces circulating CSF-1 levels.

We also formally quantified the role of selection and mechanical biases in driving aneuploidy, finding that rates of arm-level copy-number alterations are most highly correlated with their effects on cellular fitness1,2.

Recurrent mitotic errors cause chromosomal instability (CIN), a hallmark of tumors. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers (HNC), cause mitotic defects consistent with CIN in models of anogenital cancers, but this has not been studied in the context of HNC. Here, we show that HPV16 induces a specific type of CIN in patient HNC tumors, patient-derived xenografts, and cell lines, which is due to defects in chromosome congression. These defects are specifically induced by the HPV16 oncogene E6 rather than E7. We show that HPV16 E6 expression causes degradation of the mitotic kinesin CENP-E, whose depletion produces chromosomes that are chronically misaligned near spindle poles (polar chromosomes) and fail to congress. Though the canonical oncogenic role of E6 is the degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, CENP-E degradation and polar chromosomes occur independently of p53. Instead, E6 directs CENP-E degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner via the E6-associated ubiquitin protein ligase E6AP/UBE3A.

"Characterization of the molecular mechanisms of silicon uptake in coccolithophores.", "Abstract": "Coccolithophores are an important group of calcifying marine phytoplankton. Although coccolithophores are not silicified, some species exhibit a requirement for Si in the calcification process. These species also possess a novel protein (SITL) that resembles the SIT family of Si transporters found in diatoms. However, the nature of Si transport in coccolithophores is not yet known, making it difficult to determine the wider role of Si in coccolithophore biology. Here, we show that coccolithophore SITLs act as Na+ -coupled Si transporters when expressed in heterologous systems and exhibit similar characteristics to diatom SITs. We find that CbSITL from Coccolithus braarudii is transcriptionally regulated by Si availability and is expressed in environmental coccolithophore populations. However, the Si requirement of C. braarudii and other coccolithophores is very low, with transport rates of exogenous Si below the level of detection in sensitive assays of Si transport. As coccoliths contain only low levels of Si, we propose that Si acts to support the calcification process, rather than forming a structural component of the coccolith itself. Si is therefore acting as a micronutrient in coccolithophores and natural populations are only likely to experience Si limitation in circumstances where dissolved silicon (DSi) is depleted to extreme levels.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Silicon", "Phytoplankton", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Diatoms", "Calcification, Physiologic", "Haptophyta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Ratcliffe", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK."}, {"First Name": "Erin M", "Last Name": "Meyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Charlotte E", "Last Name": "Walker", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Knight", "Affiliation": "School of Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK."}, {"First Name": "Heather M", "Last Name": "McNair", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology and the Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul G", "Last Name": "Matson", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology and the Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Debora", "Last Name": "Iglesias-Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology and the Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Brzezinski", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology and the Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gerald", "Last Name": "Langer", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, UK."}, {"First Name": "Aleksey", "Last Name": "Sadekov", "Affiliation": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Ocean Graduate School, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Mervyn", "Last Name": "Greaves", "Affiliation": "The Godwin Laboratory for Palaeoclimate Research, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Brownlee", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, UK."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Curnow", "Affiliation": "School of Biochemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK."}, {"First Name": "Alison R", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina, USA."}, {"First Name": "Glen L", "Last Name": "Wheeler", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth, UK."}], "Journal": "Environmental microbiology", "PubDate": "2023Feb"}, {"PMID": "36385528", "Title": "Effect of the intratumoral microbiota on spatial and cellular heterogeneity in cancer.", "Abstract": "The tumour-associated microbiota is an intrinsic component of the tumour microenvironment across human cancer types1,2.

Here, by applying in situ spatial-profiling technologies4 and single-cell RNA sequencing5 to oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, we reveal spatial, cellular and molecular host-microbe interactions. We adapted 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics to determine the identity and in situ location of intratumoral microbial communities within patient tissues. Using GeoMx digital spatial profiling6, we show that bacterial communities populate microniches that are less vascularized, highly immuno\u2011suppressive and associated with malignant cells with lower levels of Ki-67\u00a0as compared to bacteria-negative tumour regions. We developed a single-cell RNA-sequencing method that we name INVADEseq (invasion-adhesion-directed expression sequencing) and, by applying this to patient tumours, identify cell-associated bacteria and the host cells with which they interact, as well as uncovering alterations in transcriptional pathways that are involved in inflammation, metastasis, cell dormancy and DNA repair. Through functional studies, we show that cancer cells that are infected with bacteria invade their surrounding environment as single cells and recruit myeloid cells to bacterial regions.

How these unicellular algae accomplish the complex morphogenesis of coccoliths is still largely unknown. It has long been proposed that the cytoskeleton plays a central role in shaping the growing coccoliths. Previous studies have indicated that disruption of the microtubule network led to defects in coccolith morphogenesis in Emiliania huxleyi and Coccolithus braarudii. Disruption of the actin network also led to defects in coccolith morphology in E. huxleyi, but its impact on coccolith morphology in C. braarudii was unclear, as coccolith secretion was largely inhibited under the conditions used. A more detailed examination of the role of actin and microtubule networks is therefore required to address the wider role of the cytoskeleton in coccolith morphogenesis. In this study, we have examined coccolith morphology in C. braarudii and Scyphosphaera apsteinii following treatment with the microtubule inhibitors vinblastine and colchicine (S. apsteinii only) and the actin inhibitor cytochalasin B. We found that all cytoskeleton inhibitors induced coccolith malformations, strongly suggesting that both microtubules and actin filaments are instrumental in morphogenesis.

Repression of e1 in SOX2-high cells causes collapse of the surrounding enhancers, remarkable reduction in SOX2 expression, and a global transcriptional change reminiscent of SOX2 knockout. The e1 enhancer is driven by a combination of transcription factors including SOX2 itself and the AP-1 complex, which facilitates recruitment of the co-activator BRD4. CRISPR-mediated activation of e1 in SOX2-low cells is sufficient to rebuild the e1-SOX2 loop and activate SOX2 expression.

However, the factors associated with the development of high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs and how long those Abs persist remain incompletely defined. In particular, an understanding of the relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs is limited. To address these unknowns, we quantified serum anti-SARS- CoV-2 Abs in clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent human subjects 5 wk (n = 113) and 3 mo (n = 79) after symptom resolution with three methods: a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 Ags, a new SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing assay. We then identified clinical and demographic factors, including never-before-assessed COVID-19 symptoms, that consistently correlate with high anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab levels. We detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs in 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects 5 wk after symptom resolution, and Ab levels did not decline at 3 mo. Greater disease severity, older age, male sex, higher body mass index, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab levels. Moreover, we report for the first time (to our knowledge) that COVID-19 symptoms, most consistently fever, body aches, and low appetite, correlate with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab levels.

To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the effects of microplastics on larval and early juvenile life stages of the Black Sea Bass (Centropristis striata), a North American fishery. Larvae (13-14 days post hatch, dph) were exposed to 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104, 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105, and 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 particles L-1 of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microspheres (10-20\u00a0\u03bcm) directly in seawater and via trophic transfer from microzooplankton prey (tintinnid ciliates, Favella spp.). We also compared the ingestion of virgin and chemically-treated microspheres incubated with either phenanthrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, or 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP), a plastic additive. Larval fish did not discriminate between virgin or chemically-treated microspheres. However, larvae did ingest higher numbers of microspheres through ingestion of microzooplankton prey than directly from the seawater. Early juveniles (50-60 dph) were directly exposed to the virgin and chemically-treated LDPE microspheres, as well as virgin LDPE microfibers for 96\u00a0h to determine physiological effects (i.e., oxygen consumption and immune response). There was a significant positive relationship between oxygen consumption and increasing microfiber concentration, as well as a significant negative relationship between immune response and increasing virgin microsphere concentration. This first assessment of microplastic pollution effects in the early life stages of a commercial finfish species demonstrates that trophic transfer from microzooplankton can be a significant route of microplastic exposure to larval stages of C. striata, and that multi-day exposure to some microplastics in early juveniles can result in physiological stress.", "Keywords": ["Black sea bass", "Commercial fishery", "Concentration-response", "Contaminated prey", "Immune response", "Microfibers", "Microspheres", "North America", "Respiration"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Bass", "Eating", "Ecosystem", "Fisheries", "Microplastics", "Plastics", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cheyenne D", "Last Name": "Stienbarger", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jincy", "Last Name": "Joseph", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Samantha N", "Last Name": "Athey", "Affiliation": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Bonnie", "Last Name": "Monteleone", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anthony L", "Last Name": "Andrady", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Wade O", "Last Name": "Watanabe", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pamela", "Last Name": "Seaton", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alison R", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susanne M", "Last Name": "Brander", "Affiliation": "Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Sciences, Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station, Oregon State University, USA.

Cell surface CD99 is expressed by healthy leucocytes and ECs, and participates in inflammatory transendothelial migration (TEM). Tumour cells also express CD99, and we have analysed its role in tumour progression and cancer cell TEM. Tumour cell CD99 was required for adhesion to ECs but inhibited invasion of the endothelial barrier and migratory activity. Furthermore, CD99 depletion in tumour cells caused redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton and increased activity of the Rho GTPase CDC42, known for its role in actin remodelling and cell migration. In a xenograft model of breast cancer, tumour cell CD99 expression inhibited metastatic progression, and patient samples showed reduced expression of the CD99 gene in brain metastases compared to matched primary breast tumours. We conclude that CD99 negatively regulates CDC42 and cell migration. However, CD99 has both pro- and anti-tumour activity, and our data suggest that this results in part from its functional linkage to CDC42 and the diverse signalling pathways downstream of this Rho GTPase.

Keenan-Bateman et al. (2016, 2018), though, introduced an enigmatic exocrine gland, associated with the false gill slit pigmentation pattern in Kogia breviceps. These authors provided a preliminary description of this cervical gill slit gland in their helminthological studies of the parasitic nematode, Crassicauda magna. This study offers the first detailed gross and histological description of this gland and reports upon key differences between immature and mature individuals. Investigation reveals it is a complex, compound tubuloalveolar gland with a well-defined duct that leads to a large, and expandable central chamber, which in turn leads to two caudally projecting diverticula. All regions of the gland contain branched tubular and alveolar secretory regions, although most are found in the caudal diverticula, where the secretory process is holocrine. The gland lies between slips of cutaneous muscle, and is innervated by lamellar corpuscles, resembling Pacinian's corpuscles, suggesting that its secretory product may be actively expressed into the environment. Mature K. breviceps display larger gland size, and increased functional activity in glandular tissues, as compared to immature individuals. These results demonstrate that the cervical gill slit gland of K. breviceps shares morphological features of the specialized, chemical signaling, exocrine glands of terrestrial members of the Cetartiodactyla.", "Keywords": ["cetacean", "chemical communication", "gland", "integument", "semiochemical"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Exocrine Glands", "Gills", "Whales"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tiffany F", "Last Name": "Keenan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "William A", "Last Name": "McLellan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Sentiel A", "Last Name": "Rommel", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Alexander M", "Last Name": "Costidis", "Affiliation": "Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center, Virginia Beach, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Craig A", "Last Name": "Harms", "Affiliation": "Center for Marine Sciences and Technology, North Carolina State University, Morehead City, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "'Hans' Jgm", "Last Name": "Thewissen", "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy/Neurobiology, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "David S", "Last Name": "Rotstein", "Affiliation": "Marine Mammal Pathology Services, Olney, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Mark D", "Last Name": "Gay", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Charles W", "Last Name": "Potter", "Affiliation": "Department of Vertebrate Zoology, Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, Washington, District of Columbia, USA."}, {"First Name": "Alison R", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "Ying", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "University of North Carolina Wilmington, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Wilmington, North Carolina."}, {"First Name": "D Ann", "Last Name": "Pabst", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina."}], "Journal": "Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)", "PubDate": "2022Mar"}, {"PMID": "34193382", "Title": "The forgotten radial nerve: A conceptual framework for treatment of lateral elbow pain.", "Abstract": "Lateral elbow pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal overuse disorder that has serious consequences for musculoskeletal health, occupational performance, and overall healthcare burden.

We also identify KIF18A, which encodes a mitotic kinesin protein, as being specifically required for the viability of WGD+ cells. Although KIF18A is largely dispensable for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis in WGD- cells, its loss induces notable mitotic errors in WGD+ cells, ultimately impairing cell viability.

Holococcoliths consisting of simple rhombic crystals can be produced by the haploid life cycle stage but are thought to be formed extracellularly, representing an independent evolutionary origin of calcification. We use advanced microscopy techniques to determine the nature of coccolith formation and complex crystal formation in coccolithophore life cycle stages. We find that holococcoliths are formed in intracellular compartments in a similar manner to heterococcoliths. However, we show that silicon is not required for holococcolith formation and that the requirement for silicon in certain coccolithophore species relates specifically to the process of crystal morphogenesis in heterococcoliths. We therefore propose an evolutionary scheme in which the lower complexity holococcoliths represent an ancestral form of calcification in coccolithophores.

Here, we report a unique class of eukaryotic Na+-selective, single-domain channels (EukCatBs) that are present primarily in haptophyte algae, including the ecologically important calcifying coccolithophores, Emiliania huxleyi and Scyphosphaera apsteinii The EukCatB channels exhibit very rapid voltage-dependent activation and inactivation kinetics, and isoform-specific sensitivity to the highly selective 4D-Nav blocker tetrodotoxin. The results demonstrate that the capacity for rapid Na+-based signaling in eukaryotes is not restricted to animals or to the presence of 4D-Navs. The EukCatB channels therefore represent an independent evolution of fast Na+-based electrical signaling in eukaryotes that likely contribute to sophisticated cellular control mechanisms operating on very short time scales in unicellular algae.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cyanobacteria", "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant", "Genes, Plant", "Ion Channel Gating", "Photosynthesis", "Sodium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katherine E", "Last Name": "Helliwell", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Chrachri", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Koester", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-591."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Wharam", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Alison R", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-591."}, {"First Name": "Glen L", "Last Name": "Wheeler", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Colin", "Last Name": "Brownlee", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, United Kingdom cbr@mba.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Plant physiology", "PubDate": "2020Dec"}, {"PMID": "32354372", "Title": "Commercialisation and commodification of breastfeeding: video diaries by first-time mothers.", "Abstract": "Many of aspects of our lives became increasingly commercialised in post-modern society.

A key innovation underpinning this\u00a0fundamental signaling process has been the evolution of four-domain voltage-gated Na+/Ca2+ channels (4D-Cavs/Navs). These channels are widely distributed across eukaryote diversity [4], albeit several eukaryotes, including land plants and fungi, have lost voltage-sensitive 4D-Cav/Navs [5-7]. Because these lineages appear to lack rapid Na+/Ca2+-based action potentials, 4D-Cav/Navs are generally considered necessary for fast Na+/Ca2+-based signaling [7]. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning the membrane physiology of many eukaryotes remain unexamined. Eukaryotic phytoplankton critically influence our climate as major primary producers. Several taxa, including the globally abundant diatoms, exhibit membrane excitability [8-10]. We previously demonstrated that certain diatom genomes encode 4D-Cav/Navs [4] but also proteins of unknown function, resembling prokaryote single-domain, voltage-gated Na+ channels (BacNavs) [4]. Here, we show that single-domain channels are actually broadly distributed across major eukaryote phytoplankton lineages and represent three novel classes of single-domain channels, which we refer collectively to as EukCats. Functional characterization of diatom EukCatAs indicates that they are voltage-gated Na+- and Ca2+-permeable channels, with rapid kinetics resembling metazoan 4D-Cavs/Navs. In Phaeodactylum tricornutum, which lacks 4D-Cav/Navs, EukCatAs underpin voltage-activated Ca2+ signaling important for membrane excitability, and mutants exhibit impaired motility. EukCatAs therefore provide alternative mechanisms for rapid Na+/Ca2+ signaling in eukaryotes and may functionally replace 4D-Cavs/Navs in pennate diatoms. Marine phytoplankton thus possess unique signaling mechanisms that may be key to environmental sensing in the oceans.", "Keywords": ["BacNa(v)", "EukCats", "action potentials", "calcium channel", "diatoms", "gliding motility", "ion selectivity", "signaling", "single-domain channel", "voltage-gated channel"], "MeSH terms": ["Calcium", "Diatoms", "Ion Channel Gating", "Signal Transduction", "Sodium", "Sodium Channels"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Katherine E", "Last Name": "Helliwell", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, UK; Biosciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Geoffrey Pope Building, University of Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QD, UK."}, {"First Name": "Abdul", "Last Name": "Chrachri", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, UK."}, {"First Name": "Julie A", "Last Name": "Koester", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, NC 28403-5915, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan", "Last Name": "Wharam", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, UK."}, {"First Name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "Last Name": "Verret", "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Nikolaou Plastira 100, 70013 Heraklion, Crete, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Alison R", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Marine Biology, University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, NC 28403-5915, USA."}, {"First Name": "Glen L", "Last Name": "Wheeler", "Affiliation": "Marine Biological Association, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, UK.

The cellular fate of two additional BODIPY-conjugated K.\u00a0brevis associated secondary metabolites, brevenal (B-Bn) and brevisin (B-Bs), were examined in all the species tested. All taxa exhibited minimal or undetectable fluorescence when exposed to the former conjugate, while most brightly fluoresced when treated with the latter.

Calcification by coccolithophores contributes significantly to global biogeochemical cycles. However, the physiological requirement for calcification remains poorly understood as non-calcifying strains of some commonly used model species, such as Emiliania huxleyi, grow normally in laboratory culture. To determine whether the requirement for calcification differs between coccolithophore species, we utilized multiple independent methodologies to disrupt calcification in two important species of coccolithophore: E. huxleyi and Coccolithus braarudii. We investigated their physiological response and used time-lapse imaging to visualize the processes of calcification and cell division in individual cells. Disruption of calcification resulted in major growth defects in C.\u00a0braarudii, but not in E.\u00a0huxleyi. We found no evidence that calcification supports photosynthesis in C.\u00a0braarudii, but showed that an inability to maintain an intact coccosphere results in cell cycle arrest. We found that C.\u00a0braarudii is very different from E.\u00a0huxleyi as it exhibits an obligate requirement for calcification.

The effect was seen using several structurally distinct GSK-3 SMIs and was accompanied by an increase in Lamp-1 and GZMB expression. Conversely, CD28 crosslinking obviated the need for GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibition in its enhancement of CTL function.

For alcohol, we provide data on alcohol dependence, damage to families, and the documented increase in alcohol consumption since removal of the above-inflation alcohol duty escalator. Alcoholic liver disease will shortly overtake ischaemic heart disease with regard to years of working life lost. The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, affecting more than 60% of adults in the UK, is leading to an increasing liver disease burden. Favourable responses by industry to the UK Government's soft drinks industry levy have been seen, but the government cannot continue to ignore the number of adults being affected by diabetes, hypertension, and liver disease. New direct-acting antiviral drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection have reduced mortality and the number of patients requiring liver transplantation, but more screening campaigns are needed for identification of infected people in high-risk migrant communities, prisons, and addiction centres. Provision of care continues to be worst in regions with the greatest socioeconomic deprivation, and deficiencies exist in training programmes in hepatology for specialist registrars. Firm guidance is needed for primary care on the use of liver blood tests in detection of early disease and the need for specialist referral. This report also brings together all the evidence on costs to the National Health Service and wider society, in addition to the loss of tax revenue, with alcohol misuse in England and Wales costing \u00a321 billion a year (possibly up to \u00a352 billion) and obesity costing \u00a327 billion a year (treasury estimates are as high as \u00a346 billion). Voluntary restraints by the food and drinks industry have had little effect on disease burden, and concerted regulatory and fiscal action by the UK Government is essential if the scale of the medical problem, with an estimated 63\u2008000 preventable deaths over the next 5 years, is to be addressed.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alcohol Drinking", "Cost of Illness", "Health Care Costs", "Hepatitis, Viral, Human", "Humans", "Liver Diseases, Alcoholic", "Obesity", "United Kingdom"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "Foundation for Liver Research, The Institute of Hepatology, London, UK.

We previously showed that the serine/threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase, GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2, is a central regulator of PD-1 transcription in CD8+ T cells. Here, we show that the use of small-molecule inhibitors of GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2 (GSK-3i) to reduce pcdc1 (PD-1) transcription and expression was as effective as anti-PD-1 and PD-L1-blocking antibodies in the control of B16 melanoma, or EL4 lymphoma, in primary tumor and metastatic settings. Furthermore, the conditional genetic deletion of GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2 reduced PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells and limited B16 pulmonary metastasis to the same degree as PD-1 gene deficiency. In each model, GSK-3i inhibited PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, while increasing Tbx21 (T-bet) transcription, and the expression of CD107a+ (LAMP1) and granzyme B (GZMB) on CD8+ T cells. Finally, the adoptive transfer of T cells treated ex vivo with a GSK-3 inhibitor delayed the onset of EL4 lymphoma growth to a similar extent as anti-PD-1 pretreatment. Overall, our findings show how GSK-3 inhibitors that downregulate PD-1 expression can enhance CD8+ T-cell function in cancer therapy to a similar degree as PD-1-blocking antibodies.Significance: These findings show how GSK-3 inhibitors that downregulate PD-1 expression can enhance CD8+ T-cell function in cancer therapy to a similar degree as PD-1 blocking antibodies, offering a next-generation approach in the design of immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer management.

Activation of the KLF5 Transcription Factor.", "Abstract": "The Kr\u00fcppel-like family of transcription factors plays critical roles in human development and is associated with cancer pathogenesis. Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 gene (KLF5) has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis and to be genomically amplified in cancer cells. We recently reported that the KLF5 gene is also subject to other types of somatic coding and noncoding genomic alterations in diverse cancer types. Here, we show that these alterations activate KLF5 by three distinct mechanisms: (i) Focal amplification of superenhancers activates KLF5 expression in squamous cell carcinomas; (ii) Missense mutations disrupt KLF5-FBXW7 interactions to increase KLF5 protein stability in colorectal cancer; (iii) Cancer type-specific hotspot mutations within a zinc-finger DNA binding domain of KLF5 change its DNA binding specificity and reshape cellular transcription. Utilizing data from CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout screening, we reveal that cancer cells with KLF5 overexpression are dependent on KLF5 for their proliferation, suggesting KLF5 as a putative therapeutic target.Significance: Our observations, together with previous studies that identified oncogenic properties of KLF5, establish the importance of KLF5 activation in human cancers, delineate the varied genomic mechanisms underlying this occurrence, and nominate KLF5 as a putative target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.

Because many DBA patients fail to respond to corticosteroid therapy, there is considerable need for therapeutics for this disorder.

To this end, we adopted a reprogramming strategy to generate expandable hematopoietic progenitor cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from DBA patients. Reprogrammed DBA progenitors recapitulate defects in erythroid differentiation, which were rescued by gene complementation. Unbiased chemical screens identified SMER28, a small-molecule inducer of autophagy, which enhanced erythropoiesis in a range of in vitro and in vivo models of DBA. SMER28 acted through autophagy factor ATG5 to stimulate erythropoiesis and up-regulate expression of globin genes.

The interpretation of such studies may be complicated by spatial compatibility effects that emerge when researchers employ spatial responses, and participants spontaneously code spatial relationships about an observed body. Yet, the nature of these spatial codes - whether they are location- or object-based, and coded from the perspective of the observer or the figure - has not been determined. Here, we investigated this issue by exploring spatial compatibility effects arising for objects held by a visually presented whole-bodied schematic human figure. In three experiments, participants responded to the colour of the object held in the figure's left or right hand, using left or right key presses. Left-right compatibility effects were found relative to the participant's egocentric perspective, rather than the figure's. These effects occurred even when the figure was rotated by 90\u00b0 to the left or to the right, and the coloured objects were aligned with the participant's midline. These findings are consistent with spontaneous spatial coding from the participant's perspective and relative to the normal upright orientation of the body.

However, the sensory biology of alveolate grazers is poorly understood. Using novel techniques that combine electrophysiological measurements and high-speed videomicroscopy, we investigated the sensory biology of Favella sp., a model alveolate grazer, in the context of its trophic ecology. Favella sp. produced frequent rhythmic depolarizations (\u223c500\u2005ms long) that caused backward swimming and are responsible for endogenous swimming patterns relevant to foraging. Contact of both prey cells and non-prey polystyrene microspheres at the cilia produced immediate mechanostimulated depolarizations (\u223c500\u2005ms long) that caused backward swimming, and likely underlie aggregative swimming patterns of Favella sp. in response to patches of prey. Contact of particles at the peristomal cavity that were not suitable for ingestion resulted in depolarizations after a lag of \u223c600\u2005ms, allowing time for particles to be processed before rejection. Ingestion of preferred prey particles was accompanied by transient hyperpolarizations (\u223c1\u2005s) that likely regulate this step of the feeding process.

Engagement of CD28 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic region and recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling proteins. Although the exact mechanism of CD28 signal transduction is unknown, CD28 triggering has similarities to the TCR, which was proposed to use the kinetic-segregation (KS) mechanism. The KS model postulates that, when small receptors engage their ligands within areas of close (\u223c15 nm) contact in the T cell/APC interface, this facilitates phosphorylation by segregating the engaged receptor/ligand complex from receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases with large ectodomains, such as CD45. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of elongating the extracellular region of the CD28 ligand, CD80, on its ability to costimulate IL-2 production by primary T cells. CD80 elongation reduced its costimulatory effect without abrogating CD28 binding. Confocal microscopy revealed that elongated CD80 molecules were less well segregated from CD45 at the T cell/APC interface. T cells expressing CD28 harboring a key tyrosine-170 mutation were less sensitive to CD80 elongation. In summary, the effectiveness of CD28 costimulation is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the CD28-CD80 complex. Small CD28-CD80 complex dimensions are required for optimal costimulation by segregation from large inhibitory tyrosine phosphatases. These results demonstrate the importance of ligand dimensions for optimal costimulation of IL-2 production by T cells and suggest that the KS mechanism contributes to CD28 signaling.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "B7-1 Antigen", "CD28 Antigens", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CHO Cells", "Cell Line", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Interleukin-2", "Leukocyte Common Antigens", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Binding", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hong-Sheng", "Last Name": "Lim", "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom;"}, {"First Name": "Shaun-Paul", "Last Name": "Cordoba", "Affiliation": "University College London Cancer Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6DD, United Kingdom; and."}, {"First Name": "Omer", "Last Name": "Dushek", "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom;"}, {"First Name": "Jesse", "Last Name": "Goyette", "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom;"}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1QP, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Christopher E", "Last Name": "Rudd", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1QP, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "P Anton", "Last Name": "van der Merwe", "Affiliation": "Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom; anton.vandermerwe@path.ox.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2015Dec01"}, {"PMID": "26498037", "Title": "Coccolithophore biomineralization: New questions, new answers.", "Abstract": "Coccolithophores are unicellular phytoplankton that are characterized by the presence intricately formed calcite scales (coccoliths) on their surfaces.

Treatment with minocycline or interfering with BDNF signaling restored chloride transport within these neurons and recovered DA-dependent reward behavior. Our findings demonstrate that a peripheral nerve injury causes activated microglia within reward circuitry that result in disruption of dopaminergic signaling and reward behavior.

Adult patients attending a renal clinic who had \u22651 24-hour UNa measurement were identified. Twenty-four-hour UNa measures were collected and UNa to creatinine ratio calculated. Time to renal replacement therapy or death was recorded. Four hundred twenty-three patients were identified with mean estimated glomerular filtration rate of 48 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Ninety patients required renal replacement therapy and 102 patients died. Mean slope decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate was -2.8 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) per year. Median follow-up was 8.5 years. Patients who died or required renal replacement therapy had significantly higher UNa excretion and UNa to creatinine ratio, but the association with these parameters and poor outcome was not independent of renal function, age, and albuminuria. When stratified by albuminuria, UNa to creatinine ratio was a significant cumulative additional risk for mortality, even in patients with low-level albuminuria.

However, information on the proportion of patients with resistant hypertension qualifying for renal denervation after a thorough work-up and treatment adjustment remains scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the proportion of patients eligible for renal denervation and the reasons for noneligibility at 11 expert centers participating in the European Network COordinating Research on renal Denervation in treatment-resistant hypertension (ENCOReD). The analysis included 731 patients. Age averaged 61.6 years, office blood pressure at screening was 177/96 mm Hg, and the number of blood pressure-lowering drugs taken was 4.1. Specialists referred 75.6% of patients. The proportion of patients eligible for renal denervation according to the SYMPLICITY HTN-2 criteria and each center's criteria was 42.5% (95% confidence interval, 38.0%-47.0%) and 39.7% (36.2%-43.2%), respectively. The main reasons of noneligibility were normalization of blood pressure after treatment adjustment (46.9%), unsuitable renal arterial anatomy (17.0%), and previously undetected secondary causes of hypertension (11.1%). In conclusion, after careful screening and treatment adjustment at hypertension expert centers, only \u224840% of patients referred for renal denervation, mostly by specialists, were eligible for the procedure. The most frequent cause of ineligibility (approximately half of cases) was blood pressure normalization after treatment adjustment by a hypertension specialist.

Students must be prepared to provide women with support and information to make appropriate health choices for themselves and their infants. However, student midwives may already have developed opinions about infant feeding prior to commencing a midwifery education programme. The education literature suggests that existing attitudes may present a barrier to learning for some students. This particularly applies to learning in relation to sensitive or emotionally laden subjects. A review of the literature was undertaken to identify potential teaching approaches which might help students to overcome barriers to learning. Following this the evidence was utilised at a UK university to develop activities which prepare student midwives for effective learning around infant feeding. Students enrolled in the midwifery education programme were introduced to a number of activities aimed at encouraging them to accommodate unfamiliar ideas or 'alien knowledge'. These included placing students in situations which challenged their ideas, as well as engaging in group discussions and reflective exercises. The impact of these educational interventions was identified through formative and summative assessment, and through evaluation of the teaching strategy at the end of the programme. This demonstrated that, amongst those students with previously negative attitudes towards infant feeding, there was a move towards more positive attitudes and a greater confidence in providing evidence based information to parents.", "Keywords": ["Alien knowledge", "Baby friendly initiative", "Bottle feeding", "Breastfeeding", "Infant feeding", "Learning", "Student midwife", "Teaching methods", "Threshold concepts"], "MeSH terms": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Bottle Feeding", "Breast Feeding", "Curriculum", "Female", "Humans", "Infant Food", "Infant, Newborn", "Midwifery", "Nursing Education Research", "Pregnancy", "United Kingdom"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "Angell", "Affiliation": "Bournemouth University, UK.
