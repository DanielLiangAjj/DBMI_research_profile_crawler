Here we show that the monogamous oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) has recently evolved a novel cell type in the adrenal gland that expresses the enzyme AKR1C18, which converts progesterone into 20\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone. We then demonstrate that 20\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone is more abundant in oldfield mice, where it induces monogamous-typical parental behaviours, than in the closely related promiscuous deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a cross between these species, we ultimately find interspecific genetic variation that drives expression of the nuclear protein GADD45A and the glycoprotein tenascin N, which contribute to the emergence and function of this cell type in oldfield mice.

Furthermore, the neural substrates that regulate persistence in engaging in social interactions are poorly studied. Here, we use Siamese fighting fish ( Betta splendens ), to study visually-driven turn-taking aggressive behavior. Using encounters with conspecifics and with animations, we characterize the dynamic visual features of an opponent and the behavioral sequences that drive turn taking. Through a brain-wide screen of neuronal activity during coordinated and persistent aggressive behavior, followed by targeted brain lesions, we find that the caudal portion of the dorsomedial telencephalon, an amygdala-like region, promotes persistent participation in aggressive interactions, yet is not necessary for coordination. Our work highlights how dynamic visual cues shape the rhythm of social interactions at multiple timescales, and points to the pallial amygdala as a region controlling engagement in such interactions.

Interspecific differential expression (DE) is pervasive (52-59% of expressed genes), whereas the number of DE genes between sexes is modest overall (~3%). Interestingly, the identity of DE genes varies considerably across brain regions. Much of this modularity is due to cis-regulatory divergence, and while 43% of genes were consistently assigned to the same gene regulatory class across subregions (e.g. conserved, cis- or trans-regulatory divergence), a similar number were assigned to two or more different gene regulatory classes.

Here, we exploited differences between inbred mouse strains to identify an epithelium-intrinsic mechanism that regulates tuft cell differentiation and tunes innate type 2 immunity in the small intestine. Balb/cJ (Balb) mice had fewer intestinal tuft cells than C57BL/6J (B6) mice and failed to respond to the tuft cell ligand succinate. Most of this differential succinate response was determined by the 50- to 67-Mb interval of chromosome 9 (Chr9), such that congenic Balb mice carrying the B6 Chr9 interval had elevated baseline numbers of tuft cells and responded to succinate. The Chr9 locus includes Pou2af2, which encodes the protein OCA-T1, a transcriptional cofactor essential for tuft cell development. Epithelial crypts expressed a previously unannotated short isoform of Pou2af2 predicted to use a distinct transcriptional start site and encode a nonfunctional protein. Low tuft cell numbers and the resulting lack of succinate response in Balb mice were explained by a preferential expression of the short isoform and could be rescued by expression of full-length Pou2af2.

The current gold standard for molecular diagnostics is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the extraordinary and unmet demand for testing in a variety of environments means that both complementary and supplementary testing solutions are still needed. This review highlights the role that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has had in filling this global testing need, providing a faster and easier means of testing, and what it can do for future applications, pathogens, and the preparation for future outbreaks. This review describes the current state of the art for research of LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as its implications for other pathogens and testing. The authors represent the global LAMP (gLAMP) Consortium, an international research collective, which has regularly met to share their experiences on LAMP deployment and best practices; sections are devoted to all aspects of LAMP testing, including preanalytic sample processing, target amplification, and amplicon detection, then the hardware and software required for deployment are discussed, and finally, a summary of the current regulatory landscape is provided. Included as well are a series of first-person accounts of LAMP method development and deployment. The final discussion section provides the reader with a distillation of the most validated testing methods and their paths to implementation. This review also aims to provide practical information and insight for a range of audiences: for a research audience, to help accelerate research through sharing of best practices; for an implementation audience, to help get testing up and running quickly; and for a public health, clinical, and policy audience, to help convey the breadth of the effect that LAMP methods have to offer.",

WHotLAMP is simple to use, highly sensitive (~4 viral particles per microliter of saliva) and specific, as well as inexpensive, making it ideal for frequent screening. Moreover, WHotLAMP does not require toxic chemicals or specialized equipment and thus can be performed in point-of-care settings, and may also be adapted for resource-limited environments or home use.

Behavior is further shaped at intergenerational timescales by genetic variation, drift, and selection. This sophistication and flexibility of behavior makes it challenging to measure behavior consistently in individual subjects and to compare it across individuals. In spite of these challenges, careful behavioral observations in nature and controlled measurements in the laboratory, combined with modern technologies and powerful genetic approaches, have led to important discoveries about the way genetic variation shapes behavior. A critical mass of genes whose variation is known to modulate behavior in nature is finally accumulating, allowing us to recognize emerging patterns. In this review, we first discuss genetic mapping approaches useful for studying behavior.

Effective communication requires accurate production, detection, and classification of signals, as well as selection of socially appropriate responses. Understanding how signals are generated and how acoustic signals are perceived is key to understanding the neurobiology of social behaviors. Here we review our long-standing research program focused on Xenopus, a frog genus which has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms and evolution of vertebrate social behaviors. In Xenopus laevis, vocal signals differ between the sexes, through development, and across the genus, reflecting evolutionary divergence in sensory and motor circuits that can be interrogated mechanistically. Using two ex vivo preparations, the isolated brain and vocal organ, we have identified essential components of the vocal production system: the sexually differentiated larynx at the periphery, and the hindbrain vocal central pattern generator (CPG) centrally, that produce sex- and species-characteristic sound pulse frequencies and temporal patterns, respectively. Within the hindbrain, we have described how intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in the vocal CPG generate species-specific vocal patterns, how vocal nuclei are connected to generate vocal patterns, as well as the roles of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in activating the circuit. For sensorimotor integration, we identified a key forebrain node that links auditory and vocal production circuits to match socially appropriate vocal responses to acoustic features of male and female calls. The availability of a well supported phylogeny as well as reference genomes from several species now support analysis of the genetic architecture and the evolutionary divergence of neural circuits for vocal communication. Xenopus thus provides a vertebrate model in which to study vocal communication at many levels, from physiology, to behavior, and from development to evolution. As one of the most comprehensively studied phylogenetic groups within vertebrate vocal communication systems, Xenopus provides insights that can inform social communication across phyla.", "Keywords": ["CPG", "duets", "hindbrain", "neuroendocrine", "parabrachial", "song"], "MeSH terms": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Animal Communication", "Animals", "Arytenoid Cartilage", "Biological Evolution", "Central Pattern Generators", "Female", "Gonadal Steroid Hormones", "In Vitro Techniques", "Laryngeal Muscles", "Laryngeal Nerves", "Male", "Medulla Oblongata", "Nerve Net", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Rhombencephalon", "Sex Characteristics", "Sexual Behavior, Animal", "Social Behavior", "Species Specificity", "Vocalization, Animal", "Xenopus laevis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Darcy B", "Last Name": "Kelley", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, dbk3@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Irene H", "Last Name": "Ballagh", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Charlotte L", "Last Name": "Barkan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Andres", "Last Name": "Bendesky", "Affiliation": "Department of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology and Zuckerman Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Taffeta M", "Last Name": "Elliott", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Ben J", "Last Name": "Evans", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Ian C", "Last Name": "Hall", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Young Mi", "Last Name": "Kwon", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Ursula", "Last Name": "Kwong-Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth C", "Last Name": "Leininger", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Emilie C", "Last Name": "Perez", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Heather J", "Last Name": "Rhodes", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215."}, {"First Name": "Avelyne", "Last Name": "Villain", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Ayako", "Last Name": "Yamaguchi", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Erik", "Last Name": "Zornik", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences and Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2020Jan02"}, {"PMID": "28424518", "Title": "The genetic basis of parental care evolution in monogamous mice.", "Abstract": "Parental care is essential for the survival of mammals, yet the mechanisms underlying its evolution remain largely unknown.

Furthermore, some regions affect parental care broadly, whereas others affect specific behaviours, such as nest building. Of the genes linked to differences in nest-building behaviour, vasopressin is differentially expressed in the hypothalamus of the two species, with increased levels associated with less nest building.
