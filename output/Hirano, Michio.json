This research aims to enhance understanding of activity changes across age groups post-nusinersen treatment using shift analysis, compared with untreated individuals. Retrospective data from the, international SMA consortium (iSMAc) dataset were analyzed, assessing individual item changes over 12 months. Shift analysis was used to determine the gain or loss of abilities, defining \"gain\" as a positive change between scores from 0 to either 1 or 2 and \"loss\" as a negative change from either 2 or 1 to 0. The cohort included 130 SMA II patients who underwent 12-month assessments from their first nusinersen dose, with age range between 0.6 and 49.6 years. One-third of the entire cohort experienced at least a loss in one activity, while 60% experienced a gain, particularly notable in children aged 2.5 to 5 years and 5 to 13 years. Overall, the study demonstrates a positive impact of nusinersen treatment on SMA II patients, showing a trend of increased activity gains and decreased probability of ability loss across different age groups.", "Keywords": ["Hammersmith functional motor scale expanded", "Motor function", "Nusinersen", "Shift analysis", "Spinal muscular atrophy", "treatment effect"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Giorgia", "Last Name": "Coratti", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Neurology Unit, Catholic University, 00135 Rome, Italy; Centro Clinico Nemo, U.O.C.

Typically, patients present early-onset liver failure with or without neurological involvement and a clinical course rapidly progressing to death. This is an international multicentre study aiming to provide a retrospective natural history of deoxyguanosine kinase deficient patients. A systematic literature review from January 2001 to June 2023 was conducted. Physicians of research centres or clinicians all around the world caring for previously reported patients were contacted to provide followup information or additional clinical, biochemical, histological/histochemical, and molecular genetics data for unreported cases with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency. A cohort of 202 genetically confirmed patients, 36 unreported, and 166 from a systematic literature review, were analyzed. Patients had a neonatal onset (\u2264 1 month) in 55.7% of cases, infantile (>1 month and \u2264 1 year) in 32.3%, pediatric (>1 year and \u226418 years) in 2.5% and adult (>18 years) in 9.5%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed statistically different survival rates (P < 0.0001) among the four age groups with the highest mortality for neonatal onset. Based on the clinical phenotype, we defined four different clinical subtypes: hepatocerebral (58.8%), isolated hepatopathy (21.9%), hepatomyoencephalopathy (9.6%), and isolated myopathy (9.6%). Muscle involvement was predominant in adult-onset cases whereas liver dysfunction causes morbidity and mortality in early-onset patients with a median survival of less than 1 year. No genotype-phenotype correlation was identified. Liver transplant significantly modified the survival rate in 26 treated patients when compared with untreated. Only six patients had additional mild neurological signs after liver transplant. In conclusion, deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency is a disease spectrum with a prevalent liver and brain tissue specificity in neonatal and infantile-onset patients and muscle tissue specificity in adult-onset cases. Our study provides clinical, molecular genetics and biochemical data for early diagnosis, clinical trial planning and immediate intervention with liver transplant and/or nucleoside supplementation.", "Keywords": ["DGUOK", "deoxyguanosine kinase", "liver transplant", "mitochondrial DNA", "nucleosides"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eleonora", "Last Name": "Manzoni", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Bologna 40138, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Sara", "Last Name": "Carli", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Bologna 40138, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Pauline", "Last Name": "Gaignard", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Bic\u00eatre Hospital, Reference Center for Mitochondrial Disease, University of Paris-Saclay, Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Paris 94275, France."}, {"First Name": "Lea Dewi", "Last Name": "Schlieben", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Institute of Human Genetics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, 80333 \u00a0Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Hirano", "Affiliation": "H.

Here, we examine the natural dynamics and psychobiological regulation of plasma and saliva GDF15 in four human studies representing 4,749 samples from 188 individuals. We show that GDF15 protein is detectable in saliva (8% of plasma concentration), likely produced by salivary glands secretory duct cells. Using a brief laboratory socio-evaluative stressor paradigm, we find that psychosocial stress increases plasma (+3.5-5.9%) and saliva GDF15 (+43%) with distinct kinetics, within minutes. Moreover, saliva GDF15 exhibits a robust awakening response, declining by ~40-89% within 30-45 minutes from its peak level at the time of waking up. Clinically, individuals with genetic mitochondrial OxPhos diseases show elevated baseline plasma and saliva GDF15, and post-stress GDF15 levels in both biofluids correlate with multi-system disease severity, exercise intolerance, and the subjective experience of fatigue. Taken together, our data establish that saliva GDF15 is dynamic, sensitive to psychological states, a clinically relevant endocrine marker of mitochondrial diseases.

Based upon observations that: i) patients and their families frequently report that stressful life events either trigger exacerbations of existing symptoms or the onset of new symptoms, ii) psychological states and stress hormones influence mitochondrial energy production capacity, and iii) epidemiological reports document a robust connection between traumatic/stressful life events and various neurologic disorders, we hypothesized that mitochondrial disease symptom severity may vary according to participant's mood. To investigate this we administered the Stress, Health and Emotion Survey (SHES) in 70 adults (majority white (84%) cisgender women (83%), ages 18-74) with self-reported mitochondrial diseases (MELAS, 18%; CPEO, 17%; Complex I deficiency, 13%). Participants rated the severity of each of their symptom(s) over the past year on either good or bad days. On days marked by more stress, sadness and other negative emotions, some but not all symptoms were reported to be worse, including fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, and fine motor coordination. By contrast, on days marked by happiness and calmness, participants reported these and other symptoms to be better, or less severe. Other symptoms including diminished sweating, hearing problems, and dystonia were in general unrelated to mood. Thus, some individuals living with mitochondrial diseases, at times perceive a connection between their mood and symptom severity.

However, the chronic activation of energy-dependent allostatic responses results in allostatic load, a dysregulated state that predicts functional decline, accelerates aging, and increases mortality in humans. The energetic cost and cellular basis for the damaging effects of allostatic load have not been defined. Here, by longitudinally profiling three unrelated primary human fibroblast lines across their lifespan, we find that chronic glucocorticoid exposure increases cellular energy expenditure by \u223c60%, along with a metabolic shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This state of stress-induced hypermetabolism is linked to mtDNA instability, non-linearly affects age-related cytokines secretion, and accelerates cellular aging based on DNA methylation clocks, telomere shortening rate, and reduced lifespan. Pharmacologically normalizing OxPhos activity while further increasing energy expenditure exacerbates the accelerated aging phenotype, pointing to total energy expenditure as a potential driver of aging dynamics.

Consequently, glycogen synthesis is impaired and leads to accumulation of poorly branched glycogen known as polyglucosan. GSD IV is characterized by a remarkable degree of phenotypic heterogeneity with presentations in utero, during infancy, early childhood, adolescence, or middle to late adulthood. The clinical continuum encompasses hepatic, cardiac, muscular, and neurologic manifestations that range in severity. The adult-onset form of GSD IV, referred to as adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD), is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurogenic bladder, spastic paraparesis, and peripheral neuropathy. There are currently no consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of these patients, resulting in high rates of misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and lack of standardized clinical care. To address this, a group of experts from the United States developed a set of recommendations for the diagnosis and management of all clinical phenotypes of GSD IV, including APBD, to support clinicians and caregivers who provide long-term care for individuals with GSD IV. The educational resource includes practical steps to confirm a GSD IV diagnosis and best practices for medical management, including (a) imaging of the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and spine, (b) functional and neuromusculoskeletal assessments, (c) laboratory investigations, (d) liver and heart transplantation, and (e) long-term follow-up care.

Here we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 post-mortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (n=389), post-mitotic brain tissue (n=798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures WGS design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging 5. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived SURF1-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan.

By integrating data from 17 cohorts of patients with mitochondrial diseases (n\u2009=\u2009690) we find evidence that these disorders increase resting energy expenditure, a state termed hypermetabolism. We examine this phenomenon longitudinally in patient-derived fibroblasts from multiple donors. Genetically or pharmacologically disrupting OxPhos approximately doubles cellular energy expenditure. This cell-autonomous\u00a0state of hypermetabolism occurs despite near-normal OxPhos coupling efficiency, excluding uncoupling as a general mechanism. Instead, hypermetabolism is associated with mitochondrial DNA instability, activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), and increased extracellular secretion of age-related cytokines and metabokines including GDF15. In parallel, OxPhos defects accelerate telomere erosion and epigenetic aging per cell division, consistent with evidence that excess energy expenditure accelerates biological aging. To explore potential mechanisms for these effects, we generate a longitudinal RNASeq and DNA methylation resource dataset, which reveals conserved, energetically demanding, genome-wide recalibrations. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to understand how OxPhos defects influence the energetic cost of living, and the link between hypermetabolism and aging in cells and patients with

Fibroblasts were sourced from both healthy donors (n\u2009=\u20096) and individuals with lifespan-shortening mitochondrial disease (n\u2009=\u20093). The dataset includes cytological, bioenergetic, DNA methylation, gene expression, secreted proteins, mitochondrial DNA copy number and mutations, cell-free DNA, telomere length, and whole-genome sequencing data. This dataset enables the bridging of mechanistic processes of aging as outlined by the \"hallmarks of aging\", with the descriptive characterization of aging such as epigenetic age clocks. Here we focus on bridging the gap for the hallmark mitochondrial metabolism. Our dataset includes measurement of healthy cells, and cells subjected to over a dozen experimental manipulations targeting oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), glycolysis, and glucocorticoid signaling, among others. These experiments provide opportunities to test how cellular energetics affect the biology of cellular aging.

Although OxPhos defects modulate cytokine production in vitro and in animal models, little is known about how circulating leukocytes of patients with inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects respond to acute immune challenges.

Among the most frequent causes of MDDS are defects in nucleoside/nucleotide metabolism, which is critical for synthesis and homeostasis of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrates of mtDNA replication. A central enzyme for generating dNTPs is ribonucleotide reductase, a critical mediator of de novo nucleotide synthesis composed of catalytic RRM1 subunits in complex with RRM2 or p53R2. Here, we report 5 probands from 4 families who presented with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia as well as other clinical manifestations and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle. We identified 3 RRM1 loss-of-function variants, including a dominant catalytic site variant (NP_001024.1: p.N427K) and 2 homozygous recessive variants at p.R381, which has evolutionarily conserved interactions with the specificity site. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations indicate mechanisms by which RRM1 variants affect protein structure. Cultured primary skin fibroblasts of probands manifested mtDNA depletion under cycling conditions, indicating impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis.

The m.3243A>G variant is the most common heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA mutation and underlies a spectrum of diseases, notably mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). To identify robust circulating markers of m.3243A>G disease, we first performed discovery proteomics, targeted metabolomics, and untargeted metabolomics on plasma from a deeply phenotyped cohort (102 patients, 32 controls). In a validation phase, we measured concentrations of prioritized metabolites in an independent cohort using distinct methods. We validated 20 analytes (1 protein, 19 metabolites) that distinguish patients with MELAS from controls. The collection includes classic (lactate, alanine) and more recently identified (GDF-15, \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate) mitochondrial markers. By mining untargeted mass-spectra we uncovered 3 less well-studied metabolite families: N-lactoyl-amino acids, \u03b2-hydroxy acylcarnitines, and \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acids. Many of these 20 analytes correlate strongly with established measures of severity, including Karnofsky status, and mechanistically, nearly all markers are attributable to an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, or NADH-reductive stress.

These facts reveal an important and significant unmet need for approved therapies for these debilitating and often fatal disorders. To fill this need, it is critical for clinicians and drug developers to work closely with regulatory agencies. In the United States, mitochondrial disease patients and clinicians, the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, and pharmaceutical industry members have engaged with the Food and Drug Administration to educate each other about these complex and heterogeneous diseases and about regulatory requirements to obtain approvals for novel therapies. Clinical development of therapies for rare diseases has been facilitated by the 1983 US Orphan Drug Act (ODA) and similar legislation in Japan and the European Union. Further legislation and regulatory guidance have expanded and refined regulatory flexibility. While regulatory and financial incentives of the ODA have augmented involvement of pharmaceutical companies, clinicians, with patient advocacy groups and industry, need to conduct natural history studies, develop clinical outcome measures, and identify potential supportive surrogate endpoints predictive of clinical benefit, which together are critical foundations for clinical trials. Thus, the regulatory environment for novel therapeutic development is conducive and offers flexibility for mitochondrial diseases. Nevertheless, flexibility does not mean lower standards, as well-controlled rigorous clinical trials of high quality are still required to establish the efficacy of potential therapies and to obtain regulatory agency approvals for their commercial use.

We studied 27 affected and 15 unaffected individuals from 19 families and found additional heterozygous mutations in nuclear genes interacting with mt-tRNAGlu including EARS2 and TRMU in the majority of affected individuals, but not in healthy carriers of m.14674T>C, supporting a digenic inheritance. Our transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of patient muscle suggests a stepwise mechanism where first, the integrated stress response associated with increased FGF21 and GDF15 expression enhances the metabolism modulated by serine biosynthesis, one carbon metabolism, TCA lipid oxidation and amino acid availability, while in the second step mTOR activation leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Our data suggest that the spontaneous recovery in infants with digenic mutations may be modulated by the above described changes.

Mutations in SETX result in either of two distinct neurodegenerative disorders. SETX dominant mutations result in a juvenile form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) called ALS4, whereas recessive mutations are responsible for ataxia called ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). How mutations in the same protein can lead to different phenotypes is still unclear. To elucidate AOA2 disease mechanisms, we first examined gene expression changes following SETX depletion. We observed the effects on both transcription and RNA processing, but surprisingly observed decreased R-loop accumulation in SETX-depleted cells. Importantly, we discovered a strong connection between SETX and the macroautophagy/autophagy pathway, reflecting a direct effect on transcription of autophagy genes. We show that SETX depletion inhibits the progression of autophagy, leading to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, decreased ability to clear protein aggregates, as well as mitochondrial defects. Analysis of AOA2 patient fibroblasts also revealed a perturbation of the autophagy pathway. Our work has thus identified a novel function for SETX in the regulation of autophagy, whose modulation may have a therapeutic impact for AOA2.Abbreviations: 3'READS: 3' region extraction and deep sequencing;

GDF-15 was elevated on average 30-fold in children and 6-fold in adults before the start of treatment. There was a significant correlation between basal GDF-15 and severity based on pretreatment distance walked (6MWT) and weight (BMI). During treatment, GDF-15 significantly declined, and the decrease was accompanied by relevant clinical improvements. The decline was greater in the paediatric group, which included the most severe patients and showed the greatest clinical benefit, than in the adult patients. The decline of FGF-21 was less prominent and consistent. GDF-15 is a potential biomarker of severity and of therapeutic response for patients with TK2 deficiency.

Pathogenic RYR1 variations can destabilize RyR1 leading to calcium leak causing oxidative overload and myopathy. However, the effect of RyR1 leak has not been established in individuals with RYR1-related myopathies (RYR1-RM), a broad spectrum of rare neuromuscular disorders. We sought to determine whether RYR1-RM affected individuals exhibit pathologic, leaky RyR1 and whether variant location in the channel structure can predict pathogenicity. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from 17 individuals with RYR1-RM. Mutant RyR1 from these individuals exhibited pathologic SR calcium leak and increased activity of calcium-activated proteases. The increased calcium leak and protease activity were normalized by ex-vivo treatment with S107, a RyR stabilizing Rycal molecule. Using the cryo-EM structure of RyR1 and a new dataset of\u2009>\u20092200 suspected RYR1-RM affected individuals we developed a method for assigning pathogenicity probabilities to RYR1 variants based on 3D co-localization of known pathogenic variants. This study provides the rationale for a clinical trial testing Rycals in RYR1-RM affected individuals and introduces a predictive tool for investigating the pathogenicity of RYR1 variants of uncertain significance.", "Keywords": ["Calcium", "Central core disease", "Genetics", "RyR1-related myopathy", "Ryanodine receptor", "Therapeutics"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Cytoplasm", "Humans", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Diseases", "Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel", "Sarcoplasmic Reticulum"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Kushnir", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua J", "Last Name": "Todd", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Symptoms Unit, Tissue Injury Branch, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jessica W", "Last Name": "Witherspoon", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Symptoms Unit, Tissue Injury Branch, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Qi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Reiken", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Harvey", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ross H", "Last Name": "Munce", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Wajsberg", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zephan", "Last Name": "Melville", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Oliver B", "Last Name": "Clarke", "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kaylee", "Last Name": "Wedderburn-Pugh", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Anetta", "Last Name": "Wronska", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, Clyde and Helen Wu Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Muslima S", "Last Name": "Razaqyar", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Symptoms Unit, Tissue Injury Branch, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irene C", "Last Name": "Chrismer", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Symptoms Unit, Tissue Injury Branch, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Monique O", "Last Name": "Shelton", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular Symptoms Unit, Tissue Injury Branch, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ami", "Last Name": "Mankodi", "Affiliation": "Neurogenetics Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christopher", "Last Name": "Grunseich", "Affiliation": "Neurogenetics Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Mark A", "Last Name": "Tarnopolsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kurenai", "Last Name": "Tanji", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Hirano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, H.

MNGIE stems from deficient thymidine phosphorylase activity (TP) leading to toxic elevations of plasma thymidine. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) restores TP activity and halts disease progression but has high transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Liver transplant (LT) was reported to restore TP activity in two adult MNGIE patients. We report successful LT in four additional MNGIE patients, including a pediatric patient. Our patients were diagnosed between ages 14\u00a0months and 36\u00a0years with elevated thymidine levels and biallelic pathogenic variants in TYMP. Two patients presented with progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility, and three demonstrated progressive peripheral neuropathy with two suffering limitations in ambulation. Two patients, including the child, had liver dysfunction and cirrhosis. Following LT, thymidine levels nearly normalized in all four patients and remained low for the duration of follow-up. Disease symptoms stabilized in all patients, with some manifesting improvements, including intestinal function.

These global changes are captured by DNAm clocks that accurately predict chronological age in humans but relatively little is known about how clocks perform in vitro. Here we culture primary human fibroblasts across the cellular lifespan (~6\u00a0months) and use four different DNAm clocks to show that age-related DNAm signatures are conserved and accelerated in vitro. The Skin & Blood clock shows the best linear correlation with chronological time (r\u00a0=\u00a00.90), including during replicative senescence. Although similar in nature, the rate of epigenetic aging is approximately 62x times faster in cultured cells than in the human body. Consistent with in vivo data, cells aged under hyperglycemic conditions exhibit an approximately three years elevation in baseline DNAm age. Moreover, candidate gene-based analyses further corroborate the conserved but accelerated biological aging process in cultured fibroblasts. Fibroblasts mirror the established DNAm topology of the age-related ELOVL2 gene in human blood and the rapid hypermethylation of its promoter cg16867657, which correlates with a linear decrease in ELOVL2 mRNA levels across the lifespan. Using generalized additive modeling on twelve timepoints across the lifespan, we also show how single CpGs exhibit loci-specific, linear and nonlinear trajectories that reach rates up to -47% (hypomethylation) to +23% (hypermethylation) per month.

Animal studies showed COL13A1, a synaptic extracellular-matrix protein, is involved in the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular synapse that appears independent of the Agrin-LRP4-MuSK-DOK7 acetylcholine receptor clustering pathway. Here, we report the phenotypic spectrum of 16 patients from 11 kinships harbouring homozygous or heteroallelic mutations in COL13A1. Clinical presentation was mostly at birth with hypotonia and breathing and feeding difficulties often requiring ventilation and artificial feeding. Respiratory crisis related to recurrent apnoeas, sometimes triggered by chest infections, were common early in life but resolved over time. The predominant pattern of muscle weakness included bilateral ptosis (non-fatigable in adulthood), myopathic facies and marked axial weakness, especially of neck flexion, while limb muscles were less involved. Other features included facial dysmorphism, skeletal abnormalities and mild learning difficulties. All patients tested had results consistent with abnormal neuromuscular transmission. Muscle biopsies were within normal limits or showed non-specific changes. Muscle MRI and serum creatine kinase levels were normal. In keeping with COL13A1 mutations affecting both synaptic structure and presynaptic function, treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine and salbutamol resulted in motor and respiratory function improvement. In non-treated cases, disease severity and muscle strength improved gradually over time and several adults recovered normal muscle strength in the limbs. In summary, patients with COL13A1 mutations present mostly with severe early-onset myasthenic syndrome with feeding and breathing difficulties. Axial weakness is greater than limb weakness. Disease course improves gradually over time, which could be consistent with the less prominent role of COL13A1 once the neuromuscular junction is mature. This report emphasizes the role of collagens at the human muscle endplate and should facilitate the recognition of this disorder, which can benefit from pharmacological treatment.", "Keywords": ["3,4-diaminopyridine", "COL13A1", "congenital myasthenic syndromes", "salbutamol", "synaptic basal lamina"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Collagen Type XIII", "Female", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Mutation", "Myasthenic Syndromes, Congenital", "Neuromuscular Junction", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pedro M", "Last Name": "Rodr\u00edguez Cruz", "Affiliation": "Neurosciences Group, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Judith", "Last Name": "Cossins", "Affiliation": "Neurosciences Group, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK."}, {"First Name": "Eduardo de Paula", "Last Name": "Estephan", "Affiliation": "Departamento de Neurologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (FMUSP), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Francina", "Last Name": "Munell", "Affiliation": "Neuromuscular disorders Group, Child Neurology Unit, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Kathryn", "Last Name": "Selby", "Affiliation": "University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Hirano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, H.

In MNGIE patients, TP dysfunction results in systemic thymidine and deoxyuridine overload, which interferes with mitochondrial DNA replication. Preclinical studies have shown that gene therapy using a lentiviral vector targeted to hematopoietic stem cells or an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector transcriptionally targeted to liver are feasible approaches to treat MNGIE. Here, we studied the effect of various promoters (thyroxine-binding globulin [TBG], phosphoglycerate kinase [PGK], hybrid liver-specific promoter [HLP], and alpha-1-antitrypsin [AAT]) and DNA configuration (single stranded or self complementary) on expression of the TYMP transgene in the AAV8 serotype in a murine model of MNGIE. All vectors restored liver TP activity and normalized nucleoside homeostasis in mice. However, the liver-specific promoters TBG, HLP, and AAT were more effective than the constitutive PGK promoter, and the self-complementary DNA configuration did not provide any therapeutic advantage over the single-stranded configuration. Among all constructs, only AAV-AAT was effective in all mice treated at the lowest dose (5\u2009\u00d7\u20091010 vector genomes/kg).

Mutations in either POLG or POLG2 are linked to disease and adversely affect maintenance of the mitochondrial genome, resulting in depletion, deletions and/or point mutations in mtDNA. A homozygous mutation located at Chr17: 62492543G>A in POLG2, resulting in R182W substitution in p55, was previously identified to cause mtDNA depletion and fatal hepatic liver failure. Here we characterize this homozygous R182W p55 mutation using in vivo cultured cell models and in vitro biochemical assessments. Compared to control fibroblasts, homozygous R182W p55 primary dermal fibroblasts exhibit a two-fold slower doubling time, reduced mtDNA copy number and reduced levels of POLG and POLG2 transcripts correlating with the reported disease state. Expression of R182W p55 in HEK293 cells impairs oxidative-phosphorylation. Biochemically, R182W p55 displays DNA binding and association with p140 similar to WT p55. R182W p55 mimics the ability of WT p55 to stimulate primer extension, support steady-state nucleotide incorporation, and suppress the exonuclease function of Pol \u03b3 in vitro. However, R182W p55 has severe defects in protein stability as determined by differential scanning fluorimetry and in stimulating function as determined by thermal inactivation. These data demonstrate that the Chr17: 62492543G>A mutation in POLG2, R182W p55, severely impairs stability of the accessory subunit and is the likely cause of the disease phenotype.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Division", "Cell Respiration", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase", "Fibroblasts", "HEK293 Cells", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Mutation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Stability", "RNA, Messenger", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kirsten E", "Last Name": "Hoff", "Affiliation": "Genome Integrity and Structural Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Karen L", "Last Name": "DeBalsi", "Affiliation": "Genome Integrity and Structural Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, DHHS, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Maria J", "Last Name": "Sanchez-Quintero", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, H.

Mutations in a number of genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial [Fe-S] protein assembly lead to complex neurological phenotypes. One class of proteins essential in the early cluster assembly are ferredoxins. FDX2 is ubiquitously expressed and is essential in the de novo formation of [2Fe-2S] clusters in humans. We describe and genetically define a novel complex neurological syndrome identified in two Brazilian families, with a novel homozygous mutation in FDX2. Patients were clinically evaluated, underwent MRI, nerve conduction studies, EMG and muscle biopsy. To define the genetic aetiology, a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing was performed. We identified six patients from two apparently unrelated families with autosomal recessive inheritance of a complex neurological phenotype involving optic atrophy and nystagmus developing by age 3, followed by myopathy and recurrent episodes of cramps, myalgia and muscle weakness in the first or second decade of life. Sensory-motor axonal neuropathy led to progressive distal weakness. MRI disclosed a reversible or partially reversible leukoencephalopathy. Muscle biopsy demonstrated an unusual pattern of regional succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency with iron accumulation. The phenotype was mapped in both families to the same homozygous missense mutation in FDX2 (c.431C > T, p.P144L). The deleterious effect of the mutation was validated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, which demonstrated normal expression of FDX2 mRNA but severely reduced expression of FDX2 protein in muscle tissue. This study describes a novel complex neurological phenotype with unusual MRI and muscle biopsy features, conclusively mapped to a mutation in FDX2, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial

Mutations in several different structural CV subunits cause Leigh syndrome; however, dimerization defects have not been associated with human disease. We report four Leigh syndrome subjects from three unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish families harboring a homozygous splice-site mutation (c.87\u2009+\u20091G>C) in a novel CV subunit disease gene, USMG5. The Ashkenazi population allele frequency is 0.57%. This mutation produces two USMG5 transcripts, wild-type and lacking exon 3. Fibroblasts from two Leigh syndrome probands had reduced wild-type USMG5 mRNA expression and undetectable protein. The mutation did not alter monomeric CV expression, but reduced both CV dimer expression and ATP synthesis rate. Rescue with wild-type USMG5 cDNA in proband fibroblasts restored USMG5 protein, increased CV dimerization and enhanced ATP production rate.

TP dysfunction results in systemic accumulation of the noxious TP substrates thymidine and deoxyuridine. Gene therapy using either a lentiviral vector or adeno-associated vector (AAV) has proven to be a feasible strategy, as both vectors restore biochemical homeostasis in a murine model of the disease. This study shows that the effect of an AAV containing the TYMP coding sequence transcriptionally targeted to the liver persists long term in mice.

One promising candidate for treatment is the drug rapamycin, which has been shown to extend lifespan in multiple animal models, and which was previously shown to ameliorate mitochondrial disease in a knock-out mouse model lacking a nuclear-encoded gene specifying an OxPhos structural subunit (Ndufs4). In that model, relatively high-dose intraperitoneal rapamycin extended lifespan and improved markers of neurological disease, via an unknown mechanism. Here, we administered low-dose oral rapamycin to a knock-in (KI) mouse model of authentic mtDNA disease, specifically, progressive mtDNA depletion syndrome, resulting from a mutation in the mitochondrial nucleotide salvage enzyme thymidine kinase 2 (TK2). Importantly, low-dose oral rapamycin was sufficient to extend Tk2KI/KI mouse lifespan significantly, and did so in the absence of detectable improvements in mitochondrial dysfunction. We found no evidence that rapamycin increased survival by acting through canonical pathways, including mitochondrial autophagy. However, transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses uncovered systemic metabolic changes pointing to a potential 'rapamycin metabolic signature.' These changes also implied that rapamycin may have enabled the Tk2KI/KI mice to utilize alternative energy reserves, and possibly triggered indirect signaling events that modified mortality through developmental reprogramming. From a therapeutic standpoint, our results support the possibility that low-dose rapamycin, while not targeting the underlying mtDNA defect, could represent a crucial therapy for the treatment of mtDNA-driven, and some nuclear DNA-driven, mitochondrial diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Electron Transport Complex I", "Female", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Male", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Mutation", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Signal Transduction", "Sirolimus", "Syndrome", "Thymidine Kinase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephanie E", "Last Name": "Siegmund", "Affiliation": "Department of Cellular, Molecular and Biophysical Studies."}, {"First Name": "Hua", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Rohit", "Last Name": "Sharma", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Javors", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA."}, {"First Name": "Owen", "Last Name": "Skinner", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA."}, {"First Name": "Vamsi", "Last Name": "Mootha", "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Hirano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology."}, {"First Name": "Eric A", "Last Name": "Schon", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2017Dec01"}, {"PMID": "28878116", "Title": "Inhibition of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) prevents sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy by improving calcium handling and mitochondrial function.", "Abstract": "Cardiomyopathy frequently complicates sepsis and is associated with increased mortality. Increased cardiac oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been observed during sepsis, but the mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities have not been determined. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation could be responsible for sepsis-induced oxidative stress and cardiomyopathy. Treatment of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes with low concentrations of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide. Elevated mitochondrial superoxide was accompanied by depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, an indication of mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial calcium overload. NOX2 inhibition decreased LPS-induced superoxide and prevented mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic ablation of NOX2 did not have LPS-induced superoxide or mitochondrial dysfunction. LPS decreased contractility and calcium transient amplitude in isolated cardiomyocytes, and these abnormalities were prevented by inhibition of NOX2. LPS decreased systolic function in mice, measured by echocardiography. NOX2 inhibition was cardioprotective in 2 mouse models of sepsis, preserving systolic function after LPS injection or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). These data show that inhibition of NOX2 decreases oxidative stress, preserves intracellular calcium handling and mitochondrial function, and alleviates sepsis-induced systolic dysfunction in vivo.

Sponsors included the NIH, the Wellcome Trust, and the United Mitochondrial Diseases Foundation. Dietary supplements have historically been used in the management of PMD due to their potential benefits and perceived low risk, even though little evidence exists regarding their effectiveness. PMD are rare and clinically, phenotypically, and genetically heterogeneous. Thus patient recruitment for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has proven to be challenging. Only a few RCTs examining dietary supplements, singly or in combination with other vitamins and cofactors, are reported in the literature. Regulatory issues pertaining to the use of dietary supplements as treatment modalities further complicate the research and patient access landscape. As a preface to exploring a research agenda, the workshop included presentations and discussions on what PMD are; how nutritional interventions are used in PMD; challenges and barriers to their use; new technologies and approaches to diagnosis and treatment; research opportunities and resources; and perspectives from patient advocacy, industry, and professional organizations. Seven key areas were identified during the workshop. These areas were: 1) defining the disease, 2) clinical trial design, 3) biomarker selection, 4) mechanistic approaches, 5) challenges in using dietary supplements, 6) standards of clinical care, and 7) collaboration issues. Short- and long-term goals within each of these areas were identified. An example of an overarching goal is the enrollment of all individuals with PMD in a natural history study and a patient registry to enhance research capability.

Mitochondrial diseases are the most common group of inherited metabolic disorders and are among the most common forms of inherited neurological disorders. One of the challenges of mitochondrial diseases is the marked clinical variation seen in patients, which can delay diagnosis. However, advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have substantially improved diagnosis, particularly in children. Establishing a genetic diagnosis allows patients with mitochondrial diseases to have reproductive options, but this is more challenging for women with pathogenetic mtDNA mutations that are strictly maternally inherited. Recent advances in in vitro fertilization techniques, including mitochondrial donation, will offer a better reproductive choice for these women in the future. The treatment of patients with mitochondrial diseases remains a challenge, but guidelines are available to manage the complications of disease. Moreover, an increasing number of therapeutic options are being considered, and with the development of large cohorts of patients and biomarkers, several clinical trials are in progress.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Oxidative Phosphorylation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Gr\u00e1inne S", "Last Name": "Gorman", "Affiliation": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, Institute of Neuroscience, The Medical School Framlington Place, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Patrick F", "Last Name": "Chinnery", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Salvatore", "Last Name": "DiMauro", "Affiliation": "Houston Merritt Clinical Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Hirano", "Affiliation": "Houston Merritt Clinical Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yasutoshi", "Last Name": "Koga", "Affiliation": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University Graduate School of Medicine, Kurume University, Kurume, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Robert", "Last Name": "McFarland", "Affiliation": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, Institute of Neuroscience, The Medical School Framlington Place, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK."}, {"First Name": "Anu", "Last Name": "Suomalainen", "Affiliation": "Research Programs Unit, Molecular Neurology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "David R", "Last Name": "Thorburn", "Affiliation": "Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."}, {"First Name": "Massimo", "Last Name": "Zeviani", "Affiliation": "Mitochondrial Biology Unit, Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Douglass M", "Last Name": "Turnbull", "Affiliation": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, Institute of Neuroscience, The Medical School Framlington Place, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK."}], "Journal": "Nature reviews.

We identified a recurrent de novo ATAD3A c.1582C>T (p.Arg528Trp) variant by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in five unrelated individuals with a core phenotype of global developmental delay, hypotonia, optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We also describe two families with biallelic variants in ATAD3A, including a homozygous variant in two siblings, and biallelic ATAD3A deletions mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between ATAD3A and gene family members ATAD3B and ATAD3C. Tissue-specific overexpression of borR534W, the Drosophila mutation homologous to the human c.1582C>T (p.Arg528Trp) variant, resulted in a dramatic decrease in mitochondrial content, aberrant mitochondrial morphology, and increased autophagy. Homozygous null bor larvae showed a significant decrease of mitochondria, while overexpression of borWT resulted in larger, elongated mitochondria. Finally, fibroblasts of an affected individual exhibited increased mitophagy. We conclude that the p.Arg528Trp variant functions through a dominant-negative mechanism that results in small mitochondria that trigger mitophagy, resulting in a reduction in mitochondrial content.

Complementation experiments in yeast showed that the residual activity of the mutant proteins correlates with the clinical phenotypes observed in patients.We defined the structure of COQ2 with relevant implications for mutation screening in patients and demonstrated that, contrary to other COQ gene defects such as ADCK3, there is a correlation between COQ2 genotype and patient's phenotype.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alkyl and Aryl Transferases", "Ataxia", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genotype", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Muscle Weakness", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Severity of Illness Index", "Ubiquinone"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maria Andrea", "Last Name": "Desbats", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Valeria", "Last Name": "Morbidoni", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Micol", "Last Name": "Silic-Benussi", "Affiliation": "Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS (IOV), Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Mara", "Last Name": "Doimo", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo", "Last Name": "Ciminale", "Affiliation": "Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS (IOV), Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Matteo", "Last Name": "Cassina", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Sacconi", "Affiliation": "Centre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Maladies Neuromusculaires, H\u00f4pital Archet 1, Nice, France."}, {"First Name": "Michio", "Last Name": "Hirano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Basso", "Affiliation": "Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Fabien", "Last Name": "Pierrel", "Affiliation": "University of Grenoble Alpes, Laboratoire Technologies de l'Ing\u00e9nierie M\u00e9dicale et de la Complexit\u00e9 - Informatique, Math\u00e9matiques et Applications (TIMC-IMAG), Grenoble, France."}, {"First Name": "Placido", "Last Name": "Navas", "Affiliation": "Centro Andaluz de Biolog\u00eda del Desarrollo, CABD-CSIC, CIBERER, Instituto Carlos III, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Sevilla, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Leonardo", "Last Name": "Salviati", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Trevisson", "Affiliation": "Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy eva.trevisson@unipd.it."}], "Journal": "Human molecular genetics", "PubDate": "2016Oct01"}, {"PMID": "27460527", "Title": "Mitochondrial Diseases: A Clinical and Molecular History.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["DNA, Mitochondrial", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Humans", "Mitochondrial Diseases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Steven G", "Last Name": "Pavlakis", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Neurology, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, New York.

In this survey, we asked patients and their parents about their experiences taking these dietary supplements for mitochondrial disease. The survey was disseminated through the North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium (NAMDC) and the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) registries and gathered 162 responses. The study ascertained each patient's mitochondrial disease diagnosis, dietary supplements used, adjunct therapy, and effects of the supplements on symptoms and health. Regardless of the specific underlying mitochondrial disease, the majority of the survey respondents stated they are or have been on dietary supplements. Most patients take more than four supplements primarily coenzyme Q10, l-carnitine, and riboflavin. The majority of patients taking supplements reported health benefits from the supplements. The onset of perceived benefits was between 2weeks to 3months of initiating intake. Supplements seem to be safe, with only 28% of patients experiencing mild side-effects and only 5.6% discontinuing their intake due to intolerance. Only 9% of patients had insurance coverage for their supplements and when paying out of pocket, 95% of them spend up to $500/month. Despite the use of concomitant therapies (prescribed medications, physical therapy, diet changes and other), 45.5% of patients think that dietary supplements are the only intervention improving their symptoms. Some limitations of this study include the retrospective collection of data probably associated with substantial recall bias, lack of longitudinal follow up to document pre- and post-supplement clinical status and second hand reports by parents for children which may reflect parents' subjective interpretation of symptoms severity and supplements effect rather than real patients' experience.

To date, only allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has demonstrated long-term clinical efficacy, but high morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure necessitate the search for safer alternatives. In a previous study, we demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy using a lentiviral vector containing the coding sequence of TYMP restored the biochemical homeostasis in an animal model of MNGIE. In the present follow-up study, we show that ectopic expression of TP in the hematopoietic system restores normal nucleoside levels in plasma, as well as in tissues affected in MNGIE such as small intestine, skeletal muscle, brain, and liver. Mitochondrial dNTP pool imbalances observed in liver of the animal model were also corrected by the treatment. The biochemical effects were maintained at least 20 months even with low levels of chimerism.

Perturbations of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools are a recognized cause of mitochondrial genomic instability; therefore, we determined DNA copy number and dNTP levels in mitochondria of two models of MPV17 deficiency. In Mpv17 ablated mice, liver mitochondria showed substantial decreases in the levels of dGTP and dTTP and severe mitochondrial DNA depletion, whereas the dNTP pool was not significantly altered in kidney and brain mitochondria that had near normal levels of DNA. The shortage of mitochondrial dNTPs in Mpv17-/- liver slows the DNA replication in the organelle, as evidenced by the elevated level of replication intermediates. Quiescent fibroblasts of MPV17-mutant patients recapitulate key features of the primary affected tissue of the Mpv17-/- mice, displaying virtual absence of the protein, decreased dNTP levels and mitochondrial DNA depletion. Notably, the mitochondrial DNA loss in the patients' quiescent fibroblasts was prevented and rescued by deoxynucleoside supplementation. Thus, our study establishes dNTP insufficiency in the mitochondria as the cause of mitochondrial DNA depletion in MPV17 deficiency, and identifies deoxynucleoside supplementation as a potential therapeutic strategy for MPV17-related disease.

The molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that physiologic levels of saturated fat could increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiomyocytes, leading to abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function. We investigated the effect of saturated fat on mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis in isolated ventricular myocytes. The saturated fatty acid palmitate causes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in cardiomyocytes. Palmitate, but not the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate, causes an increase in both total cellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS. Palmitate depolarizes the mitochondrial inner membrane and causes mitochondrial calcium overload by increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak. Inhibitors of PKC or NOX2 prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and the increase in ROS, demonstrating that PKC-NOX2 activation is also required for amplification of palmitate induced-ROS. Cardiomyocytes from mice with genetic deletion of NOX2 do not have palmitate-induced ROS or mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that palmitate induces mitochondrial ROS that is amplified by NOX2, causing greater mitochondrial ROS generation and partial depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all known patients suffering from mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy who underwent allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2005 and 2011. Twenty-four patients, 11 males and 13 females, median age 25 years (range 10-41 years) treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from related (n = 9) or unrelated donors (n = 15) in 15 institutions worldwide were analysed for outcome and its associated factors. Overall, 9 of 24 patients (37.5%) were alive at last follow-up with a median follow-up of these surviving patients of 1430 days. Deaths were attributed to transplant in nine (including two after a second transplant due to graft failure), and to mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy in six patients. Thymidine phosphorylase activity rose from undetectable to normal levels (median 697 nmol/h/mg protein, range 262-1285) in all survivors. Seven patients (29%) who were engrafted and living more than 2 years after transplantation, showed improvement of body mass index, gastrointestinal manifestations, and peripheral neuropathy. Univariate statistical analysis demonstrated that survival was associated with two defined pre-transplant characteristics: human leukocyte antigen match (10/10 versus <10/10) and disease characteristics (liver disease, history of gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction or both). Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation can restore thymidine phosphorylase enzyme function in patients with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy and improve clinical manifestations of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy in the long term.

Mutations in FHL1 have been associated with diverse X-linked muscle diseases: scapuloperoneal (SP) myopathy, reducing body myopathy, X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy, rigid spine syndrome (RSS) and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. In 2008, we identified a missense mutation in the second LIM domain of FHL1 (c.365 G>C, p.W122S) in a family with SP myopathy. We generated a knock-in mouse model harboring the c.365 G>C Fhl1 mutation and investigated the effects of this mutation at three time points (3-5 months, 7-10 months and 18-20 months) in hemizygous male and heterozygous female mice. Survival was comparable in mutant and wild-type animals. We observed decreased forelimb strength and exercise capacity in adult hemizygous male mice starting from 7 to 10 months of age. Western blot analysis showed absence of Fhl1 in muscle at later stages. Thus, adult hemizygous male, but not heterozygous female, mice showed a slowly progressive phenotype similar to human patients with late-onset muscle weakness. In contrast to SP myopathy patients with the FHL1 W122S mutation, mutant mice did not manifest cytoplasmic inclusions (reducing bodies) in muscle. Because muscle weakness was evident prior to loss of Fhl1 protein and without reducing bodies, our findings indicate that loss of function is responsible for the myopathy in the Fhl1 W122S knock-in mice.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Forelimb", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Hemizygote", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "LIM Domain Proteins", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss", "Mutation, Missense", "Myocardium"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Emmanuele", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology Pediatric Clinic, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico G.

At a molecular level, fused in sarcoma (FUS), one of the familial ALS-linked proteins, has been demonstrated to directly interact with SMN, while impaired nuclear localization of mutated FUS causes defective gem formation. Our objective was to determine whether gems and/or nuclear FUS levels in skin derived fibroblasts from sporadic ALS patients are consistently reduced and thus could constitute a novel and readily available biomarker of the disease. Fibroblasts from 20 patients and 17 age-matched healthy controls were cultured and co-immunostained for SMN and FUS. Results showed that no difference was detected between the two groups in the number of gems and in expression pattern of FUS. The number of gems negatively correlated with the age at biopsy in both ALS and control subjects.

In this disease, autosomal recessive TYMP mutations cause severe reductions of thymidine phosphorylase activity; marked elevations of the pyrimidine nucleosides thymidine and deoxyuridine in plasma and tissues, and somatic multiple deletions, depletion and site-specific point mutations of mitochondrial DNA. Thymidine phosphorylase and uridine phosphorylase double knockout mice recapitulated several features of these patients including thymidine phosphorylase activity deficiency, elevated thymidine and deoxyuridine in tissues, mitochondrial DNA depletion, respiratory chain defects and white matter changes. However, in contrast to patients with this disease, mutant mice showed mitochondrial alterations only in the brain. To test the hypothesis that elevated levels of nucleotides cause unbalanced deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools and, in turn, pathogenic mitochondrial DNA instability, we have stressed double knockout mice with exogenous thymidine and deoxyuridine, and assessed clinical, neuroradiological, histological, molecular, and biochemical consequences. Mutant mice treated with exogenous thymidine and deoxyuridine showed reduced survival, body weight, and muscle strength, relative to untreated animals. Moreover, in treated mutants, leukoencephalopathy, a hallmark of the disease, was enhanced and the small intestine showed a reduction of smooth muscle cells and increased fibrosis. Levels of mitochondrial DNA were depleted not only in the brain but also in the small intestine, and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate imbalance was observed in the brain. The relative proportion, rather than the absolute amount of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, was critical for mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Thus, our results demonstrate that stress of exogenous pyrimidine nucleosides enhances the mitochondrial phenotype of our knockout mice.

Here, we report that AAV2/8-mediated transfer of the human TYMP coding sequence (hcTYMP) under the control of a liver-specific promoter prevents the biochemical imbalances in a murine model of MNGIE. hcTYMP expression was restricted to liver, and a dose as low as 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910(11) genome copies/kg led to a permanent reduction in systemic nucleoside levels to normal values in about 50% of treated mice. Higher doses resulted in reductions to normal or slightly below normal levels in virtually all mice treated. The nucleoside reduction achieved by this treatment prevented deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) depletion, which is the limiting factor affecting mtDNA replication in this disease.

Similar effects can be obtained by specific inhibition of dN catabolism using tetrahydrouridine (THU; inhibitor of cytidine deaminase) or immucillin H (inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase). In addition, using an MNGIE animal model, we provide evidence that mitochondrial dNTP content can be modulated in vivo by systemic administration of dCtd or THU.

The complexity of mitochondrial genetics provides one explanation for the clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial diseases, but our understanding of disease pathogenesis remains limited. Classification of Mendelian mitochondrial encephalomyopathies has been laborious, but whole-exome sequencing studies have revealed unexpected molecular aetiologies for both typical and atypical mitochondrial disease phenotypes. Mendelian mitochondrial defects can affect five components of mitochondrial biology: subunits of respiratory chain complexes (direct hits); mitochondrial assembly proteins; mtDNA translation; phospholipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane; or mitochondrial dynamics. A sixth category-defects of mtDNA maintenance-combines features of Mendelian and mitochondrial genetics. Genetic defects in mitochondrial dynamics are especially important in neurology as they cause optic atrophy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Therapy is inadequate and mostly palliative, but promising new avenues are being identified.
