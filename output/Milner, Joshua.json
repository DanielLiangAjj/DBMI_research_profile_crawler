[{"PMID": "38933266", "Title": "Soluble antigen arrays provide increased efficacy and safety over free peptides for tolerogenic immunotherapy.", "Abstract": "Autoantigen-specific immunotherapy using peptides offers a more targeted approach to treat autoimmune diseases, but clinical implementation has been challenging. We previously showed that multivalent delivery of peptides as soluble antigen arrays (SAgAs) efficiently protects against spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Here, we compared the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of SAgAs versus free peptides. SAgAs, but not their corresponding free peptides at equivalent doses, efficiently prevented the development of diabetes. SAgAs increased the frequency of regulatory T cells among peptide-specific T cells or induce their anergy/exhaustion or deletion, depending on the type of SAgA used (hydrolysable (hSAgA) and non-hydrolysable 'click' SAgA (cSAgA)) and duration of treatment, whereas their corresponding free peptides induced a more effector phenotype following delayed clonal expansion. Over time, the peptides induced an IgE-independent anaphylactic reaction, the incidence of which was significantly delayed when peptides were in SAgA form rather than in free form. Moreover, the N-terminal modification of peptides with aminooxy or alkyne linkers, which was needed for grafting onto hyaluronic acid to make hSAgA or cSAgA variants, respectively, influenced their stimulatory potency and safety, with alkyne-functionalized peptides being more potent and less anaphylactogenic than aminooxy-functionalized peptides. Immunologic anaphylaxis occurred in NOD mice in a dose-dependent manner but not in C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice; however, its incidence did not correlate with the level of anti-peptide antibodies. We provide evidence that SAgAs significantly improve the efficacy of peptides to induce tolerance and prevent autoimmune diabetes while at the same time reducing their anaphylactogenic potential.", "Keywords": ["anaphylaxis", "autoimmune diabetes", "immunotherapy", "peptide delivery", "peptide modification", "soluble antigen array"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Immune Tolerance", "Peptides", "Female", "Autoantigens", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Immunotherapy", "Anaphylaxis", "Desensitization, Immunologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebuma", "Last Name": "Firdessa-Fite", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie N", "Last Name": "Johnson", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Camillo", "Last Name": "Bechi Genzano", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Martin A", "Last Name": "Leon", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Ku", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Fernando A", "Last Name": "Ocampo Gonzalez", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy and Immunology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joshua O", "Last Name": "Sestak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cory", "Last Name": "Berkland", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States."}, {"First Name": "Remi J", "Last Name": "Creusot", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Department of Medicine and Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38851398", "Title": "Mast Cell Activation Syndrome: current understanding and research needs.", "Abstract": "Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a term applied to several clinical entities which have gained increased attention from patients and medical providers. While several descriptive publications about MCAS exist, there are many gaps in knowledge resulting in confusion about this clinical syndrome. Whether MCAS is a primary syndrome or exists as a constellation of symptoms in the context of known inflammatory, allergic, or clonal disorders associated with systemic mast cell (MC) activation is not well understood. More importantly, the underlying mechanisms and pathways that lead to MC activation in MCAS patients remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this manuscript is to summarize the known literature, identify gaps in knowledge, and highlight research needs.

Variants in cytokine production, cytokine signaling, epithelial barrier function, antigen presentation, receptor signaling, and cellular processes and metabolism can drive autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and/or allergic inflammation. Identification of these variants has improved our understanding of the role that many of these proteins play in skewing toward TH2-related allergic inflammation. Early-onset or atypical atopic disease, often in conjunction with immunodeficiency and/or autoimmunity, should raise suspicion for an IEI. This becomes a diagnostic dilemma if the initial clinical presentation is solely allergic inflammation, especially when the prevalence of allergic diseases is becoming more common. Genetic sequencing is necessary for IEI diagnosis and is helpful for early recognition and implementation of targeted treatment, if available. Although genetic evaluation is not feasible for all patients with atopy, identifying atopic patients with molecular immune abnormalities may be helpful for diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic purposes. In this review, we focus on IEI associated with TH2-driven allergic manifestations and classify them on the basis of the affected molecular pathways and predominant clinical manifestations.", "Keywords": ["Inborn errors of immunity", "allergic inflammation", "asthma", "atopic dermatitis", "atopy", "dysregulation", "eosinophilia", "immunomodulation", "mast cell dysregulation", "primary atopic disorders", "primary immunodeficiency"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alyssa E", "Last Name": "James", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md."}, {"First Name": "Manar", "Last Name": "Abdalgani", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Paneez", "Last Name": "Khoury", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra F", "Last Name": "Freeman", "Affiliation": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.

Disease-causing JAK1 gain-of-function (GoF) mutations are considered exceedingly rare and have been identified in only four families. Here, we use forward and reverse genetics to identify 59 individuals harboring one of four heterozygous JAK1 variants. In vitro and ex vivo analysis of these variants revealed hyperactive baseline and cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) levels compared with wild-type JAK1. A systematic review of electronic health records from the BioME Biobank revealed increased likelihood of clinical presentation with autoimmunity, atopy, colitis, and/or dermatitis in JAK1 variant-positive individuals. Finally, treatment of one affected patient with severe atopic dermatitis using the JAK1/JAK2-selective inhibitor, baricitinib, resulted in clinically significant improvement. These findings suggest that individually rare JAK1 GoF variants may underlie an emerging syndrome with more common presentations of autoimmune and inflammatory disease (JAACD syndrome). More broadly, individuals who present with such conditions may benefit from genetic testing for the presence of JAK1 GoF variants.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Autoimmunity", "Colitis",

We used rigorous criteria to recruit PI-ME/CFS participants with matched controls to conduct deep phenotyping. Among the many physical and cognitive complaints, one defining feature of PI-ME/CFS was an alteration of effort preference, rather than physical or central fatigue, due to dysfunction of integrative brain regions potentially associated with central catechol pathway dysregulation, with consequences on autonomic functioning and physical conditioning. Immune profiling suggested chronic antigenic stimulation with increase in na\u00efve and decrease in switched memory B-cells. Alterations in gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and metabolic pathways were consistent with cellular phenotypic studies and demonstrated differences according to sex.

Although most individuals recover within a few days or weeks from an acute infection, some experience longer lasting effects. Data regarding the postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC) in children, or long COVID, are only just emerging in the literature. These symptoms and conditions may reflect persistent symptoms from acute infection (eg, cough, headaches, fatigue, and loss of taste and smell), new symptoms like dizziness, or exacerbation of underlying conditions. Children may develop conditions de novo, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune conditions and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. This state-of-the-art narrative review provides a summary of our current knowledge about PASC in children, including prevalence, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical characteristics, underlying mechanisms, and functional outcomes, as well as a conceptual framework for PASC based on the current National Institutes of Health definition. We highlight the pediatric components of the National Institutes of Health-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, which seeks to characterize the natural history, mechanisms, and long-term health effects of PASC in children and young adults to inform future treatment and prevention efforts. These initiatives include electronic health record cohorts, which offer rapid assessments at scale with geographical and demographic diversity, as well as longitudinal prospective observational cohorts, to estimate disease burden, illness trajectory, pathobiology, and clinical manifestations and outcomes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Child", "Humans", "Autoimmune Diseases", "COVID-19", "Disease Progression", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome", "SARS-CoV-2", "Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome", "United States"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Suchitra", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."}, {"First Name": "Rachel S", "Last Name": "Gross", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pediatrics."}, {"First Name": "Sindhu", "Last Name": "Mohandas", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases."}, {"First Name": "Cheryl R", "Last Name": "Stein", "Affiliation": "Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Abigail", "Last Name": "Case", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Rehabilitation Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}, {"First Name": "Benard", "Last Name": "Dreyer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Radiology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Nathan M", "Last Name": "Pajor", "Affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "H Timothy", "Last Name": "Bunnell", "Affiliation": "Biomedical Research Informatics Center, Nemours Children's Health, Nemours Children's Hospital, Delaware, Wilmington, Delaware."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Warburton", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Radiology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth", "Last Name": "Berg", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan B", "Last Name": "Overdevest", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Gorelik", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Sejal", "Last Name": "Saxena", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "Ravi", "Last Name": "Jhaveri", "Affiliation": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Ann & Robert H.

Dominant-negative, loss-of-function (LOF) pathogenic variants in CARD11 result in CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-\u03baB signaling (CADINS) disease. Patients with CADINS suffer with severe atopic manifestations including atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and chronic spontaneous urticaria in addition to recurrent infections and autoimmunity. We assessed the response of dupilumab in five patients and omalizumab in one patient with CADINS for the treatment of severe atopic symptoms. CARD11 mutations were validated for pathogenicity using a T cell transfection assay to assess the impact on activation-induced signaling to NF-\u03baB. Three children and three adults with dominant-negative CARD11 LOF mutations were included. All developed atopic disease in infancy or early childhood. In five patients, atopic dermatitis was severe and recalcitrant to standard topical and systemic medications; one adult suffered from chronic spontaneous urticaria. Subcutaneous dupilumab was initiated to treat atopic dermatitis and omalizumab to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria. All six patients had rapid and sustained improvement in atopic symptoms with no complications during the follow-up period. Previous medications used to treat atopy were able to be decreased or discontinued. In conclusion, treatment with dupilumab and omalizumab for severe, refractory atopic disease in patients with CADINS appears to be effective and well tolerated in patients with CADINS with severe

nucleotide variants, but large-scale screening in primary human T cells is limited due to low editing efficiency, among other challenges 1 . Here, we developed a high-throughput approach for high-efficiency and massively parallel adenine and cytosine base-editor screening in primary human T cells. We performed multiple large-scale screens editing 102 genes with central functions in T cells and full-length tiling mutagenesis of selected genes, and read out variant effects on hallmarks of T cell anti-tumor immunity, including activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. We discovered a broad landscape of gain- and loss-of-function mutations, including in PIK3CD and its regulatory subunit encoded by PIK3R1, LCK , AKT1, CTLA-4 and JAK1 . We identified variants that affected several (e.g., PIK3CD C416R) or only selected (e.g. LCK Y505C) hallmarks of T cell activity, and functionally validated several hits by probing downstream signaling nodes and testing their impact on T cell polyfunctionality and proliferation. Using primary human T cells in which we engineered a T cell receptor (TCR) specific to a commonly presented tumor testis antigen as a model for cellular immunotherapy, we demonstrate that base edits identified in our screens can tune specific or broad T cell functions and ultimately improve tumor elimination while exerting minimal off-target activity. In summary, we present the first large-scale base editing screen in primary human T cells and provide a framework for scalable and targeted base editing at high efficiency. Coupled with multi-modal phenotypic mapping, we accurately nominate variants that produce a desirable T cell state and leverage these synthetic proteins to improve models of cellular cancer immunotherapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zachary H", "Last Name": "Walsh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Parin", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neeharika", "Last Name": "Kothapalli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gergo", "Last Name": "Nikolenyi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shivem B", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Leuzzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Mu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Patricia", "Last Name": "Ho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sinan", "Last Name": "Abuzaid", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zack D", "Last Name": "Brodtman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Neil", "Last Name": "Vasan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mohammed", "Last Name": "AlQuraishi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alberto", "Last Name": "Ciccia", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Johannes C", "Last Name": "Melms", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Izar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2023Dec14"}, {"PMID": "38134932", "Title": "Sensory neurons promote immune homeostasis in the lung.", "Abstract": "Cytokines employ downstream Janus kinases (JAKs) to promote chronic inflammatory diseases.

Additionally, expression of Calcb/CGRP\u03b2 was dependent on JAK1 in the vagus nerve, and CGRP\u03b2 suppressed group 2 innate lymphoid cell function and allergic airway inflammation.

Large-scale sequencing increasingly challenges notions about single-gene disorders. It is now apparent that monogenic etiologies make appreciable contributions to the population burden of disease and that they are underrecognized in clinical practice. A genetic diagnosis informs on molecular pathology and may direct targeted treatments and tailored prevention strategies for patients and family members. It also generates knowledge about disease pathogenesis and management that is relevant to patients without rare pathogenic variants. Inborn errors of immunity are a large class of monogenic etiologies that have been well-studied and contribute to the population burden of inflammatory diseases. To further delineate the contributions of inborn errors of immunity to the pathogenesis of skin disease, we performed a set of analyses that identified 316 inborn errors of immunity associated with skin pathologies, including common skin diseases. These data suggest that clinical sequencing is underutilized in dermatology. We next use these data to derive a network that illuminates the molecular relationships of these disorders and suggests an underlying etiological organization to immune-mediated skin disease. Our results motivate the further development of a molecularly derived and data-driven reorganization of clinical diagnoses of skin disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Dermatology", "Skin Diseases", "Skin", "Pathology, Molecular"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Annelise", "Last Name": "Colvin", "Affiliation": "Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soundos", "Last Name": "Youssef", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon."}, {"First Name": "Heeju", "Last Name": "Noh", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ghislaine", "Last Name": "Jumonville", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kathleen", "Last Name": "LaRow Brown", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Tatonetti", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, West Hollywood, California, USA; Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chunhua", "Last Name": "Weng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lindsey A", "Last Name": "Bordone", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lynn", "Last Name": "Petukhova", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Department of Dermatology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

Pathway studies show how ERBIN mutations allow for enhanced TGFb signaling, and prevent STAT3 from negative-regulating TGFb signaling. This likely explains many elements of clinical overlap between disorders of STAT3 and TGFb signaling. The excessive TGFb signaling leading to increased IL-4 receptor expression also provides the rationale for precision-based therapy blocking the IL-4 receptor to treat the atopic disease. The mechanism by which PGM3 deficiency leads to atopic phenotypes is not well understood, nor is the broad variability in disease penetrance and expressivity, though preliminary studies suggest an overlap with IL-6 receptor signaling defects.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, USA.

children results in mild or minimal symptoms, though in rare cases severe disease can develop, including a multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) with myocarditis. Here, we present longitudinal profiling of immune responses during acute disease and following recovery in children who developed MIS-C, relative to children who experienced more typical symptoms of COVID-19. T cells in acute MIS-C exhibited transient signatures of activation, inflammation, and tissue residency which correlated with cardiac disease severity, while T cells in acute COVID-19 upregulated markers of follicular helper T cells for promoting antibody production. The resultant memory immune response in recovery showed increased frequencies of virus-specific memory T cells with pro-inflammatory functions in children with prior MIS-C compared to COVID-19 while both cohorts generated comparable antibody responses.

Here we found that resting TH9 cells produced IL-9 independently of T cell receptor (TCR) restimulation, due to STAT5- and STAT6-dependent bystander activation. This mechanism was seen in circulating cells from allergic patients and was restricted to recently activated cells. STAT5-dependent Il9/IL9 regulatory elements underwent remodeling over time, inactivating the locus. A broader 'allergic TH9' transcriptomic and epigenomic program was also unstable. In vivo, TH9 cells induced airway inflammation via TCR-independent, STAT-dependent mechanisms. In allergic patients, TH9 cell expansion was associated with responsiveness to JAK inhibitors. These findings suggest that TH9 cell instability is a negative checkpoint on bystander activation that breaks down in allergy and that JAK inhibitors should be considered for allergic patients with TH9 cell expansion.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Interleukin-9", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer", "STAT5 Transcription Factor", "Chromatin", "Janus Kinase Inhibitors", "Inflammation", "Hypersensitivity", "Cell Differentiation", "STAT6 Transcription Factor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aran", "Last Name": "Son", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Francoise", "Last Name": "Meylan", "Affiliation": "Office of Science and Technology, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julio", "Last Name": "Gomez-Rodriguez", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zenia", "Last Name": "Kaul", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "McKella", "Last Name": "Sylvester", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guido H", "Last Name": "Falduto", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Estefania", "Last Name": "Vazquez", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tamara", "Last Name": "Haque", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Moses M", "Last Name": "Kitakule", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chujun", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kalpana", "Last Name": "Manthiram", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chen-Feng", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "Pathology Core, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jun", "Last Name": "Cheng", "Affiliation": "Embryonic Stem Cell and Transgenic Core, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rama K", "Last Name": "Gurram", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jinfang", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pamela", "Last Name": "Schwartzberg", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Allergy Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pamela A", "Last Name": "Frischmeyer-Guerrerio", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniella M", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Although clonal myeloid neoplasms are rare, the common cause for elevated BST levels is the genetic trait hereditary \u03b1-tryptasemia (H\u03b1T) caused by increased germline TPSAB1 copy number. To date, the precise structural variation and mechanism(s) underlying elevated BST in H\u03b1T and the general clinical utility of tryptase genotyping, remain undefined. Through cloning, long-read sequencing, and assembling of the human tryptase locus from an individual with H\u03b1T, and validating our findings in\u00a0vitro and in silico, we demonstrate that BST elevations arise from overexpression of replicated TPSAB1 loci encoding canonical \u03b1-tryptase protein owing to coinheritance of a linked overactive promoter element. Modeling BST levels based on TPSAB1 replication number, we generate new individualized clinical reference values for the upper limit of normal. Using this personalized laboratory medicine approach, we demonstrate the clinical utility of tryptase genotyping, finding that in the absence of H\u03b1T, BST levels >11.4 ng/mL frequently identify indolent clonal mast cell disease. Moreover, substantial BST elevations (eg, >100 ng/mL), which would ordinarily prompt bone marrow biopsy, can result from TPSAB1 replications alone and thus be within normal limits for certain individuals with H\u03b1T.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Tryptases", "Mast Cells", "Reference Values", "Unnecessary Procedures", "Mastocytosis", "Myeloproliferative Disorders"],

TRAF3 is often somatically mutated in B cell malignancies, but its role in human immunity is not defined. Here, in five unrelated families, we describe an immune dysregulation syndrome of recurrent bacterial infections, autoimmunity, systemic inflammation, B cell lymphoproliferation, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Affected individuals each had monoallelic mutations in TRAF3 that reduced TRAF3 expression. Immunophenotyping showed that patients' B cells were dysregulated, exhibiting increased nuclear factor-\u03baB 2 activation, elevated mitochondrial respiration, and heightened inflammatory responses. Patients had mild CD4+ T cell lymphopenia, with a reduced proportion of na\u00efve T cells but increased regulatory T cells and circulating T follicular helper cells. Guided by this clinical phenotype, targeted analyses demonstrated that common genetic variants, which also reduce TRAF3 expression, are associated with an increased risk of B cell malignancies, systemic lupus erythematosus, higher immunoglobulin levels, and bacterial infections in the wider population. Reduced TRAF3 conveys disease risks by driving B cell hyperactivity via intrinsic activation of multiple intracellular proinflammatory pathways and increased mitochondrial respiration, with a likely contribution from dysregulated T cell help. Thus, we define monogenic TRAF3 haploinsufficiency syndrome and demonstrate how common TRAF3 variants affect a range of human diseases.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Autoimmunity",

exaggerated type 2 inflammation. Although typically viewed as polygenic multifactorial disorders caused by the interaction of several genes with the environment, we have come to appreciate that allergic diseases can also be caused by monogenic variants affecting the immune system and the skin epithelial barrier. Through a myriad of genetic association studies and high-throughput sequencing tools, many monogenic and polygenic culprits of allergic diseases have been described. Identifying the genetic causes of atopy has shaped our understanding of how these conditions occur and how they may be treated and even prevented. Precision diagnostic tools and therapies that address the specific molecular pathways implicated in allergic inflammation provide exciting opportunities to improve our care for patients across the field of allergy and immunology. Here, we highlight offender genes implicated in polygenic and monogenic allergic diseases and list targeted therapeutic approaches that address these disrupted pathways.", "Keywords": ["Allergy", "Genetics", "Inborn errors of immunity", "Monogenic allergic diseases", "Monogenic atopy", "Precision medicine", "Primary atopic disorders", "Targeted therapeutics"], "MeSH terms": ["Criminals", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Hypersensitivity", "Hypersensitivity, Immediate", "Inflammation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Maryam", "Last Name": "Vaseghi-Shanjani", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Experimental Medicine Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Andrew L", "Last Name": "Snow", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Therapeutics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Md."}, {"First Name": "David J", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pa; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pa."}, {"First Name": "Meriem", "Last Name": "Latrous", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stuart E", "Last Name": "Turvey", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Experimental Medicine Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Catherine M", "Last Name": "Biggs", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Heterozygous germline IKZF1 haploinsufficient (IKZF1HI) and dominant-negative (IKZF1DN) variants in humans cause B cell immune deficiency and combined immunodeficiency. Here, we identified previously unidentified heterozygous IKZF1 variants (R183C/H) located in the DNA binding domain in eight individuals with inflammatory, autoimmune, allergic symptoms, and abnormal plasma cell (PC) proliferation. Leukocytes of patients exhibited specific defects including impaired IL-2 production by T cells, T helper (TH) skewing toward TH2, low numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg), eosinophilia, and abnormal PC proliferation. In contrast to IKZF1HI and IKZF1DN, IKZF1R183H/C proteins showed increased DNA binding associated with increased gene expression of TH2 and PC differentiation, thus demonstrating that IKZF1R183H/C behave as gain-of-function (GOF) alleles. In vitro treatment with lenalidomide, known to degrade IKZF1, corrected TH2 and PC abnormalities caused by IKZF1R183H/C.

alpha-tryptasemia (H\u03b1T) is an autosomal dominant (AD) genetic trait characterized by elevated basal serum tryptase \u22658\u00a0ng/mL, caused by increased \u03b1-tryptase-encoding TPSAB1 copy number. H\u03b1T affects 5% to 7% of Western populations and has been associated with joint hypermobility. Hypermobility disorders are likewise frequently AD, but genetic etiologies are often elusive. Genotyping of individuals with hypermobility spectrum disorder (n = 132), hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (n = 78), or axial skeletal abnormalities with hypermobility (n = 56) was performed.

Acute cardiac dysfunction and resultant cardiogenic shock are common in children with MIS-C. While most children recover rapidly from acute illness, the long-term impact on the myocardium and cardiac function is unknown. Methods In this prospective study, cardiac MRI (CMR) was performed on patients <21 years of age with a history of MIS-C, 6-9 months following hospitalization. Per institutional protocol, patients with any history of LVEF<50%, persistent cardiorespiratory symptoms, or ECG abnormalities underwent clinical CMR. Research CMRs were offered to all others >10 years old. Native T1 and T2 mapping values were compared with 20 children with normal CMR examinations. Results We performed CMRs on 13 subjects at a median age of 13.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 11.9-16.0) and a median time from hospitalization of 8.2 months (IQR 6.8-9.6). Twelve subjects displayed normal ventricular function with a median left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57.2% (IQR 56.1-58.4) and median right ventricular (RV) EF of 53.1% (IQR 52.0-55.7). One subject had low normal EF (52%). There was normal T2 and native T1 as compared to normal controls. There was qualitatively no evidence of edema by T2 weighted imaging. One subject had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at the inferior insertion point and mid-ventricular inferolateral region, with normal EF, no evidence of edema or perfusion defects, and normal T1 and T2 times. When stratifying by a history of abnormal LVEF (LVEF <55%) on echocardiography, there was no difference in or parametric mapping values, though LVEF and LVEDV approached significance (p=0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Conclusions Although many children with MIS-C present acutely with cardiac dysfunction, myocardial recovery is overall excellent with minimal to no evidence of residual cardiac dysfunction or myocardial involvement. LVEF by CMR at 6-9 months among children with history of echocardiographic LV dysfunction is slightly lower, though does not meet statistical significance and is still within normal range. The long-term functional implications of this finding and the cardiac implications of MIS-C more broadly are unclear and warrant further study.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael P", "Last Name": "Dilorenzo", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Kanwal M", "Last Name": "Farooqi", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Amee M", "Last Name": "Shah", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Channing", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Jamie K", "Last Name": "Harrington", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Thomas J", "Last Name": "Connors", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Martirosyan", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Usha S", "Last Name": "Krishnan", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Ferris", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Rachel J", "Last Name": "Weller", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Donna L", "Last Name": "Farber", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Gorelik", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Erika B", "Last Name": "Rosenzweig", "Affiliation": "cuimc:Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Brett R", "Last Name": "Anderson", "Affiliation": "CUIMC: Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Research square", "PubDate": "2022Jan24"}, {"PMID": "35093604", "Title": "Targeted IL-4R\u03b1 blockade ameliorates refractory allergic eosinophilic inflammation in a patient with dysregulated TGF-\u03b2 signaling due to ERBIN deficiency.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Eosinophilia", "Humans", "Hypersensitivity", "Inflammation", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H Richard", "Last Name": "Droghini", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "J Pablo", "Last Name": "Abonia", "Affiliation": "Division of Pathology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Margaret H", "Last Name": "Collins", "Affiliation": "Division of Pathology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan J", "Last Name": "Lyons", "Affiliation": "Translational Allergic Immunopathology Unit, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md."}, {"First Name": "Alexandra F", "Last Name": "Freeman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md."}, {"First Name": "Vincent A", "Last Name": "Mukkada", "Affiliation": "Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Kimberly A", "Last Name": "Risma", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Marc E", "Last Name": "Rothenberg", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."}, {"First Name": "Justin T", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.

The STAT family of transcription factors orchestrate hematopoietic cell differentiation. Patients with de novo activating mutations of STAT3 present with multiorgan autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and recurrent infections. We conducted a detailed characterization of the blood monocyte and dendritic cell (DC) subsets in patients with gain-of-function (GOF) mutations across the gene. We found a selective deficiency in circulating nonclassical CD16+ and intermediate CD16+CD14+ monocytes and a significant increase in the percentage of classical CD14+ monocytes. This suggests a role for STAT3 in the transition of classical CD14+ monocytes into the CD16+ nonclassical subset. Developmentally, ex vivo-isolated STAT3GOF CD14+ monocytes fail to differentiate into CD1a+ monocyte-derived DCs. Moreover, patients with STAT3GOF mutations display reduced circulating CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and frequency of myeloid DCs. Specifically, we observed a reduction in the CD141+ DC population, with no difference in the frequencies of CD1c+ and plasmacytoid DCs. CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients were found to differentiate into CD1c+ DCs, but failed to differentiate into CD141+ DCs indicating an intrinsic role for STAT3 in this process. STAT3GOF-differentiated DCs produced lower amounts of CCL22 than healthy DCs, which could further explain some of the patient pathological phenotypes. Thus, our findings provide evidence that, in humans, STAT3 serves to regulate development and differentiation of nonclassical CD16+ monocytes and a subset of myeloid DCs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cell Differentiation", "Child", "Dendritic Cells", "Female", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monocytes", "Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases", "Receptors, IgG", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Thrombomodulin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Korenfeld", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Immunobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Kate", "Last Name": "Roussak", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Immunobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Dinkel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Immunobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Tiphanie P", "Last Name": "Vogel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology/Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Henry", "Last Name": "Pollack", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Joseph", "Last Name": "Levy", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer W", "Last Name": "Leiding", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Allergy and Immunology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL; and."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Megan", "Last Name": "Cooper", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology/Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO."}, {"First Name": "Eynav", "Last Name": "Klechevsky", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Immunology, Division of Immunobiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; eklechevsky@wustl.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)", "PubDate": "2021Nov15"}, {"PMID": "34634105", "Title": "Assessing the safety of bioactive ingredients in infant formula that affect the immune system: recommendations from an expert panel.", "Abstract": "Bioactive ingredients for infant formula have been sought to reduce disparities in health outcomes between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Traditional food safety methodologies have limited ability to assess some bioactive ingredients. It is difficult to assess the effects of nutrition on the infant immune system because of coincident developmental adaptations to birth, establishment of the microbiome and introduction to solid foods, and perinatal environmental factors. An expert panel was convened to review information on immune system development published since the 2004 Institute of Medicine report on evaluating the safety of new infant formula ingredients and to recommend measurements that demonstrate the safety of bioactive ingredients intended for that use. Panel members participated in a 2-d virtual symposium in November 2020 and in follow-up discussions throughout early 2021. Key topics included identification of immune system endpoints from nutritional intervention studies, effects of human milk feeding and human milk substances on infant health outcomes, ontologic development of the infant immune system, and microbial influences on tolerance. The panel explored how \"nonnormal\" conditions such as preterm birth, allergy, and genetic disorders could help define developmental immune markers for healthy term infants. With consideration of breastfed infants as a reference, ensuring proper control groups, and attention to numerous potential confounders, the panel recommended a set of standard clinical endpoints including growth, response to vaccination, infection and other adverse effects related to inflammation, and allergy and atopic diseases. It compiled a set of candidate markers to characterize stereotypical patterns of immune system development during infancy, but absence of reference ranges, variability in methods and populations, and unreliability of individual markers to predict disease prevented the panel from including many markers as safety endpoints. The panel's findings and recommendations are applicable for industry, regulatory, and academic settings, and will inform safety assessments for immunomodulatory ingredients in foods besides infant formula.", "Keywords": ["bioactives", "development", "human milk", "immune system", "immunomodulation", "infant", "infant formula", "nutrition", "safety recommendations"], "MeSH terms": ["Female", "Food Ingredients", "Humans", "Immune System", "Infant", "Infant Formula", "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Phytochemicals"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Emily A", "Last Name": "Callahan", "Affiliation": "EAC Health and Nutrition, LLC, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Talal", "Last Name": "Chatila", "Affiliation": "Boston Children's Hospital, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard J", "Last Name": "Deckelbaum", "Affiliation": "Institute of Human Nutrition and Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine J", "Last Name": "Field", "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural, Food & Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Frank R", "Last Name": "Greer", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics (Emeritus), University of Wisconsin, WI, USA."}, {"First Name": "Olle", "Last Name": "Hernell", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden."}, {"First Name": "Kirsi M", "Last Name": "J\u00e4rvinen", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronald E", "Last Name": "Kleinman", "Affiliation": "Harvard Medical School, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Josef", "Last Name": "Neu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, FL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kinga K", "Last Name": "Smolen", "Affiliation": "Boston Children's Hospital, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "John C", "Last Name": "Wallingford", "Affiliation": "Nutrispectives, LLC, WA, USA."}], "Journal": "The American journal of clinical nutrition", "PubDate": "2022Feb09"}, {"PMID": "34400315", "Title": "Clinical relevance of inherited genetic differences in human tryptases: Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia and beyond.", "Abstract": "To describe our current understanding of hereditary \u03b1-tryptasemia (H\u03b1T), how H\u03b1T fits into the evolutionary context of tryptases and contemporary framework of mast cell-associated disorders, and to discuss the future clinical and therapeutic landscape for symptomatic individuals with H\u03b1T.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Anaphylaxis", "Humans", "Mast Cell Activation Syndrome", "Mast Cells", "Mastocytosis", "Tryptases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sarah C", "Last Name": "Glover", "Affiliation": "Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi; Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida."}, {"First Name": "Melody C", "Last Name": "Carter", "Affiliation": "Mast Cell Biology Section, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Koro\u0161ec", "Affiliation": "University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases, Golnik, Slovenia."}, {"First Name": "Patrizia", "Last Name": "Bonadonna", "Affiliation": "Allergy Unit, Verona University Hospital, Verona, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence B", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Rheumatology, Columbia University, New York, New York."}, {"First Name": "George H", "Last Name": "Caughey", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California."}, {"First Name": "Dean D", "Last Name": "Metcalfe", "Affiliation": "Mast Cell Biology Section, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan J", "Last Name": "Lyons", "Affiliation": "Translational Allergic Immunopathology Unit, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic drove the need for rapid vaccine production applying a novel antigen delivery system: messenger RNA vaccines packaged in lipid nanoparticles. Unexpectedly, public vaccine administration led to a small number of severe allergic reactions, with resultant substantial public concern, especially within atopic individuals. We reviewed the constituents of the messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine and considered several contributors to these reactions: (1) contact system activation by nucleic acid, (2) complement recognition of the vaccine-activating allergic effector cells, (3) preexisting antibody recognition of polyethylene glycol, a lipid nanoparticle surface hydrophilic polymer, and (4) direct mast cell activation, coupled with potential genetic or environmental predispositions to hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, measurement of anti-polyethylene glycol antibodies in\u00a0vitro is not clinically available, and the predictive value of skin testing to polyethylene glycol components as a coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccine-specific anaphylaxis marker is unknown. Even less is known regarding the applicability of vaccine use for testing (in\u00a0vitro/vivo) to ascertain pathogenesis or predict reactivity risk.

Patients with CGD also suffer from disorders of inflammation and immune dysregulation including colitis and granulomatous lung disease, among others. Additionally, patients with CGD may be at increased risk of systemic inflammatory disorders such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The presentation of HLH often overlaps with symptoms of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis and therefore can be difficult to identify, especially in patients with a primary immune deficiency in which incidence of infection is increased. Thorough evaluation and empiric treatment for bacterial and fungal infections is necessary as HLH in CGD is almost always secondary to infection. Simultaneous treatment of infection with anti-microbials and inflammation with immunosuppression may be needed to blunt the hyperinflammatory response in secondary HLH. Herein, we present a series of X-linked CGD patients who developed HLH secondary to or with concurrent disseminated CGD-related infection. In two patients, CGD was a known diagnosis prior to development of HLH and in the other two CGD was diagnosed as part of the evaluation for HLH.

Disruption of any protein involved in this pathway leads to severe immunodeficiency and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Here, we describe an infant with severe immunodeficiency who was found to have novel biallelic mutations in SLP76. SLP76 is a key protein involved in TCR signaling and in other hematopoietic pathways. Previous studies of this protein were performed using Jurkat-derived human leukemic T cell lines and SLP76-deficient mice. Our current study links this gene, for the first time, to a human immunodeficiency characterized by early-onset life-threatening infections, combined T and B cell immunodeficiency, severe neutrophil defects, and impaired platelet aggregation. Hereby, we characterized aspects of the patient's immune phenotype, modeled them with an SLP76-deficient Jurkat-derived T cell line, and rescued some consequences using ectopic expression of wild-type SLP76. Understanding human diseases due to SLP76 deficiency is helpful in explaining the mixed T cell and neutrophil defects, providing a guide for exploring human SLP76 biology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein. Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.

"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms":

There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.

These patients present with immunodeficiency accompanied by severe nonimmunological features, including skeletal, connective tissue, and vascular abnormalities, poor postinfection lung healing, and subsequent pulmonary failure. No specific therapies are available for these abnormalities. Here, we investigated underlying mechanisms in order to identify therapeutic targets. Histological analysis of skin wounds demonstrated delayed granulation tissue formation and vascularization during skin-wound healing in AD-HIES patients. Global gene expression analysis in AD-HIES patient skin fibroblasts identified deficiencies in a STAT3-controlled transcriptional network regulating extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and angiogenesis, with hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) being a major contributor. Consistent with this, histological analysis of skin wounds and coronary arteries from AD-HIES patients showed decreased HIF-1\u03b1 expression and revealed abnormal organization of the ECM and altered formation of the coronary vasa vasorum. Disease modeling using cell culture and mouse models of angiogenesis and wound healing confirmed these predicted deficiencies and demonstrated therapeutic benefit of HIF-1\u03b1-stabilizing drugs.

The mutant alleles encode GP130 receptors bearing the transmembrane domain but lacking both the recycling motif and all four STAT3-recruiting tyrosine residues.

The monogenic disorder called hereditary \u03b1-tryptasemia, due to increased \u03b1-tryptase gene copies and protein expression, presents with clinical features such as vibratory urticaria and dysautonomia. We show that heterotetramers composed of 2\u03b1- and 2\u03b2-tryptase protomers (\u03b1/\u03b2-tryptase) form naturally in individuals who express \u03b1-tryptase. \u03b1/\u03b2-Tryptase, but not homotetramer, activates protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), which is expressed on cell types such as smooth muscle, neurons, and endothelium. Also, only \u03b1/\u03b2-tryptase makes mast cells susceptible to vibration-triggered degranulation by cleaving the \u03b1 subunit of the EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 2 (EMR2) mechanosensory receptor. Allosteric effects of \u03b1-tryptase protomers on neighboring \u03b2-tryptase protomers likely result in the novel substrate repertoire of \u03b1/\u03b2-tryptase tetramers that in turn cause some of the clinical features of hereditary \u03b1-tryptasemia and of other disorders involving mast cells.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Allosteric Regulation", "Cell Degranulation", "Female", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Humans", "Male", "Mast Cells", "Protein Multimerization", "Receptor, PAR-2", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Tryptases", "Vibration"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Quang T", "Last Name": "Le", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan J", "Last Name": "Lyons", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Andrea N", "Last Name": "Naranjo", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Ana", "Last Name": "Olivera", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Lazarus", "Affiliation": "Department of Early Discovery Biochemistry, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA."}, {"First Name": "Dean D", "Last Name": "Metcalfe", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Lawrence B", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA lbschwar@vcu.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "PubDate": "2019Oct07"}, {"PMID": "31302571", "Title": "Gene-environment interactions in primary atopic disorders.", "Abstract": "Environmental factors modify disease presentation and severity in allergic disorders.

Environmental factors such as diet, the microbiome at the epithelial-environment interface, the presence and/or extent of infection, and psychologic stress can alter disease phenotypic expression of allergic diseases, and PADs provide discrete contexts in which to understand these influences. We outline how gene-environment interactions likely contribute to a variable penetrance and expressivity in PADs. Dietary modifications of both macronutrients and/or micronutrients alter T-cell metabolism and may influence effector T-cell function. The mucosal microbiome may affect local inflammation and may remotely influence regulatory elements, while psychologic stress can affect mast cell and other allergic effector cell function.

RA acts through its receptor RAR\u03b1 to repress transcription of inflammatory cytokines, but is also essential for Th-mediated immunity, indicating complex effects of RA on Th specification and the outcome of the immune response. We examined the impact of RA on the genome-wide transcriptional response during Th differentiation to multiple subsets. RA effects were subset-selective and were most significant in Th9 cells. RA globally antagonized Th9-promoting transcription factors and inhibited Th9 differentiation. RA directly targeted the extended Il9 locus and broadly modified the Th9 epigenome through RAR\u03b1. RA-RAR\u03b1 activity limited murine Th9-associated pulmonary inflammation, and human allergic inflammation was associated with reduced expression of RA target genes. Thus, repression of the Th9 program is a major function of RA-RAR\u03b1 signaling in Th differentiation, arguing for a role for RA in interleukin 9 (IL-9) related diseases.", "Keywords": ["ATAC-seq", "ChIP-seq", "Enhancers", "Interleukin 9", "Interleukins", "RNA sequencing", "Retinoic acid", "T helper cells", "Th9 cells", "vitamin A"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Epigenetic Repression", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Hypersensitivity", "Interleukin-9", "Lung", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Pneumonia", "Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer", "Transcription, Genetic", "Tretinoin"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Daniella M", "Last Name": "Schwartz", "Affiliation": "Molecular Immunology and Inflammation Branch, NIAMS, NIH, Rockville, MD 20892, USA; Genenetics and Pathogenesis of Allergy Section, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Rockville, MD 20892, USA.

To meet these emerging needs, the project has added new content, language translations, mappings and computational tooling, as well as integrations with external community data.

The functional relationships of the PLC\u03b32S707Y mutation to other PLCG2 mutations causing (i) Btk inhibitor resistance of CLL cells and (ii) the APLAID-related human disease PLC\u03b32-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation, PLAID, revealing different clinical characteristics including cold-induced urticaria, respectively, are currently incompletely understood. Here, we show that PLC\u03b32S707 point mutants displayed much higher activities at 37\u00b0 C than the CLL Btk inhibitor resistance mutants R665W and L845F and the two PLAID mutants, PLC\u03b32\u039419 and PLC\u03b32\u039420-22. Combinations of CLL Btk inhibitor resistance mutations synergized to enhance PLC\u03b32 activity, with distinct functional consequences for different temporal orders of the individual mutations. Enhanced activity of PLC\u03b32S707Y was not observed in a cell-free system, suggesting that PLC\u03b32 activation in intact cells is dependent on regulatory rather than mutant-enzyme-inherent influences. Unlike the two PLAID mutants, PLC\u03b32S707Y was insensitive to activation by cooling and retained marked hyperresponsiveness to activated Rac upon cooling. In contrast to the PLAID mutants, which are insensitive to activation by endogenously expressed EGF receptors, the S707Y mutation markedly enhanced the stimulatory effect of EGF, explaining some of the pathophysiological discrepancies between immune cells of PLAID and APLAID patients in response to receptor-tyrosine-kinase activation.", "Keywords": ["B cell signaling", "Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase", "autoinflammation", "chronic lymphocytic leukemia", "inositol phosphates"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Walliser", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Wist", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Elisabeth", "Last Name": "Hermkes", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anja", "Last Name": "Schade", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Haas", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Deinzer", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Laurent", "Last Name": "D\u00e9sir\u00e9", "Affiliation": "Diaxonhit, Paris 75013, France."}, {"First Name": "Shawn S C", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and The Siebens-Drake Medical Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Stilgenbauer", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gierschik", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany."}], "Journal": "Oncotarget", "PubDate": "2018Sep28"}, {"PMID": "30283440", "Title": "The CBM-opathies-A Rapidly Expanding Spectrum of Human Inborn Errors of Immunity Caused by Mutations in the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 Complex.", "Abstract": "The caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11 or CARMA1)-B cell CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-MALT1 paracaspase (MALT1) [CBM] signalosome complex serves as a molecular bridge between cell surface antigen receptor signaling and the activation of the NF-\u03baB, JNK, and mTORC1 signaling axes.

The transcription factor Ikaros has been shown to play a critical role in lymphoid cell development and differentiation; however, its function in myeloid cells and innate immune responses is less appreciated. Using comprehensive genomic analysis of Ikaros-dependent transcription, DNA binding, and chromatin accessibility, we describe unexpected dual repressor and activator functions for Ikaros in the LPS response of murine macrophages. Consistent with the described function of Ikaros as transcriptional repressor, Ikzf1-/- macrophages showed enhanced induction for select responses. In contrast, we observed a dramatic defect in expression of many delayed LPS response genes, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses support a key role for Ikaros in sustained NF-\u03baB chromatin binding. Decreased Ikaros expression in Ikzf1+/- mice and human cells dampens these Ikaros-enhanced inflammatory responses, highlighting the importance of quantitative control of Ikaros protein level for its activator function. In the absence of Ikaros, a constitutively open chromatin state was coincident with dysregulation of LPS-induced chromatin remodeling, gene expression, and cytokine responses. Together, our data suggest a central role for Ikaros in coordinating the complex macrophage transcriptional program in response to pathogen challenge.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Chromatin", "Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Ikaros Transcription Factor", "Inflammation", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "RAW 264.7 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyu-Seon", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Rachel A", "Last Name": "Gottschalk", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Nicolas W", "Last Name": "Lounsbury", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Michael G", "Last Name": "Dorrington", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Systems Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892."}, {"First Name": "Songjoon", "Last Name": "Baek", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;

Here, we review known single-gene disorders leading to severe allergic phenotypes in humans, discuss how the revealed pathways fit within our current understanding of the atopic diathesis, and propose how some pathways might be targeted for therapeutic benefit.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Dermatitis, Atopic", "Humans", "Hypersensitivity", "Phenotype", "Signal Transduction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathan J", "Last Name": "Lyons", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD jdmilner@niaid.nih.gov."}], "Journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "PubDate": "2018Apr02"}, {"PMID": "29406845", "Title": "Learning from Job: A Rare Genetic Disease and Lessons of Biblical Proportions.", "Abstract": "Dominant negative mutations in STAT3, a critical signaling molecule and transcription factor in multiple organ systems, lead to a rare monogenic disease called the STAT3 loss-of-function, autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (STAT3LOF AD-HIES).

Additionally, quite a few phenotypic descriptions from the Book of Job are similar to those seen in patients with STAT3LOF AD-HIES, beyond just the boils.

Here, we developed a mouse model of S. aureus skin reinfection to investigate protective memory responses. In contrast with WT mice, IL-1\u03b2-deficient mice exhibited poor neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance during primary infection that was rescued during secondary S. aureus challenge. The \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from skin-draining LNs utilized compensatory T cell-intrinsic TLR2/MyD88 signaling to mediate rescue by trafficking and producing TNF and IFN-\u03b3, which restored neutrophil recruitment and promoted bacterial clearance. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the LNs revealed a clonotypic S. aureus-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cell expansion with a complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) aa sequence identical to that of invariant V\u03b35+ dendritic epidermal T cells. However, this T cell receptor \u03b3 (TRG) aa sequence of the dominant CDR3 sequence was generated from multiple gene rearrangements of TRGV5 and TRGV6, indicating clonotypic expansion. TNF- and IFN-\u03b3-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were also expanded in peripheral blood of IRAK4-deficient humans no longer predisposed to S. aureus skin infections.

This calcium channel, encoded by CACNA1H, overlaps the human tryptase locus, wherein increased TPSAB1 copy number causes hereditary \u03b1-tryptasemia. Germ-line CACNA1H variants may contribute to the variable expressivity observed with this genetic trait.MethodsTryptase-encoding sequences at TPSAB1 and TPSB2, and TPSG1 and CACNA1H variants were genotyped in 46 families with hereditary \u03b1-tryptasemia syndrome. Electrophysiology was performed on tsA201 HEK cells transfected with wild-type or variant CACNA1H constructs. Effects on clinical phenotypes were interrogated in families with TPSAB1 duplications and in volunteers from the ClinSeq cohort.ResultsThree nonsynonymous variants in CACNA1H (rs3751664, rs58124832, and rs72552056) cosegregated with TPSAB1 duplications in 32/46 families and were confirmed to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD). In vitro, variant CaV3.2 had functional effects: reducing current densities, and altering inactivation and deactivation properties. No clinical differences were observed in association with the CACNA1H haplotype.ConclusionA previously unrecognized haplotype containing three functional CACNA1H variants is relatively common among Caucasians, and is frequently coinherited on the same allele as additional TPSAB1 copies.

We, therefore, examined cytokine signaling and CD4+ T cell differentiation in these cohorts to characterize common pathways. As expected, differentiation of Th17 cells was impaired in both cohorts. We found that STAT1 was hyperphosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation in both cohorts and that STAT1-dependent PD-L1 up-regulation-known to inhibit Th17 differentiation in mouse models-was markedly enhanced as well. Overexpression of SOCS3 strongly inhibited phosphorylation of STAT1 and PD-L1 up-regulation, suggesting that diminished SOCS3 expression may lead to the observed effects. Defects in Th17 differentiation could be partially overcome in vitro via PD-L1 inhibition and in a mouse model of STAT3 loss-of-function by crossing them with PD-1 knockout mice.

Through next-generation sequencing on a cohort of patients with severe atopic dermatitis with and without comorbid infections, we found eight individuals, from four families, with novel heterozygous mutations in CARD11, which encodes a scaffolding protein involved in lymphocyte receptor signaling. Disease improved over time in most patients. Transfection of mutant CARD11 expression constructs into T cell lines demonstrated both loss-of-function and dominant-interfering activity upon antigen receptor-induced activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Patient T cells had similar defects, as well as low production of the cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). The mTORC1 and IFN-\u03b3 production defects were partially rescued by supplementation with glutamine, which requires CARD11 for import into T cells. Our findings indicate that a single hypomorphic mutation in CARD11 can cause potentially correctable cellular defects that lead to atopic dermatitis.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amino Acid

One patient died at age 12 with progressive intra-abdominal aspergillosis. The other patient had presented with intra-abdominal candidiasis at age 9, and developed central nervous system aspergillosis at age 18 and intra-abdominal aspergillosis at age 25. Neither patient developed Aspergillus infection of the lungs. One patient had homozygous M1I CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain family member 9) mutation, while the other had homozygous Q295X CARD9 mutation; both patients lacked CARD9 protein expression. The patients had normal monocyte and Th17 cell numbers in peripheral blood, but their mononuclear cells exhibited impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines upon fungus-specific stimulation. Neutrophil phagocytosis, killing, and oxidative burst against Aspergillus fumigatus were intact, but neither patient accumulated neutrophils in infected tissue despite normal neutrophil numbers in peripheral blood. The neutrophil tissue accumulation defect was not caused by defective neutrophil-intrinsic chemotaxis, indicating that production of neutrophil chemoattractants in extrapulmonary tissue is impaired in CARD9 deficiency.

Here, we have shown that WAS patients and mice deficient in WAS protein (WASP) frequently develop IgE-mediated reactions to common food allergens. WASP-deficient animals displayed an adjuvant-free IgE-sensitization to chow antigens that was most pronounced for wheat and soy and occurred under specific pathogen-free as well as germ-free housing conditions. Conditional deletion of Was in FOXP3+ Tregs resulted in more severe Th2-type intestinal inflammation than that observed in mice with global WASP deficiency, indicating that allergic responses to food allergens are dependent upon loss of WASP expression in this immune compartment. While WASP-deficient Tregs efficiently contained Th1- and Th17-type effector differentiation in vivo, they failed to restrain Th2 effector responses that drive allergic intestinal inflammation. Loss of WASP was phenotypically associated with increased GATA3 expression in effector memory FOXP3+ Tregs, but not in naive-like FOXP3+ Tregs, an effect that occurred independently of increased IL-4 signaling.

PLAID.", "Abstract": "Deletions in the gene encoding signal-transducing inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C-\u03b32 (PLC\u03b32) are associated with the novel human hereditary disease PLAID (PLC\u03b32-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation). PLAID is characterized by a rather puzzling concurrence of augmented and diminished functions of the immune system, such as cold urticaria triggered by only minimal decreases in temperature, autoimmunity, and immunodeficiency. Understanding of the functional effects of the genomic alterations at the level of the affected enzyme, PLC\u03b32, is currently lacking. PLC\u03b32 is critically involved in coupling various cell surface receptors to regulation of important functions of immune cells such as mast cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils. PLC\u03b32 is unique by carrying three Src (SH) and one split pleckstrin homology domain (spPH) between the two catalytic subdomains (spPHn-SH2n-SH2c-SH3-spPHc). Prevailing evidence suggests that activation of PLC\u03b32 is primarily due to loss of SH-region-mediated autoinhibition and/or enhanced plasma membrane translocation. Here, we show that the two PLAID PLC\u03b32 mutants lacking portions of the SH region are strongly (>100-fold), rapidly, and reversibly activated by cooling by only a few degrees. We found that the mechanism(s) underlying PLC\u03b32 PLAID mutant activation by cool temperatures is distinct from a mere loss of SH-region-mediated autoinhibition and dependent on both the integrity and the pliability of the spPH domain. The results suggest a new mechanism of PLC\u03b3 activation with unique thermodynamic features and assign a novel regulatory role to its spPH domain. Involvement of this mechanism in other human disease states associated with cooling such as exertional asthma and certain acute coronary events appears an intriguing possibility.", "Keywords": ["Autoinhibition", "Cold temperature sensitivity", "Inositol phospholipid", "Phospholipase C-\u03b3(2)", "Rac2 GTPase", "Split PH domain"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "COS Cells", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Cold Temperature", "Enzyme Activation", "ErbB Receptors", "Exons", "Gene Deletion", "Humans", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Isoenzymes", "Phospholipase C gamma", "Protein Biosynthesis", "Protein Domains"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anja", "Last Name": "Schade", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Walliser", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Martin", "Last Name": "Wist", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Haas", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Petra", "Last Name": "Vatter", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Johann M", "Last Name": "Kraus", "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Filingeri", "Affiliation": "Environmental Ergonomics Research Centre, Loughborough University, Leicestershire LE11 3TU, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Havenith", "Affiliation": "Environmental Ergonomics Research Centre, Loughborough University, Leicestershire LE11 3TU, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Hans A", "Last Name": "Kestler", "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081 Ulm, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Allergic Inflammation Unit, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "Gierschik", "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89070 Ulm, Germany.

Herein we describe a new disease caused by high-penetrance heterozygous germline mutations in TNFAIP3, which encodes the NF-\u03baB regulatory protein A20, in six unrelated families with early-onset systemic inflammation. The disorder resembles Beh\u00e7et's disease, which is typically considered a polygenic disorder with onset in early adulthood. A20 is a potent inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Mutant, truncated A20 proteins are likely to act through haploinsufficiency because they do not exert a dominant-negative effect in overexpression experiments. Patient-derived cells show increased degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and nuclear translocation of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit together with increased expression of NF-\u03baB-mediated proinflammatory cytokines. A20 restricts NF-\u03baB signals via its deubiquitinase activity. In cells expressing mutant A20 protein, there is defective removal of Lys63-linked ubiquitin from TRAF6, NEMO and RIP1 after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF). NF-\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines are potential therapeutic targets for the patients with this disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Female",

(\u03b22-AR) to dilate obstructed airways. Such drugs include long acting beta agonists (LABAs) that are paradoxically linked to excess asthma-related mortality. Here we show that LABAs such as salmeterol and structurally related \u03b22-AR drugs such as formoterol and carvedilol, but not short-acting agonists (SABAs) such as albuterol, promote exaggerated asthma-like allergic airway disease and enhanced airway constriction in mice. We demonstrate that salmeterol aberrantly promotes activation of the allergic disease-related transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in multiple mouse and human cells. A novel inhibitor of STAT6, PM-242H, inhibited initiation of allergic disease induced by airway fungal challenge, reversed established allergic airway disease in mice, and blocked salmeterol-dependent enhanced allergic airway disease. Thus, structurally related \u03b22-AR ligands aberrantly activate STAT6 and promote allergic airway disease. This untoward pharmacological property likely explains adverse outcomes observed with LABAs, which may be overcome by agents that antagonize STAT6.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists", "Albuterol", "Animals", "Anti-Asthmatic Agents", "Arrestins", "Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary", "Aspergillus niger", "Asthma", "Bronchoconstriction", "Carbazoles", "Carvedilol", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Formoterol Fumarate", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Lung", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Peptidomimetics", "Propanolamines", "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2", "STAT6 Transcription Factor", "Salmeterol Xinafoate", "beta-Arrestins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "John M", "Last Name": "Knight", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology & Immunology and Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Garbo", "Last Name": "Mak", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joanne", "Last Name": "Shaw", "Affiliation": "Department of Otorhinolaryngolgy - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Porter", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Catherine", "Last Name": "McDermott", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Luz", "Last Name": "Roberts", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Ran", "Last Name": "You", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology & Immunology and Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Xiaoyi", "Last Name": "Yuan", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology & Immunology and Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Valentine O", "Last Name": "Millien", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine and the Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yuping", "Last Name": "Qian", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Li-Zhen", "Last Name": "Song", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Frazier", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Choel", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacology, and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Jeong Joo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Bond", "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Houston College of Pharmacy, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institutes of Allergic and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Yuan", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institutes of Allergic and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Pijus K", "Last Name": "Mandal", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Amber", "Last Name": "Luong", "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Center for Immunology and Autoimmune Diseases, The Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, Texas, United States of America."}, {"First Name": "Farrah", "Last Name": "Kheradmand", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine and Pathology & Immunology, Translational Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, and the Biology of Inflammation Center, Baylor College of Medicine and the Michael E.

Two major types of T cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+), that use the same genetic elements and process to generate a functional TCR differ in their recognition of peptide bound to MHC class II and I, respectively.

Here, we report a comparative analysis of the TCR\u03b2 repertoires of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by use of a 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR-sequencing method. We found that TCR\u03b2 richness of CD4(+) T cells ranges from 1.2 to 9.8 \u00d7 10(4) and is approximately 5 times greater, on average, than that of CD8(+) T cells in each study subject. Furthermore, there was little overlap in TCR\u03b2 sequences between CD4(+) (0.3%) and CD8(+) (1.3%) T cells. Further analysis showed that CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells exhibited distinct preferences for certain amino acids in the CDR3, and this was confirmed further by a support vector machine classifier, suggesting that there are distinct and discernible differences between TCR\u03b2 CDR3 in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, we identified 5-12% of the unique TCR\u03b2s that share an identical CDR3 with different variable genes.

IL-21 induced STAT1 phosphorylation, and this was augmented in Stat3-deficient CD4(+) T cells. RNA-Seq analysis of CD4(+) T cells from Stat1- and Stat3-deficient mice revealed that both STAT1 and STAT3 are critical for IL-21-mediated gene regulation. Expression of some genes, including Tbx21 and Ifng, was differentially regulated by STAT1 and STAT3. Moreover, opposing actions of STAT1 and STAT3 on IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD4(+) T cells were demonstrated in vivo during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection. Finally, IL-21-mediated induction of STAT1 phosphorylation, as well as IFNG and TBX21 expression, were higher in CD4(+) T cells from patients with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome, which is caused by STAT3 deficiency, as well as in cells from STAT1 gain-of-function patients.

Together, these proteins recruit and activate phospholipase C-\u03b32 (PLC-\u03b32), a critical effector that stimulates increases in intracellular Ca(2+) and activates various signaling pathways downstream of the BCR. Individuals with one copy of a mutant PLCG2 gene, which encodes a variant PLC-\u03b32 that lacks the autoinhibitory C-terminal Src homology 2 (cSH2) domain, exhibit PLC-\u03b32-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (PLAID). Paradoxically, although COS-7 cells expressing the variant PLC-\u03b32 show enhanced basal and stimulated PLC-\u03b32 activity, B cells from PLAID patients show defective intracellular Ca(2+) responses upon cross-linking of the BCR. We found that the cSH2 domain of PLC-\u03b32 played a critical role in stabilizing the early signaling complex that is stimulated by BCR cross-linking. In the presence of the variant PLC-\u03b32, Syk, Btk, and BLNK were only weakly phosphorylated and failed to stably associate with the BCR. Thus, BCRs could not form stable clusters, resulting in dysregulation of downstream signaling and trafficking of the BCR. Thus, the cSH2 domain functions not only to inhibit the active site of PLC-\u03b32 but also to directly or indirectly stabilize the early BCR signaling complex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase", "Analysis of Variance", "Animals", "COS Cells", "Calcium", "Chlorocebus aethiops", "Flow Cytometry", "Humans", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Lipid Bilayers", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Phospholipase C gamma", "Phosphorylation", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell", "Signal Transduction", "Syk Kinase", "src Homology Domains"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20852, USA."}, {"First Name": "Haewon", "Last Name": "Sohn", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20852, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guangping", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}, {"First Name": "Susan K", "Last Name": "Pierce", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. spierce@nih.gov."}], "Journal": "Science signaling", "PubDate": "2014Sep16"}, {"PMID": "24632714", "Title": "A mouse model of HIES reveals pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of STAT3.", "Abstract": "Mutations of STAT3 underlie the autosomal dominant form of hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES). STAT3 has critical roles in immune cells and thus, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), might be a reasonable therapeutic strategy in this disease. However, STAT3 also has critical functions in nonhematopoietic cells and dissecting the protean roles of STAT3 is limited by the lethality associated with germline deletion of Stat3. Thus, predicting the efficacy of HSCT for HIES is difficult. To begin to dissect the importance of STAT3 in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells as it relates to HIES, we generated a mouse model of this disease. We found that these transgenic mice recapitulate multiple aspects of HIES, including elevated serum IgE and failure to generate Th17 cells.

Here we develop the hypothesis that both pathogen sensing and regulatory T cells act on antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) to determine whether the DCs will be competent to activate T cells with cognate receptors. Tregs that recognize self-peptide/major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the DC in question will serve to inactivate that DC, whereas sensing of pathogens or innate \"danger\" signals by the DC will oppose the action of the Tregs. The responsiveness of the T-cell compartment is further controlled by activation-threshold tuning in which responsiveness is adjusted to the strength of recurrent stimulation of T cells by self-peptide/MHCs in the periphery. Thus, a robust T-cell response depends on T-cell recognition of a peptide/MHC presented by a competent DC, competence depending on interactions with Tregs and the degree of innate stimulation through pathogen sensing, and on a combined TCR and accessory-signaling strength of stimulation that exceeds the activation threshold of the T cells, determined by its responsiveness tuning.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Antigens", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Dendritic Cells", "Epitopes", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Immunologic Memory", "Lymphopenia", "Mice", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Signal Transduction", "T-Lymphocytes", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William E", "Last Name": "Paul", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunology and Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1892 wpaul@niaid.nih.gov."}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunology and Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1892."}, {"First Name": "Zvi", "Last Name": "Grossman", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunology and Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1892."}], "Journal": "Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23905919", "Title": "Patients informing immunobiology: How disorders of IL-21 receptor signaling unravel pathways of CD8 T-cell function.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": ["CD8", "IL-21", "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1", "antiviral immunity", "signal transducer and activator of transcription 3"], "MeSH terms": ["CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Differentiation", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Job Syndrome", "Mutation", "STAT3 Transcription Factor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology", "PubDate": "2013Aug"}, {"PMID": "23895897", "Title": "Elevated IgE and atopy in patients treated for early-onset ADA-SCID.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adenosine Deaminase", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Cells, Cultured", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cytokines", "Enzyme Replacement Therapy", "Female", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin E", "Immunologic Memory", "Infant", "Male", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Severe Combined Immunodeficiency", "Th2 Cells", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Monica G", "Last Name": "Lawrence", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md."}, {"First Name": "John S", "Last Name": "Barber", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert A", "Last Name": "Sokolic", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth K", "Last Name": "Garabedian", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Avanti N", "Last Name": "Desai", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "O'Brien", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nina", "Last Name": "Jones", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pawan", "Last Name": "Bali", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Hershfield", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kelly D", "Last Name": "Stone", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Fabio", "Last Name": "Candotti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joshua D", "Last Name": "Milner", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology", "PubDate": "2013Dec"}, {"PMID": "23887241", "Title": "The cup runneth over: lessons from the ever-expanding pool of primary immunodeficiency diseases.", "Abstract": "A recent surge in newly described primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) has highlighted new physiological and pathophysiological pathways that affect the immune system.
