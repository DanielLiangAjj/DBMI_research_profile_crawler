[{"PMID": "38562378", "Title": "Transcriptome profiling and analysis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from Kazakhstan.", "Abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant subtype of esophageal cancer in Central Asia, often diagnosed at advanced stages. Understanding population-specific patterns of ESCC is crucial for tailored treatments. This study aimed to unravel ESCC's genetic basis in Kazakhstani patients and identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted therapies. ESCC patients from Kazakhstan were studied. We analyzed histological subtypes and conducted in-depth transcriptome sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed, and significantly dysregulated pathways were identified using KEGG pathway analysis (p-value < 0.05). Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed to elucidate key modules and their functions. Among Kazakhstani patients, ESCC with moderate dysplasia was the most prevalent subtype. We identified 42 significantly upregulated and two significantly downregulated KEGG pathways, highlighting molecular mechanisms driving ESCC pathogenesis. Immune-related pathways, such as viral protein interaction with cytokines, rheumatoid arthritis, and oxidative phosphorylation, were elevated, suggesting immune system involvement. Conversely, downregulated pathways were associated with extracellular matrix degradation, crucial in cancer invasion and metastasis. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed four distinct modules with specific functions, implicating pathways in esophageal cancer development. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing elucidated critical molecular pathways underlying esophageal carcinogenesis in Kazakhstani patients. Insights into dysregulated pathways offer potential for early diagnosis and precision treatment strategies for ESCC. Understanding population-specific patterns is essential for personalized approaches to ESCC management.", "Keywords": ["Kazakhstan", "RNA-seq", "analysis of differentially expressed genes", "bioinformatics", "esophageal squamous cell carcinoma", "next-generation sequencing", "transcriptomics"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Aigul", "Last Name": "Sharip", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Saule", "Last Name": "Rakhimova", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Askhat", "Last Name": "Molkenov", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Ainur", "Last Name": "Ashenova", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Ulan", "Last Name": "Kozhamkulov", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Ilyas", "Last Name": "Akhmetollayev", "Affiliation": "National Center for Biotechnology, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Andrei", "Last Name": "Zinovyev", "Affiliation": "Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Yuri", "Last Name": "Zhukov", "Affiliation": "Multidisciplinary Medical Center, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Marat", "Last Name": "Omarov", "Affiliation": "Multidisciplinary Medical Center, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Mukhtar", "Last Name": "Tuleutaev", "Affiliation": "Multidisciplinary Medical Center, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Venera", "Last Name": "Rakhmetova", "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Diseases, Astana Medical University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Joseph D", "Last Name": "Terwilliger", "Affiliation": "Sergi\u0435vsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Sergi\u0435vsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhaxybay", "Last Name": "Zhumadilov", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Ainur", "Last Name": "Akilzhanova", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}, {"First Name": "Ulykbek", "Last Name": "Kairov", "Affiliation": "Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Astana, Kazakhstan."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in genetics", "PubDate": "2024"}, {"PMID": "38294177", "Title": "Association of Variability and Hypertensive Loads in 24-h Blood Pressure With Mortality and Cardiovascular Risk.", "Abstract": "Evidence shows that high 24-h blood pressure (BP) variability increases cardiovascular risk.

Following a weight loss period (21.1 \u00b1 3.1 weeks) leading to substantial fat mass loss of 52% (\u22127.9 \u00b1 1.5 kg) and low body fat (12.7 \u00b1 4.1%), the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic signature of 24 previously young, healthy, and normal weight female physique athletes was investigated. We observed uniform increases (FDR < 0.05) in bile acids, very-long-chain free fatty acids (FFA), and oxylipins, together with reductions in unsaturated FFAs after weight loss. These widespread changes, especially in the bile acid profile, were most strongly explained (FDR < 0.05) by changes in android (visceral) fat mass. The reported changes did not persist, as all of them were reversed after the subsequent voluntary weight regain period (18.4 \u00b1 2.9 weeks) and were unchanged in non-dieting controls (n = 16). Overall, we suggest that the reported changes in FFA, bile acid, and oxylipin profiles reflect metabolic adaptation to very low levels of fat mass after prolonged periods of intense exercise and low-energy availability. However, the effects of the aforementioned metabolome subclass alteration on metabolic homeostasis remain controversial, and more studies are warranted to unravel the complex physiology and potentially associated health implications.

The main aim of our study was to assess how energy deprivation (i.e., \"semi-starvation\") leading to substantial fat mass loss affects the immune system and immunosuppression in previously normal weight individuals. Thus, to address this hypothesis, we applied a high-throughput systems biology approach to better characterize potential key pathways associated with immune system modulation during intensive weight loss and subsequent weight regain. We examined 42 healthy female physique athletes (age 27.5 \u00b1 4.0 years, body mass index 23.4 \u00b1 1.7 kg/m2) volunteered into either a diet group (n = 25) or a control group (n = 17). For the diet group, the energy intake was reduced and exercise levels were increased to induce loss of fat mass that was subsequently regained during a recovery period. The control group was instructed to maintain their typical lifestyle, exercise levels, and energy intake at a constant level. For quantification of systems biology markers, fasting blood samples were drawn at three time points: baseline (PRE), at the end of the weight loss period (MID 21.1 \u00b1 3.1 weeks after PRE), and at the end of the weight regain period (POST 18.4 \u00b1 2.9 weeks after MID). In contrast to the control group, the diet group showed significant (false discovery rate <0.05) alteration of all measured immune function parameters-white blood cells (WBCs), immunoglobulin G glycome, leukocyte transcriptome, and cytokine profile. Integrative omics suggested effects on multiple levels of immune system as dysregulated hematopoiesis, suppressed immune cell proliferation, attenuated systemic inflammation, and loss of immune cell function by reduced antibody and chemokine secretion was implied after intense weight loss. During the weight regain period, the majority of the measured immune system parameters returned back to the baseline. In summary, this study elucidated a number of molecular pathways presumably explaining immunosuppression in individuals going through prolonged periods of intense training with low-energy availability. Our findings also reinforce the perception that the way in which weight loss is achieved (i.e., dietary restriction, exercise, or both) has a distinct effect on how the immune system is modulated.", "Keywords": ["bioinformatics", "immunosuppression", "low energy availability", "physical training", "weight loss"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytokines", "Diet", "Energy Intake", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunoglobulin G", "Leukocyte Count", "Leukocytes", "Transcriptome", "Weight Loss", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Heikki V", "Last Name": "Sarin", "Affiliation": "Genomics and Biomarkers Unit, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Ivan", "Last Name": "Gudelj", "Affiliation": "Genos Glycoscience Research Laboratory, Zagreb, Croatia."}, {"First Name": "Jarno", "Last Name": "Honkanen", "Affiliation": "Research Program for Clinical and Molecular Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Johanna K", "Last Name": "Ihalainen", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, Neuromuscular Research Center, Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Arja", "Last Name": "Vuorela", "Affiliation": "Pedia Laboratory, Clinicum, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Sergievsky Center, Taub Institute and Departments of Epidemiology and Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Zhenzhen", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Joseph D", "Last Name": "Terwilliger", "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Genetics, Departments of Psychiatry, Genetics & Development, Sergievsky Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ville", "Last Name": "Isola", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, Neuromuscular Research Center, Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Juha P", "Last Name": "Ahtiainen", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, Neuromuscular Research Center, Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Keijo", "Last Name": "H\u00e4kkinen", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, Neuromuscular Research Center, Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Julija", "Last Name": "Juri\u0107", "Affiliation": "Genos Glycoscience Research Laboratory, Zagreb, Croatia."}, {"First Name": "Gordan", "Last Name": "Lauc", "Affiliation": "Genos Glycoscience Research Laboratory, Zagreb, Croatia."}, {"First Name": "Kati", "Last Name": "Kristiansson", "Affiliation": "Genomics and Biomarkers Unit, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Juha J", "Last Name": "Hulmi", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, Neuromuscular Research Center, Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Markus", "Last Name": "Perola", "Affiliation": "Genomics and Biomarkers Unit, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30422703", "Title": "Associations of increased physical performance and change in body composition with molecular pathways of heart disease and diabetes risk.", "Abstract": "Higher physical activity is associated with a reduced hazard for a plethora of diseases.

We studied the metabolic associations of changes in muscle performance and body composition during military service (range 6-12 mo). We subsequently replicated our results for body composition change in 234 population-based samples with a 7-yr follow-up. We found that increased physical performance was associated with reduced very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related measures [change in VLDL cholesterol: beta\u2009=\u2009-0.135; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-0.217, -0.054, P = 1.2 \u00d7 10-3] and lower inflammation (change in glycoprotein acetyls: beta\u2009=\u2009-0.138, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.217, -0.059, P = 6.5 \u00d7 10-4), independent of change in body composition. Lower body fat percentage, independent of change in muscle performance, was associated with metabolic changes including lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measures (change in LDL cholesterol: beta\u2009=\u2009-0.193, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.295, -0.090; P = 2.5 \u00d7 10-4), increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol measures (change in large HDL cholesterol: beta\u2009=\u20090.316, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.205, 0.427; P = 3.7 \u00d7 10-8), and decreased concentrations of amino acids (change in leucine concentration: beta\u2009=\u2009-0.236, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.341, -0.132; P = 1.0 \u00d7 10-5) that are type 2 diabetes biomarkers. Importantly, all body fat percentage associations were replicated in a general population-based cohort.

It is considered a complex trait with onset influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Identification of genetic risk variants would provide novel insight into the genetic basis of the fear of heights phenotype and contribute to the molecular-level understanding of its aetiology. Genetic isolates may facilitate identification of susceptibility alleles due to reduced genetic heterogeneity. We took advantage of an internal genetic isolate in Finland in which a distinct acrophobia phenotype appears to be segregating in pedigrees originally ascertained for schizophrenia. We conducted parametric, nonparametric, joint linkage and linkage disequilibrium analyses using a microsatellite marker panel, genotyped in families to search for chromosomal regions correlated with acrophobia. Our results implicated a few regions with suggestive evidence for linkage on chromosomes 4q28 (LOD\u2009=\u20092.17), 8q24 (LOD\u2009=\u20092.09) and 13q21-q22 (LOD\u2009=\u20092.22). We observed no risk haplotypes shared between different families. These results suggest that genetic predisposition to acrophobia in this genetic isolate is unlikely to be mediated by a small number of shared high-risk alleles, but rather has a complex genetic architecture.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alleles", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Chromosome Mapping", "Female", "Finland", "Genetic Linkage", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Haplotypes", "Humans", "Male", "Microsatellite Repeats", "Pedigree", "Phobic Disorders", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Zuzanna", "Last Name": "Misiewicz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Tero", "Last Name": "Hiekkalinna", "Affiliation": "Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Tiina", "Last Name": "Paunio", "Affiliation": "Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Teppo", "Last Name": "Varilo", "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Joseph D", "Last Name": "Terwilliger", "Affiliation": "Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Timo", "Last Name": "Partonen", "Affiliation": "Department of Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}, {"First Name": "Iiris", "Last Name": "Hovatta", "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2016Dec20"}, {"PMID": "24533837", "Title": "PSEUDOMARKER 2.0: efficient computation of likelihoods using NOMAD.", "Abstract": "PSEUDOMARKER is a software package that performs joint linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis between a marker and a putative disease locus.
