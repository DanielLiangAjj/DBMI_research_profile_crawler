Although some of their encoded proteins retain the ability to form capsids and even transfer cargo, their fitness benefit has remained elusive. Here we show that the gag -like genes PNMA1 and PNMA4 support reproductive capacity. Six-week-old mice lacking either Pnma1 or Pnma4 are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, but by six months the mutant mice become prematurely subfertile, with precipitous drops in sex hormone levels, gonadal atrophy, and abdominal obesity; overall they produce markedly fewer offspring than controls. Analysis of donated human ovaries shows that expression of both genes declines normally with aging, while several PNMA1 and PNMA4 variants identified in genome-wide association studies are causally associated with low testosterone, altered puberty onset, or obesity. These findings expand our understanding of factors that maintain human reproductive health and lend insight into the domestication of retrotransposon-derived genes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Thomas W P", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "William S", "Last Name": "Henriques", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Harrison B", "Last Name": "Cullen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mayra", "Last Name": "Romero", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Cecilia S", "Last Name": "Blengini", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shreya", "Last Name": "Sarathy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Sorkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hilina", "Last Name": "Bekele", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Jin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seungsoo", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexei", "Last Name": "Chemiakine", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rishad C", "Last Name": "Khondker", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 V V", "Last Name": "Isola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael B", "Last Name": "Stout", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vincenzo A", "Last Name": "Gennarino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Binyam", "Last Name": "Mogessie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Devanshi", "Last Name": "Jain", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Schindler", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yousin", "Last Name": "Suh", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Blake", "Last Name": "Wiedenheft", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luke E", "Last Name": "Berchowitz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024May14"}, {"PMID": "38766058", "Title": "De novo gene synthesis by an antiviral reverse transcriptase.", "Abstract": "Bacteria defend themselves from viral infection using diverse immune systems, many of which sense and target foreign nucleic acids. Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this immune strategy by instead leveraging DNA synthesis, but the identities and functions of their DNA products remain largely unknown. Here we show that DRT2 systems execute an unprecedented immunity mechanism that involves de novo gene synthesis via rolling-circle reverse transcription of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Unbiased profiling of RT-associated RNA and DNA ligands in DRT2-expressing cells revealed that reverse transcription generates concatenated cDNA repeats through programmed template jumping on the ncRNA. The presence of phage then triggers second-strand cDNA synthesis, leading to the production of long double-stranded DNA. Remarkably, this DNA product is efficiently transcribed, generating messenger RNAs that encode a stop codon-less, never-ending ORF (neo) whose translation causes potent growth arrest. Phylogenetic analyses and screening of diverse DRT2 homologs further revealed broad conservation of rolling-circle reverse transcription and Neo protein function.

However, evidence that cells exploit these structures to control function and activity of some proteins in response to stimuli has questioned this paradigm. How amyloid-like assembly can confer emergent functions and how cells couple assembly with environmental conditions remains unclear. Here, we study Rim4, an RNA-binding protein that forms translation-repressing assemblies during yeast meiosis. We demonstrate that in its assembled and repressive state, Rim4 binds RNA more efficiently than in its monomeric and idle state, revealing a causal connection between assembly and function. The Rim4-binding site location within the transcript dictates whether the assemblies can repress translation, underscoring the importance of the architecture of this RNA-protein structure for function. Rim4 assembly depends exclusively on its intrinsically disordered region and is prevented by the Ras/protein kinase A signaling pathway, which promotes growth and suppresses meiotic entry in yeast.

Most cell fate decisions, including those of yeast, are understood as being triggered by the activation of master transcription factors. However, mechanisms that enforce cell fates posttranscriptionally have been more difficult to attain. Here, we perform a forward genetic screen to determine RNA-binding proteins that affect meiotic entry at the posttranscriptional level. Our screen revealed several candidates with meiotic entry phenotypes, the most significant being RIE1, which encodes an RRM-containing protein. We demonstrate that Rie1 binds RNA, is associated with the translational machinery, and acts posttranscriptionally to enhance protein levels of the master transcription factor Ime1 in sporulation conditions. We also identified a physical binding partner of Rie1, Sgn1, which is another RRM-containing protein that plays a role in timely Ime1 expression. We demonstrate that these proteins act independently of cell size regulation pathways to promote meiotic entry.

Meiotic commitment ensures the irreversible continuation of meiosis, even upon withdrawal of the meiosis-inducing signals. A loss of meiotic commitment can cause highly abnormal polyploid cells and can ultimately lead to germ cell tumors. Despite the importance of meiotic commitment, only a few genes involved in commitment are known. In this study, we have discovered six new regulators of meiotic commitment in budding yeast: the Bcy1 protein involved in nutrient sensing, the meiosis-specific kinase Ime2, Polo kinase Cdc5, RNA-binding protein Pes4, and the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2. Decreased levels of these proteins cause a failure to establish or maintain meiotic commitment. Importantly, we found that Bmh1 and Bmh2 are involved in multiple processes throughout meiosis and in meiotic commitment. First, cells depleted of both Bmh1 and Bmh2 trigger the pachytene checkpoint, likely due to a role in DNA double-strand break repair. Second, Bmh1 interacts directly with the middle meiosis transcription factor Ndt80, and both Bmh1 and Bmh2 maintain Ndt80 levels. Third, Bmh1 and Bmh2 bind to Cdc5 and enhance its kinase activity. Finally, Bmh1 binds to Pes4, which regulates the timing of the translation of several mRNAs in meiosis II and is required to maintain meiotic commitment.

The extracellular FadA binds Congo Red, Thioflavin-T, and antibodies raised against human amyloid \u03b242. Fn produces amyloid-like FadA under stress and disease conditions, but not in healthy sites or tissues.

Here, we propose that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from unconventional model organisms may retain certain species-specific features that can consequently be investigated in depth in vitro; we use hibernating mammals as an example. Many species (including ground squirrels, bats and bears) can enter a prolonged state of physiological dormancy known as hibernation to survive unfavorable seasonal conditions. Our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the rapid transition and adaptation to a hypothermic, metabolically suppressed winter torpor state remains limited partially because of the lack of an easily accessible model. To address the fascinating unanswered questions underlying hibernation biology, we have developed a powerful model system: iPSCs from a hibernating species, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). These stem cells can potentially be differentiated into any cell type, and can be used for the analysis of cell-autonomous mechanisms that facilitate adaptation to hibernation and for comparisons with non-hibernators. Furthermore, we can manipulate candidate molecular and cellular pathways underlying relevant physiological phenomena by pharmacological or RNAi-based methods, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Moreover, iPSC strategies can be applied to other species (e.g. seals, naked mole rats, humming birds) for in vitro studies on adaptation to extreme physiological conditions.

Sequence differences between homologs can locally inhibit crossovers. Despite this, nucleotide diversity and population-scaled recombination are positively correlated in eukaryote genomes. To investigate interactions between heterozygosity and recombination we crossed Arabidopsis lines carrying fluorescent crossover reporters to 32 diverse accessions and observed hybrids with significantly higher and lower crossovers than homozygotes. Using recombinant populations derived from these crosses we observed that heterozygous regions increase crossovers when juxtaposed with homozygous regions, which reciprocally decrease. Total crossovers measured by chiasmata were unchanged when heterozygosity was varied, consistent with homeostatic control. We tested the effects of heterozygosity in mutants where the balance of interfering and non-interfering crossover repair is altered. Crossover remodeling at homozygosity-heterozygosity junctions requires interference, and non-interfering repair is inefficient in heterozygous regions. As a consequence, heterozygous regions show stronger crossover interference. Our findings reveal how varying homolog polymorphism patterns can shape meiotic recombination.", "Keywords": ["arabidopsis", "chromosomes", "crossover", "evolutionary biology", "genes", "genomics", "interference", "meiosis", "natural variation", "recombination"], "MeSH terms": ["Arabidopsis", "Chromosomes, Plant", "Crosses, Genetic", "Crossing Over, Genetic", "Ecotype", "Fluorescence", "Genetic Variation", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Meiosis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Piotr A", "Last Name": "Ziolkowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Luke E", "Last Name": "Berchowitz", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States."}, {"First Name": "Christophe", "Last Name": "Lambing", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Nataliya E", "Last Name": "Yelina", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Xiaohui", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Krystyna A", "Last Name": "Kelly", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Kyuha", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Liliana", "Last Name": "Ziolkowska", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Viviana", "Last Name": "June", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Eugenio", "Last Name": "Sanchez-Moran", "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Chris", "Last Name": "Franklin", "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Gregory P", "Last Name": "Copenhaver", "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, United States."}, {"First Name": "Ian R", "Last Name": "Henderson", "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}], "Journal": "eLife", "PubDate": "2015Mar27"}, {"PMID": "24115771", "Title": "A developmentally regulated translational control pathway establishes the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern.", "Abstract": "Production of haploid gametes from diploid progenitor cells is mediated by a specialized cell division, meiosis, where two divisions, meiosis I and II, follow a single S phase. Errors in progression from meiosis I to meiosis II lead to aneuploid and polyploid gametes, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling this transition are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved kinase Ime2 regulates the timing and order of the meiotic divisions by controlling translation. Ime2 coordinates translational activation of a cluster of genes at the meiosis I-meiosis II transition, including the critical determinant of the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern CLB3. We further show that Ime2 mediates translational control through the meiosis-specific RNA-binding protein Rim4. Rim4 inhibits translation of CLB3 during meiosis I by interacting with the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of CLB3. At the onset of meiosis II, Ime2 kinase activity rises and triggers a decrease in Rim4 protein levels, thereby alleviating translational repression. Our results elucidate a novel developmentally regulated translational control pathway that establishes the meiotic chromosome segregation pattern.", "Keywords": ["RNA-binding protein", "cyclins", "gametogenesis", "kinase", "meiosis", "translational control", "untranslated region"], "MeSH terms": ["5' Untranslated Regions", "Chromosome Segregation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Meiosis", "Multigene Family", "Protein Binding", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases", "RNA, Messenger", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Luke E", "Last Name": "Berchowitz", "Affiliation": "Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA;"}, {"First Name": "Aaron S", "Last Name": "Gajadhar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Folkert J", "Last Name": "van Werven", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexandra A", "Last Name": "De Rosa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mariya L", "Last Name": "Samoylova", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Gloria A", "Last Name": "Brar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yifeng", "Last Name": "Xu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Che", "Last Name": "Xiao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bruce", "Last Name": "Futcher", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jonathan S", "Last Name": "Weissman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Forest M", "Last Name": "White", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Angelika", "Last Name": "Amon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Genes & development", "PubDate": "2013Oct01"}]
