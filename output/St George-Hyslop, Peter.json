[{"PMID": "38889728", "Title": "Genome-wide analyses reveal a potential role for the MAPT, MOBP, and APOE loci in sporadic frontotemporal dementia.", "Abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD). Efforts in the field mainly focus on familial forms of disease (fFTDs), while studies of the genetic etiology of sporadic FTD (sFTD) have been less common. In the current work, we analyzed 4,685 sFTD cases and 15,308 controls looking for common genetic determinants for sFTD. We found a cluster of variants at the MAPT (rs199443; p\u00a0= 2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-12, OR\u00a0= 1.27) and APOE (rs6857; p\u00a0= 1.31\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-12, OR\u00a0= 1.27) loci and a candidate locus on chromosome 3 (rs1009966; p\u00a0= 2.41\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-8, OR\u00a0= 1.16) in the intergenic region between RPSA and MOBP, contributing to increased risk for sFTD through effects on expression and/or splicing in brain cortex of functionally relevant in-cis genes at the MAPT and RPSA-MOBP loci. The association with the MAPT (H1c clade) and RPSA-MOBP loci may suggest common genetic pleiotropy across FTD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (MAPT and RPSA-MOBP loci) and across FTD, AD, Parkinson disease (PD), and cortico-basal degeneration (CBD) (MAPT locus). Our data also suggest population specificity of the risk signals, with MAPT and APOE loci associations mainly driven by Central/Nordic and Mediterranean Europeans, respectively. This study lays the foundations for future work aimed at further characterizing population-specific features of potential FTD-discriminant APOE haplotype(s) and the functional involvement and contribution of the MAPT H1c haplotype and RPSA-MOBP loci to pathogenesis of sporadic forms of FTD in brain cortex.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Manzoni", "Affiliation": "UCL School of Pharmacy, London, UK.

fused in sarcoma (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration promotes the formation of irreversible condensates of FUS. However, the mechanisms by which these hypomethylated FUS condensates cause neuronal dysfunction are unknown. Here we report that expression of FUS constructs mimicking hypomethylated FUS causes aberrant dendritic FUS condensates in CA1 neurons. These hypomethylated FUS condensates exhibit spontaneous, and activity induced movement within the dendrite. They impair excitatory synaptic transmission, postsynaptic density-95 expression, and dendritic spine plasticity. These neurophysiological defects are dependent upon both the dendritic localisation of the condensates, and their ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. These results indicate that the irreversible liquid-liquid phase separation is a key component of hypomethylated FUS pathophysiology in sporadic FTLD, and this can cause synapse dysfunction in sporadic FTLD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Phase Separation", "RNA-Binding Protein FUS", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration", "DNA Methylation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Seung Chan", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, UK-Dementia Research Institute, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, London, SE5 9NU, UK."}, {"First Name": "Scott J", "Last Name": "Mitchell", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, UK-Dementia Research Institute, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, London, SE5 9NU, UK."}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Whitcomb", "Affiliation": "Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS1 3NY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Marc-David", "Last Name": "Ruepp", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, UK-Dementia Research Institute, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, London, SE5 9NU, UK."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kwangwook", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, UK-Dementia Research Institute, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, London, SE5 9NU, UK. kei.cho@kcl.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Acta neuropathologica communications", "PubDate": "2023Dec18"}, {"PMID": "37549257", "Title": "The liquid-to-solid transition of FUS is promoted by the condensate surface.", "Abstract": "A wide range of macromolecules can undergo phase separation, forming biomolecular condensates in living cells. These membraneless organelles are typically highly dynamic, formed reversibly, and carry out essential functions in biological systems. Crucially, however, a further liquid-to-solid transition of the condensates can lead to irreversible pathological aggregation and cellular dysfunction associated with the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the importance of this liquid-to-solid transition of proteins, the mechanism by which it is initiated in normally functional condensates is unknown. Here we show, by measuring the changes in structure, dynamics, and mechanics in time and space, that single-component FUS condensates do not uniformly convert to a solid gel, but rather that liquid and gel phases coexist simultaneously within the same condensate, resulting in highly inhomogeneous structures. Furthermore, our results show that this transition originates at the interface between the condensate and the dilute continuous phase, and once initiated, the gelation process propagates toward the center of the condensate. To probe such spatially inhomogeneous rheology during condensate aging, we use a combination of established micropipette aspiration experiments together with two optical techniques, spatial dynamic mapping and reflective confocal dynamic speckle microscopy. These results reveal the importance of the spatiotemporal dimension of the liquid-to-solid transition and highlight the interface of biomolecular condensates as a critical element in driving pathological protein aggregation.", "Keywords": ["biomolecular condensates", "optics", "protein"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Biomolecular Condensates", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Rheology", "RNA-Binding Protein FUS"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Anqi", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "John A.

We constructed and analyzed a multi-ancestry GWAS dataset in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Genetics Consortium (ADGC) to test for novel shared and ancestry-specific AD susceptibility loci and evaluate underlying genetic architecture in 37,382 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 6,728 African American, 8,899 Hispanic (HIS), and 3,232 East Asian individuals, performing within-ancestry fixed-effects meta-analysis followed by a cross-ancestry random-effects meta-analysis. We identified 13 loci with cross-ancestry associations including known loci at/near CR1 , BIN1 , TREM2 , CD2AP , PTK2B , CLU , SHARPIN , MS4A6A , PICALM , ABCA7 , APOE and two novel loci not previously reported at 11p12 ( LRRC4C ) and 12q24.13 ( LHX5-AS1 ). Reflecting the power of diverse ancestry in GWAS, we observed the SHARPIN locus using 7.1% the sample size of the original discovering single-ancestry GWAS (n=788,989). We additionally identified three GWS ancestry-specific loci at/near ( PTPRK ( P =2.4\u00d710 -8 ) and GRB14 ( P =1.7\u00d710 -8 ) in HIS), and KIAA0825 ( P =2.9\u00d710 -8 in NHW). Pathway analysis implicated multiple amyloid regulation pathways (strongest with P adjusted =1.6\u00d710 -4 ) and the classical complement pathway ( P adjusted =1.3\u00d710 -3 ). Genes at/near our novel loci have known roles in neuronal development ( LRRC4C, LHX5-AS1 , and PTPRK ) and insulin receptor activity regulation ( GRB14 ). These findings provide compelling support for using traditionally-underrepresented populations for gene discovery, even with smaller sample sizes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors":

phase coupling on lysosomal membranes.", "Abstract": "Phase transitions of cellular proteins and lipids play a key role in governing the organisation and coordination of intracellular biology. The frequent juxtaposition of proteinaceous biomolecular condensates to cellular membranes raises the intriguing prospect that phase transitions in proteins and lipids could be co-regulated. Here we investigate this possibility in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granule-ANXA11-lysosome ensemble, where ANXA11 tethers RNP granule condensates to lysosomal membranes to enable their co-trafficking. We show that changes to the protein phase state within this system, driven by the low complexity ANXA11 N-terminus, induce a coupled phase state change in the lipids of the underlying membrane. We identify the ANXA11 interacting proteins ALG2 and CALC as potent regulators of ANXA11-based phase coupling and demonstrate their influence on the nanomechanical properties of the ANXA11-lysosome ensemble and its capacity to engage RNP granules. The phenomenon of protein-lipid phase coupling we observe within this system offers an important template to understand the numerous other examples across the cell whereby biomolecular condensates closely juxtapose cell membranes.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jonathon", "Last Name": "Nixon-Abell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco S", "Last

Many such biomolecular condensates are not, however, homogeneous fluids, but possess an internal structure consisting of distinct sub-compartments with different compositions. Notably, condensates can contain compartments that are depleted in the biopolymers that make up the condensate. Here, we show that such double-emulsion condensates emerge via dynamically arrested phase transitions. The combination of a change in composition coupled with a slow response to this change can lead to the nucleation of biopolymer-poor droplets within the polymer-rich condensate phase.

Mapping and characterising phase behaviour of biomolecules is essential to understand the mechanisms of condensate assembly, and to develop therapeutic strategies targeting biomolecular condensate systems. A central concept for characterising phase-separating systems is the phase diagram. Phase diagrams are typically built from numerous individual measurements sampling different parts of the parameter space. However, even when performed in microwell plate format, this process is slow, low throughput and requires significant sample consumption. To address this challenge, we present here a combinatorial droplet microfluidic platform, termed PhaseScan, for rapid and high-resolution acquisition of multidimensional biomolecular phase diagrams. Using this platform, we characterise the phase behaviour of a wide range of systems under a variety of conditions and demonstrate that this approach allows the quantitative characterisation of the effect of small molecules on biomolecular phase transitions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Biomolecular Condensates", "Intracellular Space", "Microfluidics", "Phase Transition"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "William E", "Last Name": "Arter", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, Centre for Misfolding Diseases, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Runzhang", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, Centre for Misfolding Diseases, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Nadia A", "Last Name": "Erkamp", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, Centre for Misfolding Diseases, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Krainer", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, Centre for Misfolding Diseases, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Kieran", "Last Name": "Didi", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, Centre for Misfolding Diseases, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Timothy J", "Last Name": "Welsh", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, Centre for Misfolding Diseases, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Julia", "Last Name": "Acker", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathan", "Last Name": "Nixon-Abell", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jordina", "Last Name": "Guill\u00e9n-Boixet", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC), Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering (CMCB), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Tatzberg 47/49, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Titus M", "Last Name": "Franzmann", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC), Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering (CMCB), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Tatzberg 47/49, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Kuster", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Pfotenhauerstrasse 108, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anthony A", "Last Name": "Hyman", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Pfotenhauerstrasse 108, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Alexander", "Last Name": "Borodavka", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Peter St", "Last Name": "George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Alberti", "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC), Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering (CMCB), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Tatzberg 47/49, 01307, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Tuomas P J", "Last Name": "Knowles", "Affiliation": "Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, Centre for Misfolding Diseases, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK. tpjk2@cam.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2022Dec21"}, {"PMID": "35993436", "Title": "Regulation of membrane fluidity by RNF145-triggered degradation of the lipid hydrolase ADIPOR2.", "Abstract": "The regulation of membrane lipid composition is critical for cellular homeostasis.

The most differentially expressed proteins were two ER-resident polytopic membrane proteins: the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF145 and the lipid hydrolase ADIPOR2. In unsaturated lipid membranes, RNF145 is stable, promoting its lipid-sensitive interaction, ubiquitination and degradation of ADIPOR2. When membranes become enriched in saturated FAs, RNF145 is rapidly auto-ubiquitinated and degraded, stabilising ADIPOR2, whose hydrolase activity restores lipid homeostasis and prevents lipotoxicity.

Rare, heterozygous mutations in TREM2 (e.g., R47H) increase AD risk several fold. TREM2 can be cleaved at the plasma membrane by metalloproteases to release the ectodomain as soluble TREM2 (sTREM2). Wild-type sTREM2 binds oligomeric amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and acts as an extracellular chaperone, blocking and reversing A\u03b2 oligomerization and fibrillization, and preventing A\u03b2-induced neuronal loss in vitro.

AD brains expressing R47H TREM2 have more fibrous plaques with more neuritic pathology around these plaques, consistent with R47H sTREM2 promoting A\u03b2 fibrillization relative to WT sTREM2. Brain expression or injection of wild-type sTREM2 reduces pathology in amyloid models of AD in mice, indicating that wild-type sTREM2 is protective against amyloid pathology.

However, the exact pathways downstream of amyloid-\u03b2-induced cell cycle imbalance are unknown. Here, we show that PAX6, a transcription factor essential for eye and brain development which is quiescent in adults, is increased in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and in APP transgenic mice, and plays a key role between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau hyperphosphorylation. Downregulation of PAX6 protects against amyloid-\u03b2 peptide-induced neuronal death, suggesting that PAX6 is a key executor of the amyloid-\u03b2 toxicity pathway. Mechanistically, amyloid-\u03b2 upregulates E2F1, followed by the induction of PAX6 and c-Myb, while Pax6 is a direct target for both E2F1 and its downstream target c-Myb. Furthermore, PAX6 directly regulates transcription of GSK-3\u03b2, a kinase involved in tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles formation, and its phosphorylation of tau at Ser356, Ser396 and Ser404.

Thus, TREM2 function is important for sensing phosphorylated A\u03b2 variants in distinct aggregation states and reduces the accumulation and deposition of these toxic A\u03b2 species in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "FTD mutation", "TREM2", "amyloid \u03b2", "phosphorylation", "post-translational modification"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microglia", "Receptors, Immunologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pranav", "Last Name": "Joshi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Florian", "Last Name": "Riffel", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Kanayo", "Last Name": "Satoh", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medical Biophysics and Medicine (Neurology), Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases and, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Masahiro", "Last Name": "Enomoto", "Affiliation": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Hannah", "Last Name": "Scheiblich", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Gerontopsychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "N\u00e0dia", "Last Name": "Villacampa", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Gerontopsychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sathish", "Last Name": "Kumar", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Sandra", "Last Name": "Theil", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Samira", "Last Name": "Parhizkar", "Affiliation": "Chair of Metabolic Biochemistry, Biomedical Center (BMC), Faculty of Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Haass", "Affiliation": "Chair of Metabolic Biochemistry, Biomedical Center (BMC), Faculty of Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Michael T", "Last Name": "Heneka", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Gerontopsychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Paul E", "Last Name": "Fraser", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medical Biophysics and Medicine (Neurology), Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases and, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medical Biophysics and Medicine (Neurology), Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases and, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jochen", "Last Name": "Walter", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}], "Journal": "Glia", "PubDate": "2021Dec"}, {"PMID": "33823153", "Title": "Wild-type sTREM2 blocks A\u03b2 aggregation and neurotoxicity, but the Alzheimer's R47H mutant increases A\u03b2 aggregation.", "Abstract": "TREM2 is a pattern recognition receptor, expressed on microglia and myeloid cells, detecting lipids and A\u03b2 and inducing an innate immune response. Missense mutations (e.g., R47H) of TREM2 increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The soluble ectodomain of wild-type TREM2 (sTREM2) has been shown to protect against AD in\u00a0vivo, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We show that A\u03b2 oligomers bind to cellular TREM2, inducing shedding of the sTREM2 domain. Wild-type sTREM2 bound to A\u03b2 oligomers (measured by single-molecule imaging, dot blots, and Bio-Layer Interferometry) inhibited A\u03b2 oligomerization and disaggregated preformed A\u03b2 oligomers and protofibrils (measured by transmission electron microscopy, dot blots, and size-exclusion chromatography). Wild-type sTREM2 also inhibited A\u03b2 fibrillization (measured by imaging and thioflavin T\u00a0fluorescence) and blocked A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity (measured by permeabilization of artificial membranes and by loss of neurons in primary neuronal-glial cocultures). In contrast, the R47H AD-risk variant of sTREM2 is less able to bind and disaggregate oligomeric A\u03b2 but rather promotes A\u03b2 protofibril formation and neurotoxicity. Thus, in addition to inducing an immune response, wild-type TREM2 may protect against amyloid pathology by the A\u03b2-induced release of sTREM2, which blocks A\u03b2 aggregation and neurotoxicity. In contrast, R47H sTREM2 promotes A\u03b2 aggregation into protofibril that may be toxic to neurons. These findings may explain how wild-type sTREM2 apparently protects against AD in\u00a0vivo and why a single copy of the R47H variant gene is associated with increased AD risk.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "TREM2", "amyloid beta", "microglia", "neurotoxicity", "oligomers", "sTREM2"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "Neurons", "Neurotoxicity Syndromes", "Receptors, Immunologic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anna", "Last Name": "Vilalta", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Ye", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jean", "Last Name": "Sevalle", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer K", "Last Name": "Griffin", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Kanayo", "Last Name": "Satoh", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "David H", "Last Name": "Allendorf", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Suman", "Last Name": "De", "Affiliation": "AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Mar", "Last Name": "Puigdell\u00edvol", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Arturas", "Last Name": "Bruzas", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Miguel A", "Last Name": "Burguillos", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Roger B", "Last Name": "Dodd", "Affiliation": "AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Fusheng", "Last Name": "Chen", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Yalun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Flagmeier", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Lisa-Maria", "Last Name": "Needham", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Masahiro", "Last Name": "Enomoto", "Affiliation": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "Henderson", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Jochen", "Last Name": "Walter", "Affiliation": "Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Paul E", "Last Name": "Fraser", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Klenerman", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Cambridge Dementia Research Institute, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Steven F", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Departments of Medicine (Neurology) and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom.

It has recently been discovered that several such protein condensates can undergo a further irreversible phase transition, forming solid nanoscale aggregates associated with neurodegenerative disease5-7. While the irreversible gelation of protein condensates is generally related to malfunction and disease, one case where the liquid-to-solid transition of protein condensates is functional, however, is that of silk spinning8,9. The formation of silk fibrils is largely driven by shear, yet it is not known what factors control the pathological gelation of functional condensates. Here we demonstrate that four proteins and one peptide system, with no function associated with fibre formation, have a strong propensity to undergo a liquid-to-solid transition when exposed to even low levels of mechanical shear once present in their liquid-liquid phase separated form. Using microfluidics to control the application of shear, we generated fibres from single-protein condensates and characterized their structural and material properties as a function of shear stress. Our results reveal generic backbone-backbone hydrogen bonding constraints as a determining factor in governing this transition. These observations suggest that shear can play an important role in the irreversible liquid-to-solid transition of protein condensates, shed light on the role of physical factors in driving this transition in protein aggregation-related diseases and open a new route towards artificial shear responsive biomaterials.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Bombyx", "Cell Line", "Fibroins", "Peptides", "Phase Transition", "Protein Aggregates", "Proteins", "Stress, Mechanical", "Tensile Strength", "Thermodynamics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Francesco Simone", "Last Name": "Ruggeri", "Affiliation": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Daniele", "Last Name": "Vigolo", "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Ayaka", "Last Name": "Kamada", "Affiliation": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Aviad", "Last Name": "Levin", "Affiliation": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Christiane", "Last Name": "Iserman", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Simon", "Last Name": "Alberti", "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Peter St", "Last Name": "George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Tuomas P J", "Last Name": "Knowles", "Affiliation": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom. tpjk2@cam.ac.uk."}], "Journal": "Nature nanotechnology", "PubDate": "2020Oct"}, {"PMID": "32071389", "Title": "Beta amyloid aggregates induce sensitised TLR4 signalling causing long-term potentiation deficit and rat\u00a0neuronal cell death.", "Abstract": "The molecular events causing memory loss and neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) over time are still unknown.

We analyzed variants in 60 genes implicated in DLB, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical parkinsonian or dementia disorders, in order to determine their frequency in DLB. We focused on variants that have previously been reported as pathogenic, and also describe variants reported as pathogenic which remain of unknown clinical significance, as well as variants associated with strong risk. Rare missense variants of unknown significance were found in APP, CHCHD2, DCTN1, GRN, MAPT, NOTCH3, SQSTM1, TBK1 and TIA1. Additionally, we identified a pathogenic GRN p.Arg493* mutation, potentially adding to the diversity of phenotypes associated with this mutation. The rarity of previously reported pathogenic mutations in this cohort suggests that the genetic overlap of other neurodegenerative diseases with DLB is not substantial.

Despite the central role for microglia in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, little is known about their epigenomic regulation of the inflammatory response. Here, we show that Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) methylcytosine dioxygenase expression is increased in microglia upon stimulation with various inflammogens through a NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway. We found that TET2 regulates early gene transcriptional changes, leading to early\u00a0metabolic alterations, as well as a later inflammatory response independently of its enzymatic activity. We further show that TET2 regulates the proinflammatory response in microglia of mice\u00a0intraperitoneally injected with LPS. We observed that microglia associated with amyloid \u03b2 plaques expressed TET2 in brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in 5xFAD mice. Collectively, our findings show that\u00a0TET2 plays an important role in the microglial inflammatory response and suggest TET2 as a potential target to combat neurodegenerative brain disorders.", "Keywords": ["TET2", "TLR-4", "epigenetics", "metabolism", "microglia", "neuroinflammation"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Animals", "Brain", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Dioxygenases", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Microglia", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Rats", "Transcription Factor RelA", "Transcription, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alejandro", "Last Name": "Carrillo-Jimenez", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBiS), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, 41013 Sevilla, Spain;

We conducted a clinical, genetic and epigenetic investigation of a unique Ashkenazi Jewish family with monozygotic triplets, two of whom developed Alzheimer's disease at ages 73 and 76, while the third at age 85 has no cognitive complaints or deficits in daily activities. One of their offspring developed Alzheimer's disease at age 50.

This process ensures an appropriate spatial organization of proteins, vital to polarized cells such as neurons. Here, we present a mechanism for RNA transport in which RNA granules \"hitchhike\" on moving lysosomes. In\u00a0vitro biophysical modeling, live-cell microscopy, and unbiased proximity labeling proteomics reveal that annexin A11 (ANXA11), an RNA granule-associated phosphoinositide-binding protein, acts as a molecular tether between RNA granules and lysosomes. ANXA11 possesses an N-terminal low complexity domain, facilitating its phase separation into membraneless RNA granules, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain, enabling interactions with lysosomes. RNA granule transport requires ANXA11, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutations in ANXA11 impair RNA granule transport by disrupting their interactions with lysosomes. Thus, ANXA11 mediates neuronal RNA transport by tethering RNA granules to actively-transported lysosomes, performing a critical cellular function that is disrupted in ALS.", "Keywords": ["ANXA11", "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Local translation", "Lysosome", "Neurodegeneration", "Neuron", "Organelles contact", "Phase separation", "RNA granule", "RNA transport"], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Annexins", "Axonal Transport", "Axons", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "Female", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Lysosomes", "Male", "Mutation", "Protein Binding", "RNA", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Transfection", "Zebrafish"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ya-Cheng", "Last Name": "Liao", "Affiliation": "HHMI Janelia Research Campus, Ashburn, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael S", "Last Name": "Fernandopulle", "Affiliation": "NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Guozhen", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Heejun", "Last Name": "Choi", "Affiliation": "HHMI Janelia Research Campus, Ashburn, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ling", "Last Name": "Hao", "Affiliation": "NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Catherine M", "Last Name": "Drerup", "Affiliation": "NICHD, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rajan", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Jonathon", "Last Name": "Nixon-Abell", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Shen", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Meadows", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Michele", "Last Name": "Vendruscolo", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Tuomas P J", "Last Name": "Knowles", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK; Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0HE, UK."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Nelson", "Affiliation": "NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Magdalena A", "Last Name": "Czekalska", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Greta", "Last Name": "Musteikyte", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK."}, {"First Name": "Mariam A", "Last Name": "Gachechiladze", "Affiliation": "NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christina A", "Last Name": "Stephens", "Affiliation": "NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "H Amalia", "Last Name": "Pasolli", "Affiliation": "HHMI Janelia Research Campus, Ashburn, VA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lucy R", "Last Name": "Forrest", "Affiliation": "NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK; Department of Medicine (Division of Neurology), University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Lippincott-Schwartz", "Affiliation": "HHMI Janelia Research Campus, Ashburn, VA, USA.

Because AD pathologies begin two decades before the onset of dementia, prevention of A\u03b2 amyloidosis has been proposed as a mean to block the pathological cascade. Here, we generate a transgenic plant-based vaccine, a soybean storage protein containing A\u03b24-10, named A\u03b2+, for oral A\u03b2 immunization. One mg of A\u03b2+ or control protein (A\u03b2-) was administered to TgCRND8 mice once a week from 9 weeks up to 58 weeks. A\u03b2+ immunization raised both anti-A\u03b2 antibodies and cellular immune responses. Spatial learning decline was prevented in the A\u03b2+ immunized group in an extended reference memory version of Morris water maze test from 21 to 57 weeks. In Tris-buffered saline (TBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and formic acid (FA) serial extractions, all sets of A\u03b2 species from A\u03b2 monomer, low to high molecular weight A\u03b2 oligomers, and A\u03b2 smears had different solubility in TgCRND8 brains. A\u03b2 oligomers decreased in TBS fractions, corresponding to an increase in high molecular weight A\u03b2 oligomers in SDS extracts and A\u03b2 smears in FA fraction of the A\u03b2+ treated group. There was significant inhibition of histological A\u03b2 burden, especially in diffuse plaques, and suppression of microglial inflammation. Processing of amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor was not different between A\u03b2+ and A\u03b2- groups. No evidence of amyloid-related inflammatory angiopathy was observed. Thus, A\u03b2+ oral immunization could be a promising, cheap, and long-term safe disease-modifying therapy to prevent the pathological process in AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer vaccines", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers", "plant", "prevention", "soybean", "spatial memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Administration, Oral", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Immunization", "Maze Learning", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Mice, Transgenic", "Plants, Genetically Modified", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Seed Storage Proteins", "Soybean Proteins", "Spatial Learning"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Takeshi", "Last Name": "Kawarabayashi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Geriatrics Research Institute Hospital, Maebashi, Aomori, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Teruhiko", "Last Name": "Terakawa", "Affiliation": "Hokko Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Atsushi", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "Hokko Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Hisakazu", "Last Name": "Hasegawa", "Affiliation": "Hokko Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, Atsugi-shi, Kanagawa, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Sakiko", "Last Name": "Narita", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Kaoru", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Takumi", "Last Name": "Nakamura", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yusuke", "Last Name": "Seino", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Mie", "Last Name": "Hirohata", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Nobue", "Last Name": "Baba", "Affiliation": "Bioanalysis Department, LSI Medience Corporation, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Tetsuya", "Last Name": "Ueda", "Affiliation": "Bioanalysis Department, LSI Medience Corporation, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Yasuo", "Last Name": "Harigaya", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Maebashi Red Cross Hospital, Maebashi, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Fuyuki", "Last Name": "Kametani", "Affiliation": "Department of Dementia and Higher Brain Function, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Nobuyuki", "Last Name": "Maruyama", "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Masao", "Last Name": "Ishimoto", "Affiliation": "Institute of Crop Science, NARO, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Departments of Medicine, Medical Biophysics and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Mikio", "Last Name": "Shoji", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Geriatrics Research Institute Hospital, Maebashi, Aomori, Japan."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2019"}, {"PMID": "30953760", "Title": "Heritability and genetic variance of dementia with Lewy bodies.", "Abstract": "Recent large-scale genetic studies have allowed for the first glimpse of the effects of common genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), identifying risk variants with appreciable effect sizes. However, it is currently well established that a substantial portion of the genetic heritable component of complex traits is not captured by genome-wide significant SNPs. To overcome this issue, we have estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability (SNP heritability) in DLB using a method that is unbiased by allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium properties of the underlying variants. This shows that the heritability of DLB is nearly twice as high as previous estimates based on common variants only (31% vs 59.9%). We also determine the amount of phenotypic variance in DLB that can be explained by recent polygenic risk scores from either Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and show that, despite being highly significant, they explain a low amount of variance. Additionally, to identify pleiotropic events that might improve our understanding of the disease, we performed genetic correlation analyses of DLB with over 200 diseases and biomedically relevant traits. Our data shows that DLB has a positive correlation with education phenotypes, which is opposite to what occurs in AD. Overall, our data suggests that novel genetic risk factors for DLB should be identified by larger GWAS and these are likely to be independent from known AD and PD risk variants.", "Keywords": ["Dementia", "Genetic correlation", "Genetic variance", "Lewy bodies"], "MeSH terms": ["Databases, Genetic", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Lewy Body Disease"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Guerreiro", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK;

Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and A\u03b2 processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P\u2009=\u20091.32\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified.

We used 2 algorithms to confidently detect CNVs, performed a case-control association analysis, screened for candidate CNVs previously associated with DLB-related diseases, and performed a candidate gene approach to fully explore the data. We identified 5 CNV regions with a significant genome-wide association to DLB; 2 of these were only present in cases and absent from publicly available databases: one of the regions overlapped LAPTM4B, a known lysosomal protein, whereas the other overlapped the NME1 locus and SPAG9. We also identified DLB cases presenting rare CNVs in genes previously associated with DLB or related neurodegenerative diseases, such as SNCA, APP, and MAPT. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting genome-wide CNVs in a large DLB cohort.

The use of primary microglial cell cultures has proved to be a valuable tool to study microglial biology under various conditions. However, more advanced transfection methodologies for primary cultured microglia are still needed, as current methodologies provide low transfection efficiency and induce cell death and/or inflammatory activation of the microglia. Here, we describe an easy, and effective method based on the Glial-Mag method (OZ Biosciences) using magnetic nanoparticles and a magnet to successfully transfect primary microglia cells with different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). This method does not require specialist facilities or specific training and does not induce cell toxicity or inflammatory activation.

Using transgenic or viral approaches, we characterized in mice the effects of TYROBP deficiency on the phenotypic and pathological evolution of tauopathy. Biomarkers usually associated with worsening clinical phenotype (i.e., hyperphosphorylation and increased tauopathy spreading) were unexpectedly increased in MAPTP301S;Tyrobp-/- mice despite the improved learning behavior and synaptic function relative to controls with normal levels of TYROBP. Notably, levels of complement cascade initiator C1q were reduced in MAPTP301S;Tyrobp-/- mice, consistent with the prediction that C1q reduction exerts a neuroprotective effect. These observations suggest a model wherein TYROBP-KO-(knock-out)-associated reduction in C1q is associated with normalized learning behavior and electrophysiological properties in tauopathy model mice despite a paradoxical evolution of biomarker signatures usually associated with neurological decline.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Brain", "Complement C1q", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microglia", "Phenotype", "Phosphorylation", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Tauopathies", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mickael", "Last Name": "Audrain", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Vianney", "Last Name": "Haure-Mirande", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Minghui", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Icahn Institute of Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Soong Ho", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Tomas", "Last Name": "Fanutza", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paramita", "Last Name": "Chakrabarty", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA."}, {"First Name": "Paul", "Last Name": "Fraser", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter H", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Todd E", "Last Name": "Golde", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA."}, {"First Name": "Robert D", "Last Name": "Blitzer", "Affiliation": "Departments of Pharmacological Sciences and Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric E", "Last Name": "Schadt", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Icahn Institute of Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bin", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences and Icahn Institute of Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michelle E", "Last Name": "Ehrlich", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA. michelle.ehrlich@mssm.edu."}, {"First Name": "Sam", "Last Name": "Gandy", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA. samuel.gandy@mssm.edu."}], "Journal": "Molecular psychiatry", "PubDate": "2019Sep"}, {"PMID": "29930110", "Title": "Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain.", "Abstract": "Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Brain Diseases", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Phenotype", "Quantitative Trait, Heritable", "Risk Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Brainstorm Consortium", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Verneri", "Last Name": "Anttila", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. verneri.anttila@gmail.com acorvin@tcd.ie bneale@broadinstitute.org."}, {"First Name": "Brendan", "Last Name": "Bulik-Sullivan", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hilary K", "Last Name": "Finucane", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Raymond K", "Last Name": "Walters", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Bras", "Affiliation": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Laramie", "Last Name": "Duncan", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Valentina", "Last Name": "Escott-Price", "Affiliation": "Cardiff University, Medical Research Council Center for Neuropsychiatric Genetics & Genomics, Institute of Psychology, Medicine & Clinical Neuroscience, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Guido J", "Last Name": "Falcone", "Affiliation": "Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Padhraig", "Last Name": "Gormley", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rainer", "Last Name": "Malik", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nikolaos A", "Last Name": "Patsopoulos", "Affiliation": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephan", "Last Name": "Ripke", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Zhi", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Dongmei", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phil H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Patrick", "Last Name": "Turley", "Affiliation": "Analytic Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."}, {"First Name": "Benjamin", "Last Name": "Grenier-Boley", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1167 LabEx DISTALZ, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Vincent", "Last Name": "Chouraki", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1167 LabEx DISTALZ, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Yoichiro", "Last Name": "Kamatani", "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Statistical Analysis, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Claudine", "Last Name": "Berr", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1061 - Neuropsychiatry: Epidemiological and Clinical Research, Montpellier, France."}, {"First Name": "Luc", "Last Name": "Letenneur", "Affiliation": "INSERM, UMR 1219, Bordeaux, France."}, {"First Name": "Didier", "Last Name": "Hannequin", "Affiliation": "Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Amouyel", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1167 LabEx DISTALZ, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Anne", "Last Name": "Boland", "Affiliation": "Centre National de Recherche en G\u00e9nomique Humaine (CNRGH), Institut de biologie Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, CEA, Evry, France."}, {"First Name": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", "Last Name": "Deleuze", "Affiliation": "Centre National de Recherche en G\u00e9nomique Humaine (CNRGH), Institut de biologie Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, CEA, Evry, France."}, {"First Name": "Emmanuelle", "Last Name": "Duron", "Affiliation": "Department of Gerontology, H\u00f4pital Broca, AH-HP, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Badri N", "Last Name": "Vardarajan", "Affiliation": "Gertrude H.

These interactions are modulated by post-translational arginine methylation, wherein arginine hypomethylation strongly promotes phase separation and gelation. Indeed, significant hypomethylation, which occurs in FUS-associated frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), induces FUS condensation into stable intermolecular \u03b2-sheet-rich hydrogels that disrupt RNP granule function and impair new protein synthesis in neuron terminals. We show that transportin acts as a physiological molecular chaperone of FUS in neuron terminals, reducing phase separation and gelation of methylated and hypomethylated FUS and rescuing protein synthesis.

In all cell types, a soluble 17\u00a0kDa N-terminal cleavage fragment was shed into the conditioned media in a constitutive process that is inhibited by G1254023X and metalloprotease inhibitors and siRNA targeting ADAM10. Inhibitors of serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases 2/9, and ADAM17 siRNA did not block TREM2 shedding. Peptidomimetic protease inhibitors highlighted a possible cleavage site, and mass spectrometry confirmed that shedding occurred predominantly at the H157-S158 peptide bond for both wild-type and H157Y human TREM2 and for the wild-type murine orthologue. Crucially, we also show that the Alzheimer's disease-associated H157Y TREM2 variant was shed more rapidly than wild type from HEK293 cells, possibly by a novel, batimastat- and ADAM10-siRNA-independent, sheddase activity.

In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P < 1 \u00d7 10-4) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P < 5 \u00d7 10-8) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 \u00d7 10-10, odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)cases = 0.0059, MAFcontrols = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 \u00d7 10-10, OR = 1.43, MAFcases = 0.011, MAFcontrols = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 \u00d7 10-14, OR = 1.67, MAFcases = 0.0143, MAFcontrols = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Case-Control Studies", "Exome", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Microglia", "Odds Ratio", "Phospholipase C gamma", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Protein Interaction Maps", "Receptors, Immunologic", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rebecca", "Last Name": "Sims", "Affiliation": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Sven J", "Last Name": "van der Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}, {"First Name": "Adam C", "Last Name": "Naj", "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology/Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"First Name": "C\u00e9line", "Last Name": "Bellenguez", "Affiliation": "INSERM, U1167, RID-AGE-Risk Factors and Molecular Determinants of Aging-Related Diseases, Lille, France."}, {"First Name": "Nandini", "Last Name": "Badarinarayan", "Affiliation": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}, {"First Name": "Johanna", "Last Name": "Jakobsdottir", "Affiliation": "Icelandic Heart Association, Kopavogur, Iceland."}, {"First Name": "Brian W", "Last Name": "Kunkle", "Affiliation": "John P.

To explore the molecular basis of this cholinergic dysfunction, we paired translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) with RNA sequencing (TRAP-Seq) to identify the actively translating mRNAs in anterior forebrain cholinergic neurons in the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the downregulation of 67 of 71 known cholinergic-related transcripts, consistent with cholinergic neuron dysfunction in TgCRND8 mice, as well as transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation, neurotrophins, and ribosomal processing. Upregulated transcripts included those related to axon guidance, glutamatergic synapses and kinase activity and included AD-risk genes Sorl1 and Ptk2b. In contrast, the total transcriptome of the anterior forebrain showed upregulation in cytokine signaling, microglia, and immune system pathways, including Trem2, Tyrobp, and Inpp5d.

An alternative strategy is drug repositioning, redirecting existing drugs for another disease. The large amount of biological data accumulated to date warrants a comprehensive investigation to better understand AD pathogenesis and facilitate the process of anti-AD drug repositioning. Hence, we generated a list of anti-AD protein targets by analyzing the most recent publically available 'omics' data, including genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics data. The information related to AD pathogenesis was obtained from the OMIM and PubMed databases. Drug-target data was extracted from the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. We generated a list of 524 AD-related proteins, 18 of which are targets for 75 existing drugs-novel candidates for repurposing as anti-AD treatments. We developed a ranking algorithm to prioritize the anti-AD targets, which revealed CD33 and MIF as the strongest candidates with seven existing drugs. We also found 7 drugs inhibiting a known anti-AD target (acetylcholinesterase) that may be repurposed for treating the cognitive symptoms of AD. The CAD protein and 8 proteins implicated by two 'omics' approaches (ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, PICALM, CELF1, INPP5D, SPON1, and SOD3) might also be promising targets for anti-AD drug development. Our systematic 'omics' mining suggested drugs with novel anti-AD indications, including drugs modulating the immune system or reducing neuroinflammation that are particularly promising for AD intervention. Furthermore, the list of 524 AD-related proteins could be useful not only as potential anti-AD targets but also considered for AD biomarker development.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Data Mining", "Databases, Factual", "Drug Repositioning", "Genomics", "Humans", "Metabolomics", "Proteomics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Ming", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Gerold", "Last Name": "Schmitt-Ulms", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Zhengrui", "Last Name": "Xi", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Yalun", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ye", "Last Name": "Zhou", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ekaterina", "Last Name": "Rogaeva", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "27822510", "Title": "SORL1 mutations in early- and late-onset Alzheimer disease.", "Abstract": "To characterize the clinical and molecular effect of mutations in the sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) gene.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Cuccaro", "Affiliation": "John P.

The ONDRI Genomics subgroup is investigating the genetic basis of neurodegeneration. We have developed a custom next-generation-sequencing-based panel, ONDRISeq that targets 80 genes known to be associated with neurodegeneration. We processed DNA collected from 216 individuals diagnosed with one of the five diseases, on ONDRISeq. All runs were executed on a MiSeq instrument and subjected to rigorous quality control assessments. We also independently validated a subset of the variant calls using NeuroX (a genome-wide array for neurodegenerative disorders), TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, or Sanger sequencing. ONDRISeq consistently generated high-quality genotyping calls and on average, 92% of targeted bases are covered by at least 30 reads. We also observed 100% concordance for the variants identified via ONDRISeq and validated by other genomic technologies. We were successful in detecting known as well as novel rare variants in 72.2% of cases although not all variants are disease-causing. Using ONDRISeq, we also found that the APOE E4 allele had a frequency of 0.167 in these samples.

Investigation of the 5 homologues genes in the TREM locus revealed potentially damaging rare variants in TREM2, TREML1, TREML2, and TREML4. In agreement with a previous report, we observed a significant enrichment of TREM2-damaging missense substitutions in cases (N\u00a0= 9; 4.2%) compared with controls (N=2; 0.9%; p\u00a0= 0.010; after Yates' correction p\u00a0= 0.022).

Men show higher incidences of amnestic mild cognitive impairment yet women disproportionally phenoconvert to AD. It is hypothesized that men maintain greater cognitive reserve than women under comparable amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) challenge. One behavioral aspect of cognitive reserve in mice is the capacity to cope with A\u03b2-associated stereotypies by switching to increasingly effective navigational search strategies in the Morris water maze. To explore inherent sex differences in this paradigm, however, we require an A\u03b2PP mouse model wherein behavioral flexibility is impaired earlier in females than males despite equivalent A\u03b2 load. Here, we show that when F1 C57Bl/6\u00d7C3H/HeJ TgCRND8 mice are placed on C57Bl/6 background, N5 Tg males and females exhibit equivalent A\u03b2 pathologies at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age yet females display learning and memory deficits earlier than males. We further show that this N5 line does not carry the autosomal recessive pde6brd1 mutation that impairs visual acuity and that the estrous cycle is not disrupted on this genetic background. At 5.5 months of age, Tg males, but not females, compensate for A\u03b2-associated stereotypic behaviors (i.e., hyperactive tight circling) by alternating navigational search strategies and adopting increasingly productive spatial search strategies. Females fail to overcome A\u03b2-associated stereotypies and do not efficiently switch from systematic to spatial learning strategies. Together, these data identify a novel A\u03b2PP mouse model that can be used for preclinical testing of interventions targeting sexual dimorphisms in behavioral indices of cognitive reserve.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Morris water maze", "amyloid-\u03b2 cognitive reserve", "learning", "memory", "search strategy", "stereotypy", "transgenic mouse", "visual acuity"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Brain", "Cognitive Reserve", "Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 6", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Mice, Inbred C3H", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Psychomotor Performance", "Sex Characteristics", "Spatial Memory", "Spatial Navigation", "Survival Analysis"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Matthew W", "Last Name": "Granger", "Affiliation": "Neural Regeneration Laboratory, Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Bettina", "Last Name": "Franko", "Affiliation": "Neural Regeneration Laboratory, Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Matthew W", "Last Name": "Taylor", "Affiliation": "Neural Regeneration Laboratory, Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Claude", "Last Name": "Messier", "Affiliation": "School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter St", "Last Name": "George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK and Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Steffany A L", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Neural Regeneration Laboratory, Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2016"}, {"PMID": "26643944", "Title": "Genome-wide analysis of genetic correlation in dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.", "Abstract": "The similarities between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are many and range from clinical presentation, to neuropathological characteristics, to more recently identified, genetic determinants of risk.

Hundreds of causative DNA changes have been found, but much of the genetic basis of the disease is still unexplained. Mutations in the ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene are a frequent cause of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and peripheral axonal neuropathy, and account for \u223c 40% of autosomal recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The overlap of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with both diseases, as well as the common autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of thin corpus callosum and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in three related patients, prompted us to analyse the ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 gene in affected individuals with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We investigated 28 unrelated families with autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease defined by clinical, electrophysiological, as well as pathological evaluation. Besides, we screened for all the known genes related to axonal autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2A2/HMSN2A2/MFN2, CMT2B1/LMNA, CMT2B2/MED25, CMT2B5/NEFL, ARCMT2F/dHMN2B/HSPB1, CMT2K/GDAP1, CMT2P/LRSAM1, CMT2R/TRIM2, CMT2S/IGHMBP2, CMT2T/HSJ1, CMTRID/COX6A1, ARAN-NM/HINT and GAN/GAN), for the genes related to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum and axonal peripheral neuropathy (SPG7/PGN, SPG15/ZFYVE26, SPG21/ACP33, SPG35/FA2H, SPG46/GBA2, SPG55/C12orf65 and SPG56/CYP2U1), as well as for the causative gene of peripheral neuropathy with or without agenesis of the corpus callosum (SLC12A6). Mitochondrial disorders related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 were also excluded by sequencing POLG and TYMP genes. An additional locus for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2H on chromosome 8q13-21.1 was excluded by linkage analysis. Pedigrees originated in Italy, Brazil, Canada, England, Iran, and Japan. Interestingly, we identified 15 ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 mutations in 12 families (two sequence variants were never reported before, p.Gln198* and p.Pro2212fs*5). No large deletions/duplications were detected in these patients. The novel mutations seemed to be pathogenic since they co-segregated with the disease in all pedigrees and were absent in 300 unrelated controls. Furthermore, in silico analysis predicted their pathogenic effect. Our results indicate that ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 is the causative gene of a wide spectrum of clinical features, including autosomal recessive axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.", "Keywords": ["ALS5/SPG11/KIAA1840 mutations", "Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease", "axonal degeneration", "spatacsin"], "MeSH terms": ["Case-Control Studies", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Female", "Genes, Recessive", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases", "Proteins", "Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Celeste", "Last Name": "Montecchiani", "Affiliation": "1 Laboratorio di Neurogenetica, CERC - IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Lucia", "Last Name": "Pedace", "Affiliation": "1 Laboratorio di Neurogenetica, CERC - IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Temistocle", "Last Name": "Lo Giudice", "Affiliation": "1 Laboratorio di Neurogenetica, CERC - IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy 2 Dipartimento di Medicina dei Sistemi, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Antonella", "Last Name": "Casella", "Affiliation": "1 Laboratorio di Neurogenetica, CERC - IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Marzia", "Last Name": "Mearini", "Affiliation": "1 Laboratorio di Neurogenetica, CERC - IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Fabrizio", "Last Name": "Gaudiello", "Affiliation": "1 Laboratorio di Neurogenetica, CERC - IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Jos\u00e9 L", "Last Name": "Pedroso", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Chiara", "Last Name": "Terracciano", "Affiliation": "2 Dipartimento di Medicina dei Sistemi, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Carlo", "Last Name": "Caltagirone", "Affiliation": "2 Dipartimento di Medicina dei Sistemi, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy 4 Laboratorio di Neurologia Clinica e Comportamentale, IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Roberto", "Last Name": "Massa", "Affiliation": "2 Dipartimento di Medicina dei Sistemi, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Peter H", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "5 Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 6 Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 7 Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}, {"First Name": "Orlando G P", "Last Name": "Barsottini", "Affiliation": "3 Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"First Name": "Toshitaka", "Last Name": "Kawarai", "Affiliation": "8 Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan."}, {"First Name": "Antonio", "Last Name": "Orlacchio", "Affiliation": "1 Laboratorio di Neurogenetica, CERC - IRCCS Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy 2 Dipartimento di Medicina dei Sistemi, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy a.orlacchio@hsantalucia.it."}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2016Jan"}, {"PMID": "26526393", "Title": "ALS/FTD Mutation-Induced Phase Transition of FUS Liquid Droplets and Reversible Hydrogels into Irreversible Hydrogels Impairs RNP Granule Function.", "Abstract": "The mechanisms by which mutations in FUS and other RNA binding proteins cause ALS and FTD remain controversial. We propose a model in which low-complexity (LC) domains of FUS drive its physiologically reversible assembly into membrane-free, liquid droplet and hydrogel-like structures. ALS/FTD mutations in LC or non-LC domains induce further phase transition into poorly soluble fibrillar hydrogels distinct from conventional amyloids. These assemblies are necessary and sufficient for neurotoxicity in a C. elegans model of FUS-dependent neurodegeneration. They trap other ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granule components and disrupt RNP granule function. One consequence is impairment of new protein synthesis by cytoplasmic RNP granules in axon terminals, where RNP granules regulate local RNA metabolism and translation. Nuclear FUS granules may be similarly affected. Inhibiting formation of these fibrillar hydrogel assemblies mitigates neurotoxicity and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy that may also be applicable to ALS/FTD associated with mutations in other RNA binding proteins.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "Disease Models, Animal", "Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration", "Hydrogels", "Longevity", "Motor Activity", "Mutation", "Phase Transition", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA-Binding Protein FUS", "Ribonucleoproteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Tetsuro", "Last Name": "Murakami", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Departments of Medicine, Medical Biophysics and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research - Biomedical Research Unit in Dementia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Julie Qiaojin", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Development, and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3DY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Gabriele S Kaminski", "Last Name": "Schierle", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3RA, UK."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Rees", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3RA, UK."}, {"First Name": "Akinori", "Last Name": "Miyashita", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Departments of Medicine, Medical Biophysics and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Ana R", "Last Name": "Costa", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research - Biomedical Research Unit in Dementia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Roger B", "Last Name": "Dodd", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research - Biomedical Research Unit in Dementia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Fiona T S", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3RA, UK."}, {"First Name": "Claire H", "Last Name": "Michel", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3RA, UK."}, {"First Name": "Deborah", "Last Name": "Kronenberg-Versteeg", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research - Biomedical Research Unit in Dementia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Yi", "Last Name": "Li", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research - Biomedical Research Unit in Dementia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Seung-Pil", "Last Name": "Yang", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Departments of Medicine, Medical Biophysics and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Yosuke", "Last Name": "Wakutani", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Departments of Medicine, Medical Biophysics and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "William", "Last Name": "Meadows", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research - Biomedical Research Unit in Dementia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Rodylyn Rose", "Last Name": "Ferry", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Departments of Medicine, Medical Biophysics and Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3H2, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Liang", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research - Biomedical Research Unit in Dementia, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK."}, {"First Name": "Gian Gaetano", "Last Name": "Tartaglia", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK;

To tackle this challenge, we applied a high-throughput chemical microarray surface plasmon resonance imaging screen to detect the binding between small molecules and monomeric full-length Tau, a protein linked with the onset of a range of Tauopathies. The screen identified a novel set of drug-like fragment and lead-like compounds that bound to Tau. We verified that the majority of these hit compounds reduced the aggregation of different Tau constructs in vitro and in N2a cells.

Appoptosin overexpression increased caspase-mediated tau cleavage, tau aggregation, and synaptic dysfunction, whereas appoptosin deficiency reduced tau cleavage and aggregation. Appoptosin transduction impaired multiple motor functions and exacerbated neuropathology in tau-transgenic mice in a manner dependent on caspase-3 and tau. Increased appoptosin and caspase-3-cleaved tau were also observed in brain samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia with tau inclusions.

ABCA7 has been shown to mediate phagocytosis and affect membrane trafficking. The current study examined the impact of ABCA7 loss of function on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and generation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). Suppression of endogenous ABCA7 in several different cell lines resulted in increased \u03b2-secretase cleavage and elevated A\u03b2. ABCA7 knock-out mice displayed an increased production of endogenous murine amyloid A\u03b242 species. Crossing ABCA7-deficient animals to an APP transgenic model resulted in significant increases in the soluble A\u03b2 as compared with mice expressing normal levels of ABCA7. Only modest changes in the amount of insoluble A\u03b2 and amyloid plaque densities were observed once the amyloid pathology was well developed, whereas A\u03b2 deposition was enhanced in younger animals. In vitro studies indicated a more rapid endocytosis of APP in ABCA7 knock-out cells that is mechanistically consistent with the increased A\u03b2 production. These in vitro and in vivo findings indicate a direct role of ABCA7 in amyloid processing that may be associated with its primary biological function to regulate endocytic pathways. Several potential loss-of-function ABCA7 mutations and deletions linked to Alzheimer disease that in some instances have a greater impact than apoE allelic variants have recently been identified. A reduction in ABCA7 expression or loss of function would be predicted to increase amyloid production and that may be a contributing factor in the associated Alzheimer disease susceptibility.",

of oligomeric forms of amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b2) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how these oligomers might first impair neuronal function at the onset of pathology is poorly understood. Here we have examined the underlying toxic effects caused by an increase in levels of intracellular A\u03b2, an event that could be important during the early stages of the disease. We show that oligomerised A\u03b2 induces a rapid enhancement of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (EPSC(A)) when applied intracellularly. This effect is dependent on postsynaptic Ca(2+) and PKA. Knockdown of GluA1, but not GluA2, prevents the effect, as does expression of a S845-phosphomutant of GluA1. Significantly, an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), IEM 1460, reverses the increase in the amplitude of EPSC(A). These results suggest that a primary neuronal response to intracellular A\u03b2 oligomers is the rapid synaptic insertion of CP-AMPARs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid

"25523933", "Title": "Structural biology of presenilin 1 complexes.", "Abstract": "The presenilin genes were first identified as the site of missense mutations causing early onset autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease. Subsequent work has shown that the presenilin proteins are the catalytic subunits of a hetero-tetrameric complex containing APH1, nicastrin and PEN-2. This complex (variously termed presenilin complex or gamma-secretase complex) performs an unusual type of proteolysis in which the transmembrane domains of Type I proteins are cleaved within the hydrophobic compartment of the membrane. This review describes some of the molecular and structural biology of this unusual enzyme complex. The presenilin complex is a bilobed structure. The head domain contains the ectodomain of nicastrin. The base domain contains a central cavity with a lateral cleft that likely provides the route for access of the substrate to the catalytic cavity within the centre of the base domain. There are reciprocal allosteric interactions between various sites in the complex that affect its function. For instance, binding of Compound E, a peptidomimetic inhibitor to the PS1 N-terminus, induces significant conformational changes that reduces substrate binding at the initial substrate docking site, and thus inhibits substrate cleavage. However, there is a reciprocal allosteric interaction between these sites such that prior binding of the substrate to the initial docking site paradoxically increases the binding of the Compound E peptidomimetic inhibitor.

Robust biomarkers for AD do not yet exist, although changes in the cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau and A\u03b2 represent promising candidates in addition to brain imaging and genetic risk profiling. Although concentrations of soluble A\u03b242 correlate with symptoms of AD, less is known about the biological activities of A\u03b2 peptides which are generated from the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor. An unbiased DNA microarray study showed that A\u03b242, at sub-lethal concentrations, specifically increases expression of several genes in neuroblastoma cells, notably the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3 and 5 (IGFBP3/5), the transcription regulator inhibitor of DNA binding, and the transcription factor Lim only domain protein 4. Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that mRNA levels of the identified candidate genes were exclusively increased by the potentially neurotoxic A\u03b242 wild-type peptide, as both the less toxic A\u03b240 and a non-toxic substitution peptide A\u03b242 G33A did not affect mRNA levels. In vivo immunohistochemistry revealed a corresponding increase in both hippocampal and cortical IGFBP5 expression in an AD mouse model. Proteomic analyses of human AD cerebrospinal fluid displayed increased in vivo concentrations of IGFBPs. IGFBPs and transcription factors, as identified here, are modulated by soluble A\u03b242 and may represent useful early biomarkers.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "CSF proteomics", "ID1-3", "IGFBP", "LMO4", "amyloid-\u03b2", "gene regulation", "immunohistochemistry", "transcription factors"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cerebral Cortex", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microarray Analysis", "Peptide Fragments", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "RNA, Messenger", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Barucker", "Affiliation": "Institut fuer Chemie und Biochemie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Anette", "Last Name": "Sommer", "Affiliation": "Bayer Pharma AG, Global Drug Discovery, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Georg", "Last Name": "Beckmann", "Affiliation": "Bayer Pharma AG, Global Drug Discovery, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Murat", "Last Name": "Eravci", "Affiliation": "Institut fuer Chemie und Biochemie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Anja", "Last Name": "Harmeier", "Affiliation": "Institut fuer Chemie und Biochemie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Carola G", "Last Name": "Schipke", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Damian", "Last Name": "Brockschnieder", "Affiliation": "Bayer Pharma AG, Global Drug Discovery, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Thomas", "Last Name": "Dyrks", "Affiliation": "Bayer Pharma AG, Global Drug Discovery, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Veit", "Last Name": "Althoff", "Affiliation": "Institut fuer Chemie und Biochemie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Paul E", "Last Name": "Fraser", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, Departments of Medicine and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Lili-Naz", "Last Name": "Hazrati", "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Peter St", "Last Name": "George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, Departments of Medicine and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."}, {"First Name": "John C S", "Last Name": "Breitner", "Affiliation": "Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Verdun, QC, Canada Department of Psychiatry, McGill University Faculty of Medicine, Montreal, QC, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Oliver", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gerhard", "Last Name": "Multhaup", "Affiliation": "Institut fuer Chemie und Biochemie, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Berlin, Germany Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada."}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2015"}, {"PMID": "25294384", "Title": "Single-molecule imaging reveals that small amyloid-\u03b21-42 oligomers interact with the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)).", "Abstract": "Oligomers of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and have been suggested to induce neurotoxicity by binding to a plethora of cell-surface receptors.

Our results show that, at nanomolar concentrations, oA\u03b242 interacts with PrP(C) and that the species bound to PrP(C) are predominantly small oligomers (dimers and trimers).

However, mutation analysis by Sanger sequencing is costly and time consuming. We tested the utility of a recently designed semi-custom genome-wide array (NeuroX; Illumina, Inc) tailored to study neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., mutation screening). We investigated 192 patients with 4 different neurodegenerative disorders for the presence of rare damaging variations in 77 genes implicated in these diseases. Several causative mutations were identified and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, including PSEN1 p.M233T responsible for Alzheimer's disease in a large Italian family, as well as SOD1 p.A4V and p.I113T in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In total, we identified 78 potentially damaging rare variants (frequency <1%), including ABCA7 p.L400V in a family with Alzheimer's disease and LRRK2 p.R1514Q in 6 of 98 patients with Parkinson's disease (6.1%).

To test this hypothesis, we have performed an association study of 54 genomic regions, previously implicated in PD or AD, in a large cohort of DLB cases and controls. The cohort comprised 788 DLB cases and 2624 controls. To minimize the issue of potential misdiagnosis, we have also performed the analysis including only neuropathologically proven DLB cases (667 cases). The results show that the APOE is a strong genetic risk factor for DLB, confirming previous findings, and that the SNCA and SCARB2 loci are also associated after a study-wise Bonferroni correction, although these have a different association profile than the associations reported for the same loci in PD. We have previously shown that the p.N370S variant in GBA is associated with DLB, which, together with the findings at the SCARB2 locus, suggests a role for lysosomal dysfunction in this disease. These results indicate that DLB has a unique genetic risk profile when compared with the two most common neurodegenerative diseases and that the lysosome may play an important role in the etiology of this disorder.

C9orf72 transcription is reduced in expansion carriers implicating haploinsufficiency as one of the disease mechanisms. Indeed, our recent ALS study revealed that the expansion was associated with hypermethylation of the CpG-island (5'of the repeat) in DNA samples obtained from different tissues (blood, brain and spinal cord). However, the link between FTLD and methylation of the CpG-island is unknown. Hence, we investigated the methylation profile of the same CpG-island by bisulfite sequencing of DNA obtained from blood of 34 FTLD expansion carriers, 166 FTLD non-carriers and 103 controls. Methylation level was significantly higher in FTLD expansion carriers than non-carriers (P = 7.8E-13). Our results were confirmed by two methods (HhaI-assay and sequencing of cloned bisulfite PCR products). Hypermethylation occurred only in carriers of an allele with >50 repeats, and was not detected in non-carriers or individuals with an intermediate allele (22-43 repeats). As expected, the position/number of methylated CpGs was concordant between the sense and anti-sense DNA strand, suggesting that it is a stable epigenetic modification. Analysis of the combined ALS and FTLD datasets (82 expansion carriers) revealed that the degree of methylation of the entire CpG-island or contribution of specific CpGs (n = 26) is similar in both syndromes, with a trend towards a higher proportion of ALS patients with a high methylation level (P = 0.09). In conclusion, we demonstrated that hypermethylation of the CpG-island 5'of the G\u2084C\u2082-repeat is expansion-specific, but not syndrome-specific (ALS versus FTLD).", "Keywords": [], "MeSH

amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide have been implicated in the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease. We have used single-molecule techniques to examine quantitatively the cellular effects of adding well characterized A\u03b2 oligomers to primary hippocampal cells and hence determine the initial pathway of damage. We found that even picomolar concentrations of A\u03b2 (1-40) and A\u03b2 (1-42) oligomers can, within minutes of addition, increase the levels of intracellular calcium in astrocytes but not in neurons, and this effect is saturated at a concentration of about 10 nM of oligomers. Both A\u03b2 (1-40) and A\u03b2 (1-42) oligomers have comparable effects. The rise in intracellular calcium is followed by an increase in the rate of ROS production by NADPH oxidase in both neurons and astrocytes. The increase in ROS production then triggers caspase-3 activation resulting in the inhibition of long-term potentiation. Our quantitative approach also reveals that only a small fraction of the oligomers are damaging and that an individual rare oligomer binding to an astrocyte can initiate the aforementioned cascade of responses, making it unlikely to be due to any specific interaction. Preincubating the A\u03b2 oligomers with an extracellular chaperone, clusterin, sequesters the oligomers in long-lived complexes and inhibits all of the physiological damage, even at a ratio of 100:1, total A\u03b2 to clusterin. To explain how A\u03b2 oligomers are so damaging but that it takes decades to develop Alzheimer's disease, we suggest a model for disease progression where small amounts of neuronal damage from individual unsequestered oligomers can accumulate over time leading to widespread tissue-level dysfunction.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Biopolymers", "Calcium", "Caspase 3", "Enzyme Activation", "Neurons", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Priyanka", "Last Name": "Narayan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge , Lensfield Road, Cambridge, U.K."}, {"First Name": "Kira M", "Last Name": "Holmstr\u00f6m", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Dong-Hyun", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel J", "Last Name": "Whitcomb", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark R", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas W", "Last Name": "Wood", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher M", "Last Name": "Dobson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kwangwook", "Last Name": "Cho", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrey Y", "Last Name": "Abramov", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Klenerman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Biochemistry", "PubDate": "2014Apr22"}, {"PMID": "24415002", "Title": "Early fear memory defects are associated with altered synaptic plasticity and molecular architecture in the TgCRND8 Alzheimer's disease mouse model.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and slowly progressing dementing disorder that results in neuronal and synaptic loss, deposition in brain of aberrantly folded proteins, and impairment of spatial and episodic memory. Most studies of mouse models of AD have employed analyses of cognitive status and assessment of amyloid burden, gliosis, and molecular pathology during disease progression. Here we sought to understand the behavioral, cellular, ultrastructural, and molecular changes that occur at a pathological stage equivalent to the early stages of human AD. We studied the TgCRND8 mouse, a model of aggressive AD amyloidosis, at an early stage of plaque pathology (3 months of age) in comparison to their wildtype littermates and assessed changes in cognition, neuron and spine structure, and expression of synaptic glutamate receptor proteins. We found that, at this age, TgCRND8 mice display substantial plaque deposition in the neocortex and hippocampus and impairment on cued and contextual memory tasks. Of particular interest, we also observed a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the hippocampus. Furthermore, analysis of CA1 neurons revealed significant changes in apical and basal dendritic spine types, as well as altered expression of GluN1 and GluA2 receptors. This change in molecular architecture within the hippocampus may reflect a rising representation of inherently less stable thin spine populations, which can cause cognitive decline.

These common variants have replicable but small effects on LOAD risk and generally do not have obvious functional effects. Low-frequency coding variants, not detected by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding variants with large effects on LOAD risk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 14 large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in several large LOAD case-control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3 (phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two independent families and doubled risk for Alzheimer's disease in seven independent case-control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and controls of European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases and controls of European descent and 302 African American cases and controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several variants in this gene increase risk for Alzheimer's disease in both populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from Alzheimer's disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of PLD3 leads to a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) and extracellular A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in extracellular A\u03b242 and A\u03b240.

The development of array technologies has helped to identify rare recessive mutations among long runs of homozygosity (ROHs), in which both parental alleles are identical. Caribbean Hispanics are known to have an elevated risk for AD and tend to have large families with evidence of inbreeding. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the late-onset AD in a Caribbean Hispanic population might be explained in part by the homozygosity of unknown loci that could harbor recessive AD risk haplotypes or pathologic mutations. DESIGN We used genome-wide array data to identify ROHs (&gt;1 megabase) and conducted global burden and locus-specific ROH analyses. SETTING A whole-genome case-control ROH study. PARTICIPANTS A Caribbean Hispanic data set of 547 unrelated cases (48.8% with familial AD) and 542 controls collected from a population known to have a 3-fold higher risk of AD vs non-Hispanics in the same community. Based on a Structure program analysis, our data set consisted of African Hispanic (207 cases and 192 controls) and European Hispanic (329 cases and 326 controls) participants. EXPOSURE Alzheimer disease risk genes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the total and mean lengths of the ROHs per sample. Global burden measurements among autosomal chromosomes were investigated in cases vs controls. Pools of overlapping ROH segments (consensus regions) were identified, and the case to control ratio was calculated for each consensus region. We formulated the tested hypothesis before data collection. RESULTS In total, we identified 17 137 autosomal regions with ROHs. The mean length of the ROH per person was significantly greater in cases vs controls (P\u2009=\u2009.0039), and this association was stronger with familial AD (P\u2009=\u2009.0005). Among the European Hispanics, a consensus region at the EXOC4 locus was significantly associated with AD even after correction for multiple testing (empirical P value 1 [EMP1], .0001; EMP2, .002; 21 AD cases vs 2 controls). Among the African Hispanic subset, the most significant but nominal association was observed for CTNNA3, a well-known AD gene candidate (EMP1, .002; 10 AD cases vs 0 controls). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results show that ROHs could significantly contribute to the etiology of AD. Future studies would require the analysis of larger, relatively inbred data sets that might reveal novel recessive AD genes. The next step is to conduct sequencing of top significant loci in a subset of samples with overlapping ROHs.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Caribbean Region", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Hispanic or Latino", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mahdi", "Last Name": "Ghani", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Christine", "Last Name": "Sato", "Affiliation": "Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Joseph H", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Gertrude H.

Recent studies suggest that this isoform shows higher toxicity and amyloidogenecity when compared to full-length A\u03b2 peptides. Here, we report the first comprehensive and comparative IHC evaluation of pyroGlu-3 A\u03b2 deposition in humans and animal models. PyroGlu-3 A\u03b2 immunoreactivity (IR) is abundant in plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy of AD and Down syndrome patients, colocalizing with general A\u03b2 IR. PyroGlu-3 A\u03b2 is further present in two nontransgenic mammalian models of cerebral amyloidosis, Caribbean vervets, and beagle canines. In addition, pyroGlu-3 A\u03b2 deposition was analyzed in 12 different AD-like transgenic mouse models. In contrast to humans, all transgenic models showed general A\u03b2 deposition preceding pyroGlu-3 A\u03b2 deposition. The findings varied greatly among the mouse models concerning age of onset and cortical brain region. In summary, pyroGlu-3 A\u03b2 is a major species of \u03b2-amyloid deposited early in diffuse and focal plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in humans and nonhuman primates, whereas it is deposited later in a subset of focal and vascular amyloid in AD-like transgenic mouse models.

Subsequent analysis combining results for several SORL1 SNPs in the Japanese, Korean (339 cases, 1,129 controls) and Caucasians (11,840 AD cases, 10,931 controls) revealed genome wide significance with rs11218343 (P\u200a=\u200a1.77\u00d710(-9)) and rs3781834 (P\u200a=\u200a1.04\u00d710(-8)). SNPs in previously established AD loci in Caucasians showed strong evidence of association in Japanese including rs3851179 near PICALM (P\u200a=\u200a1.71\u00d710(-5)) and rs744373 near BIN1 (P\u200a=\u200a1.39\u00d710(-4)). The associated allele for each of these SNPs was the same as in Caucasians. These data demonstrate for the first time genome-wide significance of LOAD with SORL1 and confirm the role of other known loci for LOAD in Japanese.

Neuropathological examination showed abundant amyloid plaques, widespread neurofibrillary pathology, Pick bodies in the hippocampus and cortex, cortical globose tangles and ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions in white matter oligodendrocytes. We report a kindred with clinical features of FTD, whose proband bore the PS-1 M146V mutation and showed diffuse Alzheimer's type pathology and Pick bodies on post-mortem neuropathological examination.

However, little is known about the specific mechanisms by which these misfolded species induce such detrimental effects on cells. In this work, we use single-molecule imaging techniques to examine the initial interactions between A\u03b2 monomers and oligomers and the membranes of live cells. This highly sensitive method enables the visualization of individual A\u03b2 species on the cell surface and characterization of their oligomerization state, all at biologically relevant, nanomolar concentrations. The results indicate that oligomers preferentially interact with cell membranes, relative to monomers and that the oligomers become immobilized on the cell surface. Additionally, we observe that the interaction of A\u03b2 species with the cell membrane is inhibited by the presence of ATP-independent molecular chaperones. This study demonstrates the power of this methodology for characterizing the interactions between protein aggregates and the membranes of live neuronal cells at physiologically relevant concentrations and opens the door to quantitative studies of the cellular responses to potentially pathogenic oligomers.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Cell Membrane", "Diffusion", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Particle Size", "Recombinant Proteins", "Surface Properties"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Priyanka", "Last Name": "Narayan", "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, United Kingdom CB2 1EW."}, {"First Name": "Kristina A", "Last Name": "Ganzinger", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "James", "Last Name": "McColl", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Laura", "Last Name": "Weimann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Sarah", "Last Name": "Meehan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Seema", "Last Name": "Qamar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John A", "Last Name": "Carver", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mark R", "Last Name": "Wilson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher M", "Last Name": "Dobson", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Klenerman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Chemical Society", "PubDate": "2013Jan30"}, {"PMID": "23150934", "Title": "TREM2 variants in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Brain", "Exome", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Genotyping Techniques", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred A", "Mutation", "RNA, Messenger", "Receptors, Immunologic", "Risk Factors", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rita", "Last Name": "Guerreiro", "Affiliation": "University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom."}, {"First Name": "Aleksandra", "Last Name": "Wojtas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jose", "Last Name": "Bras", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Minerva", "Last Name": "Carrasquillo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ekaterina", "Last Name": "Rogaeva", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elisa", "Last Name": "Majounie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carlos", "Last Name": "Cruchaga", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Celeste", "Last Name": "Sassi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John S K", "Last Name": "Kauwe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven", "Last Name": "Younkin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Lilinaz", "Last Name": "Hazrati", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Collinge", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jennifer", "Last Name": "Pocock", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tammaryn", "Last Name": "Lashley", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Williams", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Charles", "Last Name": "Lambert", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Amouyel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alison", "Last Name": "Goate", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rosa", "Last Name": "Rademakers", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kevin", "Last Name": "Morgan", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Powell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Peter", "Last Name": "St George-Hyslop", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Andrew", "Last Name": "Singleton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Hardy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "N/A", "Last Name": "Alzheimer Genetic Analysis Group", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The New England journal of medicine", "PubDate": "2013Jan10"}]
