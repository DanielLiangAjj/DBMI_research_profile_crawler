[{"PMID": "38360903", "Title": "Distinctive CD56dim NK subset profiles and increased NKG2D expression in blood NK cells of Parkinson's disease patients.", "Abstract": "Mounting data suggest an important role for the immune system in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous evidence of increased natural killer (NK) cell populations in PD suggests a potential role of NK cells in the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous studies have analyzed NK cell populations using aggregation by variable expression of CD56 and CD16. It remains unknown what differences may exist between NK cell subpopulations when stratified using more nuanced classification. Here, we profile NK cell subpopulations and elucidate the expressions of activating, NKG2D, inhibitory, NKG2A, and homing, CX3CR1, receptors on NK cell subpopulations in PD and healthy controls (HC). We analyzed cryopreserved PMBC samples using a 10-color flow cytometry panel to evaluate NK cell subpopulations in 31 individuals with sporadic PD and 27 HC participants. Here we identified significant differences in the CD56dim NK subset that changes with disease severity in PD. Furthermore, the expressions of NKG2D in all three NK cell subsets were significantly elevated in PD patients compared to HC. Notably, NKG2A expression in the CD56bright NK subset increased in PD patients with longer disease duration but there were no changes in CX3CR1. In summary, our data suggests that changes in NK cells may be influenced by the clinical severity and duration of PD.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Weber", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, Athens, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kelly B", "Last Name": "Menees", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, Athens, GA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jieun", "Last Name": "Park", "Affiliation": "Harrison College of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA."}, {"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Agin-Liebes", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chih-Chun", "Last Name": "Lin", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roy N", "Last Name": "Alcalay", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jae-Kyung", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, Athens, GA, USA. jamlee@uga.edu."}], "Journal": "NPJ Parkinson's disease", "PubDate": "2024Feb15"}, {"PMID": "37218402", "Title": "Patterns of TDP-43 Deposition in Brains with LRRK2 G2019S Mutations.", "Abstract": "To assess for TDP-43 deposits in brains with and without a LRRK2 G2019S mutation.", "Keywords": ["LRRK2", "TDP-43", "neuropathology"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Brain", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Agin-Liebes", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard A", "Last Name": "Hickman", "Affiliation": "Department of Defense/Uniformed Services University Brain Tissue Repository, Departments of Pathology and Surgery, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jean Paul", "Last Name": "Vonsattel", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Phyllis L", "Last Name": "Faust", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Xena", "Last Name": "Flowers", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Irina", "Last Name": "Utkina Sosunova", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Joel", "Last Name": "Ntiri", "Affiliation": "Columbia College, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Matthew", "Last Name": "Surface", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Marder", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stanley", "Last Name": "Fahn", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Przedborski", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roy N", "Last Name": "Alcalay", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society", "PubDate": "2023Aug"}, {"PMID": "36691528", "Title": "Emerging therapies and recent advances for Tourette syndrome.", "Abstract": "Tourette syndrome is the most prevalent hyperkinetic movement disorder in children and can be highly disabling. While the pathomechanism of Tourette syndrome remains largely obscure, recent studies have greatly improved our knowledge about this disease, providing a new perspective in our understanding of this condition. Advances in electrophysiology and neuroimaging have elucidated that there is a reduction in frontal cortical volume and reduction of long rage connectivity to the frontal lobe from other parts of the brain. Several genes have also been identified to be associated with Tourette syndrome. Treatment of Tourette syndrome requires a multidisciplinary approach which includes behavioral and pharmacological therapy. In severe cases surgical therapy with deep brain stimulation may be warranted, though the optimal location for stimulation is still being investigated. Studies on alternative therapies including traditional Chinese medicine and neuromodulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation have shown promising results, but still are being used in an experimental basis. Several new therapies have also recently been tested in clinical trials.

Although not known to produce autoimmune responses, we hypothesized that the appearance of aggregated tau and p-tau with disease could activate the immune system. We thus compared T cell responses to tau and p-tau-derived peptides between PD patients, age-matched healthy controls, and young healthy controls (<35 y old; who are less likely to have high levels of tau aggregates). All groups exhibited CD4+ T cell responses to tau-derived peptides, which were associated with secretion of IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, and/or IL-4. The PD and control participants exhibited a similar magnitude and breadth of responses. Some tau-derived epitopes, consisting of both unmodified and p-tau residues, were more highly represented in PD participants. These results were verified in an independent set of PD and control donors (either age-matched or young controls). Thus, T cells recognizing tau epitopes escape central and peripheral tolerance in relatively high numbers, and the magnitude and nature of these responses are not modulated by age or PD disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Autoimmunity", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cells, Cultured", "Clonal Selection, Antigen-Mediated", "Female", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptides", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity", "Young Adult", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Cecilia S", "Last Name": "Lindestam Arlehamn", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Pham", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "Roy N", "Last Name": "Alcalay", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "April", "Last Name": "Frazier", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "Evan", "Last Name": "Shorr", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Chelsea", "Last Name": "Carpenter", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "John", "Last Name": "Sidney", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "Rekha", "Last Name": "Dhanwani", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "Julian", "Last Name": "Agin-Liebes", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Garretti", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Amy W", "Last Name": "Amara", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233."}, {"First Name": "David G", "Last Name": "Standaert", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233."}, {"First Name": "Elizabeth J", "Last Name": "Phillips", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37235."}, {"First Name": "Simon A", "Last Name": "Mallal", "Affiliation": "Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37235."}, {"First Name": "Bjoern", "Last Name": "Peters", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Sulzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, NY 10032."}, {"First Name": "Alessandro", "Last Name": "Sette", "Affiliation": "Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037;
