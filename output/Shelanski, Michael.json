[{"PMID": "36379916", "Title": "Genuine selective caspase-2 inhibition with new irreversible small peptidomimetics.", "Abstract": "Caspase-2 (Casp2) is a promising therapeutic target in several human diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the design of an active-site-directed inhibitor selective to individual caspase family members is challenging because caspases have extremely similar active sites. Here we present new peptidomimetics derived from the VDVAD pentapeptide structure, harboring non-natural modifications at the P2 position and an irreversible warhead. Enzyme kinetics show that these new compounds, such as LJ2 or its specific isomers LJ2a, and LJ3a, strongly and irreversibly inhibit Casp2 with genuine selectivity. In agreement with the established role of Casp2 in cellular stress responses, LJ2 inhibits cell death induced by microtubule destabilization or hydroxamic acid-based deacetylase inhibition. The most potent peptidomimetic, LJ2a, inhibits human Casp2 with a remarkably high inactivation rate (k3/Ki ~5,500,000\u2009M-1\u2009s-1), and the most selective inhibitor, LJ3a, has close to a 1000 times higher inactivation rate on Casp2 as compared to Casp3. Structural analysis of LJ3a shows that the spatial configuration of C\u03b1 at the P2 position determines inhibitor efficacy. In transfected human cell lines overexpressing site-1 protease (S1P), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and Casp2, LJ2a and LJ3a fully inhibit Casp2-mediated S1P cleavage and thus SREBP2 activation, suggesting a potential to prevent NASH development. Furthermore, in primary hippocampal neurons treated with \u03b2-amyloid oligomers, submicromolar concentrations of LJ2a and of LJ3a prevent synapse loss, indicating a potential for further investigations in AD treatment.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "Caspase 2", "Caspase 3", "Neurons", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Peptidomimetics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Elodie", "Last Name": "Bosc", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Julie", "Last Name": "Anastasie", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Feryel", "Last Name": "Soualmia", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Pascale", "Last Name": "Coric", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, CNRS, CiTCoM, F-75006, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Ju Youn", "Last Name": "Kim", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Lily Q", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gullen", "Last Name": "Lacin", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Kaitao", "Last Name": "Zhao", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ronak", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eric", "Last Name": "Duplus", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Philippe", "Last Name": "Tixador", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Andrew A", "Last Name": "Sproul", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Bernard", "Last Name": "Brugg", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Reboud-Ravaux", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Carol M", "Last Name": "Troy", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Serge", "Last Name": "Bouaziz", "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 de Paris, CNRS, CiTCoM, F-75006, Paris, France."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Karin", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Departments of Pharmacology and Pathology, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA."}, {"First Name": "Chahrazade", "Last Name": "El Amri", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France."}, {"First Name": "Etienne D", "Last Name": "Jacotot", "Affiliation": "INSERM U1164, CNRS UMR 8256, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, F-75005, France. etienne.jacotot@inserm.fr."}], "Journal": "Cell death & disease", "PubDate": "2022Nov15"}, {"PMID": "33980608", "Title": "Rapid ATF4 Depletion Resets Synaptic Responsiveness after cLTP.", "Abstract": "Activating transcription factor 4 [ATF4 (also called CREB2)], in addition to its well studied role in stress responses, is proposed to play important physiologic functions in regulating learning and memory. However, the nature of these functions has not been well defined and is subject to apparently disparate views. Here, we provide evidence that ATF4 is a regulator of excitability during synaptic plasticity. We evaluated the role of ATF4 in mature hippocampal cultures subjected to a brief chemically induced LTP (cLTP) protocol that results in changes in mEPSC properties and synaptic AMPA receptor density 1 h later, with return to baseline by 24 h. We find that ATF4 protein, but not its mRNA, is rapidly depleted by \u223c50% in response to cLTP induction via NMDA receptor activation. Depletion is detectable in dendrites within 15\u2009min and in cell bodies by 1 h, and returns to baseline by 8 h. Such changes correlate with a parallel depletion of phospho-eIF2a, suggesting that ATF4 loss is driven by decreased translation. To probe the physiologic role of cLTP-induced ATF4 depletion, we constitutively overexpressed the protein. Reversing ATF4 depletion by overexpression blocked the recovery of synaptic activity and AMPA receptor density to baseline values that would otherwise occur 24 h after cLTP induction. This reversal was not reproduced by a transcriptionally inactive ATF4 mutant.

We previously reported that specific hippocampal ATF4 downregulation causes deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory and reduction of glutamatergic functionality. Here we extend our studies to address ATF4's role in neuronal excitability. We find that long-term ATF4 knockdown in cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly increases the frequency of spontaneous action potentials. This effect is associated with decreased functionality of metabotropic GABAB receptors (GABABRs). Knocking down ATF4 results in significant reduction of GABABR-induced GIRK currents and increased mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, reducing ATF4 significantly decreases expression of membrane-exposed, but not total, GABABR 1a and 1b subunits, indicating that ATF4 regulates GABABR trafficking. In contrast, ATF4 knockdown has no effect on surface expression of GABABR2s, several GABABR-coupled ion channels or \u03b22 and \u03b32 GABAARs. Pharmacologic manipulations confirmed the relationship between GABABR functionality and action potential frequency in our cultures. Specifically, the effects of ATF4 downregulation cited above are fully rescued by transcriptionally active, but not by transcriptionally inactive, shRNA-resistant, ATF4. We previously reported that ATF4 promotes stabilization of the actin-regulatory protein Cdc42 by a transcription-dependent mechanism. To test the hypothesis that this action underlies the mechanism by which ATF4 loss affects neuronal firing rates and GABABR trafficking, we downregulated Cdc42 and found that this phenocopies the effects of ATF4 knockdown on these properties. In conclusion, our data favor a model in which ATF4, by regulating Cdc42 expression, affects trafficking of GABABRs, which in turn modulates the excitability properties of neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT GABAB receptors (GABABRs), the metabotropic receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, have crucial roles in controlling the firing rate of neurons. Deficits in trafficking/functionality of GABABRs have been linked to a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, addiction, and pain. Here we show that GABABRs trafficking is influenced by Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), a protein that has a pivotal role in hippocampal memory processes. We found that ATF4 downregulation in hippocampal neurons reduces membrane-bound GABABR levels and thereby increases intrinsic excitability. These effects are mediated by loss of the small GTPase Cdc42 following ATF4 downregulation. These findings reveal a critical role for ATF4 in regulating the modulation of neuronal excitability by GABABRs.", "Keywords": ["ATF4", "Cdc42", "GABAB receptors", "GIRK channels", "neuronal excitability"], "MeSH terms": ["Activating Transcription Factor 4", "Animals", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Neurons", "Protein Transport", "Rats", "Receptors, GABA-B", "cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Carlo", "Last Name": "Corona", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Pasini", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Jin", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Fatou", "Last Name": "Amar", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Lloyd A", "Last Name": "Greene", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033."}, {"First Name": "Michael L", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology & Cell Biology and the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10033 mls7@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Jul04"}, {"PMID": "29599707", "Title": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Elevates Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) in Neurons and Promotes ATF4-Dependent Induction of Sesn2.", "Abstract": "Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) plays important physiologic roles in the brain including regulation of learning and memory as well as neuronal survival and death. Yet, outside of translational regulation by the eIF2\u03b1-dependent stress response pathway, there is little information about how its levels are controlled in neurons. Here, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes a rapid and sustained increase in neuronal ATF4 transcripts and protein levels. This increase is dependent on tropomyosin receptor kinase (TrkB) signaling, but independent of levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. The elevation in ATF4 protein occurs both in nuclei and processes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ATF4 mediates BDNF-promoted induction of Sesn2 which encodes Sestrin2, a protector against oxidative and genotoxic stresses and a mTor complex 1 inhibitor. In contrast, BDNF-elevated ATF4 did not affect expression of a number of other known ATF4 targets including several with pro-apoptotic activity.

Analysis of gene expression profiles from laser-captured neurons from AD and controls subjects, using the Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe), yielded an interactome consisting of 488,353 transcription-factor/target interactions. Interrogation of this interactome, using the Master Regulator INference algorithm (MARINa), identified an unbiased set of candidate MRs causally responsible for regulating the transcriptional signature of AD progression. Experimental assays in autopsy-derived human brain tissue showed that three of the top candidate MRs (YY1, p300 and ZMYM3) are indeed biochemically and histopathologically dysregulated in AD brains compared to controls.

Here, we determined that the highly conserved brain miRNA miR-219 is downregulated in brain tissue taken at autopsy from patients with AD and from those with severe primary age-related tauopathy. In a Drosophila model that produces human tau, reduction of miR-219 exacerbated tau toxicity, while overexpression of miR-219 partially abrogated toxic effects. Moreover, we observed a bidirectional modulation of tau levels in the Drosophila model that was dependent on miR-219 expression or neutralization, demonstrating that miR-219 regulates tau in vivo. In mammalian cellular models, we found that miR-219 binds directly to the 3'-UTR of the tau mRNA and represses tau synthesis at the post-transcriptional level.

Treatment of neurons with 5, 6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribobenzimidazole (DRB), an RNA Pol II-dependent transcription elongation inhibitor, and flavopiridol inhibited phosphorylation and activation of Pol II and protected neurons from undergoing apoptosis. In addition to Pol II, neurons subjected to KCl withdrawal showed increased phosphorylation and activation of p70 S6 kinase, which was inhibited by both DRB and flavopiridol. Immunostaining analysis of the neurons deprived of KCl showed increased nuclear levels of phospho-p70 S6 kinase, and neurons protected with DRB and flavopiridol showed accumulation of the kinase into large spliceosome assembly factor-positive speckle domains within the nuclei. The formation of these foci corresponded with cell survival, and removal of the inhibitors resulted in dispersal of the speckles into smaller foci with subsequent apoptosis induction.

Many autopsy studies have reported brains with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are indistinguishable from those of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in the absence of amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques. For these \"NFT+/A\u03b2-\" brains, for which formal criteria for AD neuropathologic changes are not met, the NFTs are mostly restricted to structures in the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, brainstem, and olfactory areas (bulb and cortex). Symptoms in persons with PART usually range from normal to amnestic cognitive changes, with only a minority exhibiting profound impairment. Because cognitive impairment is often mild, existing clinicopathologic designations, such as \"tangle-only dementia\" and \"tangle-predominant senile dementia\", are imprecise and not appropriate for most subjects. PART is almost universally detectable at autopsy among elderly individuals, yet this pathological process cannot be specifically identified pre-mortem at the present time. Improved biomarkers and tau imaging may enable diagnosis of PART in clinical settings in the future. Indeed, recent studies have identified a common biomarker profile consisting of temporal lobe atrophy and tauopathy without evidence of A\u03b2 accumulation.

However, the potential cellular bases for these and other actions of ATF4 in brain are not well-defined.

ATF4 knockdown also decreases the density of mushroom spines and increases formation of abnormally-long dendritic filopodia in such cultures. In vivo knockdown of ATF4 in adult mouse hippocampal neurons also reduces mushroom spine density. In contrast, ATF4 over-expression does not affect the densities of PSD-95 puncta or mushrooom spines. Regulation of synaptic puncta and spine densities by ATF4 requires its transcriptional activity and is mediated at least in part by indirectly controlling the stability and expression of the total and active forms of the actin regulatory protein Cdc42. In support of such a mechanism, ATF4 silencing decreases the half-life of Cdc42 in cultured cortical neurons from 31.5 to 18.5 h while knockdown of Cdc42, like ATF4 knockdown, reduces the densities of mushroom spines and PSD-95 puncta.

Here we show that caspase-2 is required for the cognitive decline seen in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (J20). The age-related changes in behaviour and dendritic spine density observed in these mice are absent when they lack caspase-2, in spite of similar levels of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition and inflammation. A similar degree of protection is observed in cultured hippocampal neurons lacking caspase-2, which are immune to the synaptotoxic effects of A\u03b2. Our studies suggest that caspase-2 is a critical mediator in the activation of the RhoA/ROCK-II signalling pathway, leading to the collapse of dendritic spines. We propose that this is controlled by an inactive caspase-2/RhoA/ROCK-II complex localized in dendrites, which dissociates in the presence of A\u03b2, allowing for their activation and entry in the spine. These findings directly implicate caspase-2 as key driver of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and offer novel therapeutic targets.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Animals", "Astrocytes", "Behavior, Animal", "Blotting, Western", "Caspase 2", "Cells, Cultured", "Dendritic Spines", "Down-Regulation", "Enzyme Activation", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Immunoprecipitation", "Memory Disorders", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Protein Transport", "Rats", "Synapses", "rho-Associated Kinases", "rhoA GTP-Binding Protein"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Julio", "Last Name": "Pozueta", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain v, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Roger", "Last Name": "Lefort", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Elena M", "Last Name": "Ribe", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Carol M", "Last Name": "Troy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ottavio", "Last Name": "Arancio", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Shelanski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature communications", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23599427", "Title": "\u03b2-Amyloid (A\u03b2) oligomers impair brain-derived neurotrophic factor retrograde trafficking by down-regulating ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, UCH-L1.", "Abstract": "We previously found that BDNF-dependent retrograde trafficking is impaired in AD transgenic mouse neurons. Utilizing a novel microfluidic culture chamber, we demonstrate that A\u03b2 oligomers compromise BDNF-mediated retrograde transport by impairing endosomal vesicle velocities, resulting in impaired downstream signaling driven by BDNF/TrkB, including ERK5 activation, and CREB-dependent gene regulation. Our data suggest that a key mechanism mediating the deficit involves ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme that functions to regulate cellular ubiquitin. A\u03b2-induced deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling are mimicked by LDN (an inhibitor of UCH-L1) and can be reversed by increasing cellular UCH-L1 levels, demonstrated here using a transducible TAT-UCH-L1 strategy. Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, A\u03b2 may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "BDNF", "Microfluidic Device", "Trafficking", "Ubiquitin"], "MeSH terms": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor", "Cell Survival", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Protein Transport", "Rats", "Receptor, trkB", "Signal Transduction", "Ubiquitin", "Ubiquitin Thiolesterase"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Wayne W", "Last Name": "Poon", "Affiliation": "Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, University of California, Irvine, California 92697.
