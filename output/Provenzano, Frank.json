Furthermore, non-contrast MRI scans are more commonly performed than those with contrast agents and are readily available for analysis in public databases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In this article, we hypothesize that a deep learning model, trained using quantitative steady-state contrast-enhanced structural MRI datasets, in mice and humans, can generate contrast-equivalent information from a single non-contrast MRI scan. The model was first trained, optimized, and validated in mice, and was then transferred and adapted to humans. We observe that the model can substitute for Gadolinium-based contrast agents in approximating cerebral blood volume, a quantitative representation of brain activity, at sub-millimeter granularity. Furthermore, we validate the use of our deep-learned prediction maps to identify functional abnormalities in the aging brain using locally obtained MRI scans, and in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease using publicly available MRI scans from ADNI. Since it is derived from a commonly-acquired MRI protocol, this framework has the potential for broad clinical utility and can also be applied retrospectively to research scans across a host of neurological/functional diseases.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "CBV", "MRI", "aging", "deep-learning", "gadolinium"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Chen", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Nanyan", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Haoran", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Junhao", "Last Name": "Zhang", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xinyang", "Last Name": "Feng", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Sabrina", "Last Name": "Gjerswold-Selleck", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Dipika", "Last Name": "Sikka", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xuemin", "Last Name": "Zhu", "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Xueqing", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Tal", "Last Name": "Nuriel", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Hong-Jian", "Last Name": "Wei", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Cheng-Chia", "Last Name": "Wu", "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "J Thomas", "Last Name": "Vaughan", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Andrew F", "Last Name": "Laine", "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Frank A", "Last Name": "Provenzano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Jia", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in aging neuroscience", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35351193", "Title": "A deep learning MRI approach outperforms other biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "The three core pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration.

Secondary outcomes included a hippocampal-dependent list-learning task and a prefrontal cortex-dependent list-sorting task. The alternative Healthy Eating Index and a biomarker of flavanol intake (gVLM) were measured. In an MRI substudy, hippocampal cerebral blood volume was mapped. Object-recognition and list-sorting performance did not correlate with baseline diet quality and did not improve after flavanol intake. However, the hippocampal-dependent list-learning performance was directly associated with baseline diet quality and improved after flavanol intake, particularly in participants in the bottom tertile of baseline diet quality. In the imaging substudy, a region-of-interest analysis was negative but a voxel-based-analysis suggested that dietary flavanols target the dentate gyrus.

Many MRIs have fortuitously adequate sequences required for CBV mapping. However, these scans vary substantially in acquisition parameters. Here, we determined whether previously acquired contrast-enhanced MRI scans ordered in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy can be used to generate hippocampal CBV. We used intrinsic reference regions to correct for intensity scaling on a research CBV dataset to identify white matter as a robust marker for scaling correction. Next, we tested the technique on a sample of unilateral focal epilepsy patients using clinical MRI scans. We find evidence suggestive of significant hypometabolism in the ipsilateral-hippocampus of unilateral TLE subjects. We also highlight the subiculum as a potential driver of this effect.

Strikingly, mice deficient in the glutamate synthetic enzyme glutaminase have CA1 hypoactivity and a SCZ-resilience profile, implicating glutamate-metabolizing enzymes. To address this further, we examined mice with a brain-wide deficit in the glutamate-metabolizing enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), encoded by Glud1, which should lead to glutamate excess due to reduced glutamate metabolism in astrocytes. We found that Glud1-deficient mice have behavioral abnormalities in the 3 SCZ symptom domains, with increased baseline and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion as a positive symptom proxy, nest building and social preference as a negative symptom proxy, and reversal/extradimensional set shifting in the water T-maze and contextual fear conditioning as a cognitive symptom proxy. Neuroimaging of cerebral blood volume revealed hippocampal hyperactivity in CA1, which was associated with volume reduction. Parameters of hippocampal synaptic function revealed excess glutamate release and an elevated excitatory/inhibitory balance in CA1. Finally, in a direct clinical correlation using imaging-guided microarray, we found a significant SCZ-associated postmortem reduction in GLUD1 expression in CA1. These findings advance GLUD1 deficiency as a driver of excess hippocampal excitatory transmission and SCZ symptoms, and identify GDH as a target for glutamate modulation pharmacotherapy for SCZ. More broadly, these findings point to the likely involvement of alterations in glutamate metabolism in the pathophysiology of SCZ.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "CA1 Region, Hippocampal", "Cerebral Blood Volume", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Glutamate Dehydrogenase", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptors, Glutamate", "Schizophrenia"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Sharon S", "Last Name": "Lander", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology or Neurobiology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Usman", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology or Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Lewandowski", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology or Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Darpan", "Last Name": "Chakraborty", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology or Neurobiology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Frank A", "Last Name": "Provenzano", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology or Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Susana", "Last Name": "Mingote", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology or Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Sergiy", "Last Name": "Chornyy", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology or Neurobiology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Francesca", "Last Name": "Frigerio", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Physiology and Metabolism, Geneva University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerl."}, {"First Name": "Pierre", "Last Name": "Maechler", "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Physiology and Metabolism, Geneva University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerl."}, {"First Name": "Hanoch", "Last Name": "Kaphzan", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology or Neurobiology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel."}, {"First Name": "Scott A", "Last Name": "Small", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology or Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Stephen", "Last Name": "Rayport", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology or Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY."}, {"First Name": "Inna", "Last Name": "Gaisler-Salomon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology or Neurobiology, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel."}], "Journal": "Schizophrenia bulletin", "PubDate": "2019Jan01"}, {"PMID": "25616474", "Title": "Topography of brain glucose hypometabolism and epileptic network in glucose transporter 1 deficiency.", "Abstract": "(18)F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F FDG-PET) facilitates examination of glucose metabolism.

In the present study, we sought to determine whether the longitudinal regional progression of WMH predicts incident AD above-and-beyond traditional radiological markers of neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal atrophy and cortical thickness). Three hundred three nondemented older adults (mean age = 79.24 \u00b1 5.29) received high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and then again 4.6 years (standard deviation = 1.01) later.

Using structural equation modeling, we calculated latent difference scores of parietal and nonparietal WMH, hippocampus volumes, and cortical thickness values in AD-related regions. Within the structural equation modeling framework, we determined whether baseline or change scores or both predicted AD conversion, while controlling for several time-invariant relevant variables. Smaller baseline hippocampus volume, change in hippocampus volume (i.e., atrophy), higher baseline parietal lobe WMH, and increasing parietal lobe WMH volume but not WMH in other regions or measures of cortical thickness, independently predicted progression to AD.

We used a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) variant that can map metabolic defects in patients and mouse models to address basic questions about entorhinal cortex pathophysiology. The entorhinal cortex is divided into functionally distinct regions, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and we exploited the high-resolution capabilities of the fMRI variant to ask whether either of them was affected in patients with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Next, we imaged three mouse models of disease to clarify how tau and APP relate to entorhinal cortex dysfunction and to determine whether the entorhinal cortex can act as a source of dysfunction observed in other cortical areas. We found that the LEC was affected in preclinical disease, that LEC dysfunction could spread to the parietal cortex during preclinical disease and that APP expression potentiated tau toxicity in driving LEC dysfunction, thereby helping to explain regional vulnerability in the disease.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Analysis of Variance", "Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition Disorders", "Cortical Spreading Depression", "Disease Progression", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Oxygen", "tau Proteins"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Usman A", "Last Name": "Khan", "Affiliation": "1] Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between a decline in gait speed and total and regional WMH volumes in a community-based study of aging. Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0701) underwent gait-speed measurement via a 4-m walk test at the time of initial enrollment and MRI at a second time interval (mean 4.7 [SD\u00a0=\u00a00.5] years apart). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between large WMH volume and regional WMH volume with gait speed <0.5\u00a0m/s (abnormal speed), and a transition to abnormal gait speed. Analyses were adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. Large WMH volume was associated with abnormal gait speed and a transition to abnormal gait speed between the two visits, but not after adjustment for modifiable vascular disease risk factors. Increased frontal lobe WMH volume was associated with abnormal gait speed and transition to abnormal gait speed, but not in adjusted models. WMH are associated with slowing of gait over time.
