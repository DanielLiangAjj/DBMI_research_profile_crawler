[{"PMID": "38909430", "Title": "The relationship between cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensities in mid to late life.", "Abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with cortical thinning. Although they are primarily detected in older participants, these lesions can appear in younger and midlife individuals. Here, we tested whether WMH are associated with cortical thinning in relatively younger (26-50 years) and relatively older (58-84) participants who were free of dementia, and how these associations are moderated by WMH localization. WMH were automatically quantified and categorized according to the localization of three classes of white matter tracts: association, commissural and projection fibers. Mediation analyses were used to infer whether differences in cortical thickness between younger and older participants were explained by WMH. Our results revealed that total WMH explained between 20.6\u202f% and 65.5\u202f% of the effect of age on cortical thickness in AD-signature regions including the lateral temporal lobes and supramarginal gyrus, among others. This mediation was slightly stronger for projection WMH, although it was still significant for association and commissural WMH. These results suggest that there is an interplay between vascular and AD causes of cognitive impairment that starts at younger ages.", "Keywords": ["Cerebrovascular disease", "Cognitive impairment", "Cortical thickness", "Neuroimaging", "White matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Balado", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA; Neurovascular Research Group, IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute,\u00a0Carrer del Dr. Aiguader, 88,\u00a0Barcelona 08003,\u00a0Spain."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0USA."}, {"First Name": "Teal", "Last Name": "Eich", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA; Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University,\u00a0New York,\u00a0NY,\u00a0USA.

Observed age-related correlation increases among disparate cognitive tasks have supported the dedifferentiation hypothesis. We previously showed cross-sectional evidence for age-related correlation decreases instead, supporting an alternative disintegration hypothesis. In the current study, we extended our previous research to a longitudinal sample. We tested 135 participants (20-80 years) at two time points-baseline and 5-year follow-up-on a battery of 12 in-scanner tests, each tapping one of four reference abilities. We performed between-tasks correlations within domain (convergent) and between domain (discriminant) at both the behavioral and neural level, calculating a single measure of construct validity (convergent - discriminant). Cross-sectionally, behavioral construct validity was significantly different from chance at each time point, but longitudinal change was not significant. Analysis by median age split revealed that older adults showed higher behavioral validity, driven by higher discriminant validity (lower between-tasks correlations). Participant-level neural validity decreased over time, with convergent validity consistently greater than discriminant validity; this finding was also observed at the cross-sectional level. In addition, a disproportionate decrease in neural validity with age remained significant after controlling for demographic factors. Factors predicting longitudinal changes in global cognition (mean performance across all 12 tasks) included age, change in neural validity, education, and National Adult Reading Test (premorbid intelligence). Change in neural validity partially mediated the effect of age on change in global cognition. Our findings support the theory of age-related disintegration, linking cognitive decline to changes in neural representations over time.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Georgette", "Last Name": "Argiris", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "PubDate": "2024May10"}, {"PMID": "38630959", "Title": "Trajectories of Occupational Cognitive Demands and Risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in Later Life: The HUNT4 70+ Study.", "Abstract": "The cognitive reserve hypothesis posits that cognitively stimulating work delays the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.

We assessed whether OrT slope represents a neural mechanism underlying CR by associating it with task performance and NART-IQ. Additionally, we investigated how the following brain reserve measures affect the association between NART-IQ and OrT slope: mean cortical thickness, total gray matter volume, and brain volumes proximal to the areas contained in the OrT patterns. We found that higher OrT slope was associated with better task performance and higher NART-IQ. Further, the brain reserve measures were not directly associated with OrT slope, but they affected the relationship between NART-IQ and OrT slope: NART-IQ was associated with OrT slope only in individuals with high brain reserve.

Polygenic scores that summarize these discoveries explain up to 10% of the variance in cognitive test performance in samples of adults. However, the role these genetics play in cognitive aging is not well understood. We analyzed data from 168 cognitively healthy participants aged 23-77 years old, with data on genetics, neuropsychological assessment, and brain-imaging measurements from two large ongoing studies, the Reference Abilities Neural Networks, and the Cognitive Reserve study. We tested whether a polygenic index previously related to cognition (Cog PGI) would moderate the relationship between age and measurements of the cognitive domains extracted from a neuropsychological evaluation: fluid reasoning, memory, vocabulary, and speed of processing. We further explored the relationship of Cog PGI and age on cognition using Johnson-Neyman intervals for two-way interactions. Sex, education, and brain measures of cortical thickness, total gray matter volume, and white matter hyperintensity were considered covariates. The analysis controlled for population structure-ancestry. There was a significant interaction effect of Cog PGI on the association between age and the domains of memory (Standardized coefficient = -0.158, p-value = 0.022), fluid reasoning (Standardized coefficient = -0.146, p-value = 0.020), and vocabulary (Standardized coefficient = -0.191, p-value = 0.001). Higher PGI strengthened the negative relationship between age and the domains of memory and fluid reasoning while PGI weakened the positive relationship between age and vocabulary. Based on the Johnson-Neyman intervals, Cog PGI was significantly associated with domains of memory, reasoning, and vocabulary for younger adults. There is a significant moderation effect of genetic predisposition for cognition for the association between age and cognitive performance.

Yet, prior studies have suggested that A\u03b2 deposition can be associated with both cortical thinning and thickening. These contradictory results are attributed to small sample sizes, the presence versus absence of tau, and limited detectability in the earliest phase of protein deposition, which may begin in young adulthood and cannot be captured in studies enrolling only older subjects. In this study, we aimed to find the distinct and joint effects of A\u03b2 andtau on neurodegeneration during the progression from normal to abnormal stages of pathologies that remain elusive. We used18F-MK6240 and 18F-Florbetaben/18F-Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify tau, A\u03b2, and cortical thickness in 590 participants ranging in age from 20 to 90. We performed multiple regression analyses to assess the distinct and joint effects of A\u03b2 and tau on cortical thickness using 590 healthy control (HC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants (141 young, 394 HC elderlies, 52 MCI). We showed thatin participants with normal levels of global A\u03b2deposition, A\u03b2 uptakewassignificantly associated with increasedcortical thickness regardless of tau (e.g., left entorhinal cortex with t\u00a0>\u00a03.241, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0013). The relationship between tau deposition and neurodegeneration was more complex: in participants with abnormal levels of global tau, tau uptake was associated with cortical thinning in several regions of the brain (e.g., left entorhinal with t\u00a0<\u00a0-2.80, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0096 and left insula with t-value\u00a0<\u00a0-4.284, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), as reported on prior neuroimaging and neuropathological studies. Surprisingly, in participants with normal levels of global tau, tau was found to be associated with cortical thickening. Moreover, in participants with abnormal levels of global A\u03b2andtau, theresonancebetween them, defined as their correlation throughout the cortex, wasassociated strongly with cortical thinning even when controlling for a direct linear effect. We confirm prior findings of an association between A\u03b2 deposition and cortical thickening and suggest this may also be the case in the earliest stages of deposition in normal aging.

This conference, summarized in this report, explored commonalities and differences among the frameworks of resilience most commonly used in aging research in the three domains of resilience: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. These three main domains are intertwined, and stressors in one domain can lead to effects in other domains. The themes of the conference sessions included underlying contributors to resilience, the dynamic nature of resilience throughout the life span, and the role of resilience in health equity. Although participants did not agree on a single definition of \"resilience(s),\" they identified common core elements of a definition that can be applied to all domains and noted unique features that are domain specific. The presentations and discussions led to recommendations for new longitudinal studies of the impact of exposures to stressors on resilience in older adults, the use of new and existing cohort study data, natural experiments (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and preclinical models for resilience research, as well as translational research to bring findings on resilience to patient care.", "Keywords": ["cognitive", "physical", "psychosocial", "resilience", "stressors"], "MeSH terms": ["Humans", "United States", "Aged", "Aging", "National Institute on Aging (U.S.)", "Cohort Studies", "Pandemics", "COVID-19", "Geriatrics"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter M", "Last Name": "Abadir", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Karen", "Last Name": "Bandeen-Roche", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Cindy", "Last Name": "Bergeman", "Affiliation": "University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Bennett", "Affiliation": "Rush University, Chicago, Illinois, USA."}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Davis", "Affiliation": "University College London, London, UK."}, {"First Name": "Amy", "Last Name": "Kind", "Affiliation": "Center for Health Disparities Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nathan", "Last Name": "LeBrasseur", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Columbia University, New York City, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ravi", "Last Name": "Varadhan", "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."}, {"First Name": "Heather E", "Last Name": "Whitson", "Affiliation": "Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA."}], "Journal": "Journal of the American Geriatrics Society", "PubDate": "2023Aug"}, {"PMID": "37071977", "Title": "A novel causal mediation analysis approach for zero-inflated mediators.", "Abstract": "Mediation analyses play important roles in making causal inference in biomedical research to examine causal pathways that may be mediated by one or more intermediate variables (ie, mediators).

In this article, we apply a novel method, persistent homology (PH), to develop an alternative to standard functional connectivity by quantifying the pattern of information during the integrated processing. We also investigate whether PH-based functional connectivity explains cognitive performance and compare the amount of variability in explaining cognitive performance for three sets of independent variables: (1) PH-based functional connectivity, (2) graph theory-based measures, and (3) BSS. Resting-state functional connectivity data were extracted from 279 healthy participants, and cognitive ability scores were generated in four domains (fluid reasoning, episodic memory, vocabulary, and processing speed). The results first highlight the pattern of brain-information flow over whole brain regions (i.e., integrated processing) accounts for more variance of cognitive abilities than other methods. The results also show that fluid reasoning and vocabulary performance significantly decrease as the strength of the additional information flow on functional connectivity with the shortest path increases.

Functional neuroimaging may enable direct and accurate measurement of cognitive reserve which could have considerable clinical potential. The present study aimed to develop and validate a measure of cognitive reserve using task-based fMRI data that could then be applied to independent resting-state data. Connectome-based predictive modelling with leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to predict a residual measure of cognitive reserve using task-based functional connectivity from the Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network studies (n\u2009=\u2009220, mean age\u2009=\u200951.91\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u200917.04\u2009years). This model generated summary measures of connectivity strength that accurately predicted a residual measure of cognitive reserve in unseen participants. The theoretical validity of these measures was established via a positive correlation with a socio-behavioural proxy of cognitive reserve (verbal intelligence) and a positive correlation with global cognition, independent of brain structure. This fitted model was then applied to external test data: resting-state functional connectivity data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA, n\u2009=\u2009294, mean age\u2009=\u200968.3\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20097.18\u2009years).

Participants were scanned using fMRI while presented with the Letter Sternberg task, a verbal working memory task consisting of encoding, maintenance and retrieval phases, where cognitive load is manipulated by varying the number of presented items (i.e., between one and six letters). Via correlation analysis, we looked at region-level and whole-brain relationships between load levels within each phase and then computed a global task measure, what we term phase specificity, to analyze how similar neural responses were across load levels within each phase compared to between each phase. We found that longitudinal change in phase specificity was positively related to longitudinal change in cortical thickness, at both the whole-brain and regional level. Additionally, baseline NART IQ was positively related to longitudinal change in phase specificity over time. Furthermore, we found a longitudinal effect of sex on change in phase specificity, such that females displayed higher phase specificity over time. Cross-sectional findings aligned with longitudinal findings, with the notable exception of behavioral performance being positively linked to phase specificity cross-sectionally at baseline.

In this study, we examine midlife marital status trajectories and their association with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at ages 70 plus using a large population based sample from Norway. Methods: Based on a general population sample linked to population registries (N = 8706), we used multinomial logistic regression to examine the associations between six types of marital trajectories (unmarried, continuously divorced, intermittently divorced, widowed, continuously married, intermittently married) between age 44 and 68\u00a0years from national registries and a clinical dementia or a MCI diagnosis after age 70. We estimated relative risk ratios (RRR) and used mediation analyses adjusting for education, number of children, smoking, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, mental distress, and having no close friends in midlife. Inverse probability weighting and multiple imputations were applied. The population attributable fraction was estimated to assess the potential reduction in dementia cases due to marital histories. Results: Overall, 11.6% of the participants were diagnosed with dementia and 35.3% with MCI. Dementia prevalence was lowest among the continuously married (11.2%). Adjusting for confounders, the risk of dementia was higher for the unmarried (RRR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.40), continuously divorced (RRR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.43), and intermittently divorced (RRR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.06) compared to the continuously married. In general, marital trajectory was less associated with MCI than with dementia. In the counterfactual scenario, where all participants had the same risk of receiving a dementia diagnosis as the continuously married group, there would be 6.0% fewer dementia cases.

constituted by any mechanism contributing to cognitive performance beyond, or interacting with, brain structure in the widest sense. To identity multivariate activation patterns fulfilling this postulate, we investigated a verbal Sternberg fMRI task and imaged 181 people with age coverage in the ranges 20-30 (44 participants) and 55-70 (137 participants). Beyond task performance, participants were characterized in terms of demographics, and neuropsychological assessments of vocabulary, episodic memory, perceptual speed, and abstract fluid reasoning. Participants studied an array of either one, three, or six upper-case letters for 3\u2009s (=encoding phase), then a blank fixation screen was presented for 7\u2009s (=maintenance phase), to be probed with a lower-case letter to which they responded with a differential button press whether the letter was part of the studied array or not (=retrieval phase). We focused on identifying maintenance-related activation patterns showing memory load increases in pattern score on an individual participant level for both age groups. We found such a pattern that increased with memory load for all but one person in the young participants (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and such a pattern for all participants in the older group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Both patterns showed broad topographic similarities; however, relationships to task performance and neuropsychological characteristics were markedly different and point to individual differences in Cognitive Reserve. Beyond the derivation of group-level activation patterns, we also investigated the inter-subject spatial similarity of individual working memory rehearsal patterns in the older participants' group as a function of neuropsychological and task performance, education, and mean cortical thickness. Higher task accuracy and neuropsychological function was reliably associated with higher inter-subject similarity of individual-level activation patterns in older participants.", "Keywords": ["cognitive reserve", "fMRI", "inter-subject similarity", "multivariate analysis", "verbal working memory"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yunglin", "Last Name": "Gazes", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States."}], "Journal": "Frontiers in psychology", "PubDate": "2022"}, {"PMID": "35679806", "Title": "Amyloid, cerebrovascular disease, and neurodegeneration biomarkers are associated with cognitive trajectories in a racially and ethnically diverse, community-based sample.", "Abstract": "We characterized the additive contribution of cerebrovascular biomarkers to amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarkers (AV(N)) when modeling prospective, longitudinal cognitive trajectories within 3 major racial/ethnic groups.

We developed a deep learning model to quantify the CR as residual variance in memory performance using the Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data from a lifespan healthy cohort. The generalizability of the sMRI-based deep learning model was tested in two independent healthy and Alzheimer's cohorts using transfer learning framework. Structural MRIs were collected from three cohorts: 495 healthy adults (age: 20-80) from RANN, 620 healthy adults (age: 36-100) from lifespan Human Connectome Project Aging (HCPA), and 941 adults (age: 55-92) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Region of interest (ROI)-specific cortical thickness and volume measures were extracted using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas. CR was quantified by residuals which subtract the predicted memory from the true memory. Cascade neural network (CNN) models were used to train RANN dataset for memory prediction. Transfer learning was applied to transfer the T1 imaging-based model from source domain (RANN) to the target domains (HCPA or ADNI). The CNN model trained on the RANN dataset exhibited strong linear correlation between true and predicted memory based on the T1 cortical thickness and volume predictors. In addition, the model generated from healthy lifespan data (RANN) was able to generalize to an independent healthy lifespan data (HCPA) and older demented participants (ADNI) across different scanner types. The estimated CR was correlated with CR proxies such education and IQ across all three datasets. The current findings suggest that the transfer learning approach is an effective way to generalize the residual-based CR estimation.

To determine whether a phase III trial comparing home aerobic to balance training in ambulatory patients with cerebellar ataxia is warranted, we conducted a single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Nineteen subjects were randomized to aerobic training and 17 subjects to balance training. The primary outcome was improvement in ataxia as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Secondary outcomes included safety, training adherence, and balance improvements. There were no differences between groups at baseline. Thirty-one participants completed the trial, and there were no training-related serious adverse events. Compliance to training was over 70%. There was a mean improvement in ataxia symptoms of 1.9 SARA points (SD 1.62) in the aerobic group compared to an improvement of 0.6 points (SD 1.34) in the balance group. Although two measures of balance were equivocal between groups, one measure of balance showed greater improvement with balance training compared to aerobic training. In conclusion, this 6-month trial comparing home aerobic versus balance training in cerebellar ataxia had excellent retention and adherence to training.

Here, we parcellated WMH using a novel system that segments WMH based on both lobar regions and distance from the ventricles, dividing the brain into a coordinate system composed of 36 distinct parcels ('bullseye' parcellation), and then investigated the effect of distribution on cognition using two different analytic approaches. Data from a well characterized sample of healthy older adults (58 to 84\u00a0years) who were free of dementia were included. Cognition was evaluated using 12 computerized tasks, factored onto 4 indices representing episodic memory, speed of processing, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We first assessed the distribution of WMH according to the bullseye parcellation and tested the relationship between WMH parcellations and performance across the four cognitive domains. Then, we used a data-driven approach to derive latent variables within the WMH distribution, and tested the relation between these latent components and cognitive function. We observed that different, well-defined cognitive constructs mapped to specific WMH distributions. Speed of processing was correlated with WMH in the frontal lobe, while in the case of episodic memory, the relationship was more ubiquitous, involving most of the parcellations. A principal components analysis revealed that the 36 bullseye regions factored onto 3 latent components representing the natural aggrupation of WMH: fronto-parietal periventricular (WMH principally in the frontal and parietal lobes and basal ganglia, especially in the periventricular region); occipital; and temporal and juxtacortical WMH (involving WMH in the temporal lobe, and at the juxtacortical region from frontal and parietal lobes). We found that fronto-parietal periventricular and temporal & juxtacortical WMH were independently associated with speed of processing and episodic memory, respectively. These results indicate that different cognitive impairment phenotypes might present with specific WMH distributions. Additionally, our study encourages future research to consider WMH classifications using parcellations systems other than periventricular and deep localizations.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain Mapping", "Cluster Analysis", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Humans", "Leukoencephalopathies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Principal Component Analysis", "Vocabulary", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Joan", "Last Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Balado", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Fabian", "Last Name": "Corlier", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Teal", "Last Name": "Eich", "Affiliation": "Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. teich@usc.edu."}], "Journal": "Scientific reports", "PubDate": "2022Feb04"}, {"PMID": "35099509", "Title": "Prevalence Estimates of Amyloid Abnormality Across the Alzheimer Disease Clinical Spectrum.", "Abstract": "One characteristic histopathological event in Alzheimer disease (AD) is cerebral amyloid aggregation, which can be detected by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and on positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Specific genes have been also associated with both sleep regulation and cognition. In a large group of older non-demented adults, we aimed to (a) validate the association between Sleep Polygenic Risk Score (Sleep PRS) and self-reported sleep duration, and (b) examine the association between Sleep PRS and cognitive changes in a three-year follow-up. Participants were drawn from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD). A structured, in-person interview, consisting of a medical history report and physical examination, was conducted for each participant during each of the visits (baseline and first follow-up). In total, 1376 participants were included, having all demographic, genetic, and cognitive data, out of which, 688 had at least one follow-up visit. In addition, an extensive neuropsychological assessment examining five cognitive domains (memory, visuo-spatial ability, attention/speed of processing, executive function, and language) was administered. A PRS for sleep duration was created based on previously published, genome-wide association study meta-analysis results. In order to assess the relationship between the Sleep PRS and the rate of cognitive change, we used generalized estimating equations analyses. Age, sex, education, ApolipoproteinE-\u03b54 genotype status, and specific principal components were used as covariates. On a further analysis, sleep medication was used as a further covariate. Results validated the association between Sleep PRS and self-reported sleep duration (B = 1.173, E-6, p = 0.001). Further, in the longitudinal analyses, significant associations were indicated between increased Sleep PRS and decreased visuo-spatial ability trajectories, in both the unadjusted (B = -1305.220, p = 0.018) and the adjusted for the covariates model (B = -1273.59, p = 0.031). Similarly, after adding sleep medication as a covariate (B = -1372.46, p = 0.019), none of the associations between Sleep PRS and the remaining cognitive domains were significant. PRS indicating longer sleep duration was associated with differential rates of cognitive decline over time in a group of non-demented older adults. Common genetic variants may influence the association between sleep duration and healthy aging/cognitive health.", "Keywords": ["cognition", "polygenic risk score", "sleep"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aging", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Risk Factors", "Sleep", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Tsapanou", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Cognitive Neuroscience Division, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Niki", "Last Name": "Mourtzi", "Affiliation": "1st Neurology Clinic, Department of Social Medicine, Psychiatry and Neurology, Eginition Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Sokratis", "Last Name": "Charisis", "Affiliation": "1st Neurology Clinic, Department of Social Medicine, Psychiatry and Neurology, Eginition Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Hatzimanolis", "Affiliation": "1st Neurology Clinic, Department of Social Medicine, Psychiatry and Neurology, Eginition Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Eva", "Last Name": "Ntanasi", "Affiliation": "1st Neurology Clinic, Department of Social Medicine, Psychiatry and Neurology, Eginition Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11528 Athens, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Mary H", "Last Name": "Kosmidis", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54124 Thessaloniki, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Mary", "Last Name": "Yannakoulia", "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Harokopio University, 17671 Athens, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Georgios", "Last Name": "Hadjigeorgiou", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of Thessaly, 41334 Larissa, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Efthimios", "Last Name": "Dardiotis", "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, University of Thessaly, 41334 Larissa, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Paraskevi", "Last Name": "Sakka", "Affiliation": "Athens Alzheimer's Association, 11636 Athens, Greece."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Cognitive Neuroscience Division, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nikolaos", "Last Name": "Scarmeas", "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54124 Thessaloniki, Greece."}], "Journal": "Genes", "PubDate": "2021Dec27"}, {"PMID": "35029675", "Title": "Association Between Mediterranean Diet and Functional Status in Older Adults: A Longitudinal Study Based on the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project.", "Abstract": "Current evidence on the association between Mediterranean diet (MeDi) intake and activities of daily living (ADL) is limited and inconsistent in older adults.", "Keywords": ["ADL", "Disability", "Epidemiology", "Mediterranean diet"], "MeSH terms": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Aging", "Diet, Mediterranean", "Disabled Persons", "Functional Status", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Washington"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Jing", "Last Name": "Guo", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Schupf", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Emily", "Last Name": "Cruz", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard P", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yian", "Last Name": "Gu", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}], "Journal": "The journals of gerontology.

We examined the white matter correlates of these constructs and hypothesized that the tracts connecting the temporal-frontal regions would be most strongly correlated with both FDM and financial awareness. Overall, 49 healthy older adults were included in the FDM analysis and 44 in the financial awareness analyses. The Objective Financial Competency Assessment Inventory was used to measure FDM. Financial awareness was measured by integrating metacognitive ratings into this inventory and was calculated as the degree of overconfidence or underconfidence. Diffusion tensor imaging data were processed with Tracts Constrained by Underlying Anatomy distributed as part of the FreeSurfer analytic suite, which produced average measures of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in 18 white matter tracts along with the overall tract average. As expected, FDM showed the strongest negative associations with average mean diffusivity measure of the superior longitudinal fasciculus -temporal (SLFT; r\u00a0=\u2009-.360, p\u00a0=\u2009.011) and -parietal (r\u00a0=\u2009-.351, p\u00a0=\u2009.014) tracts. After adjusting for FDM, only the association between financial awareness and average mean diffusivity measure of the right SLFT (r\u00a0=\u2009.310, p\u00a0=\u2009.046) was significant.

We summarize the study designs and identify three CR models that were broadly used in these studies, including a residual model assessing lifestyle factors in relation to unexplained variance in cognition after accounting for brain markers, a moderation model testing whether lifestyle factors moderate the relationship between brain status and cognition, and a controlling model examining the associations between lifestyle factors and cognition when controlling for brain measures. We also present the findings for the impact of each lifestyle factor. No studies examined diet, sleep, or meditation, and only two studies focused on smoking and alcohol consumption each.

Many studies assessing relationships between brain function and cognition have utilized time-averaged, or static functional connectivity methods to explore ways in which brain network organization may contribute to aspects of cognitive aging. However, recent studies in this field have suggested that time-varying, or dynamic measures of functional connectivity, which assess changes in functional connectivity over the course of a scan session, may play a stronger role in explaining cognitive outcomes in healthy young adults. Further, both static and dynamic functional connectivity studies suggest that there may be differences in patterns of brain-cognition relationships as a function of whether or not the participant is performing a task during the scan. Thus, the goals of the present study were threefold: (1) assess whether neural flexibility during both resting as well as task-based scans is related to participant age and cognitive performance in a lifespan aging sample, (2) determine whether neural flexibility moderates relationships between age and cognitive performance, and (3) explore differences in neural flexibility between rest and task. Participants in the study were 386 healthy adults between the ages of 20-80 who provided resting state and/or task-based (Matrix Reasoning) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan data as part of their participation in two ongoing studies of cognitive aging. Neural flexibility measures from both resting and task-based scans reflected the number of times each node changed network assignment, and were averaged both across the whole brain (global neural flexibility) as well as within ten somatosensory/cognitive networks. Results showed that neural flexibility was not related to participant age, and that task-based global neural flexibility, as well as task-based neural flexibility in several networks, tended to be negatively related to reaction times during the Matrix Reasoning task, however these effects did not survive strict multiple comparisons correction. Resting state neural flexibility was not significantly related to either participant age or cognitive performance. Additionally, no neural flexibility measures significantly moderated relationships between participant age and cognitive outcomes. Further, neural flexibility differed as a function of scan type, with resting state neural flexibility being significantly greater than task-based neural flexibility. Thus, neural flexibility measures computed during a cognitive task may be more meaningfully related to cognitive performance across the adult lifespan then resting state measures of neural flexibility.", "Keywords": ["Cognitive aging", "Dynamic connectivity", "Fluid Reasoning"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Cognitive Aging", "Female", "Humans", "Longevity", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Neural Pathways", "Rest", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eleanna", "Last Name": "Varangis", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Weiwei", "Last Name": "Qi", "Affiliation": "Mental Health Data Science, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 48, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Seonjoo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Mental Health Data Science, New York State Psychiatric Institute, 1051 Riverside Drive, Unit 48, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA; Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.

In the current study, we examined the cognitive and cortical thickness correlates of financial decision making and financial awareness in 59 community-dwelling participants co-enrolled in a larger study (mean age=68.35 years (SD=5.5), mean education=15.91 (SD=2.36), 61% = women, 67% = White, 30% = Black participants). Data from standardized measures of financial decision making and cognition was investigated along with FreeSurfer (v. 5.3) derived thickness regions. Based on metacognitive frameworks, financial awareness was measured along with a well-validated measure of memory awareness. Results revealed that numeracy, executive functioning and vocabulary were associated with financial decision making, whereas in analysis adjusted for financial decision making, memory awareness relative to cognition was most strongly linked to financial awareness. No significant associations between thickness and financial decision making were found. However, both financial and memory awareness were associated with the same right-hemisphere temporal thickness regions underscoring the idea of a common substrate of awareness. Interestingly, our findings converge with the emerging work on financial exploitation in which the right sided temporal regions have been found to play a prominent role. Incorporating the contributing role of self-awareness in various models of financial exploitation will be an important consideration for future studies.", "Keywords": ["cognition", "cortical thickness", "financial decision making", "medial temporal region", "self-awareness"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aging", "Cognition", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Temporal Lobe"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Preeti", "Last Name": "Sunderaraman", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. psun@bu.edu."}, {"First Name": "Seonjoo", "Last Name": "Lee", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eleanna", "Last Name": "Varangis", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Silvia", "Last Name": "Chapman", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jillian L", "Last Name": "Joyce", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Whitney", "Last Name": "Hartstone", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Stephanie", "Last Name": "Cosentino", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division of the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "Brain imaging and behavior", "PubDate": "2022Jun"}, {"PMID": "34719513", "Title": "Erratum to: Systolic Blood Pressure and Cognition in the Elderly: The Northern Manhattan Study.", "Abstract": "N/A", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Xiaoyan", "Last Name": "Sun", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Chuanhui", "Last Name": "Dong", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Bonnie E", "Last Name": "Levin", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michelle", "Last Name": "Caunca", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Adina", "Last Name": "Zeki Al Hazzouri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Janet T", "Last Name": "DeRosa", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ying Kuen", "Last Name": "Cheung", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mitchell S V", "Last Name": "Elkind", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tatjana", "Last Name": "Rundek", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Clinton B", "Last Name": "Wright", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ralph L", "Last Name": "Sacco", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD", "PubDate": "2021"}, {"PMID": "34651645", "Title": "How Can Cognitive Reserve Promote Cognitive and Neurobehavioral Health?", "Abstract": "This review is aimed at understanding how cognitive reserve and related concepts contribute to promoting neurobehavioral and cognitive health, consistent with goal of the 2020 national academy of neuropsychology (NAN) Annual Meeting.Research indicates that lifestyle factors such as achieving educational and work milestones, participating in leisure and social activities and IQ are all associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline in normal aging and of developing dementia.

Recent evidence also supports the idea that specific genetic and lifestyle factors may help preserve a healthy brain or enhance brain reserve, a process that has been called brain maintenance.

We analyzed fMRI data from between 127 and 159 participants (20-80\u2009years) on a battery of tests relating to each of four cognitive reference abilities. We applied a Gaussian age kernel to capture continuous change across the life span using a 5 year sliding window centered on each age in our participant sample, with a subsequent division into young, middle, and old age brackets. This method was applied separately to both cross-sectional approximations of change and real longitudinal changes adopting a comparative approach. We then focused on longitudinal measurements of neural change to identify regions expressing peak changes and fluctuations of sign change across our sample. Our results revealed several regions expressing divergence between cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements in each domain and age bracket; behavioral comparisons between measurements showed differences in change curves for all four domains, with processing speed displaying the steepest declines. In the longitudinal change measurement, we found lack of support for age-related frontal increases across analysis types, instead finding more posterior regions displaying peak increases in activation, particularly in the old age bracket.

For instance, cognitively unimpaired individuals can have biomarker evidence of both amyloid \u03b2 and tau pathology but will often not develop clinical manifestations in their lifetime. Furthermore, a positive Alzheimer's disease pattern of biomarkers can be observed in other brain diseases in which Alzheimer's disease pathology is present as a comorbidity. In this Personal View, the International Working Group presents what we consider to be the current limitations of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and, on the basis of this evidence, we propose recommendations for how biomarkers should and should not be used for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in a clinical setting.

Some theories have linked this decline to a reduction in distinctiveness of processing at the neural level that in turn leads to cognitive decline. Increasing correlations with age among tasks formerly considered independent have been posited, supporting dedifferentiation, although results have been mixed. An alternative view is that tasks become more, and not less, independent of one another with increasing age, suggesting age-related differentiation, or what has also been termed disintegration. In the current study, we investigated if the aging process leads to a loss of behavioral and neural specificity within latent cognitive abilities. To this end, we tested 287 participants (20-80 years) on a battery of 12 in-scanner tests, three each tapping one of four reference abilities. We performed between-task correlations within domain (pertaining to convergent validity), and between domain (pertaining to discriminant validity) at both the behavioral and neural level and found that neural convergent validity was positively associated with behavioral convergent validity. In examining neural validity across the lifespan, we found significant reductions in both within- and between-domain task correlations, with a significant decrease in construct validity (convergent or discriminant) with age. Furthermore, the effect of age on total cognition was significantly mediated by neural construct validity. Taken together, contrary to a hypothesis of dedifferentiation, these correlation reductions suggest that tasks indeed become more independent with advancing age, favoring a differentiation/disintegration hypothesis of aging.", "Keywords": ["Cognitive aging", "Dedifferentiation", "Disintegration", "Reference ability neural networks", "Task-based functional connectivity", "Within-subjects fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Brain", "Cognition", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neural Networks, Computer"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Georgette", "Last Name": "Argiris", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.

In the current study, we investigated the predictive utility regarding behavioral performance and task information for 240 participants, aged 20-77, for both voxel activation and functional connectivity in 12 cognitive tasks, belonging to 4 cognitive reference domains (Episodic Memory, Fluid Reasoning, Perceptual Speed, and Vocabulary). We also added a model only comprising brain-structure information not specifically acquired during performance of a cognitive task. We used a simple brain-behavioral prediction technique based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression and studied the utility of both modalities in quasi out-of-sample predictions, using split-sample simulations (= 5-fold Monte Carlo cross validation) with 1,000 iterations for which a regression model predicting a cognitive outcome was estimated in a training sample, with a subsequent assessment of prediction success in a non-overlapping test sample. The sample assignments were identical for functional connectivity, voxel activation, and brain structure, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons of predictive utility. All 3 models that were investigated included the demographic covariates age, gender, and years of education. A minimal reference model using simple linear regression with just these 3 covariates was included for comparison as well and was evaluated with the same resampling scheme as described above. Results of the comparison between voxel activation and functional connectivity were mixed and showed some dependency on cognitive outcome; however, mean differences in predictive utility between voxel activation and functional connectivity were rather small in terms of within-modality variability or predictive success.

In this study, we utilise an established Met-dependent transgenic mouse model of TNBC, human cell lines and patient-derived xenografts to investigate the role of MET in TNBC tumorigenesis. We find that in TNBCs with mesenchymal signatures, MET participates in a compensatory interplay with FGFR1 to regulate tumour-initiating cells (TICs). We demonstrate a requirement for the scaffold protein FRS2 downstream from both Met and FGFR1 and find that dual inhibition of MET and FGFR1 signalling results in TIC depletion, hindering tumour progression.

Therefore, one could speculate that\u00a0the association between specific spatial patterns of cortical thickness may be differentially associated with different mobility domains. To test this possibility,\u00a0115 healthy participants aged 27-82 (mean 60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.8) underwent a mobility assessment (usual-walk, dual-task walk, Timed Up and Go) and MRI scan.

Scaled Subprofile Modelling (SSM), a PCA-regression, identified thickness patterns that were correlated with the individual mobility domains, controlling for multiple comparisons.

Three distinct patterns of cortical thickness were associated with three different gait domains during simple, usual-walking: pace, rhythm, and symmetry.

Given previous findings in normal ageing, we tested the hypothesis that higher segregation of the brain's connectome into distinct functional networks represents a functional mechanism underlying cognitive resilience in Alzheimer's disease. Using resting-state functional MRI, we assessed both resting-state functional MRI global system segregation, i.e. the balance of between-network to within-network connectivity, and the alternate index of modularity Q as predictors of cognitive resilience. We performed all analyses in two independent samples for validation: (i) 108 individuals with autosomal dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease and 71 non-carrier controls; and (ii) 156 amyloid-PET-positive subjects across the spectrum of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and 184 amyloid-negative controls. In the autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease sample, disease severity was assessed by estimated years from symptom onset. In the sporadic Alzheimer's sample, disease stage was assessed by temporal lobe tau-PET (i.e. composite across Braak stage I and III regions). In both samples, we tested whether the effect of disease severity on cognition was attenuated at higher levels of functional network segregation. For autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, we found higher functional MRI-assessed system segregation to be associated with an attenuated effect of estimated years from symptom onset on global cognition (P\u2009=\u20090.007). Similarly, for patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, higher functional MRI-assessed system segregation was associated with less decrement in global cognition (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and episodic memory (P\u2009=\u20090.004) per unit increase of temporal lobe tau-PET.

Imaging studies seeking to understand the neural implementation of cognitive reserve have most often used task-related fMRI studies. Using that approach, we recently described a task-invariant cognitive-reserve network whose expression correlated with IQ and that moderated between cortical thickness and cognitive performance. Here we sought to identify a pattern of resting BOLD connectivity related to cognitive reserve. We identified a connectome pattern whose connectivity correlated with IQ in both the derivation sample and a separate replication sample. The majority of the edges showing positive relationships with IQ implicate frontal regions. In the derivation sample, connectivity either moderated the relationship between mean cortical thickness and a set of cognitive outcomes or accounted for unique variance in cognitive performance after accounting for cortical thickness. In a replication sample we found that expression of this connectome correlated significantly with the primary endpoint of IQ, and also accounted for unique variance in cognitive performance beyond cortical thickness. Our findings represent an intermediate level of replication and are unlikely to have arisen purely by type-I error. This connectivity pattern therefore meets some of our theoretical criteria for a cognitive reserve-related network and provides insight into the neural implementation of cognitive reserve. Further, expression of this connectome could potentially be used as a direct measure of cognitive reserve, and as an outcome measure for intervention studies that seek to influence cognitive reserve. Future validation of and re-derivation of the pattern in expanded data sets by our and other groups will lead to further improved estimates of cognitive reserve in resting functional connectivity.", "Keywords": ["Cognitive aging", "Cortical thickness", "Multivariate imaging analysis", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Cognition", "Cognitive Aging", "Cognitive Reserve", "Connectome", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Oxygen Consumption", "Rest", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630W. 168th St., P&S Box 16, New York, NY 10032, United States.

We trained and validated random forest, support vector machine and logistic regression to predict incident AD in 1, 2, 3, and 4 subsequent years. For predicting future incidence of AD in balanced samples (bootstrapping), the machine learning models showed reasonable performance in 1-year prediction with AUC of 0.775 and 0.759, based on \"definite AD\" and \"probable AD\" outcomes, respectively; in 2-year, 0.730 and 0.693; in 3-year, 0.677 and 0.644; in 4-year, 0.725 and 0.683. The results were similar when the entire (unbalanced) samples were used. Important clinical features selected in logistic regression included hemoglobin level, age and urine protein level.

The current study sought to identify univariate cortical-thickness patterns underlying education and general intelligence after adjusting for age, gender and possible in-scanner movement in 353 individuals aged 40 to 80. We followed up this idea with multivariate analyses as well. For univariate analyses, our analyses yielded no robust associations between education and general intelligence beyond confounding effects of gender, age and extraneous in-scanner movement. A subsequent multivariate analyses showed a relationship between education and regional cortical thickness with a robust pattern of negative as well as positive loadings in several right-sided brain areas, speaking to a subtle but robust distributed effect of education on cortical thickness. Cortical thickness variance that is the residual of this education-related pattern was shown to be positively associated with age and extraneous in-scanner movement.

The present study utilized multiple resting state functional connectivity methods in a sample of adults from 20-80 years old to gain a more complete understanding of the effect of aging on network function and integrity. Whole-brain results showed that aging results in weakening average within-network connectivity, lower system segregation and local efficiency, and higher participation coefficient.

These two co-authors moved and, with no forwarding information that was available or could be found, they were therefore unable to be contacted. The authors have uncovered irregularities and deviations from the approved protocol related to the work reported in this article.

The published article does not describe that a subgroup of participants (15 out of the 47 consented subjects) enrolled in the study while taking an ineffective antidepressant medication. Of this subgroup, 10 individuals were successfully tapered off their medication and were among the 36 subjects contributing data to the analyses described. In addition, the authors have found that 8 participants did not complete the required 28-day washout prior to beginning the study. For these 8 participants, the medication-free period ranged from 1 to 21 days, with a mean of 10.1 days. Separately, an inclusion criterion was that eligible subjects \u201chad Center for Epidemiologic Studies\u2014Depression Rating scale score \u2264 10.\u201d However, the authors have found that 3 ineligible participants were included, each of whom had depressive symptom scores 1 point out of range for eligibility.

Multimodal MRI, such as structural and diffusion MRI, is likely to contain complementary information of neurodegenerative processes in AD. Here we tested the utility of the multimodal MRI (T1-weighted structure and diffusion MRI), combined with high-throughput brain phenotyping-morphometry and structural connectomics-and machine learning, as a diagnostic tool for AD. We used, firstly, a clinical cohort at a dementia clinic (National Health Insurance Service-Ilsan Hospital [NHIS-IH]; N\u202f=\u202f211; 110 AD, 64 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 37 cognitively normal with subjective memory complaints [SMC]) to test the diagnostic models; and, secondly, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2 to test the generalizability. Our machine learning models trained on the morphometric and connectome estimates (number of features\u202f=\u202f34,646) showed optimal classification accuracy (AD/SMC: 97% accuracy, MCI/SMC: 83% accuracy; AD/MCI: 97% accuracy) in NHIS-IH cohort, outperforming a benchmark model (FLAIR-based white matter hyperintensity volumes). In ADNI-2 data, the combined connectome and morphometry model showed similar or superior accuracies (AD/HC: 96%; MCI/HC: 70%; AD/MCI: 75% accuracy) compared with the CSF biomarker model (t-tau, p-tau, and Amyloid \u03b2, and ratios). In predicting MCI to AD progression in a smaller cohort of ADNI-2 (n\u202f=\u202f60), the morphometry model showed similar performance with 69% accuracy compared with CSF biomarker model with 70% accuracy.

Five hundred and sixty-two participants (19-80\u2009years old, 16 mean years of education) were studied. Data from structural T1, diffusion tensor imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans combined with a neuropsychological evaluation were used. More specifically, the measures of cortical, entorhinal, and parahippocampal thickness, hippocampal and striatal volume, default-mode network and fronto-parietal control network, fractional anisotropy (FA), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) were assessed. z-Scores for three cognitive domains measuring episodic memory, executive function, and speed of processing were computed. Multiple linear regressions and interaction effects between each of the BMs and age on cognition were examined. Adjustments were made for age, sex, education, intracranial volume, and then, further, for general cognition and motion. BMs were significantly associated with cognition. Across the adult lifespan, slow speed was associated with low striatal volume, low FA, and high WMH burden. Poor executive function was associated with low FA, while poor memory was associated with high WMH burden. After adjustments, results were significant for the associations: speed-FA and WMH, memory-entorhinal thickness. There was also a significant interaction between hippocampal volume and age in memory. In age-stratified analyses, the most significant associations for the young group occurred between FA and executive function, WMH, and memory, while for the old group, between entorhinal thickness and speed, and WMH and speed, executive function.

This study aimed to test whether internetwork connectivity among six cognitive networks is sensitive to age-related changes in neural efficiency and cognitive functioning. A factor analytic connectivity approach was used to model network interactions during 11 cognitive tasks grouped into four primary cognitive domains: vocabulary, perceptual speed, fluid reasoning, and episodic memory. Results showed that both age and task domain were related to internetwork connectivity and that some of the connections among the networks were associated with performance on the in-scanner tasks. These findings demonstrate that internetwork connectivity among several cognitive networks is not only affected by aging and task demands but also shows a relationship with task performance. As such, future studies examining internetwork connectivity in aging should consider multiple networks and multiple task conditions to better measure dynamic patterns of network flexibility over the course of cognitive aging.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aging", "Connectome", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Perception", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Thinking", "Vocabulary", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Eleanna", "Last Name": "Varangis", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Qolamreza", "Last Name": "Razlighi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Christian G", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}, {"First Name": "Zachary", "Last Name": "Fisher", "Affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Columbia University."}], "Journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "PubDate": "2019Apr"}, {"PMID": "30555031", "Title": "Perspectives on ethnic and racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: Update and areas of immediate need.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are a global crisis facing the aging population and society as a whole.

What is the association between sleep and subjective cognitive decline? Cross-sectional design, from two studies of older adults: the WHICAP in the USA and the HELIAD in Greece. A total of 1,576 WHICAP and 1,456 HELIAD participants, without mild cognitive impairment, dementia or severe depression/anxiety, were included. Participants were mostly women, with 12 (WHICAP) and 8 (HELIAD) mean years of education. Sleep problems were estimated using the Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study. Subjective cognitive decline was assessed using a structured complaint questionnaire that queries for subjective memory and other cognitive symptoms. Multinomial or logistic regression models were used to examine whether sleep problems were associated with complaints about general cognition, memory, naming, orientation and calculations. Age, sex, education, sleep medication, use of medications affecting cognition, co-morbidities, depression and anxiety were used as co-variates. Objective cognition was also estimated by summarizing neuropsychological performance into composite z-scores. Sleep problems were associated with two or more complaints: WHICAP: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.59-2.34), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001; HELIAD: \u03b2\u2005=\u20051.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.83), p\u2005\u2264\u2005.0001. Sleep problems were associated with complaints in all the cognitive subcategories, except orientation for the WHICAP. The associations were noted regardless of objective cognition. At any given level of objective cognition, sleep disturbance is accompanied by subjective cognitive impairment. The replicability in two ethnically, genetically and culturally different cohorts adds validity to our results. The results have implications for the correlates, and potential aetiology of subjective cognitive decline, which should be considered in the assessment and treatment of older adults with cognitive complaints.", "Keywords": ["elderly", "healthy ageing", "sleep problems", "subjective cognitive decline"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Sleep Wake Disorders"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Angeliki", "Last Name": "Tsapanou", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division and the Taub Institute, Gertrude H.

However, different investigators have use these terms in different ways, and there has never been an attempt to arrive at consensus on the definition of these concepts. Furthermore, there has been confusion regarding the measurement of these constructs and the appropriate ways to apply them to research. Therefore the reserve, resilience, and protective factors professional interest area, established under the auspices of the Alzheimer's Association, established a whitepaper workgroup to develop consensus definitions for cognitive reserve, brain reserve, and brain maintenance. The workgroup also evaluated measures that have been used to implement these concepts in research settings and developed guidelines for research that explores or utilizes these concepts. The workgroup hopes that this whitepaper will form a reference point for researchers in this area and facilitate research by supplying a common language.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cognition", "Epidemiology", "Functional imaging", "Structural imaging"], "MeSH terms": ["Aging", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Cognitive Reserve", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Research Design"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Eider M", "Last Name": "Arenaza-Urquijo", "Affiliation": "Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Bartr\u00e9s-Faz", "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Barcelona, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Sylvie", "Last Name": "Belleville", "Affiliation": "Research Center of the Institut Universitaire de g\u00e9riatrie de Montr\u00e9al and Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada."}, {"First Name": "Marc", "Last Name": "Cantilon", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, RWJ Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA."}, {"First Name": "Gael", "Last Name": "Chetelat", "Affiliation": "Inserm, Inserm UMR-S U1237, Universit\u00e9 de Caen-Normandie, GIP Cyceron, Caen, France."}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Ewers", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), Klinikum der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Ludwig Maximilian University LMU, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Nicolai", "Last Name": "Franzmeier", "Affiliation": "Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), Klinikum der Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Ludwig Maximilian University LMU, Munich, Germany."}, {"First Name": "Gerd", "Last Name": "Kempermann", "Affiliation": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Dresden, and CRTD -

When applied to held out data or forward applied to fMRI data from an entirely different activation task, network expression correlated with IQ. Expression of the CR pattern accounted for additional variance in fluid reasoning performance over and above the influence of cortical thickness, and also moderated between cortical thickness and reasoning performance, consistent with the behavior of a CR network.

Dementia.", "Abstract": "This project compares three neuroimaging biomarkers to predict progression to dementia in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Eighty-eight subjects with MCI and 40 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Subjects had a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and two positron emission tomography (PET) scans, one with Pittsburgh compound B ([11C]PIB) and one with fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG). MCI subjects were followed for up to 4 y and progression to dementia was assessed on an annual basis. MCI subjects had higher [11C]PIB binding potential (BPND) than HCs in multiple brain regions, and lower hippocampus volumes. [11C]PIB BPND, [18F]FDG standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), and hippocampus volume were associated with time to progression to dementia using a Cox proportional hazards model. [18F]FDG SUVR demonstrated the most statistically significant association with progression, followed by [11C]PIB BPND and then hippocampus volume.

We sought to examine the interrelationship of these imaging biomarkers and the influence of hypertension in older individuals. We used a multivariate spatial covariance neuroimaging technique to localize the effects of white matter lesion load on regional gray matter volume and assessed the role of blood pressure control, age and education on this relationship. Using a case-control design matching for age, gender, and educational attainment we selected 64 participants with normal blood pressure, controlled hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension from the Northern Manhattan Study cohort. We applied gray matter voxel-based morphometry with the scaled subprofile model to (1) identify regional covariance patterns of gray matter volume differences associated with white matter lesion load, (2) compare this relationship across blood pressure groups, and (3) relate it to cognitive performance. In this group of participants aged 60-86 years, we identified a pattern of reduced gray matter volume associated with white matter lesion load in bilateral temporal-parietal regions with relative preservation of volume in the basal forebrain, thalami and cingulate cortex. This pattern was expressed most in the uncontrolled hypertension group and least in the normotensives, but was also more evident in older and more educated individuals. Expression of this pattern was associated with worse performance in executive function and memory. In summary, white matter lesions from small-vessel disease are associated with a regional pattern of gray matter atrophy that is mitigated by blood pressure control, exacerbated by aging, and associated with cognitive performance.", "Keywords": ["aging", "brain atrophy", "cerebrovascular disease", "cognition", "hypertension", "scaled subprofile model", "voxel-based morphometry", "white matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kyle C", "Last Name": "Kern", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Evelyn F.

In the current study, we investigated whether individual differences in performance on these 2 types of inhibitory processes were attributable to region-specific patterns of cortical thinning. Clinically healthy older adults completed a pair of behavioral memory and perceptual inhibition tasks and then underwent structural brain imaging. We found that worse memory inhibition was associated with reduced cortical thickness in the left ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), an area that has been functionally associated with memory inhibition, but not in either the right or left superior parietal lobule (SPL), areas that have been functionally associated with perceptual inhibition. On the contrary, while impaired perceptual inhibition was associated with cortical thinning in the right SPL, it was not associated with cortical thickness in either the left VLPFC or SPL.

These effects are often investigated in isolation ignoring any relationships between them. It is plausible that age related declines in cognitive performance are the result of age-related structural and functional changes. This straightforward idea is tested in within a conceptual research model of cognitive aging. The current study tested whether age-related declines in task-performance were explained by age-related differences in brain structure and brain function using a task-switching paradigm in 175 participants. Sixty-three young and 112 old participants underwent MRI scanning of brain structure and brain activation. The experimental task was an executive context dual task with switch costs in response time as the behavioral measure. A serial mediation model was applied voxel-wise throughout the brain testing all pathways between age group, gray matter volume, brain activation and increased switch costs, worsening performance. There were widespread age group differences in gray matter volume and brain activation. Switch costs also significantly differed by age group. There were brain regions demonstrating significant indirect effects of age group on switch costs via the pathway through gray matter volume and brain activation. These were in the bilateral precuneus, bilateral parietal cortex, the left precentral gyrus, cerebellum, fusiform, and occipital cortices. There were also significant indirect effects via the brain activation pathway after controlling for gray matter volume. These effects were in the cerebellum, occipital cortex, left precentral gyrus, bilateral supramarginal, bilateral parietal, precuneus, middle cingulate extending to medial superior frontal gyri and the left middle frontal gyri. There were no significant effects through the gray matter volume alone pathway.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between performing a working memory task (under MRI) and resting-state brain networks in a large cohort of healthy elderly subjects (n=337). Functional connectivity and interactions between networks were assessed within the default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and right and left central executive (CEN) networks in two groups of subjects classed by their performance (low and high). The low performance group showed lower functional connectivity in both the DMN and SN, and higher functional connectivity in the right and left CEN compared to the high performance group. Overall the functional connectivity within the DMN and the CEN were correlated. The lower functional connectivity within the DMN and SN in the low performance group is suggestive of altered attentional and memory processes and/or altered motivation. The higher functional connectivity within the CEN could be related to compensatory mechanisms, without which the subjects would have even lower performances. The correlation between the DMN and CEN suggests a modulation between the lower functional connectivity within the DMN and the higher functional connectivity within the CEN when performance is reduced.

Cortical and subcortical gray matter regional volumes were calculated from 331 healthy adults (range: 19-79 years). Multivariate analyses identified a covariance pattern of brain volumes best predicting CA (R(2) = 47%). Individual expression of this brain pattern served as a physiologic measure of brain age (BA). The difference between CA and BA was predicted by education and self-report measures of physical activity. Education and the daily number of flights of stairs climbed (FOSC) were the only 2 significant predictors of decreased BA. Effect sizes demonstrated that BA decreased by 0.95 years for each year of education and by 0.58 years for 1 additional FOSC daily. Effects of education and FOSC on regional brain volume were largely driven by temporal and subcortical volumes.

The topography of A\u03b2 deposition, however, largely overlaps with frontoparietal control (FPC) regions implicated in cognitive control that has been shown to be impaired in early mild AD. To understand the neural mechanism underlying early changes in cognitive control with AD, we examined the impact of A\u03b2 deposition on task-evoked FPC activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Forty-three young and 62 cognitively normal older adults underwent an fMRI session during an executive contextual task in which task difficulty varied: single (either letter case or vowel/consonant judgment task) vs dual (switching between letter case and vowel/consonant decisions) task. Older subjects additionally completed (18)F-florbetaben positron emission tomography scans and were classified as either amyloid positive (A\u03b2+) or negative (A\u03b2-). Consistent with previous reports, age-related increases in brain activity were found in FPC regions commonly identified across groups. For both task conditions, A\u03b2-related increases in brain activity were found compared with baseline activity. For higher cognitive control load, however, A\u03b2+ elderly showed reduced task-switching activation in the right inferior frontal cortex. Our findings suggest that with A\u03b2 deposition, brain activation in the cognitive control region reaches a maximum with lower control demand and decreases with higher control demand, which may underlie early impairment in cognitive control with AD progression.", "Keywords": ["amyloid PET", "cognitive control", "cognitively normal older adults", "fMRI", "frontoparietal cortex", "\u03b2-amyloid"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Aniline Compounds", "Cognition", "Female", "Functional Laterality", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Psychomotor Performance", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reaction Time", "Stilbenes", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Hwamee", "Last Name": "Oh", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032-3784 hwamee.oh@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Steffener", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032-3784."}, {"First Name": "Qolamreza R", "Last Name": "Razlighi", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032-3784."}, {"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032-3784."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032-3784."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2016Feb10"}, {"PMID": "26679474", "Title": "Older adults with poor self-rated memory have less depressive symptoms and better memory performance when perceived self-efficacy is high.", "Abstract": "To investigate whether self-efficacy moderates the association between self-rated memory and depressive symptoms in a large sample of older adults.

An alternative approach involves investigating the number and identity of distinct dimensions within the set of neural measures and within the set of cognitive measures before examining relations between the 2 types of measures. The procedure is illustrated with data from 297 adults between 20 and 79\u00a0years of age with cortical thickness in different brain regions as the neural measures and performance on 12 cognitive tests as the cognitive measures. The results revealed that most of the relations between cortical thickness and cognition occurred at a general level corresponding to variance shared among different brain regions and among different cognitive measures.

Older adults with high cognitive reserve are more resilient to age-related brain pathology. Traditionally, cognitive reserve is indexed indirectly via static proxy variables (e.g., years of education). More recently, cross-sectional studies have suggested that reserve can be expressed as residual variance in episodic memory performance that remains after accounting for demographic factors and brain pathology (whole brain, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes). The present study extends these methods to a longitudinal framework in a community-based cohort of 244 older adults who underwent two comprehensive neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging sessions over 4.6 years. On average, residual memory variance decreased over time, consistent with the idea that cognitive reserve is depleted over time. Individual differences in change in residual memory variance predicted incident dementia, independent of baseline residual memory variance. Multiple-group latent difference score models revealed tighter coupling between brain and language changes among individuals with decreasing residual memory variance. These results suggest that changes in residual memory variance may capture a dynamic aspect of cognitive reserve and could be a useful way to summarize individual cognitive responses to brain changes.

However, like any other newly developed technique, the acquisition of neuroimaging data is costly and logistically challenging. Furthermore, studying human cognition requires acquiring a large amount of neuroimaging data, which might not be feasible to do by every researcher in the field. Here, we describe our group's efforts to acquire one of the largest neuroimaging datasets that aims to investigate the neural substrates of age-related cognitive decline, which will be made available to share with other investigators. Our neuroimaging repository includes up to 14 different functional images for more than 486 subjects across the entire adult lifespan in addition to their 3 structural images. Currently, data from 234 participants have been acquired, including all 14 functional and 3 structural images, which is planned to increased to 375 participants in the next few years. A complete battery of neuropsychological tests was also administered to all participants. The neuroimaging and accompanying psychometric data will be available through an online and easy-to-use data sharing website.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Brain", "Cognitive Aging", "Cognitive Neuroscience", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Qolamreza R", "Last Name": "Razlighi", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Cognitive aging phenotypes based on memory trajectories could be used as outcome measures for clinical trials or observational studies of risk and protective factors for dementia. This study used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to identify trajectory groups based on age- and education-corrected composite memory scores derived from immediate, delayed and recognition trials of the Selective Reminding Test. Participants included 2593 participants initially without dementia (mean age at entry = 76) in a community-based study of aging and dementia in northern Manhattan. Trajectory groups were compared on consensus diagnoses of dementia and structural MRI measures of hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortical thickness. Heterogeneity in memory trajectories allowed us to identify four groups: Stable-High (43.5 %), Stable-Low (17.1 %), Decliner (26.8 %), and Rapid Decliner (12.5 %). Decliners had more brain atrophy and higher rates of conversion to dementia. This study highlights the heterogeneity in cognitive aging and provides evidence that most elderly maintain memory function as they age. Associations with dementia and imaging measures validate subgroups of older adults identified with GMM based on their memory trajectories. Future research should use these memory trajectory phenotypes to determine whether dementia risk and protective factors differ for individuals following different memory trajectories.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Cognitive aging", "MRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Atrophy", "Dementia", "Disease Progression", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "New York City"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Laura B", "Last Name": "Zahodne", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Melanie M", "Last Name": "Wall", "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Nicole", "Last Name": "Schupf", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Richard", "Last Name": "Mayeux", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jennifer J", "Last Name": "Manly", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Box 16, New York, NY, 10032, USA. amb2139@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2015Nov"}, {"PMID": "26224757", "Title": "Response-Conflict Moderates the Cognitive Control of Episodic and Contextual Load in Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Decline in cognitive control is one of the primary cognitive changes in normal aging.

The basis of this metacognitive disturbance has been elusive; however it is almost certainly determined in part by compromise to brain regions critical for self-assessment. The subjectivity of traditional measurements of self-awareness in dementia has likely limited the rigor with which its neuroanatomic correlates can be established. Here we objectively measure memory awareness (metamemory) using a Feeling of Knowing (FOK) task in a group of cognitively diverse older adults, including 14 with mild AD and 20 cognitively healthy older adults. Performance on the metamemory task was examined in relation to the structural integrity of 14 bilateral neuroanatomic regions hypothesized to support self-awareness. Less accurate metamemory was associated only with reduced right insular volume (r=.41, p=.019).

Cognitive reserve (CR) refers to how flexibly and efficiently the individual makes use of available brain resources. The CR model suggests the brain actively attempts to cope with brain damage by using pre-existing cognitive processing approaches or by enlisting compensatory approaches. Standard proxies for CR include education and IQ although this has expanded to include literacy, occupational attainment, engagement in leisure activities, and the integrity of social networks. Most research on BRC and CR has taken place in aging and degenerative disease but these concepts likely apply to the effects of TBI, especially with regards to recovery.

Tasks that purportedly tap a specific underlying cognitive ability are strongly correlated with one another, whereas performances on tasks that tap different cognitive abilities are less strongly correlated. For these reasons, latent variables are often considered optimal for describing individual differences in cognitive abilities. Although latent variables cannot be directly observed, all cognitive tasks representing a specific latent ability should have a common neural underpinning. Here, we show that cognitive tasks representing one ability (i.e., either perceptual speed or fluid reasoning) had a neural activation pattern distinct from that of tasks in the other ability. One hundred six participants between the ages of 20 and 77 years were imaged in an fMRI scanner while performing six cognitive tasks, three representing each cognitive ability. Consistent with prior research, behavioral performance on these six tasks clustered into the two abilities based on their patterns of individual differences and tasks postulated to represent one ability showed higher similarity across individuals than tasks postulated to represent a different ability. This finding was extended in the current report to the spatial resemblance of the task-related activation patterns: The topographic similarity of the mean activation maps for tasks postulated to reflect the same reference ability was higher than for tasks postulated to reflect a different reference ability. Furthermore, for any task pairing, behavioral and topographic similarities of underlying activation patterns are strongly linked. These findings suggest that differences in the strengths of correlations between various cognitive tasks may be because of the degree of overlap in the neural structures that are active when the tasks are being performed. Thus, the latent variable postulated to account for correlations at a behavioral level may reflect topographic similarities in the neural activation across different brain regions.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Perception", "Thinking", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christian", "Last Name": "Habeck", "Affiliation": "Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons."}, {"First Name": "Jason", "Last Name": "Steffener", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Daniel", "Last Name": "Barulli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yunglin", "Last Name": "Gazes", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Qolamreza", "Last Name": "Razlighi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Danielle", "Last Name": "Shaked", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Timothy", "Last Name": "Salthouse", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of cognitive neuroscience", "PubDate": "2015Jun"}, {"PMID": "25471394", "Title": "Olfactory deficits predict cognitive decline and Alzheimer dementia in an urban community.", "Abstract": "To determine the predictive utility of baseline odor identification deficits for future cognitive decline and the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognition Disorders", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "New York City", "Olfaction Disorders", "Risk Assessment", "Urban Population"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "D P", "Last Name": "Devanand", "Affiliation": "From the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry (D.P.D.), Department of Neurology and the Gertrude H.

Among the metabolic syndrome components, only blood pressure uniquely predicted all four cognitive domains. After adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, alcohol, and risk factor treatment variables, blood pressure remained a significant correlate of all domains except memory. In this stroke-free race/ethnically diverse community-based cohort, MetS was associated with cognitive function suggesting that MetS and its components may be important predictors of cognitive outcomes.

Based on analyses of large test batteries administered to individuals ranging from young to old, four latent variables, or reference abilities (RAs) that capture the majority of the variance in age-related cognitive change have been identified: episodic memory, fluid reasoning, perceptual speed, and vocabulary. We aim to determine whether spatial fMRI networks can be derived that are uniquely associated with the performance of each reference ability. We plan to image 375 healthy adults (50 per decade from age 20 to 50; 75 per decade from age 50 to 80) while performing a set of 12 cognitive tasks. Data on 174 participants are reported here. Three tasks were grouped a priori into each of the four reference ability domains. We first assessed to what extent both cognitive task scores and activation patterns readily show convergent and discriminant validity, i.e. increased similarity between tasks within the same domain and decreased similarity between tasks between domains, respectively. Block-based time-series analysis of each individual task was conducted for each participant via general linear modeling. We partialled activation common to all tasks out of the imaging data. For both test scores and activation topographies, we then calculated correlations for each of 66 possible pairings of tasks, and compared the magnitude of correlation of tasks within reference ability domains to that of tasks between domains. For the behavioral data, globally there were significantly stronger inter-task correlations within than between domains. When examining individual abilities, 3 of the domains also met these criteria but memory reached only borderline significance. Overall there was greater topographic similarity within reference abilities than between them (p<0.0001), but when examined individually, statistical significance was reached only for episodic memory and perceptual speed. We then turned to a multivariate technique, linear indicator regression analysis, to derive four unique linear combinations of Principal Components (PC) of imaging data that were associated with each RA. We investigated the ability of the identified PCs to predict the reference domain associated with the activation of individual subjects for individual tasks. Median accuracy rates for associating component task activation with a particular reference ability were quite good: memory: 82%; reasoning: 87%; speed: 84%; vocabulary: 77%. These results demonstrate that even using basic GLM analysis, the topography of activation of tasks within a domain is more similar than tasks between domains. The follow-up regression analyses suggest that all tasks with each RA rely on a common network, unique to that RA. Our ultimate goal is to better characterize these RA neural networks and then study how their expression changes across the age span. Our hope is that by focusing on these networks associated with key features of cognitive aging, as opposed to task-related activation associated with individual tasks, we will be able to advance our knowledge regarding the key brain changes that underlie cognitive aging.", "Keywords": ["Cognitive aging", "Convergent/discriminant validity", "fMRI"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Net", "Research Design", "Young Adult"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Division, Department of Neurology and Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and The Aging Brain, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 W 168th St, P&S Box 16, New York, NY 10032, USA.

In the present study, we sought to determine whether the longitudinal regional progression of WMH predicts incident AD above-and-beyond traditional radiological markers of neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal atrophy and cortical thickness). Three hundred three nondemented older adults (mean age = 79.24 \u00b1 5.29) received high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and then again 4.6 years (standard deviation = 1.01) later.

Using structural equation modeling, we calculated latent difference scores of parietal and nonparietal WMH, hippocampus volumes, and cortical thickness values in AD-related regions. Within the structural equation modeling framework, we determined whether baseline or change scores or both predicted AD conversion, while controlling for several time-invariant relevant variables. Smaller baseline hippocampus volume, change in hippocampus volume (i.e., atrophy), higher baseline parietal lobe WMH, and increasing parietal lobe WMH volume but not WMH in other regions or measures of cortical thickness, independently predicted progression to AD. The findings provide strong evidence that regionally accumulating WMH predict AD onset in addition to hallmark neurodegenerative changes typically associated with AD.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Hippocampus atrophy", "Longitudinal", "White matter hyperintensities"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Male", "Parietal Lobe", "Risk", "White Matter"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Adam M", "Last Name": "Brickman", "Affiliation": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA; Gertrude H.

However, to best understand the multifaceted effects of advancing age, age differences in functional brain activity need to be explicitly tied to the cognitive task performance. This work hypothesized that age-related differences in task performance are partially explained by age-related differences in functional brain activity and formally tested these causal relationships. Functional MRI data was from groups of young and old adults engaged in an executive task-switching experiment. Analyses were voxel-wise testing of moderated-mediation and simple mediation statistical path models to determine whether age group, brain activity and their interaction explained task performance in regions demonstrating an effect of age group. Results identified brain regions whose age-related differences in functional brain activity significantly explained age-related differences in task performance. In all identified locations, significant moderated-mediation relationships resulted from increasing brain activity predicting worse (slower) task performance in older but not younger adults. Findings suggest that advancing age links task performance to the level of brain activity. The overall message of this work is that in order to understand the role of functional brain activity on cognitive performance, analysis methods should respect theoretical relationships.

The current multicenter study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between social cognition measured with six items from the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, general cognition, and dependence in 517 participants with probable AD. Participants were monitored every 6 months for 5.5\u00a0years. Results from multivariate latent growth curve models adjusted for sex, age, education, depression, and recruitment site revealed that social cognition and general cognition were unrelated cross-sectionally and throughout time.

Brain maintenance and cognitive reserve are theories meant to account for preserved performance despite advancing age. These theories differ in their causal mechanisms. Brain maintenance predicts more advantageous lifetime exposures will reduce age-related neural differences. Cognitive reserve predicts that lifetime exposures will not directly reduce these differences but minimize their impact on cognitive performance. The present work used moderated-mediation modeling to investigate the contributions of these mechanisms at explaining variability in cognitive performance among a group of 39 healthy younger (mean age (standard deviation) 25.9 (2.92) and 45 healthy older adults (65.2 (2.79)). Cognitive scores were computed using composite measures from three separate domains (speed of processing, fluid reasoning, and memory), while their lifetime exposures were estimated using education and verbal IQ measures. T1-weighted MR images were used to measure cortical thickness and subcortical volumes.

Several factors may mitigate such decline, among which is education, a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The aim of our work was to compare the pattern and duration of clinical trajectories before Alzheimer's dementia in individuals with low and high education within the PAQUID cohort involving 20 years of follow-up. The sample comprises 442 participants with incident Alzheimer's disease (27.2% were male)--171 with low education (mean age=86.2 years; standard deviation=5.3 years) and 271 with higher education (mean age=86.5; standard deviation=5.4)--and 442 control subjects matched according to age, sex and education. At each visit and up to the 20-year follow-up visit, several cognitive and clinical measures were collected and incident cases of Alzheimer's disease clinically diagnosed. The evolution of clinical measures in pre-demented subjects and matched controls was analysed with a semi-parametric extension of the mixed effects linear model. The results show that the first signs of cognitive decline occurred 15 to 16 years before achieving dementia threshold in higher-educated subjects whereas signs occurred at 7 years before dementia in low-educated subjects. There seemed to be two successive periods of decline in higher-educated subjects. Decline started \u223c15 to 16 years before dementia with subtle impairment restricted to some cognitive tests and with no impact during the first 7 to 8 years on global cognition, cognitive complaints, or activities of daily living scales. Then, \u223c7 years before dementia, global cognitive abilities begin to deteriorate, along with difficulties dealing with complex activities of daily living, the increase in self-perceived difficulties and depressive symptoms. By contrast, lower-educated subjects presented a single period of decline lasting \u223c7 years, characterized by decline concomitantly affecting specific and more global cognitive function along with alteration in functional abilities. This study demonstrates how early cognitive symptoms may emerge preceding Alzheimer's dementia particularly in higher-educated individuals, for whom decline occurred up to 16 years before dementia. It also demonstrates the protective role of education in the clinical trajectory preceding Alzheimer's dementia. We suggest that the initial decline in cognition occurs at the onset of comparable Alzheimer's disease pathology in both groups, and is associated with immediate decline to dementia in the lower education group. In contrast, higher education protects against further cognitive decline for \u223c7 years until pathology becomes more severe.", "Keywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "cognitive decline trajectories", "compensatory mechanisms", "education"], "MeSH terms": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Case-Control Studies", "Cognitive Reserve", "Disease Progression", "Educational Status", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "Last Name": "Amieva", "Affiliation": "1 Inserm, U897, Bordeaux, F-33076 France; Univ Bordeaux Segalen, Bordeaux, F-33076 France."}, {"First Name": "Hind", "Last Name": "Mokri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "M\u00e9lanie", "Last Name": "Le Goff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "C\u00e9line", "Last Name": "Meillon", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "Last Name": "Jacqmin-Gadda", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alexandra", "Last Name": "Foubert-Samier", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Marc", "Last Name": "Orgogozo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yaakov", "Last Name": "Stern", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", "Last Name": "Dartigues", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Brain : a journal of neurology", "PubDate": "2014Apr"}, {"PMID": "24363071", "Title": "Reliability, validity, and interpretation of the dependence scale in mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "The Dependence Scale (DS) was designed to measure dependence on others among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Finally, we studied the effect of cognitive reserve on the recruitment of glucose metabolism in a memory task by dichotomizing the data according to educational level. Our results showed that the overall cerebral glucose metabolism in females was higher than that in males, whereas male participants had higher glucose metabolism in the bilateral inferior temporal gyri and cerebellum than females.

We report that netrin-1 and its receptor DCC are widely expressed by neurons in the developing mammalian cortex during synapse formation and are enriched at synapses in vivo. We detect DCC protein distributed along the axons and dendrites of cultured cortical neurons and provide evidence that newly translated netrin-1 is selectively transported to dendrites. Using gain and loss of function manipulations, we demonstrate that netrin-1 increases the number and strength of excitatory synapses made between developing cortical neurons. We show that netrin-1 increases the complexity of axon and dendrite arbors, thereby increasing the probability of contact. At sites of contact, netrin-1 promotes adhesion, while locally enriching and reorganizing the underlying actin cytoskeleton through Src family kinase signaling and m-Tor-dependent protein translation to locally cluster presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. Finally, we demonstrate using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology that netrin-1 increases the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons.

Efforts to explore reserve have been hindered by measurement difficulties. Reed et al. (2010) proposed quantifying reserve as residual variance in episodic memory performance that remains after accounting for demographic factors and brain pathology (whole brain, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes). This residual variance represents the discrepancy between an individual\u2019s predicted and actual memory performance. The goals of the present study were to extend these methods to a larger, community-based sample and to investigate whether the residual reserve variable is explained by age, predicts longitudinal changes in language, and predicts dementia conversion independent of age. Results support this operational measure of reserve.

One potential non-cognitive contributor to function is depression, which has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The current study investigated longitudinal associations between functional abilities, cognitive status, and depressive symptoms in AD. 517 patients diagnosed with probable AD and enrolled in The Multicenter Study of Predictors of Disease Course in Alzheimer's Disease were included. Patients were followed at 6-month intervals over 5.5 years. Longitudinal changes in the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, modified Mini-Mental State Exam, and the depression subscale of the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in AD were examined in a multivariate latent growth curve model that controlled for gender, age, education, and recruitment site. Results showed that cognition and function worsened over the study period, whereas depressive symptoms were largely stable. Rates of change in cognition and function were correlated across participants and coupled within participants, indicating that they travel together over time. Worse initial cognitive status was associated with faster subsequent functional decline, and vice versa. Higher level of depressive symptoms was associated with worse initial functioning and faster subsequent cognitive and functional decline. These findings highlight the importance of both cognitive and psychiatric assessment for functional prognosis.

Experiment 1 and 2 found similar levels of priming in young and older adults at short and medium lags. At the longer repetition lags (\u223c20 + intervening stimuli), older adults showed less overall priming, as measured by reaction time (RT) facilitation, than young adults. This indicates that older adults can rapidly encode unfamiliar three-dimensional objects to support priming at shorter lags; however, they cannot maintain these representations over longer intervals.

While younger adults showed the hypercorrection effect, older adults, despite higher overall accuracy on the general-information questions and excellent basic metacognitive ability, showed a diminished hypercorrection effect. Indeed, the correspondence between their confidence in their errors and the probability of correction was not significantly greater than zero, showing, for the first time, that a particular participant population is selectively impaired on this error correction task.

Multivariate analyses identified brain-wide covariance patterns from 35 healthy young and 23 healthy older adults using MRI-derived measures of CBF and GMV related to three cognitive composite scores (i.e., memory, fluid ability, and speed/attention). These brain-cognitive relationships were consistent across the age range, and not the result of epiphenomenal associations with age and each imaging modality provided its own unique information. The CBF and GMV patterns each accounted for unique aspects of cognition and accounted for nearly all the age-related variance in the cognitive composite scores.
