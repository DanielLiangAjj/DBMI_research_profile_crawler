[{"PMID": "38389544", "Title": "The Role of Environmental Chemicals in the Etiology of Learning Difficulties: A Novel Theoretical Framework.", "Abstract": "Children from economically disadvantaged communities have a disproportionate risk of exposure to chemicals, social stress, and learning difficulties. Although animal models and epidemiologic studies link exposures and neurodevelopment, little focus has been paid to academic outcomes in environmental health studies. Similarly, in the educational literature, environmental chemical exposures are overlooked as potential etiologic factors in learning difficulties. We propose a theoretical framework for the etiology of learning difficulties that focuses on these understudied exogenous factors. We discuss findings from animal models and longitudinal, prospective birth cohort studies that support this theoretical framework. Studies reviewed point to the effects of prenatal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on reading comprehension and math skills via effects on inhibitory control processes. Long term, this work will help close the achievement gap in the United States by identifying behavioral and neural pathways from prenatal exposures to learning difficulties in children from economically disadvantaged families.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Amy E", "Last Name": "Margolis", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Paige", "Last Name": "Greenwood", "Affiliation": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Dranovsky", "Affiliation": "New York State Psychiatric Institute."}, {"First Name": "Virginia", "Last Name": "Rauh", "Affiliation": "Population and Family Health, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University Irving Medical Center."}], "Journal": "Mind, brain and education : the official journal of the International Mind, Brain, and Education Society", "PubDate": "2023Nov"}, {"PMID": "37479778", "Title": "Adult-born neurons maintain hippocampal cholinergic inputs and support working memory during aging.", "Abstract": "Adult neurogenesis is reduced during aging and impaired in disorders of stress, memory, and cognition though its normal function remains unclear.

While several psychiatric medications target the NE system, the possibility that its modulation during discreet developmental periods can have long-lasting consequences has not yet been explored. We used a chemogenetic strategy in mice to reversibly inhibit NE signaling during brief developmental periods and then evaluated any long-lasting impact of our intervention on adult NE circuit function and on emotional behavior. We also tested whether developmental exposure to the \u03b12 receptor agonist guanfacine, which is commonly used in the pediatric population and is not contraindicated during pregnancy and nursing, recapitulates the effect seen with the chemogenetic strategy. Our results reveal that postnatal days 10-21 constitute a sensitive period during which alterations in NE signaling lead to changes in baseline anxiety, increased anhedonia, and passive coping behaviors in adulthood. Disruption of NE signaling during this sensitive period also caused altered LC autoreceptor function, along with circuit specific changes in LC-NE target regions at baseline, and in response to stress.

Recent evidence shows that, even at a time when its circuitry is not yet mature, the infant hippocampus is able to produce long-lasting memories. However, the ability to acquire and store such memories relies on molecular pathways and network-based activity dynamics different from the adult system, which mature with age.

We then explored associations between hippocampal structure, connectivity, and performance on measures of spatial, social, and mathematical ability.

In children with NVLD, reduced hippocampal volume associated with worse mathematical problem solving.

We investigated how early life stress produces long-term alterations in DG structure by examining DG assembly and the generation of a stable adult stem cell pool in routine housing and after stress induced by the limited bedding/nesting paradigm in mice. We found that early life stress leads to a more immature, proliferative DG than would be expected for the animal's age immediately after stress exposure, suggesting that early life stress delays DG development.

Serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in refining the formation of brain circuits during sensitive developmental periods. In rodents, the role of 5-HT1A receptors in general and autoreceptors in particular has been characterized in anxiety. However, less is known about the role of 5-HT1A receptors in depression-related behavior. Here, we show that whole-life suppression of heteroreceptor expression results in a broad depression-like behavioral phenotype accompanied by physiological and cellular changes within medial prefrontal cortex-dorsal raphe proper (mPFC-DRN) circuitry.

We deleted the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR, a receptor required for the SSRI response) specifically from DG GCs and found that the effects of the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were abolished. By contrast, mice lacking 5HT1ARs only in young adult-born GCs (abGCs) showed normal fluoxetine responses. Notably, 5HT1AR-deficient mice engineered to express functional 5HT1ARs only in DG GCs responded to fluoxetine, indicating that 5HT1ARs in DG GCs are sufficient to mediate an antidepressant response.

Hippocampal neurogenesis occurs across the lifespan, however the rate of cell birth is up to 300% higher in adolescent mice compared to adults. Adolescence is a sensitive period in development where emotional circuitry and stress reactivity undergo plasticity establishing life-long set points. Therefore neurogenesis occurring during adolescence may be particularly important for emotional behavior. However, little is known about the function of hippocampal neurons born during adolescence. In order to assess the contribution of neurons born in adolescence to the adult stress response and depression-related behavior, we transiently reduced cell proliferation either during adolescence, or during adulthood in GFAP-Tk mice. We found that the intervention in adolescence did not change adult baseline behavioral response in the forced swim test, sucrose preference test or social affiliation test, and did not change adult corticosterone responses to an acute stressor. However following chronic social defeat, adult mice with reduced adolescent neurogenesis showed a resilient phenotype. A similar transient reduction in adult neurogenesis did not affect depression-like behaviors or stress induced corticosterone.
