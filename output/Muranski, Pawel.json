[{"PMID": "38857784", "Title": "Virus-specific T cell therapy to treat refractory viral infections in solid organ transplant recipients.", "Abstract": "Solid organ transplant recipients require ongoing immunosuppression to prevent acute rejection, which puts them at risk of opportunistic infections. Viral infections are particularly challenging to prevent and treat as many establish latency and thus cannot be eliminated, whereas targets for small molecule antiviral medications are limited. Resistance to antivirals and unacceptable toxicity also complicate treatment. Virus-specific T cell therapies aim to restore host-specific immunity to opportunistic viruses that is lacking due to ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. This minireview will provide a state-of-the-art update of the current virus-specific T cell pipeline and translational research that is likely to lead to further treatment options for viral infections in solid organ transplant recipients.", "Keywords": ["BK virus", "Epstein-Barr Virus", "JC virus", "adenovirus", "cytomegalovirus", "virus-specific T cells"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Lorne", "Last Name": "Schweitzer", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pawel", "Last Name": "Muranski", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, New York, New York, USA.

We performed a phase II multicenter study (NCT03475212) for the treatment of pediatric patients with inborn errors of immunity and/or post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant with refractory viral infections using partially-HLA matched VSTs targeting cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, or adenovirus. Primary endpoints were feasibility, safety, and clinical responses (>1 log reduction in viremia at 28 days). Secondary endpoints were reconstitution of antiviral immunity and persistence of the infused VSTs. Suitable VST products were identified for 75 of 77 clinical queries. Clinical responses were achieved in 29 of 47 (62%) of patients post-HSCT including 73% of patients evaluable at 1-month post-infusion, meeting the primary efficacy endpoint (>52%). Secondary graft rejection occurred in one child following VST infusion as described in a companion article. Corticosteroids, graft-versus-host disease, transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, and eculizumab treatment correlated with poor response, while uptrending absolute lymphocyte and CD8 T cell counts correlated with good response. This study highlights key clinical factors that impact response to VSTs and demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of this therapy in pediatric HSCT.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Humans",

Upon recovery from COVID-19, the degree of the immunological protection from reinfection remains unclear. Here we describe a 33-year-old patient with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) who had undergone liver transplantation with splenectomy followed by allogeneic SCT in 2013 after an initial failed liver and umbilical cord transplant. The patient developed mild upper respiratory symptoms in the spring of 2020 and was found to have anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies suggesting past infection. A comprehensive analysis of T cell functionality in peripheral blood from this patient revealed robust in vitro responses against SARS CoV2 antigens Spike (S) 1 and 2, membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (NP), comparable to the reactivity against common antigens from CMV, EBV, Ad and BK viruses, while only low reactivity was seen in healthy donors without documented history of COVID-19. Moreover, the patient displayed a marked recognition of counterpart antigens from related human coronaviruses (hCoVs) 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. Thus, despite lifelong immunosuppression, this survivor of COVID-19 retained a remarkable degree of immunocompetence and showed broad-spectrum T cell memory specific for SARS-CoV2 and related hCoVs including less studied hCoV M and NP antigens. The study highlights the role of cellular immunity after natural COVID-19 infection, suggesting broader use of T cell assays as a tool for risk stratification, measurement of immunocompetence and/or post-infection or post-vaccination protection, and possible T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy strategies in high-risk patients.", "Keywords": ["COVID-19", "T cells", "coronaviruses", "organ transplant"], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Viral", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus OC43, Human", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Liver", "RNA, Viral", "SARS-CoV-2", "T-Lymphocytes"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Mithil", "Last Name": "Soni", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Division of Hematology/ Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Edoardo", "Last Name": "Migliori", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Division of Hematology/ Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Amer", "Last Name": "Assal", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center/Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hei T", "Last Name": "Chan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center/Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Rodica", "Last Name": "Ciubotariu", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center/Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jian B", "Last Name": "Pan", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center/Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Kara", "Last Name": "Cicero", "Affiliation": "Columbia University Medical Center/Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marcus", "Last Name": "Pereira", "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Markus Y", "Last Name": "Mapara", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Division of Hematology/ Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Department of Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy Program, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Pawel", "Last Name": "Muranski", "Affiliation": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI), Division of Hematology/ Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States..

Appropriate solid tumor target antigens are difficult to identify for ACT. Trafficking to tumor sites and infiltrating solid tumor burdens remains a problem for ACT cells. Persistence of ACT cells, which is important in creating a durable response, is also a major challenge, partly attributed to the formidable microtumor environment conditions.

Relapse of hematologic malignancy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation limits the success of this approach, and PD-1 blockade may hold therapeutic promise. However, PD-1 expression and its relationship with post-transplant relapse is poorly described. Because the donor immunity is activated by alloresponses, PD-1 expression may differ from nontransplanted individuals, and PD-1 blockade could risk graft-versus-host disease. Here we analyzed T-cell exhaustion marker kinetics and their relationship with leukemia relapse in 85 patients undergoing myeloablative T-cell-depleted HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 35 (44%) patients relapsed. PD-1 expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells was comparably elevated in relapsed and nonrelapsed cohorts. Helios+ regulatory T cells and CD8 effector memory cells at day 30 emerged as independent predictors of relapse. Although leukemia antigen-specific T cells did not overexpress PD-1, single-cell analysis revealed LAG3 and TIM3 overexpression at relapse.

TGF-\u03b2 is critical to prevent the spontaneous activation of self-reactive T cells and sustain immune homeostasis. In contrast, in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, TGF-\u03b2 promotes the differentiation of effector T helper 17 (TH17) cells. Abrogating TGF-\u03b2 receptor signaling prevents the development of interleukin-17 (IL-17)-secreting cells and protects mice from TH17 cell-mediated autoimmunity. We found that the receptor of another member of TGF-\u03b2 family, bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1\u03b1 (BMPR1\u03b1), regulates T helper cell activation. We found that the differentiation of TH17 cells from naive CD4+ T cells was inhibited in the presence of BMPs. Abrogation of BMPR1\u03b1 signaling during CD4+ T cell activation induced a developmental program that led to the generation of inflammatory effector cells expressing large amounts of IL-17, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF family cytokines and transcription factors defining the TH17 cell lineage.

In this study, we report changes in the immune microenvironment in patients with CLL treated with single-agent lenalidomide and associate the immunologic effects of lenalidomide with antitumor response. Within days of starting lenalidomide, T cells increased in the tumor microenvironment and showed Th1-type polarization. Gene expression profiling of pretreatment and on-treatment lymph node biopsy specimens revealed upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 and many of its target genes in response to lenalidomide. The IFN-\u03b3-mediated Th1 response was limited to patients achieving a clinical response defined by a reduction in lymphadenopathy. Deep sequencing of TCR genes revealed decreasing diversity of the T cell repertoire and an expansion of select clonotypes in responders.

Rapamycin effectively reduced Th1 inflammatory cytokines interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, increased the Th2 cytokine interleukin-10, stimulated expansion of functional regulatory T cells, eliminated effector CD8+ T cells (notably T cells specific to target cells bearing minor histocompatibility antigen H60), and preserved hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Rapamycin, but not cyclosporine, reduced the proportion of memory and effector T cells and maintained a pool of na\u00efve T cells.

However, the mechanisms underlying long-term persistence of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are not well-defined. Here we identify a subset of memory CD4+ T cells capable of effluxing cellular toxins, including rhodamine (Rho), through the multidrug efflux protein MDR1 (also known as P-glycoprotein and ABCB1). Drug-effluxing CD4+ T cells were characterized as CD161+CD95+CD45RA-CD127hiCD28+CD25int cells with a distinct chemokine profile and a Th1-polarized pro-inflammatory phenotype. CD4+CD161+Rho-effluxing T cells proliferated vigorously in response to stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads and gave rise to CD161- progeny in vitro. These cells were also capable of self-renewal and maintained their phenotypic and functional characteristics when cultured with homeostatic cytokines. Multidrug-effluxing CD4+CD161+ T cells were enriched within the viral-specific Th1 repertoire of healthy donors and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and survived exposure to daunorubicin chemotherapy in vitro. Multidrug-effluxing CD4+CD161+ T cells also resisted chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in vivo and underwent significant expansion in AML patients rendered lymphopenic after chemotherapy, contributing to the repopulation of anti-CMV immunity. Finally, after influenza vaccination, the proportion of influenza-specific CD4+ T cells coexpressing CD161 was significantly higher after 2 years compared with 4 weeks after immunization, suggesting CD161 is a marker for long-lived antigen-specific memory T cells. These findings suggest that CD4+CD161+ T cells with rapid efflux capacity contribute to the maintenance of viral-specific memory T cells.

Despite a clear advantage of the less-differentiated populations, the majority of ACT trials utilize unfractionated T cell subsets. Here, we have challenged the notion that the mere presence of less-differentiated T cells in starting populations used to generate therapeutic T cells is sufficient to convey their desirable attributes. Using both mouse and human cells, we identified a T cell-T cell interaction whereby antigen-experienced subsets directly promote the phenotypic, functional, and metabolic differentiation of naive T cells. This process led to the loss of less-differentiated T cell subsets and resulted in impaired cellular persistence and tumor regression in mouse models following ACT. The T memory-induced conversion of naive T cells was mediated by a nonapoptotic Fas signal, resulting in Akt-driven cellular differentiation. Thus, induction of Fas signaling enhanced T cell differentiation and impaired antitumor immunity, while Fas signaling blockade preserved the antitumor efficacy of naive cells within mixed populations. These findings reveal that T cell subsets can synchronize their differentiation state in a process similar to quorum sensing in unicellular organisms and suggest that disruption of this quorum-like behavior among T cells has potential to enhance T cell-based immunotherapies.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Fas Ligand Protein", "Female", "Immunologic Memory", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Melanoma, Experimental", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "T-Lymphocytes", "fas Receptor"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Klebanoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher D", "Last Name": "Scott", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anthony J", "Last Name": "Leonardi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Tori N", "Last Name": "Yamamoto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anthony C", "Last Name": "Cruz", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Claudia", "Last Name": "Ouyang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Madhu", "Last Name": "Ramaswamy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Rahul", "Last Name": "Roychoudhuri", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yun", "Last Name": "Ji", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Robert L", "Last Name": "Eil", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Madhusudhanan", "Last Name": "Sukumar", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph G", "Last Name": "Crompton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Douglas C", "Last Name": "Palmer", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zachary A", "Last Name": "Borman", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Clever", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Stacy K", "Last Name": "Thomas", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Shashankkumar", "Last Name": "Patel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhiya", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pawel", "Last Name": "Muranski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ena", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco M", "Last Name": "Marincola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Alena", "Last Name": "Gros", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Gattinoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Steven A", "Last Name": "Rosenberg", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Richard M", "Last Name": "Siegel", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Restifo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "PubDate": "2016Jan"}, {"PMID": "26589913", "Title": "PPAR\u03b3 antagonist attenuates mouse immune-mediated bone marrow failure by inhibition of T cell function.", "Abstract": "Acquired aplastic anemia is an immune-mediated disease, in which T cells target hematopoietic cells; at presentation, the bone marrow is replaced by fat. It was reported that bone marrow adipocytes were negative regulators of hematopoietic microenvironment. To examine the role of adipocytes in bone marrow failure, we investigated peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a key transcription factor in adipogenesis, utilizing an antagonist of this factor called bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether. While bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether inhibited adipogenesis as expected, it also suppressed T cell infiltration of bone marrow, reduced plasma inflammatory cytokines, decreased expression of multiple inflammasome genes, and ameliorated marrow failure. In vitro, bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether suppressed activation and proliferation, and reduced phospholipase C gamma 1 and nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 expression, as well as inhibiting calcium flux in T cells. The in vivo effect of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether on T cells was confirmed in a second immune-mediated bone marrow failure model, using different strains and non-major histocompatibility antigen mismatched: bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether ameliorated marrow failure by inhibition of T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Our data indicate that peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonists may attenuate murine immune-mediated bone marrow failure, at least in part, by suppression of T cell activation, which might hold implications in the application of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonists in immune-mediated pathophysiologies, both in the laboratory and in the clinic.

Here we studied the ability of MSCs to support the growth and survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in vitro. Primary leukemic blasts isolated from the peripheral blood of 8 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were co-cultured with equal numbers of irradiated MSCs derived from unrelated donor bone marrow, with or without cytokines for up to 6weeks. Four samples showed CD34(+)CD38(-) predominance, and four were predominantly CD34(+)CD38(+). CD34(+) CD38(-) predominant leukemia cells maintained the CD34(+) CD38(-) phenotype and were viable for 6weeks when co-cultured with MSCs compared to co-cultures with cytokines or medium only, which showed rapid differentiation and loss of the LSC phenotype. In contrast, CD34(+) CD38(+) predominant leukemic cells maintained the CD34(+)CD38(+) phenotype when co-cultured with MSCs alone, but no culture conditions supported survival beyond 4weeks. Cell cycle analysis showed that MSCs maintained a higher proportion of CD34(+) blasts in G0 than leukemic cells cultured with cytokines. AML blasts maintained in culture with MSCs for up to 6weeks engrafted NSG mice with the same efficiency as their non-cultured counterparts, and the original karyotype persisted after co-culture. Chemosensitivity and transwell assays suggest that MSCs provide pro-survival benefits to leukemic blasts through cell-cell contact.

Eighteen (30.5%) were transplanted in advanced phase and 41 (69.5%) in chronic phase. With a median follow-up from relapse of 7.9 years, 5-year post relapse survival (PRS) was 62%. Multivariate analysis found disease status at transplant, time to diagnosis of relapse from transplant and pretransplant tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use as significant factors associated with PRS. Analysis of BCR-ABL transcript expression in the hematopoietic progenitor compartment was performed in 36 patients (22 relapsed, 8 non-relapsed and 6 TKI alone controls).

Here, we report that following differentiation of monocytes into moDC with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4, IFN-\u03b3 induces moDC maturation and up-regulates the co-stimulatory markers CD80/CD86/CD95 and MHC Class I, enabling moDC to effectively generate antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses for multiple viral and tumour antigens. Early exposure of monocytes to high concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 during differentiation promotes the formation of macrophages. However, under low concentrations of IFN-\u03b3, monocytes continue to differentiate into dendritic cells possessing a unique gene-expression profile, resulting in impairments in subsequent maturation by IFN-\u03b3 or lipopolysaccharide and an inability to generate effective antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses.

We found that cells exhibiting limited glucose incorporation had a molecular profile characteristic of memory precursor cells and an increased capacity to enter the memory pool compared with cells taking up high amounts of glucose. Accordingly, enforcing glycolytic metabolism by overexpressing the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase-1 severely impaired the ability of CD8+ T cells to form long-term memory.

In fate-tracking experiments, transfer of pre-DCs into RA-supplemented hosts resulted in near complete conversion of these cells into the CD11b(+)CD8\u03b1(-) subset, whereas transfer into vitamin A-deficient (VAD) hosts caused diversion to the CD11b(-)CD8\u03b1(+) lineage. As vitamin A is an essential nutrient, we evaluated retinoid levels in mice and humans after radiation-induced mucosal injury and found this conditioning led to an acute VAD state. Consequently, radiation led to a selective loss of both RA-dependent DC subsets and impaired class II-restricted auto and antitumor immunity that could be rescued by supplemental RA.

Transcription factors are critical in the generation of cellular diversity, and negative regulators antagonistic to alternate fates often act in conjunction with positive regulators to stabilize lineage commitment. Genetic polymorphisms within a single locus encoding the transcription factor BACH2 are associated with numerous autoimmune and allergic diseases including asthma, Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, vitiligo, multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. Although these associations point to a shared mechanism underlying susceptibility to diverse immune-mediated diseases, a function for BACH2 in the maintenance of immune homeostasis has not been established. Here, by studying mice in which the Bach2 gene is disrupted, we define BACH2 as a broad regulator of immune activation that stabilizes immunoregulatory capacity while repressing the differentiation programs of multiple effector lineages in CD4(+) T cells. BACH2 was required for efficient formation of regulatory (Treg) cells and consequently for suppression of lethal inflammation in a manner that was Treg-cell-dependent. Assessment of the genome-wide function of BACH2, however, revealed that it represses genes associated with effector cell differentiation. Consequently, its absence during Treg polarization resulted in inappropriate diversion to effector lineages. In addition, BACH2 constrained full effector differentiation within TH1, TH2 and TH17 cell lineages. These findings identify BACH2 as a key regulator of CD4(+) T-cell differentiation that prevents inflammatory disease by controlling the balance between tolerance and immunity.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Autoimmunity", "Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Differentiation", "Female", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Inflammation", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Rahul", "Last Name": "Roychoudhuri", "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. roychoudhuri@mail.nih.gov"}, {"First Name": "Kiyoshi", "Last Name": "Hirahara", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kambiz", "Last Name": "Mousavi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "David", "Last Name": "Clever", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Christopher A", "Last Name": "Klebanoff", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael", "Last Name": "Bonelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Giuseppe", "Last Name": "Scium\u00e8", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hossein", "Last Name": "Zare", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Golnaz", "Last Name": "Vahedi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Barbara", "Last Name": "Dema", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zhiya", "Last Name": "Yu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hui", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Hayato", "Last Name": "Takahashi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Mahadev", "Last Name": "Rao", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Pawel", "Last Name": "Muranski", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Joseph G", "Last Name": "Crompton", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "George", "Last Name": "Punkosdy", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Davide", "Last Name": "Bedognetti", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Ena", "Last Name": "Wang", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Victoria", "Last Name": "Hoffmann", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Juan", "Last Name": "Rivera", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Francesco M", "Last Name": "Marincola", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Atsushi", "Last Name": "Nakamura", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Vittorio", "Last Name": "Sartorelli", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Yuka", "Last Name": "Kanno", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Luca", "Last Name": "Gattinoni", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Akihiko", "Last Name": "Muto", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Kazuhiko", "Last Name": "Igarashi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "John J", "Last Name": "O'Shea", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Restifo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Nature", "PubDate": "2013Jun27"}, {"PMID": "23325835", "Title": "Essentials of Th17 cell commitment and plasticity.", "Abstract": "CD4(+) T helper (Th) cells exist in a variety of epigenetic states that determine their function, phenotype, and capacity for persistence. These polarization states include Th1, Th2, Th17, and Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells, as well as the more recently described T follicular helper, Th9, and Th22 cells. Th17 cells express the master transcriptional regulator retinoic acid-related orphan receptor \u03b3 thymus and produce canonical interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F cytokines. Th17 cells display a great degree of context-dependent plasticity, as they are capable of acquiring functional characteristics of Th1 cells. This late plasticity may contribute to the protection against microbes, plays a role in the development of autoimmunity, and is necessary for antitumor activity of Th17 cells in adoptive cell transfer therapy models. Moreover, plasticity of this subset is associated with higher in vivo survival and self-renewal capacity and less senescence than Th1 polarized cells, which have less plasticity and more phenotypic stability. New findings indicate that subset polarization of CD4(+) T cells not only induces characteristic patterns of surface markers and cytokine production but also has a maturational aspect that affects a cell's ability to survive, respond to secondary stimulation, and form long-term immune memory.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Cell Differentiation", "Cell Polarity", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Immunologic Memory", "Infections", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms", "Th17 Cells"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Pawel", "Last Name": "Muranski", "Affiliation": "Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. muranskp@mail.nih.gov"}, {"First Name": "Nicholas P", "Last Name": "Restifo", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Blood", "PubDate": "2013Mar28"}]
