We present a systematic analysis of the prognostic potential of diverse molecular features across large cancer cohorts. We find that the mRNA expression of biologically coherent sets of genes (modules) is substantially more predictive of patient survival than single-locus genomic and transcriptomic aberrations. Extending our analysis beyond existing curated gene modules, we find a large novel class of highly prognostic DNA/RNA cis-regulatory modules associated with dynamic gene expression within cancers. Remarkably, in more than 82% of cancers, modules substantially improve survival stratification compared with conventional clinical factors and prominent genomic aberrations. The prognostic potential of cancer modules generalizes to external cohorts better than conventionally used single-gene features. Finally, a machine-learning framework demonstrates the combined predictive power of multiple modules, yielding prognostic models that perform substantially better than existing histopathological and clinical factors in common use.", "Keywords": ["cancer genomics", "cancer regulatory networks", "precision oncology", "prognostic cancer biomarkers"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Balaji", "Last Name": "Santhanam", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Panos", "Last Name": "Oikonomou", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Saeed", "Last Name": "Tavazoie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}], "Journal": "Cell genomics", "PubDate": "2023Mar08"}, {"PMID": "36711568", "Title": "Arginine limitation causes a directed DNA sequence evolution response in colorectal cancer cells.", "Abstract": "Utilization of specific codons varies significantly across organisms.

By integrating data from 17 cohorts of patients with mitochondrial diseases (n\u2009=\u2009690) we find evidence that these disorders increase resting energy expenditure, a state termed hypermetabolism. We examine this phenomenon longitudinally in patient-derived fibroblasts from multiple donors. Genetically or pharmacologically disrupting OxPhos approximately doubles cellular energy expenditure. This cell-autonomous\u00a0state of hypermetabolism occurs despite near-normal OxPhos coupling efficiency, excluding uncoupling as a general mechanism. Instead, hypermetabolism is associated with mitochondrial DNA instability, activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), and increased extracellular secretion of age-related cytokines and metabokines including GDF15. In parallel, OxPhos defects accelerate telomere erosion and epigenetic aging per cell division, consistent with evidence that excess energy expenditure accelerates biological aging. To explore potential mechanisms for these effects, we generate a longitudinal RNASeq and DNA methylation resource dataset, which reveals conserved, energetically demanding, genome-wide recalibrations.

Most of these studies have focused on adaptation to sub-lethal stresses, upon which a stereotypic transcriptional program called the environmental stress response (ESR) is activated. However, the genetic and regulatory factors that underlie the adaptation and survival of yeast cells to stresses that cross the lethality threshold have not been systematically studied. Here, we utilized a combination of gene expression profiling, deletion-library fitness profiling, and experimental evolution to systematically explore adaptation of S. cerevisiae to acute exposure to threshold lethal ethanol concentrations-a stress with important biotechnological implications. We found that yeast cells activate a rapid transcriptional reprogramming process that is likely adaptive in terms of post-stress survival. We also utilized repeated cycles of lethal ethanol exposure to evolve yeast strains with substantially higher ethanol tolerance and survival.

Indeed, the isolation of bacteria with substantially increased persistence rates from chronic infections suggests that evolution of hyperpersistence is a significant factor in clinical therapy resistance. However, the pathways that lead to hyperpersistence and the underlying cellular states have yet to be systematically studied. Here, we show that laboratory evolution can lead to increase in persistence rates by orders of magnitude for multiple independently evolved populations of Escherichia coli and that the driving mutations are highly enriched in translation-related genes. Furthermore, two distinct adaptive mutations converge on concordant transcriptional changes, including increased population heterogeneity in the expression of several genes. Cells with extreme expression of these genes showed dramatic differences in persistence rates, enabling isolation of subpopulations in which a substantial fraction of cells are persisters. Expression analysis reveals coherent regulation of specific pathways that may be critical to establishing the hyperpersistence state. Hyperpersister mutants can thus enable the systematic molecular characterization of this unique physiological state, a critical prerequisite for developing antipersistence strategies.IMPORTANCE Bacterial persistence is a fascinating phenomenon in which a small subpopulation of bacteria becomes phenotypically tolerant to lethal antibiotic exposure. There is growing evidence that populations of bacteria in chronic clinical infections develop a hyperpersistent phenotype, enabling a substantially larger subpopulation to survive repeated antibiotic treatment. The mechanisms of persistence and modes of increasing persistence rates remain largely unknown. Here, we utilized experimental evolution to select for Escherichia coli mutants that have more than a thousandfold increase in persistence rates. We discovered that a variety of individual mutations to translation-related processes are causally involved. Furthermore, we found that these mutations lead to population heterogeneity in the expression of specific genes. We show that this can be used to isolate populations in which the majority of bacteria are persisters, thereby enabling systems-level characterization of this fascinating and clinically significant microbial phenomenon.", "Keywords": ["Escherichia coli", "antibiotic persistence", "gene expression heterogeneity", "laboratory evolution", "persisters", "systems biology", "translation"], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Anupama", "Last Name": "Khare", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA anupama.khare@nih.gov st2744@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Saeed", "Last Name": "Tavazoie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA anupama.khare@nih.gov st2744@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "mSystems", "PubDate": "2020Jan21"}, {"PMID": "31227602", "Title": "Genome wide analysis of 3' UTR sequence elements and proteins regulating mRNA stability during maternal-to-zygotic transition in zebrafish.", "Abstract": "Posttranscriptional regulation plays a crucial role in shaping gene expression.

Drosophila Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a C. elegans AS-C homolog, hlh-4, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, hlh-4 is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in hlh-4 null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that hlh-4 is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor-encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. hlh-4 is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types. The expression of ADL terminal identity features is directly controlled by HLH-4 via a phylogenetically conserved E-box motif, which, through bioinformatic analysis, we find to constitute a predictive feature of ADL-expressed terminal identity markers. The lineage that produces the ADL neuron was previously shown to require the conventional, transient proneural activity of another AS-C homolog, hlh-14, demonstrating sequential activities of distinct AS-C-type bHLH genes in neuronal specification.

Deregulated post-transcriptional modulation, such as that governed by microRNAs targeting linear sequence elements in messenger RNAs, has been implicated in the progression of many cancer types. A defining feature of RNA is its ability to fold into structures. However, the roles of structural mRNA elements in cancer progression remain unexplored. Here we performed an unbiased search for post-transcriptional modulators of mRNA stability in breast cancer by conducting whole-genome transcript stability measurements in poorly and highly metastatic isogenic human breast cancer lines. Using a computational framework that searches RNA sequence and structure space, we discovered a family of GC-rich structural cis-regulatory RNA elements, termed sRSEs for structural RNA stability elements, which are significantly overrepresented in transcripts displaying reduced stability in highly metastatic cells. By integrating computational and biochemical approaches, we identified TARBP2, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein implicated in microRNA processing, as the trans factor that binds the sRSE family and similar structural elements--collectively termed TARBP2-binding structural elements (TBSEs)--in transcripts. TARBP2 is overexpressed in metastatic cells and metastatic human breast tumours and destabilizes transcripts containing TBSEs. Endogenous TARBP2 promotes metastatic cell invasion and colonization by destabilizing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ZNF395 transcripts, two genes previously associated with Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease, respectively. We reveal these genes to be novel metastasis suppressor genes in breast cancer. The cleavage product of APP, extracellular amyloid-\u03b1 peptide, directly suppresses invasion while ZNF395 transcriptionally represses a pro-metastatic gene expression program. The expression levels of TARBP2, APP and ZNF395 in human breast carcinomas support their experimentally uncovered roles in metastasis.

This general strategy will also be usable, with minor modifications, for revealing genotype-phenotype associations between naturally occurring strains of other bacterial species.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Escherichia coli", "Genetic Linkage", "Genetic Variation", "Genetics, Microbial", "Genome, Bacterial", "Phenotype"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Freddolino", "Affiliation": "Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA."}, {"First Name": "Hani", "Last Name": "Goodarzi", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saeed", "Last Name": "Tavazoie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "Journal of bacteriology", "PubDate": "2014Feb"}, {"PMID": "23991161", "Title": "Synaptic state matching: a dynamical architecture for predictive internal representation and feature detection.", "Abstract": "Here we explore the possibility that a core function of sensory cortex is the generation of an internal simulation of sensory environment in real-time. A logical elaboration of this idea leads to a dynamical neural architecture that oscillates between two fundamental network states, one driven by external input, and the other by recurrent synaptic drive in the absence of sensory input. Synaptic strength is modified by a proposed synaptic state matching (SSM) process that ensures equivalence of spike statistics between the two network states. Remarkably, SSM, operating locally at individual synapses, generates accurate and stable network-level predictive internal representations, enabling pattern completion and unsupervised feature detection from noisy sensory input. SSM is a biologically plausible substrate for learning and memory because it brings together sequence learning, feature detection, synaptic homeostasis, and network oscillations under a single unifying computational framework.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Action Potentials", "Homeostasis", "Synapses"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Saeed", "Last Name": "Tavazoie", "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA. st2744@columbia.edu"}], "Journal": "PloS one", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23874220", "Title": "Bacterial adaptation through loss of function.", "Abstract": "The metabolic capabilities and regulatory networks of bacteria have been optimized by evolution in response to selective pressures present in each species' native ecological niche. In a new environment, however, the same bacteria may grow poorly due to regulatory constraints or biochemical deficiencies. Adaptation to such conditions can proceed through the acquisition of new cellular functionality due to gain of function mutations or via modulation of cellular networks. Using selection experiments on transposon-mutagenized libraries of bacteria, we illustrate that even under conditions of extreme nutrient limitation, substantial adaptation can be achieved solely through loss of function mutations, which rewire the metabolism of the cell without gain of enzymatic or sensory function. A systematic analysis of similar experiments under more than 100 conditions reveals that adaptive loss of function mutations exist for many environmental challenges. Drawing on a wealth of examples from published articles, we detail the range of mechanisms through which loss-of-function mutations can generate such beneficial regulatory changes, without the need for rare, specific mutations to fine-tune enzymatic activities or network connections. The high rate at which loss-of-function mutations occur suggests that null mutations play an underappreciated role in the early stages of adaption of bacterial populations to new environments.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Bacteria", "DNA Transposable Elements", "Directed Molecular Evolution", "Environment", "Food", "Mutation", "Selection, Genetic"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Alison K", "Last Name": "Hottes", "Affiliation": "Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA."}, {"First Name": "Peter L", "Last Name": "Freddolino", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Anupama", "Last Name": "Khare", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Zachary N", "Last Name": "Donnell", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Julia C", "Last Name": "Liu", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Saeed", "Last Name": "Tavazoie", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "PLoS genetics", "PubDate": "2013"}, {"PMID": "23850290", "Title": "A neurodegeneration-specific gene-expression signature of acutely isolated microglia from an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model.", "Abstract": "Microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS that are activated by infection, neuronal injury, and inflammation. Here, we utilize flow cytometry and deep RNA sequencing of acutely isolated spinal cord microglia to define their activation in\u00a0vivo. Analysis of resting microglia identified 29 genes that distinguish microglia from other CNS cells and peripheral macrophages/monocytes. We then analyzed molecular changes in microglia during neurodegenerative disease activation using the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We found that SOD1(G93A) microglia are not derived from infiltrating monocytes, and that both potentially neuroprotective and toxic factors, including Alzheimer's disease genes, are concurrently upregulated. Mutant microglia differed from SOD1(WT), lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia, and M1/M2 macrophages, defining an ALS-specific phenotype. Concurrent messenger RNA/fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed posttranscriptional regulation of microglia surface receptors and T\u00a0cell-associated changes in the transcriptome.
