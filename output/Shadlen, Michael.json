[{"PMID": "38352612", "Title": "Incorporation of a cost of deliberation time in perceptual decision making.", "Abstract": "Many decisions benefit from the accumulation of evidence obtained sequentially over time. In such circumstances, the decision maker must balance speed against accuracy, and the nature of this tradeoff mediates competing desiderata and costs, especially those associated with the passage of time. A neural mechanism to achieve this balance is to accumulate evidence in suitable units and to terminate the deliberation when enough evidence has accrued. To accommodate time costs, it has been hypothesized that the criterion to terminate a decision may become lax as a function of time. Here we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the cost of time in a perceptual choice-reaction time task. Participants discriminated the direction of motion in a dynamic random-dot display, which varied in difficulty across trials. After each trial, they received feedback in the form of points based on whether they made a correct or erroneous choice. They were instructed to maximize their points per unit of time. Unbeknownst to the participants, halfway through the experiment, we increased the time pressure by canceling a small fraction of trials if they had not made a decision by a provisional deadline. Although the manipulation canceled less than 5% of trials, it induced the participants to make faster decisions while lowering their decision accuracy. The pattern of choices and reaction times were explained by bounded drift-diffusion. In all phases of the experiment, stopping bounds were found to decline as a function of time, consistent with the optimal solution, and this decline was exaggerated in response to the time-cost manipulation.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": [], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Shinichiro", "Last Name": "Kira", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ariel", "Last Name": "Zylberberg", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, NY, USA."}, {"First Name": "Michael N", "Last Name": "Shadlen", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, NY, USA."}], "Journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "PubDate": "2024Jan31"}, {"PMID": "37975792", "Title": "Judging the difficulty of perceptual decisions.", "Abstract": "Deciding how difficult it is going to be to perform a task allows us to choose between tasks, allocate appropriate resources, and predict future performance.

We introduce DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data), a robust algorithm which is well suited for the registration of noisy, nonstationary extracellular electrophysiology recordings. In addition to estimating motion from spikes in the action potential (AP) frequency band, DREDge enables automated tracking of motion at high temporal resolution in the local field potential (LFP) frequency band. In human intraoperative recordings, which often feature fast (period <1s) motion, DREDge correction in the LFP band enabled reliable recovery of evoked potentials, and significantly reduced single-unit spike shape variability and spike sorting error. Applying DREDge to recordings made during deep probe insertions in nonhuman primates demonstrated the possibility of tracking probe motion of centimeters across several brain regions while simultaneously mapping single unit electrophysiological features. DREDge reliably delivered improved motion correction in acute mouse recordings, especially in those made with an recent ultra-high density probe. We also implemented a procedure for applying DREDge to recordings made across tens of days in chronic implantations in mice, reliably yielding stable motion tracking despite changes in neural activity across experimental sessions.

choice behavior. While much is known about the neural circuits that process sensory information and those that form decisions, less is known about the mechanisms that establish the functional linkage between them. We trained monkeys of both sexes to make difficult decisions about the net direction of visual motion under conditions that required trial-by-trial control of functional connectivity. In one condition, the motion appeared at different locations on different trials. In the other, two motion patches appeared, only one of which was informative. Neurons in the parietal cortex produced brief oscillations in their firing rate at the time routing was established: upon onset of the motion display when its location was unpredictable across trials, and upon onset of an attention cue that indicated in which of two locations an informative patch of dots would appear. The oscillation was absent when the stimulus location was fixed across trials. We interpret the oscillation as a manifestation of the mechanism that establishes the source and destination of flexibly routed information, but not the transmission of the information per se Significance Statement It has often been suggested that oscillations in neural activity might serve a role in routing information appropriately. We observe an oscillation in neural firing rate in the lateral intraparietal area consistent with such a role. The oscillations are transient. They coincide with the establishment of routing, but they do not appear to play a role in the transmission (or conveyance) of the routed information itself.", "Keywords": ["beta oscillations", "decision making", "information routing", "lateral intraparietal area", "random dot motion"], "MeSH terms": ["Male", "Female", "Animals", "Neurons", "Attention", "Parietal Lobe", "Choice Behavior", "Motion Perception", "Photic Stimulation"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Naomi N", "Last Name": "Odean", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10025 nno2106@columbia.edu shadlen@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Mehdi", "Last Name": "Sanayei", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10025."}, {"First Name": "Michael N", "Last Name": "Shadlen", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10025 nno2106@columbia.edu shadlen@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2023Sep13"}, {"PMID": "37352857", "Title": "A neural mechanism for terminating decisions.", "Abstract": "The brain makes decisions by accumulating evidence until there is enough to stop and choose.

The brain can remember these experiences and, simultaneously, estimate the timing between events. To understand the mechanisms underlying working memory and time encoding, we analyze neural activity recorded during delays in four experiments on nonhuman primates. To disambiguate potential mechanisms, we propose two analyses, namely, decoding the passage of time from neural data and computing the cumulative dimensionality of the neural trajectory over time. Time can be decoded with high precision in tasks where timing information is relevant and with lower precision when irrelevant for performing the task. Neural trajectories are always observed to be low-dimensional. In addition, our results further constrain the mechanisms underlying time encoding as we find that the linear \"ramping\" component of each neuron's firing rate strongly contributes to the slow timescale variations that make decoding time possible. These constraints rule out working memory models that rely on constant, sustained activity and neural networks with high-dimensional trajectories, like reservoir networks. Instead, recurrent networks trained with backpropagation capture the time-encoding properties and the dimensionality observed in the data.", "Keywords": ["neural dynamics", "recurrent networks", "reservoir computing", "time decoding", "working memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Memory, Short-Term", "Nerve Net", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Neurons", "Primates"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Christopher J", "Last Name": "Cueva", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; ccueva@gmail.com ranulfo.romo@gmail.com sf2237@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "Alex", "Last Name": "Saez", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Encarni", "Last Name": "Marcos", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas-Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez de Elche, San Juan de Alicante 03550, Spain."}, {"First Name": "Aldo", "Last Name": "Genovesio", "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome 00185, Italy."}, {"First Name": "Mehrdad", "Last Name": "Jazayeri", "Affiliation": "McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139."}, {"First Name": "Ranulfo", "Last Name": "Romo", "Affiliation": "Instituto de Fisiolg\u00eda Celular-Neurociencias, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, 04510 Mexico City, Mexico; ccueva@gmail.com ranulfo.romo@gmail.com sf2237@columbia.edu."}, {"First Name": "C Daniel", "Last Name": "Salzman", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Michael N", "Last Name": "Shadlen", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027."}, {"First Name": "Stefano", "Last Name": "Fusi", "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027; ccueva@gmail.com ranulfo.romo@gmail.com sf2237@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "PubDate": "2020Sep15"}, {"PMID": "32338595", "Title": "Differentiating between integration and non-integration strategies in perceptual decision making.", "Abstract": "Many tasks used to study decision-making encourage subjects to integrate evidence over time.

During perceptual decision making, the preparatory responses have been shown to track the state of the evolving evidence leading to the decision. The sensory responses are known to reflect categorical properties of visual stimuli, but it is not known whether these responses also track evolving evidence. We recorded neural responses from lateral intraparietal area of 2 female rhesus monkeys during a direction discrimination task. We compared sensory and oculomotor-preparatory responses in the same neurons when either the discriminandum (random dot motion) or an eye movement choice-target was in the neuron's response field. The neural responses in both configurations reflected the strength and direction of motion and were correlated with the animal's choice, albeit more prominently when the choice-target was in the response field. However, the variance and autocorrelation pattern of only the motor preparatory responses reflected the process of evidence accumulation. Simulations suggest that the task related activity of sensory responses could be inherited through lateral interactions with neurons that are carrying evidence accumulation signals in their motor-preparatory responses. The results are consistent with the proposal that evolving decision processes are supported by persistent neural activity in the service of actions or intentions, as opposed to high-order representations of stimulus properties.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Perceptual decision making is the process of choosing an appropriate motor action based on perceived sensory information. Association areas of the cortex play an important role in this sensory-motor transformation. The neurons in these areas show both sensory- and motor-related activity. We show here that, in the macaque parietal association area LIP, signatures of the process of evidence accumulation that underlies the decisions are predominantly reflected in the motor-related activity. This finding supports the proposal that perceptual decision making is implemented in the brain as a process of choosing between available motor actions rather than as a process of representing the properties of the sensory stimulus.", "Keywords": ["area LIP", "decision making", "motion perception", "persistent activity", "saccadic eye movements"], "MeSH terms": ["Animals", "Decision Making", "Discrimination, Psychological", "Female", "Macaca mulatta", "Motor Activity", "Neurons", "Parietal Lobe", "Perception"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "S", "Last Name": "Shushruth", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Kavli Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Mark", "Last Name": "Mazurek", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Kavli Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027."}, {"First Name": "Michael N", "Last Name": "Shadlen", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Kavli Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027 shadlen@columbia.edu."}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2018Jul11"}, {"PMID": "28756951", "Title": "Piercing of Consciousness as a Threshold-Crossing Operation.", "Abstract": "Many decisions arise through an accumulation of evidence to a terminating threshold. The process, termed bounded evidence accumulation (or drift diffusion), provides a unified account of decision speed and accuracy, and it is supported by neurophysiology in human and animal models. In many situations, a decision maker may not communicate a decision immediately and yet feel that at some point she had made up her mind. We hypothesized that this occurs when an accumulation of evidence reaches a termination threshold, registered, subjectively, as an \"aha\" moment. We asked human participants to make perceptual decisions about the net direction of dynamic random dot motion. The difficulty and viewing duration were controlled by the experimenter. After indicating their choice, participants adjusted the setting of a clock to the moment they felt they had reached a decision. The subjective decision times (tSDs) were faster on trials with stronger (easier) motion, and they were well fit by a bounded drift-diffusion model. The fits to the tSDs alone furnished parameters that fully predicted the choices (accuracy) of four of the five participants. The quality of the prediction provides compelling evidence that these subjective reports correspond to the terminating process of a decision rather than a post hoc inference or arbitrary report. Thus, conscious awareness of having reached a decision appears to arise when the brain's representation of accumulated evidence reaches a threshold or bound.

Moreover, these correlations were preserved even for error responses, a finding that contradicts existing explanations of certainty based on signal detection theory.

The level of this bound is hypothesized to mediate the speed-accuracy tradeoff. To test this, we recorded from LIP while monkeys performed a motion discrimination task in two speed-accuracy regimes. Surprisingly, the terminating threshold levels of neural activity were similar in both regimes. However, neurons recorded in the faster regime exhibited stronger evidence-independent activation from the beginning of decision formation, effectively reducing the evidence-dependent neural modulation needed for choice commitment.

Such changes of mind can even occur when the stream of information that led to the action is curtailed at movement onset. This is explained by the time delays in sensory processing and motor planning which lead to a component at the end of the sensory stream that can only be processed after initiation. Such post-initiation processing can explain the pattern of changes of mind by asserting an accumulation of additional evidence to a criterion level, termed change-of-mind bound. Here we test the hypothesis that physical effort associated with the movement required to change one's mind affects the level of the change-of-mind bound and the time for post-initiation deliberation. We varied the effort required to change from one choice target to another in a reaching movement by varying the geometry of the choice targets or by applying a force field between the targets. We show that there is a reduction in the frequency of change of mind when the separation of the choice targets would require a larger excursion of the hand from the initial to the opposite choice. The reduction is best explained by an increase in the evidence required for changes of mind and a reduced time period of integration after the initial decision.

However, the neural mechanism of this integration is poorly understood. Several decision-making models suggest that integration of evidence is implemented by a dynamic system whose state evolves toward a stable point representing the decision outcome. The internal dynamics of such point attractor models render them sensitive to the temporal gaps between cues because their internal forces push the state forward once it is dislodged from the initial stable point. We asked whether human subjects are as sensitive to such temporal gaps. Subjects reported the net direction of stochastic random dot motion, which was presented in one or two brief observation windows (pulses). Pulse strength and interpulse interval varied randomly from trial to trial. We found that subjects' performance was largely invariant to the interpulse intervals up to at least 1 s. The findings question the implementation of the integration process via mechanisms that rely on autonomous changes of network state. The mechanism should be capable of freezing the state of the network at a variety of firing rate levels during temporal gaps between the cues, compatible with a line of stable attractor states.", "Keywords": [], "MeSH terms": ["Adult", "Cues", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Motion Perception", "Reaction Time", "Time Factors"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Roozbeh", "Last Name": "Kiani", "Affiliation": "Center for Neural Science, New York University, New York, New York 10003, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Kavli Institute and Department of Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, New York 10038, and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195."}, {"First Name": "Anne K", "Last Name": "Churchland", "Affiliation": "N/A"}, {"First Name": "Michael N", "Last Name": "Shadlen", "Affiliation": "N/A"}], "Journal": "The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "PubDate": "2013Oct16"}, {"PMID": "23446688", "Title": "Neural integrators for decision making: a favorable tradeoff between robustness and sensitivity.", "Abstract": "A key step in many perceptual decision tasks is the integration of sensory inputs over time, but a fundamental questions remain about how this is accomplished in neural circuits. One possibility is to balance decay modes of membranes and synapses with recurrent excitation. To allow integration over long timescales, however, this balance must be exceedingly precise. The need for fine tuning can be overcome via a \"robust integrator\" mechanism in which momentary inputs must be above a preset limit to be registered by the circuit. The degree of this limiting embodies a tradeoff between sensitivity to the input stream and robustness against parameter mistuning. Here, we analyze the consequences of this tradeoff for decision-making performance. For concreteness, we focus on the well-studied random dot motion discrimination task and constrain stimulus parameters by experimental data. We show that mistuning feedback in an integrator circuit decreases decision performance but that the robust integrator mechanism can limit this loss. Intriguingly, even for perfectly tuned circuits with no immediate need for a robustness mechanism, including one often does not impose a substantial penalty for decision-making performance. The implication is that robust integrators may be well suited to subserve the basic function of evidence integration in many cognitive tasks.
