Recent studies showing evidence of plasticity in thalamocortical synapses indicate a role for the thalamus in shaping cortical dynamics through learning. Since signals undergo a compression from the cortex to the thalamus, we hypothesized that the computational role of the thalamus depends critically on the structure of corticothalamic connectivity. To test this, we identified the optimal corticothalamic structure that promotes biologically plausible learning in thalamocortical synapses. We found that corticothalamic projections specialized to communicate an efference copy of the cortical output benefit motor control, while communicating the modes of highest variance is optimal for working memory tasks. We analyzed neural recordings from mice performing grasping and delayed discrimination tasks and found corticothalamic communication consistent with these predictions. These results suggest that the thalamus orchestrates cortical dynamics in a functionally precise manner through structured connectivity.", "Keywords": ["CP: Neuroscience", "biologically plausible learning", "corticothalamic feedback", "meta-learning", "motor learning", "random feedback", "recurrent neural network", "thalamocortical loop", "thalamus", "working memory"], "MeSH terms": ["Thalamus", "Animals", "Mice", "Learning", "Cerebral Cortex", "Memory, Short-Term", "Neural Pathways", "Synapses", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Male"], "Authors": [{"First Name": "Kaushik J", "Last Name": "Lakshminarasimhan", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Marjorie", "Last Name": "Xie", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA."}, {"First Name": "Jeremy D", "Last Name": "Cohen", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27559, USA."}, {"First Name": "Britton A", "Last Name": "Sauerbrei", "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA."}, {"First Name": "Adam W", "Last Name": "Hantman", "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27559, USA."}, {"First Name": "Ashok", "Last Name": "Litwin-Kumar", "Affiliation": "Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.

Here we probe the degree to which motor cortex's engagement depends on task demands, specifically whether its role differs for highly practiced, or 'automatic', sequences versus flexible sequences informed by external events. To test this, we trained rats to generate three-element motor sequences either by overtraining them on a single sequence or by having them follow instructive visual cues. Lesioning motor cortex revealed that it is necessary for flexible cue-driven motor sequences but dispensable for single automatic behaviors trained in isolation. However, when an automatic motor sequence was practiced alongside the flexible task, it became motor cortex-dependent, suggesting that subcortical consolidation of an automatic motor sequence is delayed or prevented when the same sequence is produced also in a flexible context. A simple neural network model recapitulated these results and explained the underlying circuit mechanisms.

Although lesions reduced the movement speed and affected detailed kinematics similarly, they disrupted high-level sequence structure for automatic, but not visually guided, behaviors.
