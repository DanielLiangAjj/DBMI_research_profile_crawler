Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells.

Here we harness organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex, cultivated from subjects with 22q11.2DS and SCZ, as well as unaffected control samples, to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities arising from this genomic lesion. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with experimental validation, we find that the loss of genes within the 22q11.2 locus leads to a delayed development of cortical neurons. This compromised development was reflected in an elevated proportion of actively proliferating neural progenitor cells, coupled with a decreased fraction of more mature neurons. Furthermore, we identify perturbed molecular imprints linked to neuronal maturation, observe the presence of sparser neurites, and note a blunted amplitude in glutamate-induced Ca2+ transients. The aberrant transcription program underlying impaired development contains molecular signatures significantly enriched in neuropsychiatric genetic liability. MicroRNA profiling and target gene investigation suggest that microRNA dysregulation may drive perturbations of genes governing the pace at which maturation unfolds.

In this paper, we deliver a TBI to flies early in adult life, and then measure molecular and physiological phenotypes at short-, mid-, and long-term timepoints following the injury. We aim to identify the timing of changes that contribute to neurodegeneration. Here we confirm prior work demonstrating a TBI-induced decline in lifespan, and present evidence of a progressive decline in locomotor function, robust acute and modest chronic neuroinflammation, and a late-onset increase in protein aggregation. We also present evidence of metabolic dysfunction, in the form of starvation sensitivity and decreased lipids, that persists beyond the immediate injury response, but does not differ long-term. An intervention of dietary restriction (DR) partially ameliorates some TBI-induced phenotypes, including lifespan and locomotor function, though it does not alter the pattern of starvation sensitivity of injured flies. In the future, molecular pathways identified as altered following TBI-particularly in the short-, or mid-term-could present potential therapeutic targets.", "pub_date": "2022-Jun-09"}, {"title": "Functional midbody assembly in the absence of a central spindle.", "abstract": "Contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis is thought to compact central spindle microtubules to form the midbody, an antiparallel microtubule bundle at the intercellular bridge. In Caenorhabditis elegans, central spindle microtubule assembly requires targeting of the CLASP family protein CLS-2 to the kinetochores in metaphase and spindle midzone in anaphase. CLS-2 targeting is mediated by the CENP-F-like HCP-1/2, but their roles in cytokinesis and midbody assembly are not known. We found that although HCP-1 and HCP-2 mostly function cooperatively, HCP-1 plays a more primary role in promoting CLS-2-dependent central spindle microtubule assembly. HCP-1/2 codisrupted embryos did not form central spindles but completed cytokinesis and formed functional midbodies capable of supporting abscission. These central spindle-independent midbodies appeared to form via contractile ring constriction-driven bundling of astral microtubules at the furrow tip. This work suggests that, in the absence of a central spindle, astral microtubules can support midbody assembly and that midbody assembly is more predictive of successful cytokinesis than central spindle assembly.", "pub_date": "2022-Mar-07"}, {"title": "Circadian autophagy drives iTRF-mediated longevity.", "abstract": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has recently gained interest as a potential anti-ageing treatment for organisms from\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0to humans", "pub_date": "2021"}, {"title": "Circadian regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling and lifespan.", "abstract": "Because old age is associated with defects in circadian rhythm, loss of circadian regulation is thought to be pathogenic and contribute to mortality.

RNA interference and site-directed mutagenesis were used to explore functional and structural BMP receptor requirements for BMP7-evoked chemotropic activity. We show that specific type II BMP receptor subunits, ActRIIA and BMPR2, are required for BMP7-induced growth cone collapse in developing spinal neurons and for chemotaxis of monocytes.

Here, an alternative hypothesis is proposed in which the A\u03b2PP cleavage product C99, not A\u03b2, is the main culprit, via its role as a regulator of cholesterol metabolism. C99, which is a cholesterol sensor, promotes the formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM), a cholesterol-rich lipid raft-like subdomain of the ER that communicates, both physically and biochemically, with mitochondria. We propose that in early-onset AD (EOAD), MAM-localized C99 is elevated above normal levels, resulting in increased transport of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to membranes of intracellular organelles, such as ER/endosomes, thereby upregulating MAM function and driving pathology. By the same token, late-onset AD (LOAD) is triggered by any genetic variant that increases the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol that, in turn, boosts the levels of C99 and again upregulates MAM function. Thus, the functional cause of AD is upregulated MAM function that, in turn, causes the hallmark disease phenotypes, including the plaques and tangles.

However, relatively little is known about whether and how release of endogenous neuropeptides from inhibitory cells contributes to their behavioral role in regulating memory formation. Here we report that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons participate in social memory storage by enhancing information transfer from hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Notably, this action depends on release of the neuropeptide enkephalin from VIP neurons, causing long-term depression of feedforward inhibition onto CA2 pyramidal cells. Moreover, VIP neuron activity in the CA2 region is increased selectively during exploration of a novel conspecific.

To assess how different structural elements of ADGRL3 (e.g., the adhesive domains, autoproteolytic cleavage site, or tethered agonist (TA)) impact receptor function, we require constructs that disrupt specific receptor features without impacting others. While we showed previously that mutating conserved Phe and Met residues in the TA of ADGRL3-C-terminal fragment (CTF), a CTF truncated to the G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site, abolishes receptor-mediated G protein activation, we now find that autoproteolytic cleavage is disrupted in the full-length version of this construct.

We found that mutating the sixth and seventh residues of the TA, Leu and Met, to Ala impaired activity in a serum response element activity assay for both full-length and CTF constructs. We confirmed this activity loss results from impaired G protein coupling using an assay that acutely exposes the TA through controlled proteolysis.

Here, I discuss how we - myself, my laboratory and the diffraction community - have faced the phase problem, considering the evolution of methods for phase evaluation as structural biology developed to the present day. During the explosive growth of macromolecular crystallography, practice in diffraction analysis evolved from a universal reliance on isomorphous replacement to the eventual domination of anomalous diffraction for de novo structure determination. As the Protein Data Bank (PDB) grew and familial relationships among proteins became clear, molecular replacement overtook all other phasing methods; however, experimental phasing remained essential for molecules without obvious precedents, with multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD and SAD) predominating. While the mathematics-based direct methods had proved to be inadequate for typical macromolecules, they returned to crack substantial selenium substructures in SAD analyses of selenomethionyl proteins. Native SAD, exploiting the intrinsic S and P atoms of biomolecules, has become routine. Selenomethionyl SAD and MAD were the mainstays of structural genomics efforts to populate the PDB with novel proteins. A recent dividend has been paid in the success of PDB-trained artificial intelligence approaches for protein structure prediction. Currently, molecular replacement with AlphaFold models often obviates the need for experimental phase evaluation. For multiple reasons, we are now unfazed by the phase problem.

The cerebellum receives axonal projections from the locus coeruleus, and norepinephrine release is implicated in states of arousal and stress, but whether aversive learning relies on plastic changes in norepinephrine release in the cerebellum is unknown. Here we report that in mice, norepinephrine is released in the cerebellum following an unpredicted noxious event (a foot-shock) and that this norepinephrine release is potentiated powerfully with fear acquisition as animals learn that a previously neutral stimulus (tone) predicts the aversive event. Importantly, both chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition of the locus coeruleus-cerebellum pathway block fear memory without impairing motor function. Thus, norepinephrine release in the cerebellum is modulated by experience and underlies aversive learning.", "pub_date": "2023-Aug-10"}, {"title": "Perturbation of serine enantiomers homeostasis in the striatum of MPTP-lesioned monkeys and mice reflects the extent of dopaminergic midbrain degeneration.", "abstract": "Loss of dopaminergic midbrain neurons perturbs l-serine and d-serine homeostasis in the post-mortem caudate putamen (CPu) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, it is unclear whether the severity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration plays a role in deregulating serine enantiomers' metabolism. Here, through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we measured the levels of these amino acids in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys and MPTP-plus-probenecid (MPTPp)-treated mice to determine whether and how dopaminergic midbrain degeneration affects the levels of serine enantiomers in various basal ganglia subregions. In addition, in the same brain regions, we measured the levels of key neuroactive amino acids modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission, including l-glutamate, glycine, l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and their precursors l-glutamine, l-asparagine. In monkeys, MPTP treatment produced severe denervation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibers (\u205375%) and increased the levels of serine enantiomers in the rostral putamen (rPut), but not in the subthalamic nucleus, and the lateral and medial portion of the globus pallidus. Moreover, this neurotoxin significantly reduced the protein expression of the astrocytic serine transporter ASCT1 and the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH in the rPut of monkeys. Conversely, concentrations of d-serine and l-serine, as well as ASCT1 and GAPDH expression were unaffected in the striatum of MPTPp-treated mice, which showed only mild dopaminergic degeneration (\u205330%). These findings unveil a link between the severity of dopaminergic nigrostriatal degeneration and striatal serine enantiomers concentration, ASCT1 and GAPDH expression. We hypothesize that the up-regulation of d-serine and l-serine levels occurs as a secondary response within a homeostatic loop to support the metabolic and neurotransmission demands imposed by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Homeostasis of serine enantiomers is disrupted in the post-mortem caudate putamen and cerebrospinal fluid of living Parkinson's disease patients.", "abstract": "L-serine generated in astrocytes plays a pivotal role in modulating essential neurometabolic processes, while its enantiomer, D-serine, specifically regulates NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signalling. Despite their physiological relevance in modulating cerebral activity, serine enantiomers metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), we measured D- and L-serine levels along with other amino acids known to modulate NMDAR function, such as L-glutamate, L-aspartate, D-aspartate, and glycine, in the post-mortem caudate putamen (CPu) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) of PD patients. Moreover, we examined these amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of de novo living PD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients versus subjects with other neurological disorders (OND), used as control. We found higher D-serine and L-serine levels in the CPu of PD patients but not in the SFG, a cerebral region that, in contrast to the CPu, is not innervated by nigral dopaminergic terminals. We also highlighted a significant elevation of both serine enantiomers in the CSF samples from PD but not in those of AD and ALS patients, compared with control subjects. By contrast, none or only minor changes were found in the amount of other NMDAR modulating amino acids.

Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it has been unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-\u03b3 into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We found that IFN-\u03b3 upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-\u03b3-induced genes and their response kinetics were similar in neurons and glia, but with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, which were the only cells to undergo cellular proliferation and express MHC classII (MHC-II) and associated genes. To determine if neurons respond directly via cell-autonomous IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR) signaling, we produced mutant mice with a deletion of the IFN-\u03b3-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, which resulted in a complete loss of dopaminergic neuronal responses to IFN-\u03b3.

Auxilin KO mice display cardinal features of PD, including progressive motor deficits, \u03b1-synuclein pathology, nigral dopaminergic loss, and neuroinflammation. Significantly, treatment with L-DOPA ameliorated motor deficits. Unbiased proteomic and neurochemical analyses of auxilin KO brains indicated dopamine dyshomeostasis. We validated these findings by demonstrating slower dopamine reuptake kinetics in\u00a0vivo, an effect associated with dopamine transporter misrouting into axonal membrane deformities in the dorsal striatum. Defective SV protein sorting and elevated synaptic autophagy also contribute to ineffective dopamine sequestration and compartmentalization, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration.

Ventral midbrain dopamine neurons exhibit ongoing tonic firing that produces low extrasynaptic levels of dopamine below the detection of conventional extrasynaptic cyclic voltammetry (\u223c10-20 nanomolar), with superimposed bursts that can saturate the dopamine uptake transporter and produce transient micromolar concentrations. The bursts are known to lead to marked presynaptic plasticity via multiple mechanisms, but analysis methods for these kinetic parameters are limited. To provide a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the modulation of dopamine neurotransmission by physiological, genetic, and pharmacological means, we present three computational models of dopamine release with different levels of spatiotemporal complexity to analyze in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings from the dorsal striatum of mice. The models accurately fit to cyclic voltammetry data and provide estimates of presynaptic dopamine facilitation/depression kinetics and dopamine transporter reuptake kinetics, and we used the models to analyze the role of synuclein proteins in neurotransmission. The models' results support recent findings linking the presynaptic protein \u03b1-synuclein to the short-term facilitation and long-term depression of dopamine release, as well as reveal a new role for \u03b2-synuclein and/or \u03b3-synuclein in the long-term regulation of dopamine reuptake.", "pub_date": "2023"}, {"title": "Dynamic physiological \u03b1-synuclein S129 phosphorylation is driven by neuronal activity.", "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, the elevation of \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylated at Serine129 (pS129) is a widely cited marker of pathology. However, the physiological role for pS129 has remained undefined. Here we use multiple approaches to show for the first time that pS129 functions as a physiological regulator of neuronal activity. Neuronal activity triggers a sustained increase of pS129 in cultured neurons (200% within 4\u2009h). In accord, brain pS129 is elevated in environmentally enriched mice exhibiting enhanced long-term potentiation. Activity-dependent \u03b1-synuclein phosphorylation is S129-specific, reversible, confers no cytotoxicity, and accumulates at synapsin-containing presynaptic boutons.

This process eliminates noncoding DNA sequences that interrupt genes and also deletes hundreds of germline-limited open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed during genome rearrangement. Here, we update the set of transcribed germline-limited ORFs (TGLOs) in O. trifallax. We show that TGLOs tend to be expressed during nuclear development and then are absent from the somatic MAC. We also demonstrate that exposure to synthetic RNA can reprogram TGLO retention in the somatic MAC and that TGLO retention leads to transcription outside the normal developmental program.

Postzygotic development involves extensive remodeling of the germline genome to form somatic chromosomes. Ciliates therefore offer a valuable model for studying the architecture and evolution of programed genome rearrangements. Current studies usually focus on a few model species, where rearrangement features are annotated by aligning reference germline and somatic genomes. Although many high-quality somatic genomes have been assembled, a high-quality germline genome assembly is difficult to obtain due to its smaller DNA content and abundance of repetitive sequences. To overcome these hurdles, we propose a new pipeline, SIGAR (Split-read Inference of Genome Architecture and Rearrangements) to infer germline genome architecture and rearrangement features without a germline genome assembly, requiring only short DNA sequencing reads. As a proof of principle, 93% of rearrangement junctions identified by SIGAR in the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax were validated by the existing germline assembly. We then applied SIGAR to six diverse ciliate species without germline genome assemblies, including Ichthyophthirius multifilii, a fish pathogen.
