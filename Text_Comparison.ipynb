Our overall goal is to reveal the molecular mechanisms that cells use to repair, maintain, and decode their genetic information. This research combines aspects of biochemistry, physics, and nanoscale technology to answer questions about complex biological problems that cannot be easily addressed through traditional biochemical approaches. As part of our work, we have established robust experimental platforms that enable single molecule imaging of biochemical reaction mechanisms in a “high throughput” experimental format that can be applied to the study of protein-nucleic acid interactions. The advantages of our approaches are that we can see what proteins are bound to DNA, where they are bound, how they move, and how they interact with and influence other components of the system – all in real-time, at the level of a single reaction.

            "Over the past two decades the most important revolution in human brain research took place due to the availability of non-invasive imaging methods allowing to evaluate the structure and function of the brain. Structural imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows us to assess structural changes that occur as the brain develops when we are young and deteriorate as we age. When disease processes attack the brain, atrophy or other structural changes occurs at a rapid rate. MRI allows us to precisely assess these changes. Further, it is now possible to measure the activity of brain cells using functional MRI (fMRI). Brain cells compute and communicate using electrical signals. This activity requires oxygen, the brain’s energy source, and the intricate and precise supply of oxygen to the brain can be measured with fMRI, providing us a map of brain activity.In the lab we seek to understand the relation between the brain’s structure and function in health and disease, with focus on the biology of learning and memory. We aspire to understand how brain structure and activity give rise to various aspects of behavior. To that end, we use fMRI in humans and mice to understand the basic principles of brain function as well as detect brain regions that are not working normally, follow them carefully and try novel first-in-class therapeutic approaches to alleviate brain disorders.We measure activity in multiple brain systems simultaneously, looking at the interactions between regions of the brain. We attempt to characterize changes in activity that can be used to identify populations or individuals at risk. Namely, we look for changes that precede and predict diseases.

            "​ The Tabas laboratory studies the cellular biology of advanced atherosclerotic plaque progression and the cellular-molecular mechanisms linking insulin resistance to enhanced atherosclerosis. The studies on advanced plaque progression have been driven by the findings in humans that <5% of coronary lesions cause acute atherothrombotic vascular disease and that these \"vulnerable plaques\" are distinguished by the presence of large areas of necrosis that promote inflammation and plaque instability. ​ The studies on plaque necrosis have focused on two processes that are critical to the generation of advanced lesional necrosis, namely, macrophage (MΦ) apoptosis coupled with defective clearance of the dead cells (efferocytosis\"). The apoptosis studies have explored the mechanisms, consequences, and in-vivo relevance of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), notably the PERK-CHOP branch of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway known as the stress Unfolded Protein Response (UPR); and a non-ER stress pathway involving a kinase called PKR. The laboratory has established a critical link between the UPR and a calcium-induced apoptosis pathway. This pathway involves an ER calcium-release channel called IP3R (inositol-3-phosphate receptor), a calcium-sensitive protein kinase called CaMKII (calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), and oxidative stress-generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase. Ongoing work is focused on additional pro-apoptotic processes involving mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial-calcium interaction, and the death receptor-caspase 8 pathway. Additional new studies are exploring processes that are atheroprotective through preventing advanced lesional MΦ death, defective efferocytosis, and/or inflammation. These processes include autophagy; dendritic cell-mediated regulatory T cell activation; and arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators that promote inflammation resolution. Efferocytosis studies in the lab are investigating the role and regulation of the MΦ efferocytosis receptor MerTK and the mechanisms and consequences of efferocytosis by plaque dendritic cells. ​ Obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes are becoming the major drivers of atherothrombotic vascular disease worldwide. The Tabas laboratory is part of a collaborative group, funded by an NIH Program Project (PPG) and including the laboratories of Drs. Alan Tall and Domenico (Mimmo) Accili, exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this association. Recent published work from the PPG elucidated mechanisms of enhanced advanced lesional MΦ death and plaque necrosis in the setting of MΦ insulin resistance, and new work in this area has directly linked these findings to calcium-induced apoptosis (above). The PPG has also discovered new pathways in the liver that increase the risk for atherosclerosis, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia. In this context, the Tabas laboratory has recently discovered that a calcium-IP3R-CaMKII pathway in hepatocytes, similar to the one described above in MΦs, plays a key role in glucagon-mediated excessive glucose production, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and dyslipidemia in the setting of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Ongoing studies are investigating the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in this new pathway. ​ The ultimate goal of each of these projects is to continually pinpoint areas of therapeutic potential. The lab is particularly interested in new therapies that prevent the conversion of benign atherosclerotic lesions into disease-causing vulnerable plaques—work that is now being carried out using nanoparticles to deliver relevant compounds to atherosclerotic lesions (funded as part of an NIH Program of Excellence in Nanotechnology). The laboratory is also interested in using drugs to disrupt the aforementioned new glucagon-mediated pathway in liver, i.e., to block the generation of systemic, liver-derived atherosclerotic risk factors in the setting of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Dr. Zaccara overturned long-held beliefs in the m6A field by proposing a unified model of how m6A mRNAs are controlled in cells with a paradigm-shifting study published in Cell in 2020, on which she is the sole author apart from her post-doc advisor. In her own lab, she plans to dissect the inner working of m6A mRNA regulation. Her lab will integrate multiple high-throughput approaches, including cutting-edge base-editing screens, massively parallel reporter assays, advanced data analysis to decipher how the dynamic regulation of critical m6A players control m6A mRNA. One of the clearest examples where m6A deregulation contributes to disease is in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In her post-doc, Dr. Zaccara contributed to seminal publications showing that elevated m6A levels maintain AML cells in an undifferentiated blast-like state. Her lab will continue exploring the contribution to m6A in AML and normal hemopoiesis, with unprecedented throughput and resolution.As RNA modifications play important roles in development, cancer, and several other human diseases, many CUIMC researchers, including Uttiya Basu (Microbiology & Immunology), Lei Ding (CSCI), Jianwen Que (Medicine), Yuefeng Huang (Microbiology & Immunology), and Xuebing Wu (Systems Biology / Medicine), have ongoing projects related to m6A modifications, will benefit from Dr. Zaccara’s expertise, and enthusiastically welcome her recruitment.Dr. Zaccara holds an undergraduate degree in biotechnologies; she earned her Master and PhD in Biomolecular Science from Trento University. She subsequently joined the Department of Pharmacology as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow under the mentorship of Dr. Samie Jaffrey, a pioneer in m6A epitranscriptomics and a leader in the broader field of RNA biology. Her work has been instrumental in assessing the role of m6A modification in normal and disease states. Additionally, she provided substantial contributions to solve the dogma of why the number of m6A sites in cellular mRNAs has functional consequences on mRNA fate.

            "The overall goal of our research is to understand nervous system function and dysfunction at the cellular and molecular level, focusing on pathways that regulate protein trafficking, degradation, and secretion. Within this broad framework, Waites lab members are currently working on several related but distinct projects, including 1) investigating roles of the ESCRT pathway in neuronal protein degradation and neurodegenerative disease etiology, 2) elucidating the cellular/molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress and glucocorticoids induce brain pathology, and 3) illuminating the mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and secretion.Current ProjectsRoles of the ESCRT pathway in protein degradation and neurodegenerationDegradative pathways are essential for maintaining nervous system health by preventing toxic protein accumulation and aggregation. Our lab has been studying one such pathway, the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport), comprising a series of protein complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III) that recognize ubiquitinated substrates and package them into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for delivery to lysosomes. Work in the Waites lab has shown that the ESCRT pathway mediates the degradation of specific synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins in an activity-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we have become very interested in the mechanisms of ESCRT pathway localization, transport, and regulation in neurons, as well as the ESCRT pathway’s role in SV protein turnover and presynaptic function. Moreover, mutations in ESCRT components are associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and we are interested in how these perturb normal ESCRT trafficking and function to precipitate neurodegeneration. Some of the questions we are addressing include: How are the different ESCRT components transported to synapses, and what types of stimuli catalyze their transport and synaptic recruitment? How are SV proteins targeted and sorted into the ESCRT pathway for degradation? What are the consequences of ESCRT protein mutation/loss-of-function on SV protein turnover, neurotransmitter release, and broader synaptic function? What are the other presynaptic and neuronal substrates of the ESCRT pathway?How do chronic stress and glucocorticoids cause brain pathology?Chronic stress and high levels of glucocorticoids, the major stress hormones, are known risk factors for several neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e. anxiety, depression, PTSD) and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We are studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of stress-induced brain pathology, particularly those relevant to AD etiology, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to illuminate how stress and glucocorticoids contribute to 1) overproduction of toxic amyloid-beta (A?)?peptides, 2) impairment of the endolysosomal pathway and other degradative pathways, 3) mitochondrial dysfunction, 4) Tau pathology and its propagation between brain regions, and 5) neuroinflammation.Mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and secretionExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized vesicles that contain diverse cargoes (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids), are secreted by all cell types, and mediate cell-to-cell communication. In the brain, EVs have roles in many biological processes including development, homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, and the immune response. EVs are also implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease through their role in spreading pathogenic proteins (i.e. A?, Tau) throughout the brain. However, little is known about the basic mechanisms of EV biogenesis, secretion, uptake, and transmission between cells, or how these processes are regulated. We are investigating these mechanisms for a population of small EVs called ‘exosomes’, using a combination of biochemical and live imaging approaches in cell culture, ex vivo brain slices, and in vivo mouse models.\n",

Although designed with engineering goals, this technology provides the basis for tomorrow’s computational neuroscience, engaging complex cognitive tasks and high-level cortical representations.

To explain visual processing, the models must meet computational challenges comparable to those biological visual systems face in the real world. The models therefore need to contain rich visual knowledge about the world and have substantial computational power. Building such models requires the methods of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We take a top-down approach to modelling, starting with models that perform the task, but abstract from much of the biological detail. We then attempt to reveal the aspects of human task performance and brain activity that these models fail to explain. This motivates adjustments to the architecture and the design of the units. Architectures and units must be plausibly implementable with biological neurons. Their design is chosen as required by function and inspired by biology, so as to better explain brain and behavioural data.

            "Biological investigations intoPlasmodium falciparum,the etiologic agent of severe malaria, reveal an organism that is tremendously adept at overcoming therapeutic attack and evading host immunity. This haploid apicomplexan parasite causes disease in over half a billion individuals and kills over a million African children yearly, and prevents sterilizing immunity from being acquired even by individuals who have been infected thousands of times. Disease can result from severe anemia, hyperparasitemia, or other complications resulting from sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (RBC) in the microvasculature, a process that depends on the presentation of antigenically distinct parasite proteins on the infected RBC surface. Chemotherapeutic clearance of asexual blood stage parasites is the linchpin of malaria treatment and control, however it is systematically thwarted by the acquisition of resistance. The most dramatic consequence has been with chloroquine (CQ), for decades the gold standard until resistance appeared and pre-empted a dramatic increase in malaria mortality and morbidity rates, particularly in Africa.During my past 30 years of malaria research, I have investigated howP. falciparuminvades and develops within hepatocytes and RBC, what immune effector mechanisms operate on these stages, how antimalarials act and how parasites counter their action, and how parasites are successfully transmitted toAnophelesmosquitoes, their definitive host. My laboratory's ongoing and planned research channels these interests into several themes:1) What are the parasite factors that mediate resistance to antimalarial drugs;2) What biological processes are targeted by antimalarial drugs and what accounts for parasite death;3) What biochemical and physiological functions are intrinsic to the digestive vacuole (DV) and the apicoplast, the site of action of CQ and of antibiotics respectively; and4) How doesP. falciparum regulateits virulence and prevent the establishment of protective immunity.These studies benefit from our extensive experience inP. falciparumtransfection and we constantly strive for new innovations in genetics to enhance the power of these investigations.\n",

This haploid apicomplexan parasite affects more than half a billion people and is responsible for over a million child fatalities in Africa each year, effectively preventing those who have been infected multiple times from developing lasting immunity. The disease manifests through severe anemia, hyperparasitemia, or complications caused by the accumulation of infected red blood cells (RBCs) in small blood vessels, a mechanism reliant on the display of unique parasite proteins on the surface of infected RBCs. The eradication of asexual blood stage parasites through chemotherapy is crucial for malaria management and treatment; however, this effort is consistently undermined by the development of drug resistance. The most notable instance of this has been with chloroquine (CQ), which was considered the gold standard treatment for many years until resistance emerged, leading to a significant rise in malaria mortality and morbidity rates, especially in Africa. Over the past three decades of malaria research, I have delved into various aspects of P. falciparum, including how it invades and develops within liver and RBC cells, the immune mechanisms that target these stages, the functioning of antimalarial drugs, and how parasites evade their effects. Additionally, I have studied the transmission of parasites to Anopheles mosquitoes, their definitive host.

            "A major goal of neuroscience is to understand how the brain produces behavior. But to produce complex learned behavior, the brain first needs to evaluate behavior. The central question that drives the Gadagkar Lab is: How do brains evaluate behaviors - both self-generated and the behaviors of others? Many of our socially relevant motor skills such as speaking or playing a musical instrument are not innately programmed but are acquired and maintained through a process of trial and error or reinforcement. First, during the practice phase, these complex motor sequences are learned by matching exploratory motor output to internal goals or templates. Second, these newly acquired sequences are performed to a socially significant target audience in a highly stereotyped manner. Third, the audience evaluates the performance, shows a preference for certain features like stereotypy and virtuosity, and provides feedback to the performer. These three stages of practice, performance, and preference serve the goal of learning motor skills critical for social life, yet we understand very little about the neural mechanisms underlying these processes.The songbird, with its highly tractable song circuit, is an excellent model system to address this problem. The adult zebra finch song is a learned, stereotyped motor sequence, and juvenile finches learn to imitate their tutor’s song (the internal goal) by trial and error. Furthermore, male songbirds ‘practice’ their songs alone with the ultimate goal of ‘performing’ to a female. Female finches evaluate male songs directed at them and show a ‘preference’ for the most stereotyped and attractive songs. The goal of the Gadagkar Lab is to combine the advantages of the zebra finch courtship song system with state-of-the-art computational, theoretical, and experimental techniques to study how the brain implements reinforcement learning through the stages of practice, performance, and preference. Some of the questions we are currently investigating are: 1. What is the role of reinforcement during early critical periods of sensorimotor learning? 2. How does the brain switch between a state optimized for variability and learning to a state optimized for stereotypy and performance? 3. What are the neural mechanisms of female mate choice?\n",

The Gadagkar Lab is driven by the fundamental question: How do brains assess both self-generated behaviors and those of others? Many of our socially significant motor skills, including speaking and playing instruments, are not instinctively programmed but are instead acquired through a system of trial and error or reinforcement. Initially, these intricate motor sequences are learned during the practice phase by aligning exploratory motor outputs with internal targets or templates. Next, these sequences are executed in a consistent manner for a socially important audience. Finally, the audience evaluates the performance, expressing preferences for certain characteristics like consistency and skillfulness, while offering feedback to the performer. These three stages—practice, performance, and preference—are essential for mastering motor skills necessary for social engagement, yet the neural processes involved remain poorly understood. The zebra finch, with its well-characterized song circuit, serves as an ideal model for investigating this issue. The adult zebra finch's song is a learned, consistent motor sequence, and young finches acquire their tutor's song through trial and error. Additionally, male songbirds rehearse their songs alone, aiming to perform for females. Female finches assess the songs directed at them and show a preference for those that are most consistent and appealing.

            "We are studying the molecular and cellular events that regulate the early development and organization of the central nervous system. After neuronal differentiation, axons extend towards their target cells within the central nervous system, navigating under the guidance of cues in the environment. To determine the nature of such cues and the mechanisms by which growth cones respond to them, we have analyzed the earliest axonal pathways in the developing spinal cord. Using in vitro assays in combination with antibodies and molecular markers that define cellular components of the developing spinal cord, we have identified several components of a guidance system that may contribute to the projection pattern of a subset of sensory relay neurons, the commissural neurons. Commissural neurons project circumferentially and ventrally away from the dorsal midline of the neural tube and towards and across the ventral midline of the spinal cord before turning to project towards higher spinal segments and supraspinal sites. Two groups of cells, located at the dorsal and ventral midlines and known as the roof plate and the floor plate, respectively, appear to act as sources of cues for commissural axons. The roof plate appears to direct initial axon extension away from the dorsal midline through the release of a diffusible chemorepellent, whereas the floor plate provides both contact-mediated and diffusible cues for commissural axon navigation towards and across the midline. We are currently trying to determine how roof plate- and floor plate-derived signals act to influence the direction of growth of commissural axons.The ventral midline of the neural tube consists of several subgroups of cells that differ, according to their position in the rostro-caudal axis, in the expression of cellular markers and signaling molecules. Throughout the axis, these cells appear to have multiple roles in the patterning of adjacent cell types and axons. To begin to study the mechanisms underlying cell identity within the neural tube we have therefore examined the development of the ventral midline cell groups. By analyzing changes in neural cell identity and pattern within neural tube explants, we have shown that axial mesodermal cells of the notochord and prechordal mesoderm provide inductive signals that initiate the differentiation of the ventral midline and patterning of neurons within the neural plate. Sonic hedgehog appears to mediate the induction of floor plate by notochord, but in rostral regions sonic hedgehog appears to act cooperatively with another signaling molecule to generate ventral midline cells with rostral properties. Current experiments are directed at the molecular identification of mesoderm-derived inducing signals at different rostro-caudal levels and the characterization of the response of neuroepithelial cells to such signals.\n",

            "Our research focuses on understanding normal and abnormal biology of the urothelium, a water-tight epithelial barrier lining the urinary outflow tract that protects against infection. The urothelium is nearly quiescent, but can rapidly undergo regeneration in response to injury from urinary tract infection or exposure to chemicals. Chronic injury or inflammation however, induces a shift from a urothelial differentiation program to a basal/squamous differentiation program generating an epithelium similar to skin. Our studies have used mouse models to identify major transcriptional and epigenetic regulators of urothelial differentiation both in the healthy urothelium and in bladder cancer, including nuclear receptors (Pparg, retinoids) and chromatin remodeling genes.Bladder cancers can be divided into distinct classes; Basal/Squamous tumors tend to be invasive, and are immune infiltrated, while luminal/papillary tumors tend to be less invasive, are exophytic, and have low levels of immune infiltration. Pparg, a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily promotes urothelial/luminal differentiation and suppresses basal/squamous differentiation. At present, most patients with high-grade Basal/squamous tumors undergo cystectomy, while lower grade papillary tumors can be resected by TURBT, but often regrow, and can become invasive. Deficiency in retinoids has long been known to induce squamous differentiation in a number of epithelial including the urothelium. We find that Pparg regulates urothelial differentiation at least in part, by up-regulating retinoid signaling and Kdm6a, a chromatin modifier required for retinoid signaling.Most recently, our studies have investigated the efficacy of a 2-drug treatment consisting of rosiglitazone, a synthetic Pparg agonist, and trametinib, a MEK/ERK inhibitor. Using a mouse model of basal/squamous muscle invasive bladder cancer, we show that either drug alone can restrict tumor growth, while the 2-drug combination induces tumor cell death within 7 days of treatment. Furthermore, the epithelium of rosiglitazone/trametinib treated mice undergoes a switch from basal/squamous differentiation which promotes tumor formation to urothelial differentiation; restoring endogenous cell types and functions, which are important for bladder stretch and physiology.  An important goal, is translating these preclinical findings into a clinical study which is currently underway.\n",

While the urothelium generally remains inactive, it can quickly regenerate following injuries caused by urinary tract infections or chemical exposure. However, persistent injury or inflammation can lead to a transition from urothelial differentiation to a basal/squamous differentiation pathway, producing an epithelium resembling skin. We have utilized mouse models to identify key transcriptional and epigenetic factors that govern urothelial differentiation in both healthy tissue and bladder cancer, including nuclear receptors (such as Pparg and retinoids) and chromatin remodeling genes. Bladder cancers can be classified into specific types: basal/squamous tumors are typically invasive and exhibit immune infiltration, whereas luminal/papillary tumors are generally less invasive, exophytic, and have minimal immune presence. Pparg, a transcription factor in the nuclear receptor superfamily, encourages urothelial/luminal differentiation while inhibiting basal/squamous differentiation. Currently, patients with high-grade basal/squamous tumors usually undergo cystectomy, while those with lower-grade papillary tumors may receive TURBT, but often face recurrence and possible invasiveness. It has been established that retinoid deficiency can lead to squamous differentiation in various epithelia, including the urothelium. Our research indicates that Pparg influences urothelial differentiation partly by enhancing retinoid signaling and Kdm6a, a chromatin modifier essential for this signaling pathway. Recently, we have explored the effectiveness of a dual-drug treatment combining rosiglitazone, a synthetic Pparg agonist, and trametinib, a MEK/ERK inhibitor. Utilizing a mouse model of invasive basal/squamous bladder cancer, we found that while each drug alone can limit tumor growth, the combination treatment leads to tumor cell death within seven days. Additionally, the urothelium in mice treated with rosiglitazone and trametinib shows a transition from a basal/squamous differentiation profile that encourages tumor development back to urothelial differentiation, reinstating vital cell types and functions necessary for bladder capacity and health.

Through these collaborative efforts, we aim to trace the complete journey of tumor development, from a solitary transformed cell to a complex and aggressive tumor population, achieving an unparalleled scale and resolution. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach will facilitate the creation of predictive models for tumor evolution, enhancing our capacity to foresee and potentially disrupt cancer progression.\n",
            "My laboratory has concentrated its research efforts on experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Through the use of both in vitro and in vivo models of these two adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders, we have studied the contribution of death of specific subsets of neurons a series of both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms.Among the cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, we have paid particular attention to the role of mitochondria, fist by studying the link of defect in bioenergetic and neuronal death; then by linking respiratory defect to program cell death, and more recently by studying defect in mitophagy and neuronal death.  Our recent results have shown that PINK1 and Parkin interact to modulate the turnover of defective mitochondria and that in presence of PINK1 and/or Parkin mutations, mitochondrial quality control mechanisms are defective. Currently, we thus try to understand PINK1 normal function and how it communicates with Parkin. We also study the actual molecular basis of mitophagy and how any defect in such mechanism of quality control could cause neurodegeneration.Among the non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, we have first studied the actual role and molecular determinants of neuroinflammation, i.e. how activated microglia and reactive astrocytes could mediate neuronal death. More recently, we have found that astrocytes derived from both experimental models of disease such as ALS and from patients can provoke the death of specific neurons. Currently, we are thus searching at identifying the nature of the toxic factor(s) mediating this neurodegeneration phenomenon; at defining the molecular cascade of death engaged within specific of neurons upon exposure to toxic astrocytes, and at miniaturizing this in vitro model of ALS to use it for high-throughput screening of small molecules library.\n",

We employ both in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of specific neuronal subset deaths through a range of both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. In terms of cell autonomous mechanisms, we have particularly examined the role of mitochondria, initially exploring the connection between bioenergetic defects and neuronal death, then linking respiratory dysfunction to programmed cell death, and more recently investigating issues with mitophagy and neuronal loss. Our latest findings indicate that PINK1 and Parkin work together to regulate the turnover of damaged mitochondria, and that mutations in PINK1 and/or Parkin lead to impaired mitochondrial quality control. Currently, we are working to understand the normal functions of PINK1 and its interaction with Parkin, as well as the fundamental molecular mechanisms behind mitophagy and how failures in these quality control processes may lead to neurodegeneration. Regarding non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, we have initially focused on the role and molecular aspects of neuroinflammation, particularly how activated microglia and reactive astrocytes contribute to neuronal death. Recently, we have discovered that astrocytes from both ALS experimental models and patient samples can induce the death of certain neurons.

            "Research in the laboratory is focused on immunological memory and specifically on memory T cells as essential mediators of protective immunity. While it was previously thought that memory T cells mediate their protective responses through rapid migration and surveillance through tissues, it is now become clear that localization and establishment of non-circulating memory T cells resident in tissue sites is integral to immune protection. We are incorporating fundamental studies on mouse models with novel translational approaches on human samples to investigate tissue immune responses. We have identified a new subset of non-circulating tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in the lung that mediate optimal protective immunity in a mouse model of influenza infection. Current studies into mechanisms for how memory T cells become targeted to and maintained in the lung use total transcriptome profiling and bioinformatics approaches.

            "Our research program aims to understand the molecular mechanisms of olfactory receptor gene choice. Olfactory receptor (OR) genes compose the largest mammalian gene family consisted of more than 1000 members. These genes are expressed in a stochastic and mutually exclusive fashion in such a way that only one OR allele is expressed in each olfactory sensory neuron. Our data suggest that this unusual expression pattern is orchestrated by a combination of positive and negative regulatory mechanism. According to our findings, OR genes undergo chromatin mediated silencing at a developmental stage that precedes olfactory receptor activation. One of the 3000 alleles is chosen for activation, by the enzymatic removal of the silencing chromatin marks. We currently combine genetic and biochemical approaches that together with cutting edge microscopy should reveal critical mechanistic details of this process.\n",

We employ an array of complementary methods, including in vivo single-cell patch-clamp recordings, two-photon activity imaging, optogenetics, and various behavioral approaches. The overarching objective of my lab is to elucidate how the specific properties and interconnections of particular neuronal types within sensory circuits facilitate the computations required for sensory perception.\n",

We have demonstrated that specific sequences within the ion channel (leucine zippers) recruit regulatory proteins, which modulate the ion channel function in normal and pathologic conditions. The laboratory is now focused on understanding the molecular components and functional implications of macromolecular complex formation of the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa, maxi-K) and the L-type voltage gated calcium channel. The laboratory utilizes both molecular biologic and electrophysiologic (planar lipid bilayer, patch clamp) techniques to elucidate these fundamental processes and emphasizes the links between these fundamental molecular processes and systems function.

They are maintained for life through self-renewing divisions where HSCs divide to produces HSC daughter cells. How self-renewal is regulated is a central question in stem cell biology. HSC self-renewal is regulated by both HSC intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. In vivo, HSCs reside in a complex microenvironment and are critically regulated by factors secreted by cells that comprise a specialized niche. The HSC niche represents a critical element responsible for the extrinsic regulation of HSC self-renewal. Alterations to the microenvironment can contribute to the development of leukemia, bone marrow failure syndromes and anemia. We are investigating extrinsic mechanisms that regulate HSC self-renewal, and how mis-regulation of niche/HSC interactions contributes to diseases such as cancer and anemia.

These cells persist throughout an individual's life by undergoing self-renewing divisions that produce daughter HSCs. A fundamental question in stem cell biology is how self-renewal is controlled. This process is influenced by both intrinsic characteristics of the HSCs and external factors from their environment. Within the body, HSCs exist in a specialized microenvironment, or niche, where various cells release factors that significantly regulate HSC self-renewal. The niche is a vital component in the external regulation of this process. Changes in the microenvironment can lead to conditions such as leukemia, bone marrow failure syndromes, and anemia. Our research focuses on the external factors that influence HSC self-renewal and how disruptions in the interactions between the niche and HSCs may lead to diseases like cancer and anemia.

            "Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles that contain their own genetic machinery. As such, they operate under the dual genetic controls of nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondrial genetics differs markedly from mendelian genetics, because first, mitochondria are inherited exclusively from the mother, and second, there are hundreds or thousands of mitochondria (and mtDNAs) per cell. Biochemically, the most relevant aspect of mitochondrial function is the production of oxidative energy via the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation. There are maternally-inherited, mendelian-inherited, sporadic, and even environmentally-induced mitochondrial disorders, most of which are fatal. We are studying the molecular basis of a number of these diseases, often using cytoplasmic hybrids, or \"cybrids,\" that contain known proportions of mutant or wild-type mtDNAs in clonal cell lines that have no contaminating mtDNA background. We have also begun a project on treating mtDNA-based disease using pharmacological approaches aimed at \"shifting heteroplasmy\" in order to restore respiratory function in patient-derived cells. Most recently we have become interested in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and have discovered that presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and gamma-secretase activity itself, are located predominantly in a specialized subcompartment of the ER that is physically and biochemically connected to mitochondria, called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM). We have found that cells from AD patients have massively increased ER-mitochondrial communication, which may help explain many of the seemingly unrelated features of the disease.

            "Neuroscience made enormous strides during the 1990’s with the advent of molecular genetic techniques that allowed us to identify myriad disease genes and manipulate them in animal models from flies to mice. In the 2000’s, we came to appreciate the importance of epigenetic mechanisms to neurobiology, and now we are on the cusp of a new field that might be called “RNA neurobiology.”RNA biology may, in fact, have particular importance in the brain, given the extremely dynamic nature of neuronal synapses. The post-synaptic compartment contains polysomes, which indicates that translation is crucial for higher-order brain activity, and protein synthesis has long been thought to be required for memory consolidation. Small wonder, then, that disruption of RNA-binding proteins is associated with wide-ranging syndromes that affect motor control, behavior, and cognition.My interest in RNA-binding proteins centers on their role in post-transcriptional regulation of proteins that, when mutated, lead to human neurological disease. But my interest is in the wild-type versions of these proteins: my research has shown that relatively modest increases or decreases in the levels of at least some ‘normal’ proteins can be pathogenic. This opens up an entirely new avenue to discovering new neurological disease genes, as I showed recently in the identification of patients bearing mutations inPumilio1(Cell, 2018).\n",

            "Neuroscience experienced significant advancements in the 1990s with the introduction of molecular genetic techniques that enabled the identification and manipulation of numerous disease-related genes in various animal models, ranging from fruit flies to mice. In the following decade, the significance of epigenetic mechanisms in neurobiology became increasingly clear, and we now stand on the brink of a new discipline that could be termed \"RNA neurobiology.\" RNA biology appears to be particularly crucial in the brain due to the highly dynamic nature of neuronal synapses. The presence of polysomes in the post-synaptic compartment highlights the importance of translation for complex brain functions, and it has long been understood that protein synthesis is essential for memory consolidation. Consequently, the disruption of RNA-binding proteins has been linked to various syndromes that impact motor skills, behavior, and cognitive functions. My research focuses on RNA-binding proteins and their role in the post-transcriptional regulation of proteins that, when altered, contribute to neurological diseases in humans. I am particularly interested in the wild-type forms of these proteins, as my findings indicate that even slight variations in the levels of certain 'normal' proteins can have pathogenic effects. This perspective paves the way for a novel approach to identifying new genetic contributors to neurological diseases, a point I recently demonstrated through the discovery of patients with mutations in Pumilio1 (Cell, 2018).\n",

We investigate these functions in the monkey visual system, and combine behavioral and computational techniques with neurophysiological approaches such as reversible inactivation and single- and multi-neuron recording.A central question we address is how the brain endogenously decides how to allocate its resources. How do we decide when and to what to attend?  How do we decide which item to commit to memory or process in greater depth? Our working hypothesis is that such mental operations can be understood in a decision framework as processes that are geared toward specific goals - namely, to learn, reduce uncertainty or acquire information. Thus, we seek to understand how the brain actively controls its own information sampling strategies, and how this relates to the actions and reward structures in a task. We are investigating this process in the parietal and the frontal lobes, two key areas involved in attention control.  Future investigations will extend to other areas and neuromodulatory systems.\n",

            "The main focus of the laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms that generate the astounding diversity of cell types in a nervous system. Using the C.elegans model system, we have revealed a core regulatory logic for how terminal neuronal identity is controlled in several different neuron types. We have demonstrated that these regulatory mechanisms are conserved in chordates. These insights have allowed us to reprogram the identity of heterologous cell types to that of specific neuron types. Venturing into a little explored area of neuronal diversification, we have developed a novel paradigm to study asymmetry across the left/right axis, by far the least understood axis in any nervous system, and identified a complex gene regulatory network that differentially controls terminal neuron identity across this axis.Aside from our main focus on neuronal development, we have also studied the molecular machinery with which the nervous system responds to the environment (i) to modulate behavior and (ii) to ensure that it maintains its functional and structural integrity.Employing new technologies that we developed, we continue to exploit the simplicity and experimental amenability of the worm to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the genetic programs that control the development of theC.elegansnervous system and we will continue to extend these insights to vertebrates.\n",

            "We study the cell and molecular biology of lung inflammation by real-time fluorescence imaging and multiple other approaches. Severe, rapidly progressing lung inflammation causes the disease called Acute Lung Injury (ALI), a debilitating condition in which there is breakdown of fluid barriers separating blood from the inhaled air, causing fluid accumulation in the lung’s airspaces. The resulting respiratory failure requires respiratory support by mechanical ventilators in critical care units. It is estimated that about 250,000 people suffer from ALI in the US alone, with a mortality rate of 20-25%. Patients who survive the disease continue to have a high rate of morbidity for many years. Despite these statistics, there is really no \"cure\" for ALI in the sense that one cannot administer an agent that reverses the illness or blocks its progress. The available therapy continues to be supportive in that the patient's physiological deterioration is kept in check. ​ Prime causes of ALI are infection and sepsis. According to the WHO, lower respiratory tract infections are the fifth largest cause of death in high-income countries and the third largest cause worldwide. Other causes include gastric acid aspiration, lung barotrauma, pulmonary embolism and smoke inhalation. These conditions can be replicated in animal models, providing a means to understand basic disease mechanisms and to develop products that might be therapeutically effective in the clinical setting. ​ Our ongoing projects include research in immunity, fluid barriers, barrier-enhancing biologics (we have patented one biologic), surfactant secretion, water secretion, micromechanics, stem cells and macrophages. In the last three years, our publications have appeared in high-impact journals, including the Journal of Clinical Investigation, Nature Communications, Nature Medicine and Nature. Despite the competitive times for federally supported research funding, we expect our research to grow considerably in the near future.

            "We are currently interested in three broad research areas:1) Mechanisms underlying the tissue specificity of cancer-associated chromatin abnormality:In contrast to tissue- and sequence-specific transcription factors, chromatin regulators are ubiquitously expressed and often target hundreds of genes. Paradoxically, cancer-associated mutations in chromatin regulators exhibit a high degree of tissue specificity. We are interested to address why/how does the broad activity of chromatin regulator produce pathway-specific effect. To this end, we are using novel epigenome-editing tools to discern the 'driver' vs. 'passenger' downstream targets following global chromatin perturbation.2) Response and resistance mechanisms to chromatin-targeted drugs:Chromatin regulators have emerged as popular drug targets in oncology and other human diseases and a number of epigenetic drugs are FDA-approved or in clinical development to treat cancer. However, little is known about the potential mechanisms and biomarkers that predict the response or resistance to these drugs. We plan to employ Crispr/Cas9-mediated genomic screening approaches to systematically study the mechanism of action underlying cancer epigenetic drugs.3) Novel tools to study chromatin functionality and dynamics:While traditional epigenomic profiling methods (eg. ChIP-seq) have greatly facilitated our understanding of chromatin organization, they provide largely correlative evidence and lack the ability to reveal functional and dynamic aspects of chromatin modifications. We are interested in developing new tools that allow us to study chromatin in high-resolution and in real-time.For more information, please visit ourlab website.\n",

            "The nervous system is unique and remarkable in the complexity of the precise interconnections among its component cells. The human brain is composed of roughly ten billion neurons, each of which can participate in thousands of connections. Thus, the genetically-directed assembly of the nervous system involves formation of about 1013 specific interconnections between neurons. Implementation of this extraordinarily precise program depends on the controlled spatial and temporal expression of selective adhesion molecules on neural cell surfaces. Although the full complement of proteins responsible for specific adhesion in the nervous system remains unclear, many families of neural adhesion molecules have been identified and studied in detail. Our focus is on structural studies of neural adhesion molecules to reveal the molecular basis of their function and atomic-level details of their binding specificity.Much of our efforts are focused on the cadherins, a large family of cell surface proteins that mediate adhesive binding between cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Crystal Structures of cadherins show that binding interactions form only between the N-terminal domains of the extracellular regions. The idea that these domains encode cadherin cell adhesive specificity has been verified by structre-based mutagenesis experiments. There are several subfamilies of cadherins expressed in the nervous system, including type I, type II, and protocadherins. The sorting of motor neuron pools is dependent on the unique distributions of type II cadherins expressed by the cells of each motor neuron pool.Our long-term goal is to determine the atomic-level basis for specific adhesion in a variety of neural systems.\n",

Our work on Hox proteins centers around two questions: 1) how these homeodomain-containing transcription factors achieve specificityin vivoand 2) what are the relevant target genes that these factors regulate to control morphogenesis? To answer these questions, we are using a variety of in vitro DNA binding assays, structural biology,invivoreporter gene assays, and genome-wide methods to discover and validate Hox target genes and Hox binding sites. Genetic methods are used to analyze the function of putative target genes and their specific contributions to morphology. Our work on appendage development focuses on two questions: 1) how is positional information generated along the proximo-distal (PD) axis and 2) how is cell proliferation regulated and coordinated with cell differentiation? To answer the first question, our main approach is to dissect at high resolution the transcriptional responses of genes expressed at specific positions along the PD axis, primarily in the legs. To answer the second question, we are identifying the genes and pathways that selector genes regulate to modulate cell proliferation during appendage development. Our work on the adult motor system stems from our work on leg development. Here, we are studying how the motor neurons that innervate the adult leg are generated and specified to target the correct muscles and generate the correct dendritic pattern in the CNS. Using this information, we are beginning to study how the movement of the legs is coordinated by local interneurons and sensory feedback. Locomotion assays to study adult walking behavior are used to analyze the wild type circuitry and the consequences to when this circuit is perturbed.Up to date information on the Mann lab can be found athttps://mannlab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/\n",

We focus on how ion channels and synaptic transmission regulate information flow in the cortico-hippocampal circuit, which plays a critical role in learning and memory. One area of research explores the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (the HCN channels) in regulating dendritic integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. We found that genetic deletion of the HCN1 channel from hippocampus enhances synaptic excitation, the induction of long-term plasticity and, surprisingly, spatial learning and memory. As these channels have also been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric diseases, we are now examining the molecular mechanisms that regulate HCN1 channel expression and trafficking in both normal and disease states. A second project examines the role of the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus, an area first identified in 1934 but which has received little attention over the past 80 years. We have developed a mouse like that enables us to selectively inactivate CA2, which we find produces a very specific deficit in the encoding of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember a conspecific. We are now examining the CA2 neural circuitry in more detail to determine how this region participates in memory encoding. As data from individuals with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders suggest the presence of alterations in the CA2 region, we are using mouse models of neuropsychiatric disease to explore the possible role of altered CA2 function in the social endophenotypes of these disorders.\n",

First, the functional circuitry of cerebellum-like structures is relatively simple and well characterized.  Second, a plausible systems level function for cerebellum-like structures has been identified.In vivo studies conducted in several phylogenetically distinct groups of fish have shown that cerebellum-like circuits act as an adaptive filter—learning and removing predictable features of the sensory input, for example those due to the animal's own behavior.  Adaptive filtering allows unpredictable and thus behaviorally relevant features of the sensory input to be processed more easily.  A combination of experimental and modeling studies have led to a hypothesis regarding how this adaptive filtering is implemented in cerebellum-like circuits.  Key ingredients include: (1) principal neurons that integrate peripheral electrosensory input with a diverse array of sensory and motor information conveyed by parallel fibers and (2) anti-Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity at parallel fiber synapses onto principal cells.  One goal of research in the lab is to deepen and extend our understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying the generation and use of sensory predictions in the electrosensory lobe of weakly electric mormyrid fish.Predicting sensory events is of general importance both for sensory processing and motor control.  Intriguingly, several lines of evidence suggest that the mammalian cerebellum itself is involved in generating such predictions.  A second focus of our research is to extend studies of sensory predictions in fish to other cerebellum-like structures and to the cerebellum itself.  Initial studies will include tests of the adaptive filter hypothesis in the mammalian dorsal cochlear nucleus and investigations of regions of the mormyrid cerebellum closely associated with electrosensory processing.\n",

In vivo research across various phylogenetically diverse fish groups has revealed that cerebellum-like circuits serve as adaptive filters—learning to disregard predictable aspects of sensory input, such as those arising from the animal's own actions. This adaptive filtering enables more efficient processing of unpredictable, behaviorally significant sensory inputs. Through a blend of experimental and modeling approaches, we have developed a hypothesis concerning the mechanisms by which this adaptive filtering occurs within cerebellum-like circuits. Essential components of this process include: (1) principal neurons that combine peripheral electrosensory input with a wide range of sensory and motor information relayed via parallel fibers, and (2) anti-Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity at the synapses from parallel fibers to principal cells. One of our lab’s key goals is to deepen and broaden our understanding of the cellular and circuit dynamics that underlie the creation and utilization of sensory predictions in the electrosensory lobe of weakly electric mormyrid fish. The capacity to predict sensory events is crucial for both sensory processing and motor control. Notably, there is compelling evidence indicating that the mammalian cerebellum may also play a role in generating such predictions. A secondary focus of our research is to expand the study of sensory predictions in fish to other cerebellum-like structures and the cerebellum itself. Preliminary investigations will involve examining the adaptive filter hypothesis in the mammalian dorsal cochlear nucleus, as well as studying regions of the mormyrid cerebellum that are closely linked to electrosensory processing.\n",

Of the accessory proteins, β subunits (CaVβ) are arguably the most important, being necessary for targeting the channel to the membrane and normalizing channel gating (the manner in which the channel opens and closes). Their essential role is emphasized by the severe neurological and cardiovascular phenotypes ensuing from CaVβ dysregulation: epilepsy, altered threshold to pain, night blindness, and defects in cardiac development.  We aim to understand: (1) at a quantitative level the mechanisms by which CaVβs exert such powerful effects on CaV channels; (2) the role of the α1-β interaction in disease; and (3) the potential of the α1-β association as a target for therapeutic drugs.  A powerful complement of approaches is used including: whole-cell and single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) determination of protein-protein interactions, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and modeling.Design of Novel Genetically-Encoded CaV Channel InhibitorsBlockade of CaV channels is a therapeutic strategy for an impressive array of cardiovascular and neurological diseases including: angina, hypertension, stroke, migraines, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy.  In the quest for more effective and selective CaV channel blockers, the CaV channel a1-b subunit interaction is recognized as a promising locus, although attempts to target this site in the past have met with only limited success.  It was recently discovered that the Rem/Rad/Gem/Kir (RGK) sub-family of Ras-like GTPases potently inhibit CaV channels by interaction with CaVb subunits.  How do these ‘natural genetically-encoded CaV channel blockers’ work?  Can we learn from Nature’s design to create a new generation of custom CaV channel blockers?  We are taking cues from this remarkable protein family to create useful new genetically encoded CaV channel blockers for various customized applications.Reverse Engineering CaV Channels in Heart and NeuronsCaV channels are central to biological function in heart and nerve cells, being necessary for generating the heartbeat, nerve cell communications, and regulation of gene expression.  In the complicated cellular environment of heart cells and neurons, the mechanistic bases of CaV channel functions are often obscure, akin to a biological ‘black box’.  To elucidate mysterious aspects of CaV channel behavior in such native cells we employ a reverse engineering approach where viral-mediated gene delivery permits selective genetic manipulation of CaV channel properties in heart and neuronal cells.  Questions we are interested in addressing include: How are different CaV channels targeted to spatially distinct sites in heart and neurons?  What mechanisms underlie CaV channel regulation by messenger molecules in heart and neurons?  To address these, we combine viral-mediated gene delivery, quantitative confocal imaging, and electrophysiological approaches.\n",

            "Our lab is interested in cortical mechanisms of visual processing. We have two broad areas of research – understanding task-related anticipation in visual cortex, and analyzing the cortical basis of visual form processing. We are also actively involved in developing new recording and analysis techniques for these two research directions.Task-Related Anticipation in Visual CortexBy using a novel optical imaging technique developed by us for use in alert behaving monkeys, we recently discovered a robust anticipatory hemodynamic signal in primary visual cortex (V1). This signal is independent of visual stimulation or local neuronal activity. Given any regular, predictable visual task, this signal appears timed to bring fresh arterial blood to V1 in anticipation of the task onset. Our finding poses a serious challenge to the current understanding of fMRI which assumes that hemodynamic signals are uniformly predicted by underlying neural activity. It also likely indicates a novel task-related arousal mechanism in the brain – probably driven by distal neuromodulatory input – that prepares relevant cortical areas for upcoming task demands by bringing in fresh arterial blood in anticipation. A major focus of our lab, currently, is in understanding the neural basis and functional consequences of this signal. We are doing so with optical imaging and electrophysiology both in the alert monkey, and in an alert rat preparation that we are in the process of setting up.Cortical Basis of Visual Form ProcessingIt is now appreciated that even V1 has the sophisticated neural machinery to process reasonably complex visual items such as smooth contours, textures and surfaces. This is mediated through geometrically precise long-range connections within V1, combined with feedback from higher visual areas. Using optical imaging in alert monkey we find that the imaged response to a chain of short lines is suppressed relative to the linear sum of responses to individual lines, in a manner that is tuned for smoothness and collinearity; fMRI responses in human V1 are closely analogous. Similarly, illusory contours evoke robust imaging signals in monkey V1; linear discriminant analysis and fMRI shows an analogous response in humans. Combining human studies where we can ask our subjects complex perceptual questions with monkey optical imaging where we can carry out more invasive electrophysiology gives us a powerful tool to explore the cortical basis of early visual processing.Developing New Brain Imaging and Analysis TechniquesTo pursue any question in neuroscience I believe it is very important to be able to develop new techniques as and when the question demands it. Our discovery of the anticipatory hemodynamic signal in V1 came about only because we had developed a dual-wavelength imaging technique that images cortical blood volume and oxygenation simultaneously with electrode recordings in the alert monkey. This allowed us to circumvent the limitations of neuoimaging signals such as fMRI that cannot disambiguate changes in blood volume from oxygenation. We are currently developing a flavoprotein imaging system to visualize neural activity at a spatial scale appropriate for studying visual processing. We are also developing imaging in the alert rodent, including two-photon imaging, to understand the neural basis of task-related anticipation.\n",

This processing is facilitated by geometrically precise long-range connections within V1 alongside feedback from higher visual areas. Our imaging studies in alert monkeys reveal that the response to a series of short lines is suppressed compared to the linear combination of responses to individual lines, with sensitivity to factors like smoothness and collinearity; analogous fMRI responses are observed in humans. Similarly, robust imaging signals arise in monkey V1 in response to illusory contours, with linear discriminant analysis and fMRI demonstrating comparable reactions in humans. By integrating human studies that allow us to pose complex perceptual questions with monkey optical imaging, where more invasive electrophysiological techniques can be employed, we gain invaluable insights into the cortical foundations of early visual processing.\n",

            "The brain’s complexity is apparent from the incredible diversity in its cell types. To form the functional circuitry necessary to achieve sophisticated cognitive and motor functions, neural progenitors must make each type of neural cell at the right place and time and also in the correct proportions. The major goal of my lab is to understand the origin of this cellular diversity in the brain and the logic by which it is generated in such a highly organized manner.A relatively small pool of neural progenitors generates diverse cell types sequentially by responding to changes in cell intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Over time, they lose the ability, or “competence,” to make cell types born at earlier stages and gain competence to make cell types born at later stages. How competence is regulated during development is poorly understood, but has important implications in our basic understanding of brain development, origin of neurodevelopmental disorders, and how we can harness stem cells for brain repair.The Drosophila Neuroblast systemTheDrosophilaembryo provides an ideal model to study neural progenitor competencein vivo: there are only ~30 neuroblasts, the fly neural progenitors, in the embryonic nerve cord, and each gives rise to a unique lineage of neurons and glia in an invariant birth order. One of the amazing features of neuroblasts is that each neuroblast and its progeny can be individually identified and tracked over timein vivo. This allows us to reproducibly find the same single progenitor between animals and across development. Critically, the set of transcription factors that specify fate of the neural progeny based on birth order, called “temporal identity factors,” is known and can be exploited to test the neuroblasts’ competence to produce each type of neuron over development.Mechansisms of neuroblast competence restrictionUsing a combination of genetics and DNA FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization), we recently discovered that neuroblasts undergo a developmentally-timed reorganization of their genome that physically relocates genes within the nucleus (Kohwi et al.,Cell2013). Genes harbor specific positions relative to various functional compartments within nuclei that can affect whether they can be turned on or off. We discovered that such gene repositioning occurs in neuroblasts in a highly regulated manner, and consequently, determines whether a specific neural cell type can be made at a specific developmental stage. Thus, this restructuring of nuclear architecture appears to regulate the neuroblasts’ competence state (Kohwi and Doe,Nature Rev Neurosci2013). Current projects focus on understanding how the timing of genome reorganization in neuroblasts is controlled, investigating how the reorganization affects neuroblast output, and translating our findings in the fruit fly to the mouse model system.(photo credit: Barbara Alper/Columbia University)\n",

We found that this gene repositioning in neuroblasts occurs in a tightly regulated manner and plays a crucial role in determining whether a particular neural cell type can be generated at a specific developmental stage.

            "Stem Cells in the KidneyStem cells are characterized by low cycling time and a standard procedure in the field is to apply BrdU in a short pulse to an animal and to follow it by a long term chase. Cells that retain the label (Label-retaining cells or LRCs) are considered to be stem cells. We found that in the adult kidney, these stem cells are concentrated in the papilla and located mostly outside the renal tubule. When the kidneys were subjected to unilateral ischemia followed by re-perfusion, we found that these LRCs migrated out of their niche in the papilla and started to rapidly divide. Purification of these cells led to identification of a gene that is expressed in them but in no other cell in the kidney. To provide definitive evidence for the existence of stem we need to produce a “lineage marker”. We generated a mouse that expresses the Cre recombinase (Cre:ERT2) under a control of its promoter and bred this mouse to a reporter strain such that these cells express a fluorescent protein but only when a drug (tamoxifen) induces the Cre expression. We found that these marked cells exist in the papilla as clusters of cells but are present as single cells in every nephron segment. Ischemic injury led to proliferation and migration of these cells to the site of injury followed by incorporation into the injured nephron segments. Thus these cells are bona fide stem cells of the adult kidney. Response of the Kidney to AcidosisOver the past two decades we have shown that the collecting tubule of the nephron contains two types of intercalated cells, α-intercalated cells secrete acid while β-intercalated cells secrete HCO3. We have shown that the β-IC converts to the α-IC form when the animal is fed an acid diet. We showed that this conversion is a process of differentiation induced by the deposition of an extracellular matrix protein called hensin/DMBT1. Deletion of hensin results in a complete blockade of the conversion. We recently discovered that the proximate signal by which the cell senses a change in extracellular pH is secretion of the chemokine SDF1. We are presently investigating the mechanism by which SDF1 and its receptor CXCR4 mediate this effect. Branching Morphogenesis during kidney developmentThe kidneys develop when an epithelial outgrowth of the Wolffian duct (the ureteric bud) invades the metanephric mesenchyme causing it to convert to the epithelial nephron. The epithelia then send signals that induce another round of branching. Hence, the branches of the tree eventually determine the number of nephrons. We began a new project in which we are attempting to map the entire branching tree during kidney development and to identify the entire map of the branching tree and we are studying the effect of specific gene deletions on the pattern of branching.

In experiments involving unilateral ischemia followed by reperfusion, we observed that these LRCs migrated from their papillary niche and began to proliferate rapidly. Upon isolating these cells, we discovered a gene specifically expressed in them that is absent in other kidney cells. To definitively demonstrate the presence of stem cells, we needed to create a \"lineage marker.\" We engineered a mouse model expressing the Cre recombinase (Cre:ERT2) controlled by its promoter, which was then bred with a reporter strain that fluoresces upon Cre expression induced by tamoxifen.

There is an almost implicit requirement for unique neuronal mechanisms for maintaining proteostasis. We discovered a new mechanism of protein degradation, which we term the “neuroproteasome”. In essence, we made a fascinating observation that proteasomes in excitatory neurons are localized to the neuronal plasma membrane, degrading substrates co-translationally during states of elevated neuronal activity. This is not only as a new system of protein degradation, but this degradation generates a large set of 4-18aa extracellular peptides which can act as neuromodulators and directly influence the activity of other cells in the brain. Our findings controvert dogma in three waysProteasomes have historically considered to be intracellular complexes. The neuroproteasome is the first description of a plasma-membrane-bound and functionally transmembrane complex.Ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases have historically been the primary mechanisms to specify which substrates get turned over. Neuroproteasome-mediated degradation is ubiquitin-independent, which begs the question how substrates are selected for co-translational degradation.The resulting products of degradation have historically thought to be immediately broken down into constituent amino acids. Neuroproteasome-derived peptides are released into the extracellular space, where they act as a new mechanism of signaling through yet-to-be-identified receptors, establishing new receptor-ligand relationships in the brain.My laboratory seeks to establish a new field in molecular neuroscience by revealing the mechanisms underlying neuroproteasome-mediated protein degradation and the functions of the new mechanism of signaling through neuroproteasome-mediated peptides.

This discovery introduces a new protein degradation system that releases a substantial range of 4-18 amino acid extracellular peptides, which may serve as neuromodulators and directly affect the activity of other brain cells. Our results challenge conventional thinking in three significant ways: First, proteasomes have traditionally been viewed as intracellular entities, whereas the neuroproteasome is the first to be described as a plasma membrane-associated and functionally transmembrane complex. Second, the mechanisms of substrate specificity have largely revolved around ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases, but neuroproteasome-mediated degradation occurs independently of ubiquitin, raising questions about how substrates are chosen for this co-translational degradation. Lastly, while degradation products have typically been thought to be quickly broken down into individual amino acids, our findings reveal that neuroproteasome-generated peptides are released into the extracellular space, potentially functioning as a new signaling mechanism through yet-to-be-discovered receptors, indicating novel receptor-ligand interactions in the brain. \n",

            "The diversity and specificity of the adaptive immune system is achieved through somatic assembly and subsequent modification of antigen receptor genes in developing lymphocytes. Specifically, functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes are assembled from germline variable, diversity and joining gene fragments through V(D)J recombination. In peripheral lymphoid organs, the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is further modified through class switch recombination to achieve different effector functions. While V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination are initiated by a lymphocyte-specific cleavage mechanism, the repair of DNA double-strand break intermediates is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed non-homologous end-joining pathway. Moreover, like other DNA damage events, physiological DNA breaks activate DNA damage responses to enforce cell cycle arrest and achieve efficient and precise repair. Not surprisingly, defects in the DNA repair pathways can block lymphocyte development, leading to congenital primary immunodeficiency. Reducing the fidelity of DNA repair increases the risk of chromosomal translocations that can cause leukemia and lymphoma. The clinical treatment of human lymphomas and leukemias often induces additional DNA damage, which needs to be repaired by the non-homologous end-joining pathway with the help of DNA damage response factors. Therefore, elucidating the cellular pathways that mediate DNA repair, understanding their molecular mechanisms of action, and evaluating theirin vivofunctions in animal models will yield critical information for the clinical management of both immunodeficiencies and lymphoid malignancies.\n",

Functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes are formed by combining germline variable, diversity, and joining gene segments via V(D)J recombination. In the peripheral lymphoid organs, the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene undergoes further modification through class switch recombination to fulfill various effector functions. Both V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination utilize a lymphocyte-specific cleavage process, while the repair of DNA double-strand breaks is handled by the widely expressed non-homologous end-joining pathway. Additionally, similar to other instances of DNA damage, physiological DNA breaks trigger DNA damage responses that enforce cell cycle arrest and facilitate effective repair. Consequently, any flaws in DNA repair mechanisms can hinder lymphocyte development, resulting in congenital primary immunodeficiencies. Lowering the precision of DNA repair can increase the likelihood of chromosomal translocations, which may lead to leukemia and lymphoma. Clinical treatments for human lymphomas and leukemias often result in further DNA damage, necessitating repair through the non-homologous end-joining pathway, assisted by DNA damage response factors.

Our lab is interested in how neurons acquire their type-specific morphology and organization and how this organization underlies circuit function. To approach this problem, we use molecular, genetic, anatomical, and behavioral approaches to identify the mechanisms that sculpt somatosensory circuits during development.Using the fruit flyDrosophilawe can dissect the mechanisms of nervous system patterning and function with cell type specificity. For example we identified the mechanisms that allow branches from the same cell to spread from each other to cover their appropriate territory, a basic feature of most or all neuronal arbors. This process of “self-avoidance” is controlled by the highly diversified homophilic immunoglobulin superfamily member Dscam1. We also showed that repulsion is also enforced by integrin receptors for the extracellular matrix.Current interests in the lab include 1) identification of interneuron populations that transmit somatosensory information and the contribution of these neurons to behavior (see Burgos et al., 2018), 2) the mechanisms that underlie specific connectivity between primary sensory neurons and target interneurons, 3) cell-extrinsic cues that mediate targeting and morphogenesis of both dendrites and axons, and 4) imaging neuronal activity and behavior in intact Drosophila larvae to shed light on neural circuit function, in collaboration with the Hillman lab at the Zuckerman Institute (see Vaadia & Li, et al., 2019).\n",

To tackle these questions, we employ a combination of molecular, genetic, anatomical, and behavioral methods to uncover the mechanisms responsible for shaping somatosensory circuits during development. By utilizing the fruit fly, Drosophila, we can analyze the specific processes of nervous system patterning and functionality concerning different cell types. For instance, we have discovered the mechanisms that enable branches from the same neuron to separate and effectively cover their designated areas—a fundamental characteristic of most neuronal networks. This \"self-avoidance\" process is regulated by the highly varied homophilic immunoglobulin superfamily protein Dscam1. Additionally, we have demonstrated that integrin receptors for the extracellular matrix also play a role in enforcing this repulsion.

            "Our studies have led to the unexpected conclusion that a significant portion of the mammalian genome transcribes noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and that the RNA exosome, a component of the cellular ncRNA surveillance machinery, rapidly decays some of the ensuing ncRNAs. Two questions have arisen: is there a biological function of ncRNA decay of such large and unprecedented nature, and what are the pathophysiological consequences of failure of ncRNA decay? Using B-lymphocytes as a model system, our laboratory has pioneered studies demonstrating that surveillance and decay of the ncRNA transcriptome is an important mechanism for development and function of mammalian cells and when compromised, causes genomic instability, immune system dysregulation, and genetic alterations specific to cancer initiation.In normal conditions, RNA surveillance pathway components orchestrate programmed immunoglobulin locus recombination by facilitating access of the DNA mutator AID to single strand DNA sequences stripped of inhibitory ncRNAs. Thus, our study provides the first evidence that RNA-decay machinery can be specifically targeted to a particular region of the mammalian genome to facilitate a defined biological function.We discovered that when RNA surveillance pathways are suppressed by various genetic mutations, transcription associated DNA/RNA hybrids are not efficiently unwound leading to DNA mutagenesis and translocations. In pathophysiological conditions like in lymphomagenesis the RNA exosome subunit and cofactors are mutated; likewise, the developmental defects leading to Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia are caused by restricted ncRNA decay mediated by RNA exosome. Thus, our current studies highlight the relationship of RNA surveillance and transcription associated DNA mutagenesis in human diseases related to the immune and nervous systems.\n",

            "Our research has yielded the surprising finding that a considerable segment of the mammalian genome is involved in the transcription of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are rapidly degraded by the RNA exosome, a crucial element of the cellular ncRNA monitoring system. This raises two key questions: what is the biological significance of such extensive ncRNA decay, and what are the pathological implications if this decay process fails? Using B-lymphocytes as a model, our lab has been at the forefront of demonstrating that the monitoring and degradation of the ncRNA transcriptome are vital for the development and functioning of mammalian cells. When this process is disrupted, it can lead to genomic instability, immune dysfunction, and genetic changes that can initiate cancer. Under normal circumstances, components of the RNA surveillance pathway facilitate programmed recombination of the immunoglobulin locus, allowing the DNA mutator AID access to single-stranded DNA regions free of inhibiting ncRNAs. Our findings represent the first evidence that RNA decay mechanisms can be directed to specific genomic regions to support specific biological functions. We found that when RNA surveillance pathways are hindered by various genetic mutations, transcription-associated DNA/RNA hybrids are not effectively unwound, resulting in DNA mutations and translocations. In pathological cases, such as lymphomagenesis, mutations occur in the RNA exosome subunit and its cofactors; likewise, developmental disorders like Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia are linked to limited ncRNA degradation caused by RNA exosome malfunction. Therefore, our ongoing research illuminates the connection between RNA surveillance and transcription-associated DNA mutagenesis in human diseases affecting the immune and nervous systems.\n",
            "Our laboratory studies the molecular mechanisms by which class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit signals across biological membranes. Class C GPCRs mediate a number of key biological phenomena including excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, calcium homeostasis, and taste. These receptors are characterized by a large ligand-binding extracellular domain in addition to the canonical seven-helix transmembrane domain. Another unique feature of the class C receptors is that they require dimerization for function. We are investigating the structure and function of two class C GPCRs, human GABA(B) receptor and calcium-sensing (CaS) receptor. Our goal is to understand the ligand-dependent activation mechanism of these receptors.Human GABA(B) receptor mediates inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. It functions as an obligatory heterodimer of GBR1 and GBR2 subunits. We determined the extracellular-domain structures of GABA(B) receptor in three functional states: in the apo form, bound to six different antagonists, and bound to two different agonists. Our structures revealed the molecular mechanisms of orthosteric ligand recognition and showed that receptor activation involves the formation of a novel heterodimer interface between membrane proximal-domains of both subunits.We recently solved a near full-length structure of GABA(B) receptor, captured in the inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure revealed a novel heterodimer interface between the transmembrane (TM) helices 3 and 5 of both GABA(B) subunits. This interface embodies the signature of GABA(B) receptor’s inactive conformation. Furthermore, we identified a unique Â¢intersubunit latchÂ¢ motif within this TM interface that maintains the inactive state of the receptor. Its disruption through mutation results in constitutive receptor activity. We also discovered multiple ligands pre-associated with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids embedded within the TM domains to modulate receptor function and maintain receptor integrity.Human CaS receptor maintains extracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. We solved the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaS receptor in the resting and active conformations. We provided direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft, and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation.Using anomalous difference maps, we identified multiple novel binding sites for Ca(2+) that are located throughout the extracellular domain. Ca(2+) fulfills two functional roles. First, it maintains the structural integrity of CaS receptor. Second, it is directly involved in receptor activation as it facilitates the formation of a homodimer interface that is unique to the active state. Our results indicate that amino acids and Ca(2+) are co-agonists of CaS receptor, acting jointly to trigger receptor activation.Our structures revealed multiple binding sites for PO4(3-). PO4(3-) is also important for structural integrity of the receptor, but it inhibits receptor activity. Therefore, activation of CaS receptor involves an intricate interplay of amino acids, Ca(2+), and PO4(3-).\n",

            "Our understanding of how the biology of various diseases relates to the central dogma that DNA encodes RNA, which encodes protein has been buoyed by rapid technological advances in DNA and RNA sequencing and has led to some of the first advances in personalized medicine. However, characterization of the final and arguably most actionable element of the central dogma, protein, has lagged behind. Among the various proteomic parameters, a comprehensive description of the landscape of covalent protein modifications in any given cell is particularly challenging. Our research efforts are highly multidisciplinary, which have been largely focused on two programs, i.e., (1) novel protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and (2) novel covalent protein modifications by small molecule drugs. Regarding (1), the entire repertoire of protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is enormous, with ~400 different known types, and many more unknown ones (i.e., the “dark proteome”). PTMs are inaccessible by genomic sequencing tools. Instead, they are almost exclusively analyzed by proteomic technologies. The functional characterization of a PTM event ultimately depends on the unequivocal assignment of the modification site. However, the chemical natures of PTMs are diverse, and many types of PTMs are not amenable to traditional proteomic technologies for site-localization with single amino acid resolution because they are, for example, labile, heterogeneous or low-abundance. We have developed a multidisciplinary program (i.e., chemical biology, quantitative-/chemo-proteomics, computation biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and animal models) towards the functional analyses of a number of important PTMs, including protein tyrosine sulfation, phosphorylation and Poly-ADP-ribosylation. Regarding (2), besides these naturally occurring PTMs, covalent protein modification has been increasingly appreciated as a novel therapeutic modality. The current efforts on drug development have been mostly focused on targeting a small fraction of the human proteome with good pharmacological tractability (e.g., kinases). It has been estimated, however, that approximately 90% of human proteins (e.g., transcription factors, adaptors and intrinsically disordered proteins) have not been effectively targeted by small-molecule drugs, because, for example, they lack traditionally defined binding pockets. We have also been particularly active in the development of covalent protein modification and chemoproteomic technologies that potentially will revolutionize the principle of drug development by pushing the boundaries of the druggable proteome.\n",

            "Advancements in DNA and RNA sequencing technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the relationship between disease biology and the central dogma, which states that DNA encodes RNA, leading to protein synthesis. This progress has contributed to early developments in personalized medicine. However, the exploration of proteins—seen as the final and most influential component of the central dogma—has not kept pace. A key challenge is gaining a comprehensive understanding of covalent protein modifications within cells. Our research is highly interdisciplinary, focusing primarily on two key areas: (1) novel posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins and (2) new covalent protein modifications by small molecule drugs. In terms of (1), there is a vast array of known PTMs—around 400 different types—with many additional unidentified modifications referred to as the “dark proteome.” These modifications cannot be adequately investigated through genomic sequencing methods and are primarily analyzed using proteomic technologies. The ability to functionally characterize PTM events hinges on accurately identifying their modification sites; however, the diverse chemical nature of PTMs presents challenges, as many are difficult to analyze with standard proteomic techniques due to issues like instability, variability, or low abundance. Our multidisciplinary approach incorporates chemical biology, quantitative proteomics, computational biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and animal models to study vital PTMs, including protein tyrosine sulfation, phosphorylation, and Poly-ADP-ribosylation. Regarding (2), the exploration of covalent modifications of proteins has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Current drug development efforts predominantly target a small subset of the human proteome that is amenable to pharmacological interventions, such as kinases. However, it's estimated that nearly 90% of human proteins—including transcription factors, adaptors, and intrinsically disordered proteins—remain untapped by small-molecule drugs due to their lack of traditional binding sites.

This includes transcription factors that recruit enzymes to express genes as well as an evolving understanding of the 3-dimensional chromatin architecture which brings together either DNA enhancer regions to activate genes or DNA insulation regions to silence genes. Structural scaffold proteins such at CTCF and the cohesin complex are essential in maintaining the integrity of local DNA structural interactions within defined neighborhoods known as topologically associating domains (TADs).These proteins provide dynamic structure within the TAD which is essential in influencing dynamic cell-type specific transcriptional programs. Genes which contribute to transcriptional regulation, including members of the cohesin complex, are frequently mutated in human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (12-20%), glioblastoma multiforme (5%), bladder cancer (20-35%) and Ewing sarcoma (40-50%).The functional consequences of chromatin structure in regulating lineage-specification, signal-dependent responses, and local/distant DNA structure has not been fully elucidated, however, our recent work has established the requirement of suitable chromatin architecture for the function of cell-type specific transcription factors to activate gene responsible for blood formation bone marrow stem cell differentiation.Our laboratory uses genetic mouse models and primary patient samples to understand the role of altered chromatin architecture as a regulator of gene expression/gene silencing that maintain the balance of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal with differentiation and blood formation.\n",

            "Mounting an immune response is an energetically costly endeavor, with the potential to greatly impact host fitness. A cost-benefit relationship — between the collateral damage associated with an inflammatory response and the benefit of inflammation in protecting the host from infection — imparts a selective pressure that ensures the magnitude of a response is proportional to the potential threat encountered. To achieve homeostasis, the immune system must balance pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to neutralize invading pathogens while limiting or preventing damage to surrounding tissue. At mucosal barriers — which are colonized by diverse communities of commensal microbes and serve to interface the internal physiology of an organism with the ever-changing external environment — fine-tuning opposing immune responses is of even greater relevance. Constant exposure to novel environmental antigens and high concentrations of microbial ligands that can activate innate immune receptors increase the risk for persistent inflammatory activation. As a result, complex immune networks operate to contextualize diverse microbial and environmental stimuli. These inputs subsequently shape mucosal immune responses and synergize to preserve mucosal barrier integrity and function. Consequently, aberrant immune responses, due to a breakdown in tolerance or defects in barrier maintenance, largely underlie the etiology of chronic mucosal inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n",

            "Initiating an immune response is a demanding process that can significantly affect the host's fitness. There exists a cost-benefit dynamic between the collateral damage caused by an inflammatory response and the protective benefits it provides against infections. This dynamic imposes selective pressures that ensure the intensity of the immune response aligns with the level of threat faced. To maintain homeostasis, the immune system must strike a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, effectively neutralizing pathogens while minimizing harm to surrounding tissues. This balancing act is particularly critical at mucosal barriers, which harbor diverse communities of beneficial microbes and link the organism's internal functions with an ever-changing external environment. The constant exposure to new environmental antigens and high levels of microbial ligands—capable of activating innate immune receptors—heightens the risk of ongoing inflammatory activation. Consequently, sophisticated immune networks are established to interpret various microbial and environmental signals, which in turn influence mucosal immune responses and work together to maintain the integrity and functionality of mucosal barriers. As a result, disruptions in immune responses due to failures in tolerance or barrier maintenance are significant contributors to the development of chronic mucosal inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\n",

Current work aims to investigate transcriptional regulators and guidance mechanisms for the contralateral projection, and mechanisms of growth cone interactions with cells of the chiasm midline.We have recently addressed whether the programs of gene expression that direct retinal axon decussation at the optic chiasm are relevant to the formation of connections of retinal axons in their first target, the lateral geniculate nucleus. We now aim to identify molecular regulators of axon-targeting and retinal ganglion cell axon arbor morphogenesis, and to analyze the interplay of molecular factors and neural activity in the targeting and refinement of eye-specific projections.A genetic model for these studies is the albino.

            "The focus of Dr. Kass' research program is the structure and function of ion channels that are expressed primarily in the heart. Dr. Kass has directed NIH and/or NSF sponsored research for forty-two years that has contributed to our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular basis of cardiac electrical activity through a multidisciplinary approach bridging basic biophysical and clinical science. Contributions from this work include the cellular basis of calcium-dependent arrhythmogenic activity in the heart, basic mechanisms of action of calcium channel blocking drugs, and the molecular events underlying the control of the duration of electrical events in the heart during sympathetic nerve stimulation. His laboratory has focused on understanding the molecular physiology and pharmacology of congenital arrhythmias. These arrhythmias are caused by inherited mutations in genes coding for ion channels and/or ion channel related proteins expressed in the heart. This work has contributed to an understanding of gene-specific risk factors caused by mutation-induced changes in heart ion channel activity, and to the development of a mutation-specific approach to manage these disorders. The mutation-specific therapeutic strategy, verified in genotyped patients, has established the principle that two variants of the same genetic disorder require dramatically different therapeutic strategies for disease management based on biophysical properties of specific genetic lesions. This approach has evolved from close collaborations with clinical colleagues in which information is shared from clinic to basic laboratory and back to clinic. Additional studies are aimed at unraveling the structural basis of mutation-induced, and potentially lethal, disease phenotypes using approaches such as voltage-clamp fluorometry to directly measure movement of gating machinery in the ion channel of interest as well as biochemical methods of directly probing structures of region of ion channels that are hotspots for disease-causing mutations and the use of computer-based modeling to understand both structure and functional consequences of these mutations. Work has additionally more recently focused on potassium ion channel mutations that underlie a form of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension. This work has provided information not only of novel pathways that contribute to this disease, but also to new routes of therapeutic management of this disorder. The goal of this approach is to unmask new and specific targets for the development of anti-arrhythmic drugs. Currently, work in the laboratory focused on the study of mechanisms underlying heritable arrhythmias in the context of complex genetic backgrounds has studied the cellular electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes differentiated from inducible pluripotent stem cells derived from family members of patients harboring disease-causing mutations. This approach has offered opportunities to screen drugs for effective disease management when multiple genes may be involved in the disease phenotype.\n",

The development of this method has been facilitated by strong collaborations with clinical colleagues, allowing for the exchange of findings between clinical settings and basic research. Additional studies aim to reveal the structural basis for mutation-induced, potentially severe disease traits, using techniques like voltage-clamp fluorometry to measure gating movements in targeted ion channels, biochemical probing of disease-related mutation hotspots, and computational modeling to comprehend the structural and functional effects of these mutations.

Our analysis of the patterns of expression of the odorant receptor genes, coupled with earlier electrophysiologic experiments have provided a logic for olfactory discrimination. Individual olfactory sensory neurons express only one of a thousand receptor genes. Neurons expressing a given receptor, although randomly distributed in domains in the epithelium, project their axons to a small number of topographically fixed loci or glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. These data support a model of olfactory coding in which discrimination of odor quality would result from the detection of specific spatial patterns of activity in the olfactory bulb.\n",

By analyzing the patterns in the expression of odorant receptor genes and incorporating previous electrophysiological studies, we have developed a framework that explains how olfactory discrimination occurs. Each olfactory sensory neuron is dedicated to expressing just one of the approximately 1,000 receptor genes. Although the neurons that express the same receptor are randomly located in various areas of the olfactory epithelium, they send their axons to a limited number of fixed locations, known as glomeruli, in the olfactory bulb. This evidence supports a model of olfactory coding where the differentiation of odor quality arises from recognizing distinct spatial activity patterns within the olfactory bulb.\n",

            "A fundamental capacity of the mammalian cerebral cortex is to process information in a form conducive to encoding, storage and  retrieval of memories. A general organizational principle of cortical mnemonic circuits states that these steps all require a precisely orchestrated spatio-temporal interaction among a large number of relatively uniform excitatory and a numerically fewer but richly diverse population of inhibitory and neuromodulatory circuit elements. However,  a mechanistic understanding of how these circuit motifs interact during elementary steps of memory processing is lacking. Our general hypothesis is that single neurons perform complex computations by exploiting their multilayered and compartmentalized dendritic arborization. Specifically, we hypothesize that, (1) neuronal dendritic arbor constitutes a backbone for both compartmentalized input integration and plasticity, and (2) dynamic interactions between synaptic and intrinsic forms of neuronal plasticity can expand neuron’s capability to detect, store and recall various features of information.To test these predictions, we use a variety of techniques: direct electrophysiological recordings from various compartments of neurons, simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from multiple neurons, together with two-photon imaging/photoactivation and optogenetics.A major focus of our lab will be to understand how dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs in different subcellular domains fundamentally enhance information processing and storage capabilities of single and small networks of neurons in the hippocampal circuitAnother aspect of our work will focus on testing the prediction that intrinsic and synaptic forms of neuronal plasticity bidirectionally interact within dendritic compartments. We also aim to reveal exact mechanisms how these different forms of neuronal plasticity are affected by inhibition and neuromodulation.The long-term goal of our laboratory is to establish causal links between single cell computations and behavior.\n",

            "The mammalian cerebral cortex possesses a crucial ability to manage information in a manner that supports the encoding, storage, and retrieval of memories. A key organizational principle of cortical memory circuits posits that these processes rely on well-coordinated spatial and temporal interactions among a large number of similar excitatory elements and a smaller but more varied array of inhibitory and neuromodulatory components. However, there is insufficient mechanistic insight into how these circuit patterns function during the basic phases of memory processing. We propose that individual neurons execute complex computations by leveraging their layered and compartmentalized dendritic structures. Specifically, we suggest that (1) the dendritic tree of neurons serves as a foundation for both compartmentalized input integration and plastic adaptation, and (2) the interplay between synaptic and intrinsic neuronal plasticity can enhance a neuron's ability to detect, store, and recall diverse information features. To investigate these hypotheses, we employ various methodologies, including direct electrophysiological recordings from different neuronal compartments, simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from multiple neurons, alongside two-photon imaging/photoactivation and optogenetics. A primary focus of our lab will be to explore how dynamic interactions among excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs across various subcellular regions significantly improve the information processing and storage abilities of both individual neurons and small neuronal networks within the hippocampal circuit. Additionally, we will examine the interaction between intrinsic and synaptic forms of neuronal plasticity within dendritic compartments. We aim to uncover the specific mechanisms through which these different types of plasticity are influenced by inhibition and neuromodulation. Ultimately, our laboratory's long-term objective is to establish clear causal relationships between single-cell computations and behavioral outcomes.\n",

            "A challenge in understanding the brain lies in going beyond descriptions of single brain areas to studying how multiple areas interact within a network to produce emergent behaviors. In the cerebral cortex, these network interactions are thought to be mediated by bidirectional connections between cortical areas. However, despite anatomical evidence of strongly recurrent network connectivity in cortex, the functional role of recurrent cortical processing is not well understood. The goal of the lab is to elucidate the computational purpose of the recurrent network architecture of cortex.Using vision as a model system, the lab studies how recurrent processing supports our ability to visually recognize objects, a computationally challenging task at which humans excel. Bidirectional connections between the hierarchically arranged stages of visual cortex could serve at least two fundamental computational purposes: they may dynamically modify neural activity in a process of online visual inference (Bayesian inference) between cortical stages, and they may provide top-down signals for driving learning (error backpropagation) across the cortical hierarchy. To explore these hypotheses, experiments measure the content and downstream impact of messages passed across the network during object recognition and learning.Our experimental platform, centered around the common marmoset, will use advanced tools such as cellular imaging and targeted optogenetics to examine the neural subpopulations involved in transmission of information between high-level visual cortical areas.

            "My lab's interests focus on understanding the cerebral cortex. We use theoretical and computational methods to unravel the circuitry of the cerebral cortex, the rules by which this circuitry develops or \"self-organizes\", and the computational functions of this circuitry. Our guiding hypothesis — motivated by the stereotypical nature of cortical circuitry across sensory modalities — is that there are fundamental computations done by the circuits of sensory cortex that are invariant across highly varying input signals. This commonality is likely to extend in important ways to motor and \"higher-order\" cortex as well, although these structures show more prominent circuit differences with sensory cortex, consistent with their role in producing internally generated activity as well as in integrating their inputs. In some way that does not strongly depend on the specific content of the input, cortical circuits extract invariant structures from their input and learn to represent these structures in an associative, relational manner. We (and many others) believe the atomic element underlying these computations is likely to be found in the computations done by a roughly 1mm-square chunk of the cortical circuit. To understand this element, we have focused on one of the best-studied cortical systems, primary visual cortex, and also have interest in any cortical system in which the data gives us a foothold (such as rodent whisker barrel cortex, studied here at Columbia by Randy Bruno, and monkey area LIP, studied here by Mickey Goldberg and Jackie Gottlieb).The function of this element depends both on its mature pattern of circuitry and on the developmental and learning rules by which this circuitry is shaped by the very inputs that it processes. Thus we focus both on understanding how the mature circuitry creates cortical response properties  and on how this circuitry is shaped by input activity during development and learning.  We also use theoretical methods to analyze sensory cortical data to infer functional properties.\n",

This shared characteristic may also be applicable to motor and \"higher-order\" cortices, although these areas exhibit more distinct circuit differences from the sensory cortex, aligning with their functions in generating internal activities and integrating diverse inputs. Cortical circuits are thought to extract stable structures from their inputs and learn to represent these structures in an associative and relational way, independent of the specific details of the input. We, along with other researchers, believe that the fundamental unit of these computations can be identified within approximately a 1mm-square segment of the cortical circuit.

The long term goal is to uncover the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases and to suggest novel and adapted therapies for them. Along these lines we are studying the function of bone as an endocrine organ regulating glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis and examining the role of osteoblasts in hematopoiesis with particular emphasis in myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ​ Bone as an endocrine organOsteoblasts, the bone forming cells, have been shown previously to influence glucose metabolism through the secretion of a bone-specific hormone, osteocalcin. We found that the activity of osteocalcin is regulated transcriptionally by osteoblast-expressed FoxO1. These findings raised for us the question of the nature of the osteoblast as an endocrine cell, and more specifically whether it secretes other hormones regulating any aspect of energy metabolism. Using a genetic approach to this problem we identified a second osteoblast-specific hormone that affects glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. We are currently expanding this work, searching for its receptor and for other functions and mechanisms of action exerted by this hormone. ​ Detecting Interactions between Osteoblasts and Leukemia BlastsIn current work, our lab has discovered a function of the skeleton, as an inducer of leukemogenesis. We identified a mutation in the osteoblast that disrupts hematopoiesis leading to leukemogenic transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and establishment of MDS progressing to AML. The same mutation and signaling pathway were identified in more than a third of patients with MDS and AML. We have also found that osteoblasts affect engraftment of leukemia blasts. We are currently characterizing the signaling pathway that mediates these actions.

            "Studies on the cell biology of recombination are still in their infancy, and much remains to be uncovered in terms of the physical behavior of chromosomes, repair foci, and the factors that comprise them. The advent of cell biological techniques like protein tagging and observable chromosomal loci have permitted programs of experimentation that can address these fundamental questions of biology. By using these tools, we hope to unify physical phenomenology with genetic and biochemical models of recombination, permitting a complete understanding of this crucial process. In so doing, we hope to gain insight that may be consequential to studies of human disease and develop new and useful technologies for the manipulation of cells.We use budding yeast as an experimental organism to study essential biological processes and we are pursuing 3 main areas of research: (1) visualization of homologous recombination processes in real time in living cells with an emphasis on the behavior of the broken ends of a double-strand break, (2) identification of new interrelationships between players in the DNA repair pathways (especially for crosslinks), (3) examining the consequences of gene dysregulation in cancer cells, or during viral infection, to discover novel genetic interaction pathways to lead to therapeutic target discovery.1) We are currently studying the physical behavior of chromosomes in living cells and how they respond to DNA damage. We have found that increased mobility of chromosomes after DNA damage facilitates homology search. We are studying precisely how the DNA ends are processed after a double-strand break (DSB) by creating site-specific DSBs using meganucleases, TALENÂ®s and CRISPR-Cas9. Each DNA end flanking the DSB is fluorescently tagged along with the repair template on the homolog. After induction of a DSB, we can visualize repair proteins recruited to the ends before the homology search begins. We observe tight a temporal covariance among increased chromosome mobility, the physical pairing of homologous loci and the resultant gene conversion events. A key question is what happens to the second end of the break during HDR. We have designed a system with chromosomal tags on both ends of the break to allow us to independently visualize each end and track its behavior before, during, and after HR. By determining the precise choreography of DNA end movement during repair, we will better understand many of the open questions surrounding the resolution of DSBs. How often does synthesis-dependent strand annealing occur? How are crossovers and non-crossovers physically mediated? How are broken ends guided to repair substrates and foci? The effects on these processes of mutations in DNA repair pathway proteins are being examined to reveal the driving principles underlying how chromosomes physically respond to damage.2) Analysis of pairwise combinations of double mutants provides a powerful method for determining relationships with a genetic pathway (e.g., epistasis or suppression). Such a genetic analysis becomes increasingly robust when combined with sensitizing conditions, such as treatment with a DNA damaging agent. We have developed an approach that focuses our attention on sub-networks of the DNA damage response by first identifying sets of strains that are sensitive to a particular DNA damaging agent. Next, under the same damaging conditions, pairwise crosses are performed of this subset of strains, which includes known DNA damage repair mutants. By applying this approach to a DNA crosslinking reagent, cisplatin, which is an important chemotherapeutic compound, we have identified over 150 genes involved in cisplatin sensitivity, some of which were not previously recognized as part of the DNA repair response network. Examination of systematic pairwise combinations of these mutations will reveal the global organization of this repair network.3) We have developed methods to rapidly screen the entire yeast gene disruption library to reveal genetic interactions between overexpression of a protein and deletion/mutation of more than 5,500 chromosomal genes. These interactions reveal the pathways that are affected when particular proteins are mis-expressed. Although many cancer genomics and genome-wide expression studies have highlighted the important relationship between gene dosage and phenotype, little attention has been given to studying the effect of gene overexpression. To understand the biological consequences of mis-expression, we overexpress the yeast homolog of the cancer protein of interest and identify genetic interactions. These interactions are often preserved in human cells and reveal interactions that are useful in guiding personalized chemotherapy in cancer patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are using our expression system to explore the pathways that are affected when SAR2-CoV-2 proteins are expressed after infection. We are focusing on viral proteins that target the endoplasmic reticulum to assemble the viral replicon.\n",

The introduction of cell biological methods, such as protein tagging and the visualization of chromosomal loci, has enabled experimental approaches to tackle these essential biological questions. By incorporating these techniques, we aim to integrate physical phenomena with genetic and biochemical models of recombination, ultimately striving for a thorough comprehension of this vital biological process.

            "\n",
            "In our first area of focus, we are investigating how chromosomes behave in living cells following DNA damage. Our findings indicate that increased chromosome mobility post-damage aids in the search for homology. We are examining the processing of DNA ends after a double-strand break through the use of meganucleases, TALEN®s, and CRISPR-Cas9 for creating site-specific breaks. Both ends of the break are fluorescently tagged, along with the repair template on the homolog, allowing us to visualize the recruitment of repair proteins pre-homology search. We note a significant temporal correlation among the heightened mobility of chromosomes, the physical pairing of homologous loci, and subsequent gene conversion events. A critical inquiry pertains to the fate of the second break end during homology-directed repair. We have devised a system with chromosomal tags at both break ends, enabling independent tracking of each end's behavior throughout the repair process. By delineating the precise choreography of DNA end movement, we hope to address several unresolved questions about double-strand break resolution, such as the frequency of synthesis-dependent strand annealing, the physical mechanisms behind crossovers and non-crossovers, and the guidance of broken ends towards repair foci. We are also investigating how mutations in DNA repair proteins affect these processes to uncover the underlying principles governing chromosome responses to damage.\n",

            "Decisions as a Window on Cognition - The Neural Building Blocks of ThoughtThe evolution of sophisticated brains has freed us from the immediacy of sensation and action by giving us the capacity for flexible decision-making. The evidence we obtain through our senses (or from memory) need not precipitate an immediate, reflexive response. Instead our decisions are deliberative and provisional, contingent on other sources of information, long-term goals, and values. I believe the principles of brain function that underlie simple forms of reasoning and decision-making are also the building blocks of human cognition.Brain circuits support integration of evidence from diverse sources (for example, different senses and memory), assign more or less weight to cues that differ in their reliability, calculate expected costs and benefits associated with anticipated outcomes, process elapsed time to meet a deadline or to assess temporal cost, and implement rules (such as deciding on what to decide upon) and policies (balancing accuracy against speed).Read more athttp://www.beinghuman.org/article/decisions-window-cognition\n",

(1) GtrB, a polyisoprenyl phosphate glycosyltransferase attaches glucose to a lipid carrier for membrane translocation and a glycosyl donor for subsequent reactions. This reaction represents the first step in all protein glycosylation and glycosylation of the cell wall. (2) ArnT uses sugar-charged donors produced by GtrB-like enzymes, and transfers the saccharide to lipid A on the cell surface of bacteria, altering antibiotic resistance properties. (3) The Mancia lab determined the structure of a phosphatidylinositol-phosphate (PIP) synthase – an enzyme required for inositol-lipid synthesis – with a bound CDP-diacylglycerol substrate. This enzyme is a member of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase family (CDP-APs), which catalyze the defining step in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life.

A key goal of the laboratory is to understand the mechanism by which intracellular calcium release is triggered, modulated and terminated. We use X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy (CryoEM) to investigate the structure and dynamics of the molecular machines involved in such process, including amongst others the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which mediates intracellular Ca2+ release during E-C coupling. ​ We and others have described structures of the isolated ryanodine receptor in various states – closed, open, and bound to activating ligands. One of the key issues we wish to address with further work is to investigate the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor in the context of both the transmembrane protein binding partners around it, and the cell as a whole. ​ The ultimate goal of our research is a structural understanding of how the voltage gated Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane mechanically couple to the ryanodine receptor and directly control gating of the receptor, and how adjacent RyRs in the paracrystalline arrays that have been observed at the terminal cisternae interact with one another and signal cooperatively.

            "Sexually reproducing organisms employ a specialized developmental program to generate cells that are used to pass genetic material from one generation to the next. These reproductive cells, called gametes, contain half the DNA complement of a typical cell and are known to us as sperm, eggs, pollen, and spores etc. A hallmark feature of gamete development is a marked decrease in mRNA production (i.e. transcriptional control) and a concurrent emphasis on genetic regulation at the level of protein synthesis (i.e. translational control). We discovered that in order to control translation during gamete development, budding yeast builds massive RNA-binding protein structures that exhibit biochemical properties of amyloid (thus termed ‘amyloid-like’). Our research goals are to discover and understand the pathways and mechanisms by which cells regulate formation, function, and reversibility of amyloids. We strive to expand our understanding of birth defects and fertility while also providing key insights into principles underlying neurodegenerative disease.Amyloids are fibrous protein aggregates that are predominantly understood for their roles in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and prion diseases. What is remarkable about amyloid-like assemblies in yeast is that they are not pathogenic- on the contrary they are both functional and regulated. These structures bind to and repress translation of key transcripts and are essential for gamete production. Formation of these repressors is regulated by starvation and clearance is regulated by precise developmental cues. Regulated amyloid-like assemblies are also features of mouse and frog meiosis highlighting their evolutionary conservation and likely ancient evolutionary origin in sexual reproduction.Our lab employs genetic, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to understand the pathways and mechanisms underlying formation and clearance of amyloid-like assemblies. We also use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to decipher how translation can be regulated by this intriguing class of RNA-binding structures. We are also using yeast to screen and identify compounds that prevent and/or disassemble amyloid-like assemblies. The compounds that we identify in this manner will be excellent potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we are investigating the hypothesis that mammalian sperm development also relies on amyloid-like assemblies to regulate gene expression.Our studies will lay the foundation for understanding the molecular underpinnings of how cells regulate and process amyloid-like assemblies. Each finding provides the potential lead to a pathway or gene that could be a therapeutic target. Despite much research and development, anti-amyloid preventative therapies have been elusive. They are needed for neurodegenerative diseases in which few if any effective preventative therapies are currently available. Therapeutic strategies resulting from this work will rely on my ability to apply the findings we gain from this study to neurodegenerative disease models.

This process comprises several key developmental milestones, including implantation, the separation of the embryo from the placenta, and gastrulation, which establishes the coordinate system on which all the future organs will form. Perhaps one of the oldest questions in all of biology is how, despite tremendous conservation in embryonic pathways, we develop into completely differently looking organisms – a human always looks like a human and a mouse always looks like a mouse. If we understand these phenomena in great detail, we can harness them and faithfully mimic organ formation in a lab. At the interface of chemical engineering, developmental biology and biophysics, Mijo Simunovic uses human pluripotent stem cells to elucidate the molecular details and the biomechanics underlying early human embryogenesis and organogenesis, with goals to advancing reproductive and regenerative medicine and to faithfully modeling complex human diseases.Organoids are complex tissues derived from stem cells that mimic important aspects of actual organ formation, including biochemical signaling, cellular diversity, and tissue transformations. Simunovic has previously generated an organoid model of the human epiblast, which is the embryonic tissue that gives rise to all the organs. He used this model to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of symmetry breaking, the key first step in establishing the body plan. Following on these efforts, Simunovic builds quantitative organoids to mimic the mechanisms of human embryo implantation and gastrulation; essentially, to understand how we are formed.

Receptors function in three steps: signal recognition, transduction, and transmission. This is exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on which I worked for forty years. These receptors bind acetylcholine, transduce this binding into the opening of a pore, and conduct cations causing a depolarization of the synaptic membrane. We identified the overall receptor structure and, within this, the specific sites and substructures at the front-line of these functional steps. More recently, this approach was applied to the BK channel, a voltage- and calcium-ion-activated channel, widely expressed and responsible for membrane hyperpolarization.Also recently, I began to consider cellular functions that depend on circuits of signaling components. Cellular function depends on the functions of individual molecular components and on their coordination via direct or indirect interactions. Cellular function also depends on cellular structure and on the distribution of the functional molecular components in these structures. Crucial to the specificity and effectiveness of the interactions among functional components are microdomains, which both channel and amplify the signals between components. My approach to understanding such systems is to represent all steps as kinetic equations, consistent with thermodynamics, and to solve the resulting equations in time and space. To the extent that experimental data exist, the equations are fit to these data. Such a model is a mathematical summary of the known properties of the components and of the target cellular function. Notwithstanding, such a model is a hypothetical outline of how the cell might function, always wanting experimental tests and refinement.\n",

            "My primary focus has been on deciphering the roles of molecular receptors, which serves as the main objective of our research center. Receptors operate in three key phases: signal detection, signal transduction, and signal transmission. A prime example of this is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which I have studied for four decades. These receptors are responsible for binding acetylcholine, converting that binding into pore opening, and allowing the passage of cations that lead to synaptic membrane depolarization. We have elucidated the overall structure of these receptors, pinpointing specific sites and substructures involved in each functional phase. More recently, I have applied this methodology to the BK channel, a voltage- and calcium-activated channel that is broadly distributed and plays a role in membrane hyperpolarization. \n",

            "Additionally, I have begun to explore cellular functions that arise from networks of signaling components. Cellular activity relies not just on individual molecular functionalities but also on their coordination through direct or indirect relationships. The organization of cellular structures and the spatial distribution of functional molecular elements are also significant for cellular performance. Microdomains play a vital role in enhancing the specificity and efficacy of interactions among functional components by facilitating and amplifying signals. My strategy for understanding these systems involves representing all processes as kinetic equations aligned with thermodynamic principles, which I then solve spatially and temporally. Where experimental data is available, I fit these equations to the data, creating a mathematical representation of the known characteristics of the components and the intended cellular function. However, this model serves as a theoretical framework for potential cellular functions, always requiring empirical validation and refinement.\n",
            "At a cellular level, organisms face two fundamental challenges: maintaining integrity of the genome in response to mobile genetic elements and mutagens, and expressing a specific repertoire of genes at the correct time and proper level. It is now widely recognized that noncoding RNAs play crucial and surprisingly diverse roles in controlling both the expression of DNA, via transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation, and the content of DNA itself, by mediating sequence-specific DNA cleavage events. The recent discovery of pervasive genome defense systems in bacteria and archaea known as CRISPR–Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats–CRISPR-associated), and the development of these systems for genome engineering, highlight the biological power and technological potential of RNA-guided DNA control.The Sternberg Lab broadly strives to expand our understanding of the ways in which noncoding RNAs conspire with effector proteins to target DNA. Focusing on evolutionarily distinct but analogous systems in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and using a combination of biochemistry, structural biology, biophysics, and genetics, we are uncovering new biological function while simultaneously advancing novel tools with which to precisely manipulate the genome.

            "At the cellular level, organisms encounter two primary challenges: preserving genome integrity against mobile genetic elements and mutagens, and accurately regulating the expression of specific genes at the appropriate times and levels. It is increasingly understood that noncoding RNAs are essential and remarkably varied in their roles in managing DNA expression through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, as well as influencing the DNA content itself by facilitating targeted DNA cleavage. The recent identification of widespread genome defense mechanisms in bacteria and archaea, known as CRISPR–Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats–CRISPR-associated), along with advancements in utilizing these systems for genome editing, emphasize the biological significance and innovative potential of RNA-mediated DNA regulation. The Sternberg Lab aims to broaden our comprehension of how noncoding RNAs interact with effector proteins to target DNA. By investigating evolutionarily distinct yet analogous systems in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and employing a mix of biochemistry, structural biology, biophysics, and genetics, we are revealing novel biological functions while also developing innovative tools for precise genome manipulation.

This researcher has mainly contributed to understanding the molecular mechanisms and structural dynamics of DNA repair and recombination processes, particularly involving recombinases, helicases, and related proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi, using advanced imaging and microscopy techniques to explore genetic, biochemical, and chemical phenomena at the single-molecule level.\n",
            "Our group uses single-molecule optical microscopy to study fundamental interactions between proteins and nucleic acids. Our overall goal is to reveal the molecular mechanisms that cells use to repair, maintain, and decode their genetic information. This research combines aspects of biochemistry, physics, and nanoscale technology to answer questions about complex biological problems that cannot be easily addressed through traditional biochemical approaches. As part of our work, we have established robust experimental platforms that enable single molecule imaging of biochemical reaction mechanisms in a “high throughput” experimental format that can be applied to the study of protein-nucleic acid interactions. The advantages of our approaches are that we can see what proteins are bound to DNA, where they are bound, how they move, and how they interact with and influence other components of the system – all in real-time, at the level of a single reaction. We are applying this technology towards determining the physical basis for the mechanisms that proteins use to maintain genome integrity, with particular emphasis on reactions related to homologous DNA recombination.\n"

            "In neuroscience, the researcher investigates neural activity in Drosophila and mice, focusing on the spatial and temporal structure of neuronal responses during various behaviors. Behavioral biology is explored through studies on Drosophila's egg-laying behavior and the influence of pheromones like darcin in mice on mating behaviors. Sensory processing is examined in Drosophila's bitter-sensing neurons and the role of olfactory circuits in cognitive mapping, with insights into synaptic plasticity and decision-making processes. Machine learning is applied to replicate anatomical connectivity in olfactory circuits and to automate signal quantification in neural activity studies. Developmental biology is highlighted through the study of the dwarf cuttlefish, including its brain atlas and rapid embryonic development, emphasizing its unique neural functions and evolutionary adaptations. Overall, the research integrates these fields to enhance understanding of neural mechanisms underlying behavior and sensory processing across different species.\n",
            "Mammals possess an olfactory system of inordinate discriminatory power. We are studying how the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception is accomplished. Our analysis of the patterns of expression of the odorant receptor genes, coupled with earlier electrophysiologic experiments have provided a logic for olfactory discrimination. Individual olfactory sensory neurons express only one of a thousand receptor genes. Neurons expressing a given receptor, although randomly distributed in domains in the epithelium, project their axons to a small number of topographically fixed loci or glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. These data support a model of olfactory coding in which discrimination of odor quality would result from the detection of specific spatial patterns of activity in the olfactory bulb.\n",

            "Mammals have a highly advanced olfactory system with exceptional ability to distinguish between different smells. Our research focuses on understanding how this diversity and specificity in olfactory perception is achieved. By analyzing the patterns in the expression of odorant receptor genes and incorporating previous electrophysiological studies, we have developed a framework that explains how olfactory discrimination occurs. Each olfactory sensory neuron is dedicated to expressing just one of the approximately 1,000 receptor genes. Although the neurons that express the same receptor are randomly located in various areas of the olfactory epithelium, they send their axons to a limited number of fixed locations, known as glomeruli, in the olfactory bulb. This evidence supports a model of olfactory coding where the differentiation of odor quality arises from recognizing distinct spatial activity patterns within the olfactory bulb.\n",
            "Mammals possess an olfactory system of inordinate discriminatory power. We are studying how the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception is accomplished. Our analysis of the patterns of expression of the odorant receptor genes, coupled with earlier electrophysiologic experiments have provided a logic for olfactory discrimination. Individual olfactory sensory neurons express only one of a thousand receptor genes. Neurons expressing a given receptor, although randomly distributed in domains in the epithelium, project their axons to a small number of topographically fixed loci or glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. These data support a model of olfactory coding in which discrimination of odor quality would result from the detection of specific spatial patterns of activity in the olfactory bulb.\n"

We are studying how the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception is accomplished. Our analysis of the patterns of expression of the odorant receptor genes, coupled with earlier electrophysiologic experiments have provided a logic for olfactory discrimination. Individual olfactory sensory neurons express only one of a thousand receptor genes. Neurons expressing a given receptor, although randomly distributed in domains in the epithelium, project their axons to a small number of topographically fixed loci or glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. These data support a model of olfactory coding in which discrimination of odor quality would result from the detection of specific spatial patterns of activity in the olfactory bulb.', 'Bridget Carragher': 'For almost my entire career I have been involved in the development of streamlined and automated methods for EM aimed at improving both the quality of EM data as well as the accessibility of these techniques to the wider biological community.

But real proteins have evolved to depend on biomolecular interactions and conformational flexibility in order to balance stability with function. A key challenge in protein engineering is our limited mechanistic understanding of how proteins’ conformational ensembles are poised to perform non-equilibrium processes, which enable their functions.Our research group combines computational protein design with high-throughput biophysical techniques to study biomolecular conformational changes, towards engineering proteins that change conformations, interact with other molecules, and cross membranes in response to signals. Design principles for building signal-responsive, conformation-switching proteins can guide efforts to control the behavior and development of living systems and treat diseases without disrupting healthy cells.

His lab identified and characterized a novel host protein, termed ZAP for zinc finger antiviral protein, that blocks gene expression of many viruses, including the murine leukemia viruses, Ebola, Sindbis, and HIV-1, by degrading viral mRNAs and inhibiting their translation. Recent work has identified RIPLET, a signaling molecule in annate immunity, as a cofactor for ZAP. The lab has also characterized a protein complex responsible for the silencing of retroviral DNAs in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and identified a zinc finger protein, ZFP809, as an ES-cell specific recognition molecule that binds the proviral DNA and brings TRIM28 to locally modify chromatin.

Mutations in core components and modulators of the LIN-12/Notch signaling system have been implicated in cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and developmental diseases and syndromes. UsingC. elegans, we study how LIN-12/Notch signaling is modulated during normal development and identify potential ways it may be modulated to combat disease.We are currently investigating the fundamental logic and molecular events that govern how multipotential cells make cell fate decisions; using sensitive and specific suppressor and enhancer screens to identify new, conserved modulators of LIN-12/Notch and other signaling pathways with potential disease relevance; and studying cell fate programming and reprogramming during organogenesis and in alternative life histories..\", 'Oliver Hobert': 'The main focus of the laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms that generate the astounding diversity of cell types in a nervous system. Using the C.elegans model system, we have revealed a core regulatory logic for how terminal neuronal identity is controlled in several different neuron types. We have demonstrated that these regulatory mechanisms are conserved in chordates. These insights have allowed us to reprogram the identity of heterologous cell types to that of specific neuron types. Venturing into a little explored area of neuronal diversification, we have developed a novel paradigm to study asymmetry across the left/right axis, by far the least understood axis in any nervous system, and identified a complex gene regulatory network that differentially controls terminal neuron identity across this axis.Aside from our main focus on neuronal development, we have also studied the molecular machinery with which the nervous system responds to the environment (i) to modulate behavior and (ii) to ensure that it maintains its functional and structural integrity.Employing new technologies that we developed, we continue to exploit the simplicity and experimental amenability of the worm to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the genetic programs that control the development of theC.elegansnervous system and we will continue to extend these insights to vertebrates.', 'Eric Kandel': 'We combine behavioral, cellular, and molecular biological approaches to delineate the changes that underlie simple forms of learning and memory in invertebrates and vertebrates.

Recently we have reconstituted critical components of this learning in dissociated cell culture, and we now use the reconstituted system to examine the molecular mechanisms which contribute to short- and long-term memory.In vertebrates we use genetically modified mice to examine the mechanisms of long-term potentiation in the mammalian hippocampus and its relation to spacial memory and maintenance.', 'Arthur Karlin': 'Understanding the function of molecular receptors has been my guiding interest and the central mission of the Center. Receptors function in three steps: signal recognition, transduction, and transmission. This is exemplified by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on which I worked for forty years. These receptors bind acetylcholine, transduce this binding into the opening of a pore, and conduct cations causing a depolarization of the synaptic membrane. We identified the overall receptor structure and, within this, the specific sites and substructures at the front-line of these functional steps. More recently, this approach was applied to the BK channel, a voltage- and calcium-ion-activated channel, widely expressed and responsible for membrane hyperpolarization.Also recently, I began to consider cellular functions that depend on circuits of signaling components. Cellular function depends on the functions of individual molecular components and on their coordination via direct or indirect interactions. Cellular function also depends on cellular structure and on the distribution of the functional molecular components in these structures. Crucial to the specificity and effectiveness of the interactions among functional components are microdomains, which both channel and amplify the signals between components. My approach to understanding such systems is to represent all steps as kinetic equations, consistent with thermodynamics, and to solve the resulting equations in time and space. To the extent that experimental data exist, the equations are fit to these data. Such a model is a mathematical summary of the known properties of the components and of the target cellular function. Notwithstanding, such a model is a hypothetical outline of how the cell might function, always wanting experimental tests and refinement.', 'Peter D. Kwong': 'At Columbia University, my research has focused on Antibodyomics, the informatics of antibody recognition, development, and improvement. Numerous antibodies have been identified from HIV-1-infected donors that neutralize diverse strains of HIV-1. These antibodies could provide the basis for a B cell-mediated HIV-1 vaccine. However, it has been unclear how to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination. To address this issue, my group along with colleagues from Columbia University (L. Shapiro, B. Honig, R. Friesner) and elsewhere (Academia Sinica, ADARC, NIH, Vanderbilt University, University of Kansas) have undertaken an informatics-based approach to understand the genetic and immunologic processes controlling the development of HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies. As genetic information is currently the fastest growing database of biological information, we have focused on incorporating next-generation sequencing of B cell transcripts to determine the origin, maturation pathway, and prevalence of broadly neutralizing antibody lineages (Antibodyomics1, 2, 4, and 6). We have also incorporated large-scale robotic analyses of serum neutralization to identify and quantify neutralizing antibodies from donor cohorts (Antibodyomics3). Statistical analyses furnish another layer of insight (Antibodyomics5), with informatics incorporating physical characteristics of antibodies and their targets through molecular dynamics simulations and with free energy perturbation analyses providing information-rich output (Antibodyomics7 and 8). Functional interrogation of individual antibodies (Antibodyomics9) and synthetic antibody libraries (Antibodyomics10) also yields multi-dimensional data by which to understand and improve antibodies. Antibodyomics thus comprise resolution-enhancing tools, which collectively embody an information-driven discovery engine towards development of effective B cell-based vaccines.

One genome gives rise to the other during programmed genome reorganization, and we study how this system co-evolved with germline DNA transposons.', 'Michal Levo': 'Coordinated activation of subsets of genes, at specific tissues and developmental times, governs cell fate decisions and cellular behavior. We now know that genomes are replete with regulatory sequences guiding this spatiotemporal activation of genes. Developmental disorders and diseases are often associated with disruptions to this regulatory code. As our mapping of eukaryotic genomes improved in the last few decades, we learned that the number of regulatory DNA elements greatly exceeds the number of genes, and these elements can reside far away along the genome from their target gene. What are the mechanisms that mediate gene regulation within this genomic labyrinth remains an open question. How do regulatory elements communicate with their target genes? What ensures the right regulatory interactions take place at specific cells and times? What are the molecular agents bringing the regulatory instruction to life? And how are properties of the local chromatin environment and the broader 3D genome organization related to the regulation of gene activity?The Levo lab combines several experimental modalities (from genomic assays to live subcellular imaging), with computational analysis and modeling, to study the dynamic, multilayered control of gene expression in the service of differentiation and development.

Olfactory receptor (OR) genes compose the largest mammalian gene family consisted of more than 1000 members. These genes are expressed in a stochastic and mutually exclusive fashion in such a way that only one OR allele is expressed in each olfactory sensory neuron. Our data suggest that this unusual expression pattern is orchestrated by a combination of positive and negative regulatory mechanism. According to our findings, OR genes undergo chromatin mediated silencing at a developmental stage that precedes olfactory receptor activation. One of the 3000 alleles is chosen for activation, by the enzymatic removal of the silencing chromatin marks. We currently combine genetic and biochemical approaches that together with cutting edge microscopy should reveal critical mechanistic details of this process.', 'Tom Maniatis': 'The primary focus of my lab during the past 10 years has been in two areas: 1. Disease mechanisms of ALS, which involves a combination of human genetic, stem cell and animal model approaches, and 2. The structure and function of the clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) genes. We have used behavioral assays in both projects to characterize the phenotypic consequences of mutations in mouse models. The ALS animal model work has involved the use of various neuromuscular behavioral studies of the SOD1 G93A mouse model, while the protocadherin project has involved studies of both motor function and affective behavior (depression and anxiety). Manuscripts describing both studies are under review. The most recent ALS work is a study of the role of autophagy in ALS disease progression, and these studies involved various studies of motor function such as the rotarod test for motor coordination and muscle strength. The protocadherin studies involve various assays for affective function (anxiety and depression), in Pcdha gene cluster deletion mice. We have shown that these mice display a cell-autonomous serotonergic wiring phenotype, and have characterized the behavioral consequences. Recent human genetic studies from other laboratories have implicated the Pcdh gene cluster in autism and other neurological diseases. We have generated a series of well-characterized deletion mutants in the Pcdh gene cluster, and are characterizing their behavioral phenotypes. Thus, the behavior core is central to our ongoing and future studies.', 'Richard S. Mann': 'Our lab uses the fruit fly,Drosophilamelanogaster, to study three main problems: Hox protein function and specificity; appendage development; and the development and function of the adult motor system. Our work on Hox proteins centers around two questions: 1) how these homeodomain-containing transcription factors achieve specificityin vivoand 2) what are the relevant target genes that these factors regulate to control morphogenesis? To answer these questions, we are using a variety of in vitro DNA binding assays, structural biology,invivoreporter gene assays, and genome-wide methods to discover and validate Hox target genes and Hox binding sites. Genetic methods are used to analyze the function of putative target genes and their specific contributions to morphology. Our work on appendage development focuses on two questions: 1) how is positional information generated along the proximo-distal (PD) axis and 2) how is cell proliferation regulated and coordinated with cell differentiation? To answer the first question, our main approach is to dissect at high resolution the transcriptional responses of genes expressed at specific positions along the PD axis, primarily in the legs. To answer the second question, we are identifying the genes and pathways that selector genes regulate to modulate cell proliferation during appendage development. Our work on the adult motor system stems from our work on leg development. Here, we are studying how the motor neurons that innervate the adult leg are generated and specified to target the correct muscles and generate the correct dendritic pattern in the CNS. Using this information, we are beginning to study how the movement of the legs is coordinated by local interneurons and sensory feedback.

The human brain is composed of roughly ten billion neurons, each of which can participate in thousands of connections. Thus, the genetically-directed assembly of the nervous system involves formation of about 1013 specific interconnections between neurons. Implementation of this extraordinarily precise program depends on the controlled spatial and temporal expression of selective adhesion molecules on neural cell surfaces. Although the full complement of proteins responsible for specific adhesion in the nervous system remains unclear, many families of neural adhesion molecules have been identified and studied in detail. Our focus is on structural studies of neural adhesion molecules to reveal the molecular basis of their function and atomic-level details of their binding specificity.Much of our efforts are focused on the cadherins, a large family of cell surface proteins that mediate adhesive binding between cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Crystal Structures of cadherins show that binding interactions form only between the N-terminal domains of the extracellular regions. The idea that these domains encode cadherin cell adhesive specificity has been verified by structre-based mutagenesis experiments. There are several subfamilies of cadherins expressed in the nervous system, including type I, type II, and protocadherins. The sorting of motor neuron pools is dependent on the unique distributions of type II cadherins expressed by the cells of each motor neuron pool.Our long-term goal is to determine the atomic-level basis for specific adhesion in a variety of neural systems.', 'David E.

As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the cellular gene expression machinery for replication; consequently, the abilities of virus and host cell to control gene expression play critical roles during the establishment of viral infection. Many viruses have evolved elegant strategies to co-opt and manipulate cellular processes for their own benefit, but conversely, eukaryotic cells use specialized branches of gene expression pathways to respond to and eradicate viruses. In the Steckelberg lab, we combine biochemical, structural (x-ray crystallography and cryoEM) and cell biological methods to study the molecular interactions that regulate gene expression during infection with RNA viruses of the flaviviridae and coronaviridae families. Studying how viruses hijack cellular processes provides insight into the life cycle of important human pathogens but also expands our understanding of the cellular machinery itself.

It is now widely recognized that noncoding RNAs play crucial and surprisingly diverse roles in controlling both the expression of DNA, via transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation, and the content of DNA itself, by mediating sequence-specific DNA cleavage events. The recent discovery of pervasive genome defense systems in bacteria and archaea known as CRISPR–Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats–CRISPR-associated), and the development of these systems for genome engineering, highlight the biological power and technological potential of RNA-guided DNA control.The Sternberg Lab broadly strives to expand our understanding of the ways in which noncoding RNAs conspire with effector proteins to target DNA. Focusing on evolutionarily distinct but analogous systems in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and using a combination of biochemistry, structural biology, biophysics, and genetics, we are uncovering new biological function while simultaneously advancing novel tools with which to precisely manipulate the genome.

On the mechanistic side, the Zhang lab focuses on fundamental understanding of the targeting specificity of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), how they regulate alternative splicing in various cellular contexts, especially in the nervous system, and how such regulation can be disrupted by mutations and genetic variations. On the functional side, the lab aims to uncover the roles of RBPs in determining the neuronal cell fate, morphological and functional properties during neural differentiation and maturation. More recently, the lab has also been working on translating fundamental knowledge on RNA regulation to precision genetic medicine, with a particular focus on multiple devastating monogenic diseases affecting the central nervous system.Dr. Zhang and his lab have pioneered RNA Systems Biology approaches to investigating splicing-regulatory networks. Dr. Zhang’s work has led to breakthroughs in mapping protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution on a genome-wide scale (e.g., Zhang & Darnell, Nat Biotech, 2011; Weyn-Vanhentenryck, Cell Rep. 2014). Building on this unprecedented resolution, his lab has developed innovative statistical models to better define the binding specificity of RBPs, which led to discoveries of novel binding modes of old RBPs under decades of investigations, with implications in development and cancer (e.g., Ustianenko, Mol Cell, 2018 (cover story); Feng, Mol Cell, 2019). Dr. Zhang also developed an integrative modeling strategy to define splicing-regulatory networks by combining multiple modalities of genomic data and evolutionary signatures (Zhang, Science 2010).

Philippe Batut’s research aims to characterize these regulatory sequences and understand the molecular mechanisms by which they modulate gene expression during the development of a new organism.Philippe's graduate work contributed to the ENCODE Project’s efforts towards the functional annotation of the human genome, and to a growing realization that much of our genome is transcribed into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These lncRNAs are a diverse class of molecules that, despite resembling mRNAs, do not encode proteins – and while a small subset has been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression, their functions remain largely unexplored. Philippe used evolutionary transcriptomics approaches to show that many lncRNAs in the Drosophila genome are deeply conserved, suggesting that they are biologically relevant. Their expression is extremely dynamic during embryonic development, and these temporal dynamics are also highly conserved.In his postdoctoral research at Princeton University, he leveraged quantitative live imaging approaches to study the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in development in the group of Michael S.

This work established, through the use of emerging genome engineering technologies, that the three-dimensional organization of the genome in the space of the nucleus plays a key role in regulating the temporal dynamics of gene expression. His work further paved the way for single-cell studies of the regulatory roles non-coding RNAs in developing embryos.Learn more about his research at theBatut Lab.\", 'Luke E. Berchowitz': 'Sexually reproducing organisms employ a specialized developmental program to generate cells that are used to pass genetic material from one generation to the next. These reproductive cells, called gametes, contain half the DNA complement of a typical cell and are known to us as sperm, eggs, pollen, and spores etc. A hallmark feature of gamete development is a marked decrease in mRNA production (i.e. transcriptional control) and a concurrent emphasis on genetic regulation at the level of protein synthesis (i.e. translational control). We discovered that in order to control translation during gamete development, budding yeast builds massive RNA-binding protein structures that exhibit biochemical properties of amyloid (thus termed ‘amyloid-like’). Our research goals are to discover and understand the pathways and mechanisms by which cells regulate formation, function, and reversibility of amyloids. We strive to expand our understanding of birth defects and fertility while also providing key insights into principles underlying neurodegenerative disease.Amyloids are fibrous protein aggregates that are predominantly understood for their roles in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and prion diseases. What is remarkable about amyloid-like assemblies in yeast is that they are not pathogenic- on the contrary they are both functional and regulated. These structures bind to and repress translation of key transcripts and are essential for gamete production. Formation of these repressors is regulated by starvation and clearance is regulated by precise developmental cues. Regulated amyloid-like assemblies are also features of mouse and frog meiosis highlighting their evolutionary conservation and likely ancient evolutionary origin in sexual reproduction.Our lab employs genetic, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to understand the pathways and mechanisms underlying formation and clearance of amyloid-like assemblies. We also use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to decipher how translation can be regulated by this intriguing class of RNA-binding structures. We are also using yeast to screen and identify compounds that prevent and/or disassemble amyloid-like assemblies. The compounds that we identify in this manner will be excellent potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we are investigating the hypothesis that mammalian sperm development also relies on amyloid-like assemblies to regulate gene expression.Our studies will lay the foundation for understanding the molecular underpinnings of how cells regulate and process amyloid-like assemblies. Each finding provides the potential lead to a pathway or gene that could be a therapeutic target. Despite much research and development, anti-amyloid preventative therapies have been elusive. They are needed for neurodegenerative diseases in which few if any effective preventative therapies are currently available. Therapeutic strategies resulting from this work will rely on my ability to apply the findings we gain from this study to neurodegenerative disease models. Columbia University Medical Center and the Taub Institute for Alzheimer’s and Aging Research provide the supportive framework and collaborative opportunities to make this possible.', 'Amanda L. Bergner': 'Ms. Bergner’s research had been focused in several areas, including understanding the value of genetic testing for the epilepsies. The application of genetic testing in the setting of epilepsy has increased tremendously in the past decade, moving from single gene testing to multi-gene panels and broader genomic sequencing. Her research into the use of genetic testing in epilepsy and the value of genetic testing results in the management of epilepsy is helping to shape the national conversation on the importance of this tool in the treatment of individuals and families, including her involvement in conducting the systematic literature review that led to the first practice guideline for genetic testing in the epilepsies.Ms. Bergner has also focused her research on the growing awareness of critical aspects of conducting clinical genomics research. Genome sequencing is becoming commonplace in clinical research focused on discovering genetic contributions to both rare and common disease. Her research has helped to elucidate several important considerations when undertaking this type of research in the clinic, including consent best practices and the return of results to subjects/patients. This work has helped to shape the national conversation about integrating research-based genomic sequencing into existing clinical practices, ultimately supporting informed decision-making for individuals and families.As well, Ms. Bergner has focused on the improvement of key quality of life components for individuals with neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses (NF) are a group of disorders that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Individuals living with NF typically experience functional impairments in multiple body systems, including hearing loss, vision loss, mobility issues, communication difficulties, stigma, social isolation, and mental health disorders. While current trials focus on medical and surgical interventions to improve functional impairments with quantifiable outcomes, less has been explored in terms of patient-reported data about both quality of life and outcomes of intervention for NF. As part of her post-graduate research, Ms. Bergner investigated this problem and found that patient report is a critical component of evaluating both the impact of the symptoms of NF and potential intervention. Patient report can be valuable in two primary areas in which clinical trials are currently underway: hearing loss, and pain/physical functioning.As well, her research has helped to identify the most effective patient-reported outcome measures to be used in clinical trials in NF through the Response Endpoints in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) consortium, a group of international experts in NF. Collectively, the results from my research has opened new directions for evaluating response in clinical trials for NF. She has additionally been involved in making practice recommendations for the genetic counseling profession regarding NF.', 'Timothy H. Bestor': 'Some mammalian promoters are inactive even when in the presence of all the factors necessary for their expression; imprinted genes and genes on the inactive X chromosomes are not expressed, even though the identical allele on the homologous chromosome may be expressed at high levels. The states of activity of such genes are subject to somatic inheritance. Genes subject to heritable silencing are said to be under epigenetic regulation. Most epigenetic regulation in mammals depends on the establishment and maintenance of genomic methylation patterns. Transcription of mammalian genes is prevented by the methylation of cytosines within promoter elements, and methylation patterns are transmitted during cell division with very high fidelity. It was previously thought that reversible promoter methylation might be involved in gene regulation during development, but recent data indicate that the primary function of DNA methylation is the suppression of intragenomic parasites and of proviral DNA. DNA methylation also has crucial roles in genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation in females. Our laboratory purified, characterized, and cloned the first eukaryotic DNA methyltransferase, now known as DNMT1. We collaborated with the Jaenisch laboratory to disrupt the Dnmt1 gene and showed that DNA methylation is necessary for the suppression of transposons; Jaenisch and colleagues showed that DNA methylation is required for imprinted gene expression and for X chromosome inactivation. Our laboratory was the first to identify a human genetic disorder (ICF syndrome) that is caused by mutations in a DNA methyltransferase gene (the DNMT3B gene), the first to identify a mammalian tRNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase, and the first to identify a gene required for the establishment of genomic imprints in oocytes and for the methylation and silencing of transposons in male germ cells. We continue to identify the cues that direct de novo DNA methylation to specific sequences in germ cells and to identify factors required for de novo methylation. We are also using ultrahigh throughput DNA sequencing to obtain whole-genome methylation profiles in order to identify regions of ectopic DNA methylation that may contribute to the development of breast cancer and psychiatric disorders.', 'Wellington V.

My lab has a long-standing interest in studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which lung epithelial progenitors give rise to the various specialized cell types, including \\xa0multiciliated, secretory \\xa0and neuroendocrine cells. Furthermore, we have a major interest in studying the mechanisms that control the organization and behavior of the lung stem cell compartment and how their failure contribute to abnormal repair and chronic pulmonary diseases. Over the past two decades our studies have revealed key roles for Fgf, Notch, retinoids, Hippo-Yap and microRNAs in the development of the lung structure, innate immunity and the diversity and function of the stem cell compartment of airways. Our work has provided relevant mechanistic insights into a number of conditons, including, lung agenesis and hypoplasia, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and neuroendocrine hyperplasias.', 'Chia-Wei Cheng': 'Adaptation to dietary changes profoundly influenced human evolution and continues to impact our modern lives in health and diseases. After embryonic development, tissue-resident adult stem and progenitor cells remain the capacity to adjust their regenerative activity in response to diets and nutritional states to maintain tissue homeostasis. Such adaptation must rely on the systemic mediators integrating the inter-organ crosstalk to coordinate whole-body metabolism and the intracellular signaling machinery converting the nutritional messages into the transcriptional regulatory actions to determine the stem cell fate.Our research focuses on the interface of nutritional and transcriptional regulatory networks. We study how adult stem and progenitor cells perceive the nutritional states and fine-tune their lineage decisions in tissue regeneration and disease development processes. Our goal is to illustrate the conversion from the nutritional perception to cell fate decisions at the single-cell level, in the hope of inspiring new therapeutic strategies. Towards this end, we use genetic mouse models, organoid systems, and transplantation experiments to identify and characterize the endocrinal and metabolic cell-fate determinants in the contexts of tissue homeostasis and adaptation to diet.

Lethality of PDA owes largely to the advanced disease stage at the time of diagnosis and to its profound resistance to existing therapies. Targeted therapy is a cornerstone of precision medicine, and is currently the focus of much anticancer drug development. However, in the context of pancreatic cancer, no chemical inhibitors exist for the most common KRAS mutations (G12D, G12V) even though it is well established that the oncogenic KRAS promotes drug resistance. Thus, a detailed understanding of the role of specific genetic lesions and their signaling surrogates in the initiation and progression of PDA is critical to improving treatment efficacy and patient outcome for this disease. Using genetically engineered mouse models and ex vivo culture systems, the Chio lab seeks to understand the basic mechanisms underlying PDAC biology such that vulnerabilities can be identified and tested for therapeutic intervention.

In the 2000’s, we came to appreciate the importance of epigenetic mechanisms to neurobiology, and now we are on the cusp of a new field that might be called “RNA neurobiology.”RNA biology may, in fact, have particular importance in the brain, given the extremely dynamic nature of neuronal synapses. The post-synaptic compartment contains polysomes, which indicates that translation is crucial for higher-order brain activity, and protein synthesis has long been thought to be required for memory consolidation. Small wonder, then, that disruption of RNA-binding proteins is associated with wide-ranging syndromes that affect motor control, behavior, and cognition.My interest in RNA-binding proteins centers on their role in post-transcriptional regulation of proteins that, when mutated, lead to human neurological disease. But my interest is in the wild-type versions of these proteins: my research has shown that relatively modest increases or decreases in the levels of at least some ‘normal’ proteins can be pathogenic. This opens up an entirely new avenue to discovering new neurological disease genes, as I showed recently in the identification of patients bearing mutations inPumilio1(Cell, 2018).', 'Laura A. Johnston': 'My laboratory investigates the mechanisms used by growing tissues to gauge and regulate the collective and individual fitness of cells, thereby optimizing tissue and animal fitness. We are interested in the basic biological mechanisms that regulate these processes, how they contribute to development of healthy tissues and in understanding their relevance to developmental and tumorigenic pathologies. We use the simple genetic model organism Drosophila and utilize strategies that allow manipulation of growth and cell fitness in living, growing animals. Our projects include: how the growth regulator Myc mediates competitive interactions during tissue and organ growth; investigation of homeostatic processes, including metabolism, that allow cells to sense and respond to growth changes in their local environment; identification of factors that act as sensors and mediators of cellular fitness; and genetic and molecular dissection of tissue regeneration. These processes provide plasticity to growing organs and give cells control over their local environment.', 'Chao Lu': \"We are currently interested in three broad research areas:1) Mechanisms underlying the tissue specificity of cancer-associated chromatin abnormality:In contrast to tissue- and sequence-specific transcription factors, chromatin regulators are ubiquitously expressed and often target hundreds of genes. Paradoxically, cancer-associated mutations in chromatin regulators exhibit a high degree of tissue specificity. We are interested to address why/how does the broad activity of chromatin regulator produce pathway-specific effect. To this end, we are using novel epigenome-editing tools to discern the 'driver' vs. 'passenger' downstream targets following global chromatin perturbation.2) Response and resistance mechanisms to chromatin-targeted drugs:Chromatin regulators have emerged as popular drug targets in oncology and other human diseases and a number of epigenetic drugs are FDA-approved or in clinical development to treat cancer. However, little is known about the potential mechanisms and biomarkers that predict the response or resistance to these drugs. We plan to employ Crispr/Cas9-mediated genomic screening approaches to systematically study the mechanism of action underlying cancer epigenetic drugs.3) Novel tools to study chromatin functionality and dynamics:While traditional epigenomic profiling methods (eg. ChIP-seq) have greatly facilitated our understanding of chromatin organization, they provide largely correlative evidence and lack the ability to reveal functional and dynamic aspects of chromatin modifications. We are interested in developing new tools that allow us to study chromatin in high-resolution and in real-time.For more information, please visit ourlab website.\", 'Cathy Mendelsohn': 'Our research focuses on understanding normal and abnormal biology of the urothelium, a water-tight epithelial barrier lining the urinary outflow tract that protects against infection. The urothelium is nearly quiescent, but can rapidly undergo regeneration in response to injury from urinary tract infection or exposure to chemicals. Chronic injury or inflammation however, induces a shift from a urothelial differentiation program to a basal/squamous differentiation program generating an epithelium similar to skin. Our studies have used mouse models to identify major transcriptional and epigenetic regulators of urothelial differentiation both in the healthy urothelium and in bladder cancer, including nuclear receptors (Pparg, retinoids) and chromatin remodeling genes.Bladder cancers can be divided into distinct classes; Basal/Squamous tumors tend to be invasive, and are immune infiltrated, while luminal/papillary tumors tend to be less invasive, are exophytic, and have low levels of immune infiltration. Pparg, a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily promotes urothelial/luminal differentiation and suppresses basal/squamous differentiation. At present, most patients with high-grade Basal/squamous tumors undergo cystectomy, while lower grade papillary tumors can be resected by TURBT, but often regrow, and can become invasive. Deficiency in retinoids has long been known to induce squamous differentiation in a number of epithelial including the urothelium. We find that Pparg regulates urothelial differentiation at least in part, by up-regulating retinoid signaling and Kdm6a, a chromatin modifier required for retinoid signaling.Most recently, our studies have investigated the efficacy of a 2-drug treatment consisting of rosiglitazone, a synthetic Pparg agonist, and trametinib, a MEK/ERK inhibitor. Using a mouse model of basal/squamous muscle invasive bladder cancer, we show that either drug alone can restrict tumor growth, while the 2-drug combination induces tumor cell death within 7 days of treatment. Furthermore, the epithelium of rosiglitazone/trametinib treated mice undergoes a switch from basal/squamous differentiation which promotes tumor formation to urothelial differentiation; restoring endogenous cell types and functions, which are important for bladder stretch and physiology.\\xa0 An important goal, is translating these preclinical findings into a clinical study which is currently underway.', 'Emmanuelle Passegué': 'Our laboratory studies how hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) regulate blood production during the lifetime of an ever-changing organism. This fundamental question is central to tissue development, maintenance and regeneration, and has implications for every aspect of adult physiology ranging from response to stress, development of diseases, and biology of aging. We are interested in identifying the mechanisms that control HSC activity in normal and a range of deregulated conditions, with the goal of identifying affected genes and pathways that could be used to develop new therapies to treat human myeloid malignancies and help combat physiological aging. Towards this end, we are employing a variety of cross-disciplinary approaches using mouse models and human samples.', 'Rodney Rothstein': 'Studies on the cell biology of recombination are still in their infancy, and much remains to be uncovered in terms of the physical behavior of chromosomes, repair foci, and the factors that comprise them. The advent of cell biological techniques like protein tagging and observable chromosomal loci have permitted programs of experimentation that can address these fundamental questions of biology. By using these tools, we hope to unify physical phenomenology with genetic and biochemical models of recombination, permitting a complete understanding of this crucial process. In so doing, we hope to gain insight that may be consequential to studies of human disease and develop new and useful technologies for the manipulation of cells.We use budding yeast as an experimental organism to study essential biological processes and we are pursuing 3 main areas of research: (1) visualization of homologous recombination processes in real time in living cells with an emphasis on the behavior of the broken ends of a double-strand break, (2) identification of new interrelationships between players in the DNA repair pathways (especially for crosslinks), (3) examining the consequences of gene dysregulation in cancer cells, or during viral infection, to discover novel genetic interaction pathways to lead to therapeutic target discovery.1) We are currently studying the physical behavior of chromosomes in living cells and how they respond to DNA damage. We have found that increased mobility of chromosomes after DNA damage facilitates homology search. We are studying precisely how the DNA ends are processed after a double-strand break (DSB) by creating site-specific DSBs using meganucleases, TALENÂ®s and CRISPR-Cas9. Each DNA end flanking the DSB is fluorescently tagged along with the repair template on the homolog. After induction of a DSB, we can visualize repair proteins recruited to the ends before the homology search begins. We observe tight a temporal covariance among increased chromosome mobility, the physical pairing of homologous loci and the resultant gene conversion events. A key question is what happens to the second end of the break during HDR. We have designed a system with chromosomal tags on both ends of the break to allow us to independently visualize each end and track its behavior before, during, and after HR. By determining the precise choreography of DNA end movement during repair, we will better understand many of the open questions surrounding the resolution of DSBs. How often does synthesis-dependent strand annealing occur? How are crossovers and non-crossovers physically mediated? How are broken ends guided to repair substrates and foci? The effects on these processes of mutations in DNA repair pathway proteins are being examined to reveal the driving principles underlying how chromosomes physically respond to damage.2) Analysis of pairwise combinations of double mutants provides a powerful method for determining relationships with a genetic pathway (e.g., epistasis or suppression). Such a genetic analysis becomes increasingly robust when combined with sensitizing conditions, such as treatment with a DNA damaging agent. We have developed an approach that focuses our attention on sub-networks of the DNA damage response by first identifying sets of strains that are sensitive to a particular DNA damaging agent. Next, under the same damaging conditions, pairwise crosses are performed of this subset of strains, which includes known DNA damage repair mutants. By applying this approach to a DNA crosslinking reagent, cisplatin, which is an important chemotherapeutic compound, we have identified over 150 genes involved in cisplatin sensitivity, some of which were not previously recognized as part of the DNA repair response network. Examination of systematic pairwise combinations of these mutations will reveal the global organization of this repair network.3) We have developed methods to rapidly screen the entire yeast gene disruption library to reveal genetic interactions between overexpression of a protein and deletion/mutation of more than 5,500 chromosomal genes. These interactions reveal the pathways that are affected when particular proteins are mis-expressed. Although many cancer genomics and genome-wide expression studies have highlighted the important relationship between gene dosage and phenotype, little attention has been given to studying the effect of gene overexpression. To understand the biological consequences of mis-expression, we overexpress the yeast homolog of the cancer protein of interest and identify genetic interactions. These interactions are often preserved in human cells and reveal interactions that are useful in guiding personalized chemotherapy in cancer patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are using our expression system to explore the pathways that are affected when SAR2-CoV-2 proteins are expressed after infection. We are focusing on viral proteins that target the endoplasmic reticulum to assemble the viral replicon.', 'Eric A. Schon': 'Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles that contain their own genetic machinery. As such, they operate under the dual genetic controls of nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Mitochondrial genetics differs markedly from mendelian genetics, because first, mitochondria are inherited exclusively from the mother, and second, there are hundreds or thousands of mitochondria (and mtDNAs) per cell. Biochemically, the most relevant aspect of mitochondrial function is the production of oxidative energy via the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation. There are maternally-inherited, mendelian-inherited, sporadic, and even environmentally-induced mitochondrial disorders, most of which are fatal. We are studying the molecular basis of a number of these diseases, often using cytoplasmic hybrids, or \"cybrids,\" that contain known proportions of mutant or wild-type mtDNAs in clonal cell lines that have no contaminating mtDNA background. We have also begun a project on treating mtDNA-based disease using pharmacological approaches aimed at \"shifting heteroplasmy\" in order to restore respiratory function in patient-derived cells. Most recently we have become interested in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and have discovered that presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and gamma-secretase activity itself, are located predominantly in a specialized subcompartment of the ER that is physically and biochemically connected to mitochondria, called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM). We have found that cells from AD patients have massively increased ER-mitochondrial communication, which may help explain many of the seemingly unrelated features of the disease. We believe that this hyperconnectivity plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of AD, with implications for both diagnosis and treatment of this devastating disorder.', 'Mimi Shirasu-Hiza': \"Our laboratory aims to understand how specific circadian-regulated physiological functions contribute to health and disease using Drosophila melanogaster. Circadian rhythm, or the oscillation of biological functions over the 24 hour day, is increasingly recognized as an important factor in human health. Many diseases have a circadian component, particularly inflammatory diseases. For example, you are most likely to have a heart attack at 8 am, flares of rheumatoid arthritis at 6 am, and an asthma attack at 4 am. Moreover, many diseases (bacterial infeciton, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, bipolar disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, breast cancer, aging) are associated with loss of circadian regulation. How does loss of circadian regulation accelerate or delay the progression of disease? We found that, in the fly, circadian mutants are immunocompromised against bacterial pathogens and that the immunity of wild-type flies oscillates with circadian rhythm: flies have different survival times depending on the time of day that they are infected. We now have three major foci for our research: innate immune cell function; metabolism; and sleep. Our overarching goal is to use circadian biology as a prism to understand the interaction, coordination, and regulation of complex physiologies in the whole animal that contribute to disease pathology.\", 'Mijo Simunovic': 'The first days of animal embryo development are perhaps the most remarkable example of tissue self-organization in all of biology. This process comprises several key developmental milestones, including implantation, the separation of the embryo from the placenta, and gastrulation, which establishes the coordinate system on which all the future organs will form. Perhaps one of the oldest questions in all of biology is how, despite tremendous conservation in embryonic pathways, we develop into completely differently looking organisms – a human always looks like a human and a mouse always looks like a mouse. If we understand these phenomena in great detail, we can harness them and faithfully mimic organ formation in a lab. At the interface of chemical engineering, developmental biology and biophysics, Mijo Simunovic uses human pluripotent stem cells to elucidate the molecular details and the biomechanics underlying early human embryogenesis and organogenesis, with goals to advancing reproductive and regenerative medicine and to faithfully modeling complex human diseases.Organoids are complex tissues derived from stem cells that mimic important aspects of actual organ formation, including biochemical signaling, cellular diversity, and tissue transformations. Simunovic has previously generated an organoid model of the human epiblast, which is the embryonic tissue that gives rise to all the organs. He used this model to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of symmetry breaking, the key first step in establishing the body plan. Following on these efforts, Simunovic builds quantitative organoids to mimic the mechanisms of human embryo implantation and gastrulation; essentially, to understand how we are formed. Beyond elucidating basic biology, Simunovic engineers organoid assays to model various diseases. He is particularly interested in understanding mechanisms of very early embryogenesis whose impairment is the leading cause of pregnancy failure and ectopic pregnancies. Working with biologists and clinicians, Simunovic is also building organ-on-chip technologies to understand the complexity of organ tissues and to modeling complex human diseases.Simunovic received his BS and MS in Chemistry from the University of Zagreb.

This includes transcription factors that recruit enzymes to express genes as well as an evolving understanding of the 3-dimensional chromatin architecture which brings together either DNA enhancer regions to activate genes or DNA insulation regions to silence genes. Structural scaffold proteins such at CTCF and the cohesin complex are essential in maintaining the integrity of local DNA structural interactions within defined neighborhoods known as topologically associating domains (TADs).These proteins provide dynamic structure within the TAD which is essential in influencing dynamic cell-type specific transcriptional programs. Genes which contribute to transcriptional regulation, including members of the cohesin complex, are frequently mutated in human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (12-20%), glioblastoma multiforme (5%), bladder cancer (20-35%) and Ewing sarcoma (40-50%).The functional consequences of chromatin structure in regulating lineage-specification, signal-dependent responses, and local/distant DNA structure has not been fully elucidated, however, our recent work has established the requirement of suitable chromatin architecture for the function of cell-type specific transcription factors to activate gene responsible for blood formation bone marrow stem cell differentiation.Our laboratory uses genetic mouse models and primary patient samples to understand the role of altered chromatin architecture as a regulator of gene expression/gene silencing that maintain the balance of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal with differentiation and blood formation.', 'Debra J Wolgemuth': 'Genetic control of mammalian germ cell differentiation.The research interests of the Wolgemuth lab focus on understanding the genetic control of gametogenesis and embryogenesis using mouse models and gene targeting, transgenic, and molecular and cell biological approaches. The first of the three major projects involves understanding the function of the A and E-type cyclins during the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles mainly during spermatogenesis but also in oogenesis. We have demonstrated that cyclin A1 is essential for the progression of spermatocytes into the first meiotic division, that cyclin A2 is required for mitotic divisions of male germ cell stem cells, and that the E-type cyclins have unexpected function during meiosis, notably in the maintenance of telomere integrity. A second area of research involves elucidating the function of the BET family of double bromodomain-containing proteins, proteins that read epigenetic marks, during germ cell differentiation and neural development. We showed that the BET family member BRDT is essential for proper chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation during meiotic prophase and also during spermiogenesis and that BRD2 is essential for embryonic survival and neural differentiation and function, in particular in the etiology of seizure susceptibility. We have recently generated a conditional knockout model ofBrd2which will allow us to determine its function in adult tissues, including the germ line. Finally, the lab is pursuing studies on the role of retinoid signaling during male germ cell differentiation, again in using molecular genetic approaches in the mouse model, and more recently, pharmacologic intervention. We have used a pan-antagonist of the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to disrupt spermatogenesis and induce sterility, importantly in a reversible manner.

The laboratory focuses on three major directions to study epigenetic inheritance and cancer epigenetics.

A cost-benefit relationship — between the collateral damage associated with an inflammatory response and the benefit of inflammation in protecting the host from infection — imparts a selective pressure that ensures the magnitude of a response is proportional to the potential threat encountered. To achieve homeostasis, the immune system must balance pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to neutralize invading pathogens while limiting or preventing damage to surrounding tissue. At mucosal barriers — which are colonized by diverse communities of commensal microbes and serve to interface the internal physiology of an organism with the ever-changing external environment — fine-tuning opposing immune responses is of even greater relevance. Constant exposure to novel environmental antigens and high concentrations of microbial ligands that can activate innate immune receptors increase the risk for persistent inflammatory activation. As a result, complex immune networks operate to contextualize diverse microbial and environmental stimuli. These inputs subsequently shape mucosal immune responses and synergize to preserve mucosal barrier integrity and function. Consequently, aberrant immune responses, due to a breakdown in tolerance or defects in barrier maintenance, largely underlie the etiology of chronic mucosal inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\", 'Uttiya Basu': 'Our studies have led to the unexpected conclusion that a significant portion of the mammalian genome transcribes noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and that the RNA exosome, a component of the cellular ncRNA surveillance machinery, rapidly decays some of the ensuing ncRNAs. Two questions have arisen: is there a biological function of ncRNA decay of such large and unprecedented nature, and what are the pathophysiological consequences of failure of ncRNA decay? Using B-lymphocytes as a model system, our laboratory has pioneered studies demonstrating that surveillance and decay of the ncRNA transcriptome is an important mechanism for development and function of mammalian cells and when compromised, causes genomic instability, immune system dysregulation, and genetic alterations specific to cancer initiation.In normal conditions, RNA surveillance pathway components orchestrate programmed immunoglobulin locus recombination by facilitating access of the DNA mutator AID to single strand DNA sequences stripped of inhibitory ncRNAs. Thus, our study provides the first evidence that RNA-decay machinery can be specifically targeted to a particular region of the mammalian genome to facilitate a defined biological function.We discovered that when RNA surveillance pathways are suppressed by various genetic mutations, transcription associated DNA/RNA hybrids are not efficiently unwound leading to DNA mutagenesis and translocations. In pathophysiological conditions like in lymphomagenesis the RNA exosome subunit and cofactors are mutated; likewise, the developmental defects leading to Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia are caused by restricted ncRNA decay mediated by RNA exosome. Thus, our current studies highlight the relationship of RNA surveillance and transcription associated DNA mutagenesis in human diseases related to the immune and nervous systems.', 'Hachung Chung': 'Decades of research in innate immunity has unraveled how the host uses pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect microbial DNA and RNA to mount an immune response that counteracts infection. However, these findings raise an intriguing question: How does the host suppress immune responses to their own DNA or RNA? This is a fundamental question in biology and a topic of high clinical relevance as we start to recognize how self-nucleic acid sensing by our immune system can cause autoimmune diseases, and also be used for immunomodulatory therapies for diseases such as cancer.', 'Lei Ding': 'Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play critical roles in the generation, repair and homeostasis of the blood and immune system via self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. They are maintained for life through self-renewing divisions where HSCs divide to produces HSC daughter cells. How self-renewal is regulated is a central question in stem cell biology. HSC self-renewal is regulated by both HSC intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. In vivo, HSCs reside in a complex microenvironment and are critically regulated by factors secreted by cells that comprise a specialized niche. The HSC niche represents a critical element responsible for the extrinsic regulation of HSC self-renewal. Alterations to the microenvironment can contribute to the development of leukemia, bone marrow failure syndromes and anemia. We are investigating extrinsic mechanisms that regulate HSC self-renewal, and how mis-regulation of niche/HSC interactions contributes to diseases such as cancer and anemia. Understanding the HSC niche is a key step in helping design better strategies forin vitroexpansion of HSCs, and for treatment of niche related diseases such as leukemia and anemia.', 'Donna Farber': 'Research in the laboratory is focused on immunological memory and specifically on memory T cells as essential mediators of protective immunity. While it was previously thought that memory T cells mediate their protective responses through rapid migration and surveillance through tissues, it is now become clear that localization and establishment of non-circulating memory T cells resident in tissue sites is integral to immune protection. We are incorporating fundamental studies on mouse models with novel translational approaches on human samples to investigate tissue immune responses. We have identified a new subset of non-circulating tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in the lung that mediate optimal protective immunity in a mouse model of influenza infection. Current studies into mechanisms for how memory T cells become targeted to and maintained in the lung use total transcriptome profiling and bioinformatics approaches. We have identified novel roles for specific integrins and inflammatory mediators in this process, and are studying the signaling pathways involved in resident memory T cell generation and functional recall.', 'Sankar Ghosh': 'Groundbreaking discoveries over many decades have confirmed and elaborated on the close connection between the immune system and a host of diseases of major importance to public health, including cancer, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes and celiac disease.

Medical interventions that manipulate the immune system to target cancer, so-called cancer immunotherapies, have seen spectacular results in the treatment of certain tumors. And this is just the beginning.The Ghosh lab has a long-standing interest in understanding and elucidating the complexities of transcriptional regulation, with a particular focus on the innate and adaptive immune system. As pathological changes to the transcriptional programs of immune cells lie at the heart of many diseases, we aim to obtain a deep, mechanistic understanding of the pathways that establish, maintain and fine-tune the immunological transcriptome. Based on this knowledge, we hope to devise novel, innovative approaches to combat some of humanities most vexing afflictions.Current projects in the Ghosh lab include:', 'Arnold Han': 'Our research investigates the function of T cells as they pertain to human diseases, including cancer and autoimmunity.', 'Yuefeng Huang': 'Higher-level organisms have evolved multi-layered immune systems, including physical barriers of skin and mucous membranes and soluble effector and cellular effector components to prevent pathologic colonization. Within these systems, adaptive T lymphocytes have for many years been considered the essential component of host cell-mediated immunity, using antigen-binding receptors to detect a wide array of ligands. In the past decade, another set of lymphocytes, namely innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), has been recognized to play critical roles in immunity against infections, especially during the early time window prior to T cell activation. ILCs lack antigen-specific receptors but resemble the effector phenotype and function of polarized T cell subsets in cytokine-induced cytokine production. ILC are enriched in mucosal barriers but are also found in secondary lymphoid or non-lymphoid tissues, contributing to host defense, tissue repair, metabolic homeostasis, inflammation and autoimmune disorders.', 'Ivaylo Ivanov': 'A vast and diverse community of microorganisms lives in a symbiotic relationship within the human body. These resident microorganisms, mostly composed of bacteria, are also known as the commensal microbiota. Commensal bacteria are indispensible for the proper metabolic and immune functions of the host. It has recently become obvious that commensal bacteria are important modulators of intestinal immune homeostasis and that the composition of the microbiota is a major determining factor of the type and robustness of mucosal immune responses.', 'Hans-Willem Snoeck': 'The research program of the Snoeck lab primarily focuses on hematopoiesis with the aim to improve bone marrow transplantation and gene therapy targeted at hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and gain insight in leukemogenesis. To achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in self-renewal of HSCs, we have mapped genes underlying quantitative genetic variation in the behavior of HSCs among inbred mouse strains. After identifying allelic variation in the Prdm16 gene as one of the underlying mechanisms, the lab now focuses on the mechanism of action of Prdm16 in the renewal of HSCs. Expansion of this program into directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent state cells (iPSCs) (collectively called human pluritpotent cells (hPSCs)) arose from the desire to attempt to alleviate post-bone marrow transplantation immune deficiency, caused, among others, by defective T cell reconstitution. Furthermore, the capacity to generate thymic epithelial cells from human pluripotent stem cells will allow the generation of the next generation of \"personal immune\" mice. As the thymus develops from the anterior foregut endoderm, the approaches we developed also led to strategies to generate virtually every type of cell of the respiratory system from hPSCs.', 'Megan Sykes': 'Major areas of focus in the Sykes lab include organ allograft tolerance induction, xenotransplantation tolerance and Type 1 diabetes.', 'Shan Zha': 'The diversity and specificity of the adaptive immune system is achieved through somatic assembly and subsequent modification of antigen receptor genes in developing lymphocytes. Specifically, functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes are assembled from germline variable, diversity and joining gene fragments through V(D)J recombination. In peripheral lymphoid organs, the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is further modified through class switch recombination to achieve different effector functions. While V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination are initiated by a lymphocyte-specific cleavage mechanism, the repair of DNA double-strand break intermediates is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed non-homologous end-joining pathway. Moreover, like other DNA damage events, physiological DNA breaks activate DNA damage responses to enforce cell cycle arrest and achieve efficient and precise repair. Not surprisingly, defects in the DNA repair pathways can block lymphocyte development, leading to congenital primary immunodeficiency. Reducing the fidelity of DNA repair increases the risk of chromosomal translocations that can cause leukemia and lymphoma. The clinical treatment of human lymphomas and leukemias often induces additional DNA damage, which needs to be repaired by the non-homologous end-joining pathway with the help of DNA damage response factors. Therefore, elucidating the cellular pathways that mediate DNA repair, understanding their molecular mechanisms of action, and evaluating theirin vivofunctions in animal models will yield critical information for the clinical management of both immunodeficiencies and lymphoid malignancies.', 'Jonathan Dworkin': 'My laboratory is interested in the mechanisms used by quiescent cells to survive stressful conditions, such as nutrient limitation with particular attention on how these strategies affect antibiotic sensitivity including the emergence of tolerance (“persisters”).

This haploid apicomplexan parasite causes disease in over half a billion individuals and kills over a million African children yearly, and prevents sterilizing immunity from being acquired even by individuals who have been infected thousands of times. Disease can result from severe anemia, hyperparasitemia, or other complications resulting from sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (RBC) in the microvasculature, a process that depends on the presentation of antigenically distinct parasite proteins on the infected RBC surface. Chemotherapeutic clearance of asexual blood stage parasites is the linchpin of malaria treatment and control, however it is systematically thwarted by the acquisition of resistance. The most dramatic consequence has been with chloroquine (CQ), for decades the gold standard until resistance appeared and pre-empted a dramatic increase in malaria mortality and morbidity rates, particularly in Africa.During my past 30 years of malaria research, I have investigated howP. falciparuminvades and develops within hepatocytes and RBC, what immune effector mechanisms operate on these stages, how antimalarials act and how parasites counter their action, and how parasites are successfully transmitted toAnophelesmosquitoes, their definitive host. My laboratory's ongoing and planned research channels these interests into several themes:1) What are the parasite factors that mediate resistance to antimalarial drugs;2) What biological processes are targeted by antimalarial drugs and what accounts for parasite death;3) What biochemical and physiological functions are intrinsic to the digestive vacuole (DV) and the apicoplast, the site of action of CQ and of antibiotics respectively; and4) How doesP. falciparum regulateits virulence and prevent the establishment of protective immunity.These studies benefit from our extensive experience inP. falciparumtransfection and we constantly strive for new innovations in genetics to enhance the power of these investigations.\", 'Yiping W.

We are investigating the structure and function of two class C GPCRs, human GABA(B) receptor and calcium-sensing (CaS) receptor. Our goal is to understand the ligand-dependent activation mechanism of these receptors.Human GABA(B) receptor mediates inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. It functions as an obligatory heterodimer of GBR1 and GBR2 subunits. We determined the extracellular-domain structures of GABA(B) receptor in three functional states: in the apo form, bound to six different antagonists, and bound to two different agonists. Our structures revealed the molecular mechanisms of orthosteric ligand recognition and showed that receptor activation involves the formation of a novel heterodimer interface between membrane proximal-domains of both subunits.We recently solved a near full-length structure of GABA(B) receptor, captured in the inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure revealed a novel heterodimer interface between the transmembrane (TM) helices 3 and 5 of both GABA(B) subunits. This interface embodies the signature of GABA(B) receptor’s inactive conformation. Furthermore, we identified a unique Â¢intersubunit latchÂ¢ motif within this TM interface that maintains the inactive state of the receptor. Its disruption through mutation results in constitutive receptor activity. We also discovered multiple ligands pre-associated with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids embedded within the TM domains to modulate receptor function and maintain receptor integrity.Human CaS receptor maintains extracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. We solved the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaS receptor in the resting and active conformations. We provided direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft, and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation.Using anomalous difference maps, we identified multiple novel binding sites for Ca(2+) that are located throughout the extracellular domain. Ca(2+) fulfills two functional roles. First, it maintains the structural integrity of CaS receptor. Second, it is directly involved in receptor activation as it facilitates the formation of a homodimer interface that is unique to the active state. Our results indicate that amino acids and Ca(2+) are co-agonists of CaS receptor, acting jointly to trigger receptor activation.Our structures revealed multiple binding sites for PO4(3-). PO4(3-) is also important for structural integrity of the receptor, but it inhibits receptor activity. Therefore, activation of CaS receptor involves an intricate interplay of amino acids, Ca(2+), and PO4(3-).', 'Neil L. Harrison': 'The Harrison laboratory is interested in synaptic transmission, especially at inhibitory synapses, which are necessary for the normal processing of information in the mammalian brain. Failure of synaptic inhibition leads to epilepsy, while enhancement of synaptic inhibition is associated with reduced anxiety, muscle relaxation, sedation, hypnosis and anesthesia. The lab studies the details of inhibitory synaptic function, its modulation and plasticity, using a variety of modern electrophysiological and molecular biological techniques. Projects within the lab study these synapses at several different levels of organization, including brain slice, single cell and subcellular preparations. A major focus of the lab is on the GABA-A receptor, the principal receptor protein at inhibitory synapses in the brain. The lab personnel include physiologists, biophysicists, molecular biologists and pharmacologists.', 'Jonathan A. Javitch': 'One main line of research in my laboratory is aimed at understanding the structural bases of agonist and antagonist binding and specificity in the dopamine D2-like receptors and related biogenic amine receptor, how agonist binding is transduced into G protein activation, and the structural basis for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization and its role in signaling. In the pursuit of these objectives we are carrying out research on the dopamine D2 receptor as well as several other GPCRs. The D2 receptor is the principal target of antipsychotic drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia.Other research in my laboratory is focused on determining the structural bases of the transport of substrate by the dopamine transporter and its inhibition by drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine. We are also studying regulation of the trafficking and function of the dopamine transporter and its role in sensitization. Several lines of evidence support the relevance of sensitization to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including the ability of amphetamine and other psychostimulants to induce psychosis in normal subjects and the increased sensitivity of patients with schizophrenia to the psychotogenic effects of psychostimulants.Our laboratory also studies a number of bacterial homologs of the neurotransmitter transporters as model systems for direct structural studies, including X-ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy, and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, which we are pursuing in collaboration with colleagues. Our work focuses primarily on the molecular and cellular level, and we also are using mice and fruit flies as model systems to probe the relevance of these molecular details to psychostimulant-induced behaviors.', 'Robert S. Kass': \"The focus of Dr. Kass' research program is the structure and function of ion channels that are expressed primarily in the heart. Dr. Kass has directed NIH and/or NSF sponsored research for forty-two years that has contributed to our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular basis of cardiac electrical activity through a multidisciplinary approach bridging basic biophysical and clinical science. Contributions from this work include the cellular basis of calcium-dependent arrhythmogenic activity in the heart, basic mechanisms of action of calcium channel blocking drugs, and the molecular events underlying the control of the duration of electrical events in the heart during sympathetic nerve stimulation. His laboratory has focused on understanding the molecular physiology and pharmacology of congenital arrhythmias. These arrhythmias are caused by inherited mutations in genes coding for ion channels and/or ion channel related proteins expressed in the heart. This work has contributed to an understanding of gene-specific risk factors caused by mutation-induced changes in heart ion channel activity, and to the development of a mutation-specific approach to manage these disorders. The mutation-specific therapeutic strategy, verified in genotyped patients, has established the principle that two variants of the same genetic disorder require dramatically different therapeutic strategies for disease management based on biophysical properties of specific genetic lesions. This approach has evolved from close collaborations with clinical colleagues in which information is shared from clinic to basic laboratory and back to clinic. Additional studies are aimed at unraveling the structural basis of mutation-induced, and potentially lethal, disease phenotypes using approaches such as voltage-clamp fluorometry to directly measure movement of gating machinery in the ion channel of interest as well as biochemical methods of directly probing structures of region of ion channels that are hotspots for disease-causing mutations and the use of computer-based modeling to understand both structure and functional consequences of these mutations. Work has additionally more recently focused on potassium ion channel mutations that underlie a form of heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension. This work has provided information not only of novel pathways that contribute to this disease, but also to new routes of therapeutic management of this disorder. The goal of this approach is to unmask new and specific targets for the development of anti-arrhythmic drugs. Currently, work in the laboratory focused on the study of mechanisms underlying heritable arrhythmias in the context of complex genetic backgrounds has studied the cellular electrophysiology of cardiomyocytes differentiated from inducible pluripotent stem cells derived from family members of patients harboring disease-causing mutations. This approach has offered opportunities to screen drugs for effective disease management when multiple genes may be involved in the disease phenotype.\", 'Christoph Kellendonk': 'The Kellendonk laboratory uses circuit dissection tools in the mouse to understand the biology that underlies cognitive, negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. To this end we have been manipulating the expression levels of dopamine D2 receptors and neuronal activity in genetically defined sub-circuits of the striatum and studied the consequences of these manipulations on behavior and circuit function. Using similar approaches, we have been studying the role of thalamo-prefrontal circuits in cognition and working memory. Recently, we began to address the role of dopamine in the generation of false percepts which has relevance to auditory hallucinations in humans.', 'Steven Owen Marx': 'The Marx laboratory studies the regulation of ion channels by macromolecular complexes. We have demonstrated that specific sequences within the ion channel (leucine zippers) recruit regulatory proteins, which modulate the ion channel function in normal and pathologic conditions. The laboratory is now focused on understanding the molecular components and functional implications of macromolecular complex formation of the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa, maxi-K) and the L-type voltage gated calcium channel. The laboratory utilizes both molecular biologic and electrophysiologic (planar lipid bilayer, patch clamp) techniques to elucidate these fundamental processes and emphasizes the links between these fundamental molecular processes and systems function. To date our work has had significant impact in understanding the triggers of fatal cardiac arrhythmias and mechanical dysfunction in heart failure. Present experiments are very likely to impact our understanding of control of peripheral blood pressure by the sympathetic nervous system.', 'Steven A. Siegelbaum': 'We are interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying electrical signaling and synaptic transmission in the nervous system, and how these electrical signals give rise to complex behaviors. We focus on how ion channels and synaptic transmission regulate information flow in the cortico-hippocampal circuit, which plays a critical role in learning and memory. One area of research explores the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (the HCN channels) in regulating dendritic integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. We found that genetic deletion of the HCN1 channel from hippocampus enhances synaptic excitation, the induction of long-term plasticity and, surprisingly, spatial learning and memory. As these channels have also been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric diseases, we are now examining the molecular mechanisms that regulate HCN1 channel expression and trafficking in both normal and disease states. A second project examines the role of the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus, an area first identified in 1934 but which has received little attention over the past 80 years. We have developed a mouse like that enables us to selectively inactivate CA2, which we find produces a very specific deficit in the encoding of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember a conspecific. We are now examining the CA2 neural circuitry in more detail to determine how this region participates in memory encoding. As data from individuals with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders suggest the presence of alterations in the CA2 region, we are using mouse models of neuropsychiatric disease to explore the possible role of altered CA2 function in the social endophenotypes of these disorders.', 'Susan F. Steinberg': 'The studies in my laboratory aim to identify the mechanisms that underlie the physiologically important changes in cardiomyocyte adrenergic receptor responsiveness that accompany normal cardiac development, that influence the evolution of heart failure, or that contribute to cardiac injury in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress. Our studies take advantage of a wide range of reductionist molecular and cell biological approaches in both cell culture and in vitro models to study the expression and subcellular localization of adrenergic receptor subtypes, to identify the adrenergic receptor binding partners and effectors that dictate signaling specificity in cardiomyocytes, and to understand the molecular basis for catecholamine-dependent cardiomyocyte remodeling. One area of particular interest has been the stimulus- (in some cases redox-) dependent post-translational modifications on signaling kinases such as protein kinase C and protein kinase D that alter their enzymology. We also have identified post-translational processing (involving an O-glycan-regulated proteolytic cleavage) of the beta1-adrenergic receptor N-terminus as a mechanism that calibrates signaling output to downstream effector responses. In both cases, these studies identify novel molecular determinants that can serve as druggable targets.', 'David Sulzer': \"Dr. Sulzer's lab investigates the function and alteration of the synapses of the cortex and the basal ganglia including the dopamine system in normal behaviors such as habit formation and action selection, and in diseases of the system. Their work has made fundamental contributions to understanding the roles of these synapses in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, schizophrenia, autism, and drug addiction. His laboratory developed new optical, electrophysiological and electrochemical methods including the first direct recordings of quantal neurotransmitter release from synapses, the fundamental unit of neurotransmission, and the first optical methods to observe neurotransmitter release and reuptake. His work increased the understanding of the life cycle of synaptic vesicles, cellular structures that package neurotransmitter release.Among the discoveries and inventions of the laboratory are 1) discovery of co-release of glutamate from dopamine neurons (with Stephen Rayport) 2) introduction of the weak base mechanism of amphetamine action and the first direct measurement of reverse transport, an important property of amphetamine 3) the first recording of quantal neurotransmitter release from CNS synapses, by using amperometry at dopamine terminals 4) discovery of multiple means to alter quantal size, including the effects of L-DOPA, amphetamine, vesicle transporter expression (with Robert Edwards), rebound hyperacidification, and discovery of fusion pore flickering 5) discovery of the biosynthetic pathway of neuromelanin 6) introduction of & the role of autophagic degradation in synaptic development, which may underlie forms of autism, 7) discovery of how alpha-synuclein and other proteins are degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy, which may underlie forms of Parkinson’s (with Ana Maria Cuervo) 8) the first optical analysis of corticostriatal transmission, showing the role of activity, dopamine, and acetylcholine in synaptic selection (with Nigel Bamford) 9) co-invention of fluorescent false neurotransmitters, the first optical means to observe neurotransmitter release and reuptake from CNS terminals (with Dalibor Sames) 10) discovered the role of glutamate in controlling axonal outgrowth and branching 11) discovery of antigen presentation by neurons targeted in Parkinson’s disease, which may underlie targeted cell death.The Sulzer lab has published over 140 papers on this research and has received awards from the McKnight, Helmsely, Picower, Michael J Fox, Simons, HDSA Foundations, NIH, and NARSAD.\", 'Shi Du Yan': \"Molecular and cellular processes of Alzheimer's disease, renal disease, brain tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases.\", 'Dian Yang': 'We are generally interested in investigating the fundamental principles of tumor evolution and identifying key regulators of tumor progression.\\xa0 Our research is at the interface ofcancer biology,technology development,and computational analysis, which combines CRISPR-based molecular recording tools, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), single cell genomics-related algorithm development, and in vivo functional assays.The main goal of the Yang lab is to investigate the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing cancer cell state transitions and ultimately develop a quantitative roadmap of tumor\\xa0evolution.Towards this goal,we have recently developed an autochthonous“KP-Tracer” mouse model, which allows us to continuously monitor the processes by which a single cell harboring oncogenic mutations evolves into an aggressive tumor.

We will dissect the cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern cancer cell state transitions, and identify the regulatory gene networks that drive cancer evolution. Furthermore, our lab is committed to expanding the molecular recording toolkits, enabling more precise and detailed reconstruction of tumor life histories. Through these collaborative efforts, we strive to reconstruct the entire trajectory of tumor development, capturing the process from a single transformed cell to a complex and aggressive tumor population, with unprecedented scale and resolution. Ultimately, this holistic approach will pave the way for the development of predictive models of tumor evolution, advancing our ability to predict and potentially intervene in cancer progression.', 'Yonghao Yu': 'Our understanding of how the biology of various diseases relates to the central dogma that DNA encodes RNA, which encodes protein has been buoyed by rapid technological advances in DNA and RNA sequencing and has led to some of the first advances in personalized medicine. However, characterization of the final and arguably most actionable element of the central dogma, protein, has lagged behind. Among the various proteomic parameters, a comprehensive description of the landscape of covalent protein modifications in any given cell is particularly challenging. Our research efforts are highly multidisciplinary, which have been largely focused on two programs, i.e., (1) novel protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and (2) novel covalent protein modifications by small molecule drugs. Regarding (1), the entire repertoire of protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is enormous, with ~400 different known types, and many more unknown ones (i.e., the “dark proteome”). PTMs are inaccessible by genomic sequencing tools. Instead, they are almost exclusively analyzed by proteomic technologies. The functional characterization of a PTM event ultimately depends on the unequivocal assignment of the modification site. However, the chemical natures of PTMs are diverse, and many types of PTMs are not amenable to traditional proteomic technologies for site-localization with single amino acid resolution because they are, for example, labile, heterogeneous or low-abundance. We have developed a multidisciplinary program (i.e., chemical biology, quantitative-/chemo-proteomics, computation biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and animal models) towards the functional analyses of a number of important PTMs, including protein tyrosine sulfation, phosphorylation and Poly-ADP-ribosylation. Regarding (2), besides these naturally occurring PTMs, covalent protein modification has been increasingly appreciated as a novel therapeutic modality. The current efforts on drug development have been mostly focused on targeting a small fraction of the human proteome with good pharmacological tractability (e.g., kinases). It has been estimated, however, that approximately 90% of human proteins (e.g., transcription factors, adaptors and intrinsically disordered proteins) have not been effectively targeted by small-molecule drugs, because, for example, they lack traditionally defined binding pockets. We have also been particularly active in the development of covalent protein modification and chemoproteomic technologies that potentially will revolutionize the principle of drug development by pushing the boundaries of the druggable proteome.', 'Larry Abbott': \"Computational and Mathematical Analysis of Neurons and Neural NetworksLarry Abbott's research involves the computational modeling and mathematical analysis of neurons and neural networks. Analytic techniques and computer simulation are used to study how single neurons respond to their many synaptic inputs, how neurons interact to produce functioning neural circuits, and how large populations of neurons represent, store, and process information. Areas of particular interest include spike-timing dependent forms of synaptic plasticity, transformations of sensory encoding in olfaction, and the dynamics of internally generated activity and signal propagation in large neural networks.Most neural activity is generated internally but nervous systems are nevertheless highly sensitive to external influences such as sensory stimuli. We study how stimulus driven and internally generative activity interact and combine to produce responses. We also model how chaotic ongoing activity can be harnessed and controlled to produce useful motor output. We are interested in representing perception not as a passive analysis of sensory input, but as a dynamic process that involves modeling the external world, making inferences about predictable events and noting when something unexpected happens. This requires both representing sensory stimuli and modifying ongoing activity through synaptic plasticity.\", 'Dmitriy Aronov': 'The ultimate goal of my lab is to understand the relationship between neuronal activity dynamics and the states of cognitive experience, like memories and thoughts. We focus on the hippocampal/entorhinal system, which is critically involved in the formation and retrieval of memories. Studies of this circuit have traditionally focused on navigation, uncovering a rich representation of spatial variables in the firing of its neurons. Yet, spatial location is only one component of memory. Beyond location, memories contain a mix of sensory, temporal, behavioral and emotional information. We are trying to understand how all these diverse types of information are encoded in the hippocampal/entorhinal system and bound together into a coherent representation.Rat virtual reality. In one line of research, we are developing and using rat virtual reality (VR) systems in order to obtain unprecedented experimental control of the animal’s sensory environment. VR allows rapid, closed-loop manipulations of the animal’s sensory and behavioral context, coupled with uninterrupted neural recordings and manipulations. We are beginning to understand how behaviorally relevant sensory information is organized in the activity of the hippocampal/entorhinal circuit. By training rats to perform sophisticated memory-guided tasks in VR, we also aim to understand how the states of activity in this circuit contribute to behaviors that require memory retrieval.Food caching by birds. In a parallel line of research, we will study how memories are processed during a fascinating and highly specialized behavior – the caching and subsequent retrieval of hidden food items by black-capped chickadees. Chickadees use their hippocampal formation to perform this memory-guided task. However, compared to its mammalian counterpart, the avian hippocampal system is anatomically simpler and more tractable on the circuit level. Using automated laboratory caching arenas inspired by VR, combined with miniaturized technologies for small birds, we plan to investigate neural representations of cache memories and the contributions of these representations to behavior.', 'Rudy Behnia': 'Animals face complex environments teeming with sensory stimuli. Light, odor, taste, sound and touch need to be properly encoded in the brain to allow them to understand their natural surrounding and adapt their behavior to survive and thrive. Light in particular is an essential cue for many diurnal animals: it is sensed in the eye by photoreceptors; highly specialized neurons that detect photons. How do neuronal circuits in the brain accurately interpret these photoreceptor signals to extract a variety of features of the visual scene, such as object shape, color, and depth of field? Using the fruit fly model system, we are teasing apart the neuronal circuits underlying two aspects of vision: motion detection and color discrimination. We use a variety of complementary techniques:in vivosingle cell patch-clamp recordings, two-photon activity-imaging, optogenetic as well as behavioral paradigms. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand how the properties of specific neuronal types and their connectivity within sensory circuits allow for the computations necessary for sensory perception.', 'Mark Churchland': 'The brain is not only a remarkable computational organ – capable of feats that stymie the best computers and robots – it is the seat of who we are and all we think.\\xa0 Yet despite such romantic notions, modern systems neuroscience has principally asked how the brain transforms inputs into outputs.\\xa0 This approach has deep historical roots – Descartes, Sherrington – and fabulous modern successes – Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel.\\xa0 Yet the brain is clearly more than a glorified input-output device.\\xa0 The neural networks within it do not just respond to external stimuli, they also generate their own activity.\\xa0 A principal goal of my laboratory is to study the neural dynamics responsible for this ability.\\xa0 In particular, I study how primary motor cortex generates the rich temporal patterns of neural activity that are responsible for moving the body.\\xa0 My laboratory also focuses on translating basic science knowledge regarding dynamics into better ‘neural prostheses’: brain-machine interfacesthat directly translate neural activity into movement, thus bypassing an injured limb or spinal cord.', 'Rui M. Costa': 'Our overall goal is to understand how changes in molecular networks in the brain modify neural circuits to allow the generation of novel actions and their shaping by experience. We use genetic, electrophysiological, optical, and behavioral approaches to gain this mechanistic insight.We are also interested in understanding action control, in particular the differences between goal-directed actions and habits. We also study the mechanisms behind disorders of behavioral repetitive and compulsion, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive conditions.', 'Aniruddha Das': 'Our lab is interested in cortical mechanisms of visual processing. We have two broad areas of research – understanding task-related anticipation in visual cortex, and analyzing the cortical basis of visual form processing. We are also actively involved in developing new recording and analysis techniques for these two research directions.Task-Related Anticipation in Visual CortexBy using a novel optical imaging technique developed by us for use in alert behaving monkeys, we recently discovered a robust anticipatory hemodynamic signal in primary visual cortex (V1). This signal is independent of visual stimulation or local neuronal activity. Given any regular, predictable visual task, this signal appears timed to bring fresh arterial blood to V1 in anticipation of the task onset. Our finding poses a serious challenge to the current understanding of fMRI which assumes that hemodynamic signals are uniformly predicted by underlying neural activity. It also likely indicates a novel task-related arousal mechanism in the brain – probably driven by distal neuromodulatory input – that prepares relevant cortical areas for upcoming task demands by bringing in fresh arterial blood in anticipation. A major focus of our lab, currently, is in understanding the neural basis and functional consequences of this signal. We are doing so with optical imaging and electrophysiology both in the alert monkey, and in an alert rat preparation that we are in the process of setting up.Cortical Basis of Visual Form ProcessingIt is now appreciated that even V1 has the sophisticated neural machinery to process reasonably complex visual items such as smooth contours, textures and surfaces. This is mediated through geometrically precise long-range connections within V1, combined with feedback from higher visual areas. Using optical imaging in alert monkey we find that the imaged response to a chain of short lines is suppressed relative to the linear sum of responses to individual lines, in a manner that is tuned for smoothness and collinearity; fMRI responses in human V1 are closely analogous. Similarly, illusory contours evoke robust imaging signals in monkey V1; linear discriminant analysis and fMRI shows an analogous response in humans. Combining human studies where we can ask our subjects complex perceptual questions with monkey optical imaging where we can carry out more invasive electrophysiology gives us a powerful tool to explore the cortical basis of early visual processing.Developing New Brain Imaging and Analysis TechniquesTo pursue any question in neuroscience I believe it is very important to be able to develop new techniques as and when the question demands it. Our discovery of the anticipatory hemodynamic signal in V1 came about only because we had developed a dual-wavelength imaging technique that images cortical blood volume and oxygenation simultaneously with electrode recordings in the alert monkey. This allowed us to circumvent the limitations of neuoimaging signals such as fMRI that cannot disambiguate changes in blood volume from oxygenation. We are currently developing a flavoprotein imaging system to visualize neural activity at a spatial scale appropriate for studying visual processing. We are also developing imaging in the alert rodent, including two-photon imaging, to understand the neural basis of task-related anticipation.', 'Jane Dodd': 'We are studying the molecular and cellular events that regulate the early development and organization of the central nervous system. After neuronal differentiation, axons extend towards their target cells within the central nervous system, navigating under the guidance of cues in the environment. To determine the nature of such cues and the mechanisms by which growth cones respond to them, we have analyzed the earliest axonal pathways in the developing spinal cord. Using in vitro assays in combination with antibodies and molecular markers that define cellular components of the developing spinal cord, we have identified several components of a guidance system that may contribute to the projection pattern of a subset of sensory relay neurons, the commissural neurons. Commissural neurons project circumferentially and ventrally away from the dorsal midline of the neural tube and towards and across the ventral midline of the spinal cord before turning to project towards higher spinal segments and supraspinal sites. Two groups of cells, located at the dorsal and ventral midlines and known as the roof plate and the floor plate, respectively, appear to act as sources of cues for commissural axons. The roof plate appears to direct initial axon extension away from the dorsal midline through the release of a diffusible chemorepellent, whereas the floor plate provides both contact-mediated and diffusible cues for commissural axon navigation towards and across the midline. We are currently trying to determine how roof plate- and floor plate-derived signals act to influence the direction of growth of commissural axons.The ventral midline of the neural tube consists of several subgroups of cells that differ, according to their position in the rostro-caudal axis, in the expression of cellular markers and signaling molecules. Throughout the axis, these cells appear to have multiple roles in the patterning of adjacent cell types and axons. To begin to study the mechanisms underlying cell identity within the neural tube we have therefore examined the development of the ventral midline cell groups. By analyzing changes in neural cell identity and pattern within neural tube explants, we have shown that axial mesodermal cells of the notochord and prechordal mesoderm provide inductive signals that initiate the differentiation of the ventral midline and patterning of neurons within the neural plate. Sonic hedgehog appears to mediate the induction of floor plate by notochord, but in rostral regions sonic hedgehog appears to act cooperatively with another signaling molecule to generate ventral midline cells with rostral properties. Current experiments are directed at the molecular identification of mesoderm-derived inducing signals at different rostro-caudal levels and the characterization of the response of neuroepithelial cells to such signals.', 'Yasmine El-Shamayleh': 'Yasmine El-Shamayleh is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and a Principal Investigator in the Mortimer B.

Yasmine joined Columbia University in May 2019.The overarching goal of research in the El-Shamayleh lab is to discover how neurons in the primate cerebral cortex identify the objects we see—a process critical for informing our decisions and guiding our actions. In pursuit of this goal, we seek to understand how visual cortical neurons process information about the shape of an object—information that enables us to identify objects correctly and to interact with them appropriately. To furnish new mechanistic insights, we use and develop optogenetic techniques for the functional dissection of primate cortical circuits.', 'Vincent P. Ferrera': 'The Ferrera Lab has two main areas of interest:1) Flexible decision-making in prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. We are interested in neural mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility, the ability of an organism to adapt its behavior to changing circumstances. We use neurophysiological and functional imaging approaches to understanding how the brain weighs evidence, adjusts decision criteria, and evaluates reward outcomes.2) Attention and reward in visual cortex. Attention is necessary to filter sensory data for behaviorally relevant information and is naturally directed toward rewarding stimuli. We are interesting in the neural mechanisms by which reward influences attention, especially in the context of socially rewarding stimuli such as faces.', 'Stefano Fusi': 'The complexity of real world behavior cannot be reduced to a simple mapping between a sensory stimulus and a motor response. Indeed the same stimulus should sometimes lead to different behaviors depending on the situation, the intention of the subject, and the rules imposed by the task to be performed. In many complex tasks we need to go through a series of different inner mental states each representing a particular disposition to behavior. Our group investigates the neural mechanisms which underlie the formation of rule representations (learning) and their expression. In particular we are developing a model of a neural network which encodes the inner mental states as attractor of the neural dynamics. Moreover we study the theory of synaptic mechanisms leading to the abstraction of the rules (learning and memory). In collaboration with experimentalists from different fields we test our ideas on real biological brains.', 'Vikram Gadagkar': 'A major goal of neuroscience is to understand how the brain produces behavior. But to produce complex learned behavior, the brain first needs to evaluate behavior. The central question that drives the Gadagkar Lab is: How do brains evaluate behaviors - both self-generated and the behaviors of others? Many of our socially relevant motor skills such as speaking or playing a musical instrument are not innately programmed but are acquired and maintained through a process of trial and error or reinforcement. First, during the practice phase, these complex motor sequences are learned by matching exploratory motor output to internal goals or templates. Second, these newly acquired sequences are performed to a socially significant target audience in a highly stereotyped manner. Third, the audience evaluates the performance, shows a preference for certain features like stereotypy and virtuosity, and provides feedback to the performer. These three stages of practice, performance, and preference serve the goal of learning motor skills critical for social life, yet we understand very little about the neural mechanisms underlying these processes.The songbird, with its highly tractable song circuit, is an excellent model system to address this problem. The adult zebra finch song is a learned, stereotyped motor sequence, and juvenile finches learn to imitate their tutor’s song (the internal goal) by trial and error. Furthermore, male songbirds ‘practice’ their songs alone with the ultimate goal of ‘performing’ to a female. Female finches evaluate male songs directed at them and show a ‘preference’ for the most stereotyped and attractive songs. The goal of the Gadagkar Lab is to combine the advantages of the zebra finch courtship song system with state-of-the-art computational, theoretical, and experimental techniques to study how the brain implements reinforcement learning through the stages of practice, performance, and preference. Some of the questions we are currently investigating are: 1. What is the role of reinforcement during early critical periods of sensorimotor learning? 2. How does the brain switch between a state optimized for variability and learning to a state optimized for stereotypy and performance? 3. What are the neural mechanisms of female mate choice?', 'Joseph A. Gogos': 'My laboratory has elucidated the contribution of rare de novo and inherited mutations to the genetic risk of schizophrenia and develops relevant model systems to understand their impact on neural mechanisms and advance neuropsychiatric therapeutics. Some of the questions we try to answer are: What kind and how many different mutations increase the risk for schizophrenia? What kind of failures in neural circuits in our brain underlie these constellation of symptoms we refer to as schizophrenia? Why do neural circuits fail in particular ways and not others when our genetic program is disturbed by disease mutations? Why are conditions such as schizophrenia so frequent? Toward these goals, my laboratory has two interconnected research programs:• Genetics of Complex Psychiatric Disorders: Most psychiatric disorders have a strong genetic component and, therefore, our starting point is findings from human genetic approaches. Our genetics program has contributed a series of genetic discoveries especially on the contribution of rare mutations in the genetic architecture of schizophrenia.• Animal Models of Complex Psychiatric Disorders: We are using mouse models of rare, recurrent, large-effect mutations to ask what are the consequences of a genetic lesion associated with mental illness in humans, on brain structure and function of a model organism, starting at the simpler cellular and synaptic levels to the higher-order circuit and behavior levels.

How do we decide when and to what to attend?\\xa0 How do we decide which item to commit to memory or process in greater depth? Our working hypothesis is that such mental operations can be understood in a decision framework as processes that are geared toward specific goals - namely, to learn, reduce uncertainty or acquire information. Thus, we seek to understand how the brain actively controls its own information sampling strategies, and how this relates to the actions and reward structures in a task. We are investigating this process in the parietal and the frontal lobes, two key areas involved in attention control.\\xa0 Future investigations will extend to other areas and neuromodulatory systems.', 'Wesley Grueber': 'Dendrites and axons show extraordinarily diverse forms and modes of patterning, with important implications for nervous system wiring and neuronal function. Our lab is interested in how neurons acquire their type-specific morphology and organization and how this organization underlies circuit function. To approach this problem, we use molecular, genetic, anatomical, and behavioral approaches to identify the mechanisms that sculpt somatosensory circuits during development.Using the fruit flyDrosophilawe can dissect the mechanisms of nervous system patterning and function with cell type specificity. For example we identified the mechanisms that allow branches from the same cell to spread from each other to cover their appropriate territory, a basic feature of most or all neuronal arbors. This process of “self-avoidance” is controlled by the highly diversified homophilic immunoglobulin superfamily member Dscam1. We also showed that repulsion is also enforced by integrin receptors for the extracellular matrix.Current interests in the lab include 1) identification of interneuron populations that transmit somatosensory information and the contribution of these neurons to behavior (see Burgos et al., 2018), 2) the mechanisms that underlie specific connectivity between primary sensory neurons and target interneurons, 3) cell-extrinsic cues that mediate targeting and morphogenesis of both dendrites and axons, and 4) imaging neuronal activity and behavior in intact Drosophila larvae to shed light on neural circuit function, in collaboration with the Hillman lab at the Zuckerman Institute (see Vaadia & Li, et al., 2019).', 'Robert D. Hawkins': 'We are investigating cellular mechanisms of learning and memory in two experimental systems: the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, and long-term potentiation in mammalian hippocampus. We are also exploring possible relationships between the mechanisms in these two systems.Our studies in Aplysia have focused on two simple forms of learning: sensitization and classical conditioning. We use electrophysiological, imaging, and genetic methods to investigate cellular mechanisms of these forms of learning in isolated cell culture. We also study cellular mechanisms during learning in dissected preparations, in which it is possible to relate more directly the mechanisms to behavior.We have also focused on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, a long-lasting form of synaptic plasticity that is thought to be involved in mammalian learning and memory. We use electrophysiological, imaging, and genetic methods in hippocampal slices and in dissociated cell culture to investigate cellular mechanisms of LTP.', 'Elias Issa': 'A challenge in understanding the brain lies in going beyond descriptions of single brain areas to studying how multiple areas interact within a network to produce emergent behaviors. In the cerebral cortex, these network interactions are thought to be mediated by bidirectional connections between cortical areas. However, despite anatomical evidence of strongly recurrent network connectivity in cortex, the functional role of recurrent cortical processing is not well understood. The goal of the lab is to elucidate the computational purpose of the recurrent network architecture of cortex.Using vision as a model system, the lab studies how recurrent processing supports our ability to visually recognize objects, a computationally challenging task at which humans excel. Bidirectional connections between the hierarchically arranged stages of visual cortex could serve at least two fundamental computational purposes: they may dynamically modify neural activity in a process of online visual inference (Bayesian inference) between cortical stages, and they may provide top-down signals for driving learning (error backpropagation) across the cortical hierarchy. To explore these hypotheses, experiments measure the content and downstream impact of messages passed across the network during object recognition and learning.Our experimental platform, centered around the common marmoset, will use advanced tools such as cellular imaging and targeted optogenetics to examine the neural subpopulations involved in transmission of information between high-level visual cortical areas. Positioned at the intersection of biological vision, neuroengineering, and machine learning, the lab’s environment fosters an interplay between experiments, novel techniques, and neural network models in an effort to reveal the computations implemented in cortical networks.', 'Itamar Kahn': 'Over the past two decades the most important revolution in human brain research took place due to the availability of non-invasive imaging methods allowing to\\xa0evaluate the structure and function of the brain.

To form the functional circuitry necessary to achieve sophisticated cognitive and motor functions, neural progenitors must make each type of neural cell at the right place and time and also in the correct proportions. The major goal of my lab is to understand the origin of this cellular diversity in the brain and the logic by which it is generated in such a highly organized manner.A relatively small pool of neural progenitors generates diverse cell types sequentially by responding to changes in cell intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Over time, they lose the ability, or “competence,” to make cell types born at earlier stages and gain competence to make cell types born at later stages. How competence is regulated during development is poorly understood, but has important implications in our basic understanding of brain development, origin of neurodevelopmental disorders, and how we can harness stem cells for brain repair.The Drosophila Neuroblast systemTheDrosophilaembryo provides an ideal model to study neural progenitor competencein vivo: there are only ~30 neuroblasts, the fly neural progenitors, in the embryonic nerve cord, and each gives rise to a unique lineage of neurons and glia in an invariant birth order. One of the amazing features of neuroblasts is that each neuroblast and its progeny can be individually identified and tracked over timein vivo. This allows us to reproducibly find the same single progenitor between animals and across development. Critically, the set of transcription factors that specify fate of the neural progeny based on birth order, called “temporal identity factors,” is known and can be exploited to test the neuroblasts’ competence to produce each type of neuron over development.Mechansisms of neuroblast competence restrictionUsing a combination of genetics and DNA FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization), we recently discovered that neuroblasts undergo a developmentally-timed reorganization of their genome that physically relocates genes within the nucleus (Kohwi et al.,Cell2013). Genes harbor specific positions relative to various functional compartments within nuclei that can affect whether they can be turned on or off. We discovered that such gene repositioning occurs in neuroblasts in a highly regulated manner, and consequently, determines whether a specific neural cell type can be made at a specific developmental stage. Thus, this restructuring of nuclear architecture appears to regulate the neuroblasts’ competence state (Kohwi and Doe,Nature Rev Neurosci2013). Current projects focus on understanding how the timing of genome reorganization in neuroblasts is controlled, investigating how the reorganization affects neuroblast output, and translating our findings in the fruit fly to the mouse model system.(photo credit: Barbara Alper/Columbia University)', 'Nikolaus Kriegeskorte': 'Understanding brain-computational mechanisms by testing deep neural network models with massively multivariate brain-activity dataRecent advances in neural network modelling have enabled major strides in computer vision and other artificial intelligence applications. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the brain and their computations could be implemented in biological neurons. Although designed with engineering goals, this technology provides the basis for tomorrow’s computational neuroscience, engaging complex cognitive tasks and high-level cortical representations. We are entering an exciting new era, in which we will be able to build neurobiologically faithful feedforward and recurrent computational models of how biological brains perform high-level feats of intelligence.The objective of the lab is to understand the brain information processing that enables visual perception, object recognition, and scene understanding. Vision is of interest in its own right, but also provides a model for understanding, more generally, how the brain computes and how it might perform probabilistic inference through parallel and recurrent computations.The lab uses massively multivariate measurements of brain activity along with behavioural data to test models of brain information processing that perform visual tasks. To explain visual processing, the models must meet computational challenges comparable to those biological visual systems face in the real world. The models therefore need to contain rich visual knowledge about the world and have substantial computational power. Building such models requires the methods of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We take a top-down approach to modelling, starting with models that perform the task, but abstract from much of the biological detail. We then attempt to reveal the aspects of human task performance and brain activity that these models fail to explain. This motivates adjustments to the architecture and the design of the units. Architectures and units must be plausibly implementable with biological neurons. Their design is chosen as required by function and inspired by biology, so as to better explain brain and behavioural data. The lab develops neural net models, statistical inference and visualisation techniques, and visual stimuli and tasks, and measures brain activity with fMRI and MEG in humans and with array recordings in nonhuman primates.', 'Attila Losonczy': 'A fundamental capacity of the mammalian cerebral cortex is to process information in a form conducive to encoding, storage and\\xa0 retrieval of memories. A general organizational principle of cortical mnemonic circuits states that these steps all require a precisely orchestrated spatio-temporal interaction among a large number of relatively uniform excitatory and a numerically fewer but richly diverse population of inhibitory and neuromodulatory circuit elements. However,\\xa0 a mechanistic understanding of how these circuit motifs interact during elementary steps of memory processing is lacking. Our general hypothesis is that single neurons perform complex computations by exploiting their multilayered and compartmentalized dendritic arborization. Specifically, we hypothesize that, (1) neuronal dendritic arbor constitutes a backbone for both compartmentalized input integration and plasticity, and (2) dynamic interactions between synaptic and intrinsic forms of neuronal plasticity can expand neuron’s capability to detect, store and recall various features of information.To test these predictions, we use a variety of techniques: direct electrophysiological recordings from various compartments of neurons, simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from multiple neurons, together with two-photon imaging/photoactivation and optogenetics.A major focus of our lab will be to understand how dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs in different subcellular domains fundamentally enhance information processing and storage capabilities of single and small networks of neurons in the hippocampal circuitAnother aspect of our work will focus on testing the prediction that intrinsic and synaptic forms of neuronal plasticity bidirectionally interact within dendritic compartments. We also aim to reveal exact mechanisms how these different forms of neuronal plasticity are affected by inhibition and neuromodulation.The long-term goal of our laboratory is to establish causal links between single cell computations and behavior.', 'Carol A. Mason': 'In our studies of axon guidance in the visual pathways, we analyze the behaviors, cellular interactions and molecular directives of retinal axon growth cones during avoidance and crossing of the midline at the optic chiasm. This system is a model for axon navigation at the CNS midline, and for patterning the binocular projection. We have identified a molecular program of transcription factors and guidance receptors that regulate cell identity and projection of the ipsilateral retinal axon pathway through the optic chiasm. Current work aims to investigate transcriptional regulators and guidance mechanisms for the contralateral projection, and mechanisms of growth cone interactions with cells of the chiasm midline.We have recently addressed whether the programs of gene expression that direct retinal axon decussation at the optic chiasm are relevant to the formation of connections of retinal axons in their first target, the lateral geniculate nucleus. We now aim to identify molecular regulators of axon-targeting and retinal ganglion cell axon arbor morphogenesis, and to analyze the interplay of molecular factors and neural activity in the targeting and refinement of eye-specific projections.A genetic model for these studies is the albino. In both humans and rodents, lack of pigment in the eye leads to visual impairment due to the misrouting of retinal fibers at the optic chiasm to contralateral rather than ipsilateral targets. Albinism is caused by diverse\\xa0genes controlling melanogenesis. We aim to study how factors in the melanogenic pathway from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) affect retinal patterning, and retinal ganglion cell specification and projection fate.', 'Kenneth Miller': 'My lab\\'s interests focus on understanding the cerebral cortex. We use theoretical and computational methods to unravel the circuitry of the cerebral cortex, the rules by which this circuitry develops or \"self-organizes\", and the computational functions of this circuitry. Our guiding hypothesis — motivated by the stereotypical nature of cortical circuitry across sensory modalities — is that there are fundamental computations done by the circuits of sensory cortex that are invariant across highly varying input signals. This commonality is likely to extend in important ways to motor and \"higher-order\" cortex as well, although these structures show more prominent circuit differences with sensory cortex, consistent with their role in producing internally generated activity as well as in integrating their inputs. In some way that does not strongly depend on the specific content of the input, cortical circuits extract invariant structures from their input and learn to represent these structures in an associative, relational manner. We (and many others) believe the atomic element underlying these computations is likely to be found in the computations done by a roughly 1mm-square chunk of the cortical circuit. To understand this element, we have focused on one of the best-studied cortical systems, primary visual cortex, and also have interest in any cortical system in which the data gives us a foothold (such as rodent whisker barrel cortex, studied here at Columbia by Randy Bruno, and monkey area LIP, studied here by Mickey Goldberg and Jackie Gottlieb).The function of this element depends both on its mature pattern of circuitry and on the developmental and learning rules by which this circuitry is shaped by the very inputs that it processes. Thus we focus both on understanding how the mature circuitry creates cortical response properties\\xa0 and on how this circuitry is shaped by input activity during development and learning.\\xa0 We also use theoretical methods to analyze sensory cortical data to infer functional properties.', 'Liam Paninski': 'I am a Professor in the Department of Statistics and Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, and also the Co-director of the Grossman Center for the Statistics of Mind.

Through the use of both in vitro and in vivo models of these two adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders, we have studied the contribution of death of specific subsets of neurons a series of both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms.Among the cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, we have paid particular attention to the role of mitochondria, fist by studying the link of defect in bioenergetic and\\xa0neuronal death; then by linking respiratory defect to program cell death, and more recently by studying defect in mitophagy and neuronal death. \\xa0Our recent results have shown that PINK1 and Parkin interact to modulate the turnover of defective mitochondria and that in presence of PINK1 and/or Parkin\\xa0mutations, mitochondrial quality control mechanisms are defective. Currently, we thus try to understand PINK1\\xa0normal function and how it communicates with Parkin. We also study the actual molecular basis of mitophagy and how any defect in such mechanism of quality control could cause neurodegeneration.Among the non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, we have first studied the actual role and molecular determinants of neuroinflammation, i.e. how activated microglia and reactive astrocytes could mediate neuronal death. More recently, we have found that astrocytes derived from both experimental models of disease such as ALS and from patients can provoke the death of specific neurons. Currently,\\xa0we are thus searching\\xa0at identifying the nature of the toxic factor(s) mediating this neurodegeneration phenomenon;\\xa0at defining the molecular cascade of death engaged within specific of neurons upon exposure to toxic astrocytes, and at miniaturizing this in vitro model of ALS to use it for high-throughput screening of small molecules library.\", 'Ning Qian': 'The research in our laboratory focuses on computational and psychophysical studies of visual perception. Unlike machine vision approaches, we emphasize physiological plausibility of our models because such models have more explanatory and predictive power for understanding biological vision. We have been constructing binocular vision models by analyzing known spatiotemporal receptive-field properties of binocular cells in the visual cortex, and have been applying our models to explain depth perception from horizontal disparity (stereovision), vertical disparity (the induced effect), inter-ocular time delay (the Pulfrich effects), motion field (structure-from-motion), and monocular occlusion (da Vinci stereopsis). We also test new predictions from our models via visual psychophysical experiments.A recent emphasis of our research is psychophysical investigation of faces. Face perception is essential for social interactions. While traditional face studies have primarily focused on high-level properties of face perception, we take a complementary approach by investigating contributions of low-level processing along multiple, interactive streams to face perception. We have been studying hierarchical face processing from low to high levels by measuring multi-level adaptation aftereffects. We also plan to conduct computational studies of faces.Finally, we are interested in computational models of motor planning and sensorimotor integration. In particular, we would like to understand synergistic interactions between visual perception and motor control.', 'Kapil V. Ramachandran': 'Neurons are postmitotic cells that synthesize many fold more protein than mitotic cells, have an exquisitely dynamic proteome subject to changes in neuronal activity and subcellular localization, yet live for decades without accumulating protein aggregates. There is an almost implicit requirement for unique neuronal mechanisms for maintaining proteostasis. We discovered a new mechanism of protein degradation, which we term the “neuroproteasome”. In essence, we made a fascinating observation that proteasomes in excitatory neurons are localized to the neuronal plasma membrane, degrading substrates co-translationally during states of elevated neuronal activity. This is not only as a new system of protein degradation, but this degradation generates a large set of 4-18aa extracellular peptides which can act as neuromodulators and directly influence the activity of other cells in the brain. Our findings controvert dogma in three waysProteasomes have historically considered to be intracellular complexes. The neuroproteasome is the first description of a plasma-membrane-bound and functionally transmembrane complex.Ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases have historically been the primary mechanisms to specify which substrates get turned over. Neuroproteasome-mediated degradation is ubiquitin-independent, which begs the question how substrates are selected for co-translational degradation.The resulting products of degradation have historically thought to be immediately broken down into constituent amino acids. Neuroproteasome-derived peptides are released into the extracellular space, where they act as a new mechanism of signaling through yet-to-be-identified receptors, establishing new receptor-ligand relationships in the brain.My laboratory seeks to establish a new field in molecular neuroscience by revealing the mechanisms underlying neuroproteasome-mediated protein degradation and the functions of the new mechanism of signaling through neuroproteasome-mediated peptides. We leverage approaches from any discipline to address how neuroproteasomes are regulated and how they modify neuronal structure and function, including super-resolution live microscopy, quantitative proteomics, fast calcium imaging, biochemistry, and chemical biology. We also have a keen eye towards understanding how neuroproteasomes are dysregulated in neurodegenerative disease and over the course of normal physiological aging. Our research program will define neuroproteasomes as a bona fide hub of proteostasis and neuroproteasome-mediated peptide signaling as a new mechanism of neuromodulation. In the long run, we seek to leverage this framework to understand how neuroproteasome localization is modified over aging and neurodegenerative conditions and how to manipulate neuroproteasome localization and function for benefit.', 'Daniel Salzman': \"We study the neural mechanisms that give particular sensory stimuli emotional value, leading to emotional behavior. Using the primate visual system as an experimental platform, our basic approach is to conduct neurophysiological experiments in rhesus monkeys performing a variety of tasks involving emotional learning. We generally use conditioning techniques to give otherwise neutral stimuli emotional significance.We are investigating the physiological responses of amygdala neurons during emotional learning. The amygdala is a limbic brain structure likely to be critical to the process of associating sensory stimuli with emotional values. Simultaneously, we employ quantitative measurements of emotional learning and behavior in the monkey. We are testing the hypothesis that modulations in amygdala neural activity are correlated with the monkeys' emotional learning, behavior, and decision making.Future studies are planned in three general directions. First, we plan to study how orbitofrontal cortex contributes to emotional learning and behavior on the tasks we employ. Parts of orbitofrontal cortex are intimately connected to the amygdala, and our goal is to understand the distinct processing in these brain areas. Second, we plan to investigate how stimuli in other sensory modalities become associated with emotional value in the amygdala. The amygdala receives input from multiple sensory modalities, and therefore representations of emotional value in the amygdala may exist across sensory modalities, perhaps even in the same cells. Finally, we plan to use pharmacological manipulations to try to understand the critical synaptic mechanisms underlying emotional learning. These experiments may deepen our understanding of psychopharmacology by linking synaptic mechanisms to both neurophysiology and to emotional behavior.\", 'Nathaniel Sawtell': \"Unraveling the functions of neural circuits is a fundamental challenge for neuroscience.\\xa0 Research in my laboratory focuses on understanding the functions of cerebellum-like sensory structures and the cerebellum in fish and mammals.\\xa0 We are also interested in understanding the neural mechanisms through which past experience and sensorimotor context affect early stages of sensory processing.\\xa0 Cerebellum-like structures associated with electrosensory systems in fish offer a number of advantages for linking synaptic, cellular, and circuit properties with systems level functions.

The evidence we obtain through our senses (or from memory) need not precipitate an immediate, reflexive response. Instead our decisions are deliberative and provisional, contingent on other sources of information, long-term goals, and values. I believe the principles of brain function that underlie simple forms of reasoning and decision-making are also the building blocks of human cognition.Brain circuits support integration of evidence from diverse sources (for example, different senses and memory), assign more or less weight to cues that differ in their reliability, calculate expected costs and benefits associated with anticipated outcomes, process elapsed time to meet a deadline or to assess temporal cost, and implement rules (such as deciding on what to decide upon) and policies (balancing accuracy against speed).Read more athttp://www.beinghuman.org/article/decisions-window-cognition', 'Clarissa Waites': 'The overall goal of our research is to understand nervous system function and dysfunction at the cellular and molecular level, focusing on pathways that regulate protein trafficking, degradation, and secretion. Within this broad framework, Waites lab members are currently working on several related but distinct projects, including 1) investigating roles of the ESCRT pathway in neuronal protein degradation and neurodegenerative disease etiology, 2) elucidating the cellular/molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress and glucocorticoids induce brain pathology, and 3) illuminating the mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and secretion.Current ProjectsRoles of the ESCRT pathway in protein degradation and neurodegenerationDegradative pathways are essential for maintaining nervous system health by preventing toxic protein accumulation and aggregation. Our lab has been studying one such pathway, the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport), comprising a series of protein complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III) that recognize ubiquitinated substrates and package them into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for delivery to lysosomes. Work in the Waites lab has shown that the ESCRT pathway mediates the degradation of specific synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins in an activity-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we have become very interested in the mechanisms of ESCRT pathway localization, transport, and regulation in neurons, as well as the ESCRT pathway’s role in SV protein turnover and presynaptic function. Moreover, mutations in ESCRT components are associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and we are interested in how these perturb normal ESCRT trafficking and function to precipitate neurodegeneration. Some of the questions we are addressing include: How are the different ESCRT components transported to synapses, and what types of stimuli catalyze their transport and synaptic recruitment? How are SV proteins targeted and sorted into the ESCRT pathway for degradation? What are the consequences of ESCRT protein mutation/loss-of-function on SV protein turnover, neurotransmitter release, and broader synaptic function? What are the other presynaptic and neuronal substrates of the ESCRT pathway?How do chronic stress and glucocorticoids cause brain pathology?Chronic stress and high levels of glucocorticoids, the major stress hormones, are known risk factors for several neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e. anxiety, depression, PTSD) and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We are studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of stress-induced brain pathology, particularly those relevant to AD etiology, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to illuminate how stress and glucocorticoids contribute to 1) overproduction of toxic amyloid-beta (A?)?peptides, 2) impairment of the endolysosomal pathway and other degradative pathways, 3) mitochondrial dysfunction, 4) Tau pathology and its propagation between brain regions, and 5) neuroinflammation.Mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and secretionExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized vesicles that contain diverse cargoes (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids), are secreted by all cell types, and mediate cell-to-cell communication. In the brain, EVs have roles in many biological processes including development, homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, and the immune response. EVs are also implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease through their role in spreading pathogenic proteins (i.e. A?, Tau) throughout the brain. However, little is known about the basic mechanisms of EV biogenesis, secretion, uptake, and transmission between cells, or how these processes are regulated. We are investigating these mechanisms for a population of small EVs called ‘exosomes’, using a combination of biochemical and live imaging approaches in cell culture, ex vivo brain slices, and in vivo mouse models.', 'Hynek Wichterle': 'My laboratory models and studies the development of the nervous system in a culture dish. We have pioneered some of the most efficient methods for the differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells into specific subtypes of spinal motor neurons and interneuronsin vitro. The process faithfully recapitulates normal embryonic development, providing a unique opportunity to study neural development at a biochemical level in a controlled environment outside of the embryo.We combine the differentiation system with CRISPR based genome editing and with inducible transgene expression to decode transcriptional programs controlling progressive transitions from a pluripotent stem cell to a defined postmitotic neuron. We assembled a global map of genomic regulatory elements controlling motor neuron expression program. Our ultimate goal is to decipher the syntax and grammar of the \"language\" used by transcription factors to specify neuronal cell identity during embryonic development.The lab also capitalizes on the unlimited source of spinal neurons to study molecular processes underlying neuronal maturation, synapse formation, and neuronal aging and degeneration.

Indeed, all communication, including speech, sign language, gestures and writing, is mediated via the motor system. Taking this viewpoint, the purpose of the human brain is to use sensory signals to determine future actions. The goal of our lab is to understand the computational principles underlying human sensorimotor control. We use theoretical studies, computer simulations and human experiments to examine the basis of skilled motor behavior.Our focus is on the control of the hand and arm as a model system that demonstrates many of the features which make sensorimotor control hard. The upper limb has a large number of interacting degrees of freedom and it interacts with many different objects under a variety of environmental conditions. Despite this complexity, healthy humans demonstrate a remarkable ability to generate accurate and appropriate motor behavior when interacting with the world. To examine the computations underlying sensorimotor control, we have developed a research program that uses computational techniques from machine learning, control theory and signal processing together with novel experimental techniques that include robotic interfaces and virtual reality systems that allow for precise experimental control over sensory inputs and task variables.There are five broad areas to our research program: (1) Motor planning and optimal control, (2) Probabilistic models of sensorimotor control, (3) Predictive models for estimation, control & sensory processing, (4) Motor learning of novel dynamics, and (5) The interplay between decision making and sensorimotor control.\", 'Jahar Bhattacharya': 'We study the cell and molecular biology of lung inflammation by real-time fluorescence imaging and multiple other approaches.

The resulting respiratory failure requires respiratory support by mechanical ventilators in critical care units. It is estimated that about 250,000 people suffer from ALI in the US alone, with a mortality rate of 20-25%. Patients who survive the disease continue to have a high rate of morbidity for many years.

Cells that retain the label (Label-retaining cells or LRCs) are considered to be stem cells. We found that in the adult kidney, these stem cells are concentrated in the papilla and located mostly outside the renal tubule. When the kidneys were subjected to unilateral ischemia followed by re-perfusion, we found that these LRCs migrated out of their niche in the papilla and started to rapidly divide. Purification of these cells led to identification of a gene that is expressed in them but in no other cell in the kidney. To provide definitive evidence for the existence of stem we need to produce a “lineage marker”. We generated a mouse that expresses the Cre recombinase (Cre:ERT2) under a control of its promoter and bred this mouse to a reporter strain such that these cells express a fluorescent protein but only when a drug (tamoxifen) induces the Cre expression. We found that these marked cells exist in the papilla as clusters of cells but are present as single cells in every nephron segment. Ischemic injury led to proliferation and migration of these cells to the site of injury followed by incorporation into the injured nephron segments. Thus these cells are bona fide stem cells of the adult kidney. Response of the Kidney to AcidosisOver the past two decades we have shown that the collecting tubule of the nephron contains two types of intercalated cells, α-intercalated cells secrete acid while β-intercalated cells secrete HCO3. We have shown that the β-IC converts to the α-IC form when the animal is fed an acid diet. We showed that this conversion is a process of differentiation induced by the deposition of an extracellular matrix protein called hensin/DMBT1. Deletion of hensin results in a complete blockade of the conversion. We recently discovered that the proximate signal by which the cell senses a change in extracellular pH is secretion of the chemokine SDF1. We are presently investigating the mechanism by which SDF1 and its receptor CXCR4 mediate this effect. Branching Morphogenesis during kidney developmentThe kidneys develop when an epithelial outgrowth of the Wolffian duct (the ureteric bud) invades the metanephric mesenchyme causing it to convert to the epithelial nephron. The epithelia then send signals that induce another round of branching. Hence, the branches of the tree eventually determine the number of nephrons. We began a new project in which we are attempting to map the entire branching tree during kidney development and to identify the entire map of the branching tree and we are studying the effect of specific gene deletions on the pattern of branching.

What kind of failures in neural circuits in our brain underlie these constellation of symptoms we refer to as schizophrenia? Why do neural circuits fail in particular ways and not others when our genetic program is disturbed by disease mutations? Why are conditions such as schizophrenia so frequent?

The long term goal is to uncover the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases and to suggest novel and adapted therapies for them. Along these lines we are studying the function of bone as an endocrine organ regulating glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis and examining the role of osteoblasts in hematopoiesis with particular emphasis in myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). \\u200b Bone as an endocrine organOsteoblasts, the bone forming cells, have been shown previously to influence glucose metabolism through the secretion of a bone-specific hormone, osteocalcin. We found that the activity of osteocalcin is regulated transcriptionally by osteoblast-expressed FoxO1. These findings raised for us the question of the nature of the osteoblast as an endocrine cell, and more specifically whether it secretes other hormones regulating any aspect of energy metabolism. Using a genetic approach to this problem we identified a second osteoblast-specific hormone that affects glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. We are currently expanding this work, searching for its receptor and for other functions and mechanisms of action exerted by this hormone. \\u200b Detecting Interactions between Osteoblasts and Leukemia BlastsIn current work, our lab has discovered a function of the skeleton, as an inducer of leukemogenesis. We identified a mutation in the osteoblast that disrupts hematopoiesis leading to leukemogenic transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and establishment of MDS progressing to AML. The same mutation and signaling pathway were identified in more than a third of patients with MDS and AML. We have also found that osteoblasts affect engraftment of leukemia blasts. We are currently characterizing the signaling pathway that mediates these actions. This work may provide a rationale for using means to manipulate the osteoblast to make the hematopoietic niche hostile to residual leukemia cells.

We combine molecular tool development with genetic and genomic approaches to explore epigenetic mechanisms underlying normal physiological functions, and to uncover the epigenetic basis of diseases to accelerate the development of therapeutics. We mainly use human ESC- or iPSC-based system and genetically engineered mouse models to tackle these questions. Our three major research directions are listed below as1)CRISPR-based epigenome editing tool development;2)Molecular basis of memory storage;3)Tackle human disease by sculpting epigenome. \\u200b Epigenome Editing Tool Development Many breakthroughs in biomedical research were enabled by innovative technology and tool development, which is certainly applied to the field of epigenetics. Traditionally epigenetics is referred to the study of heritable changes of gene expression without altering the DNA sequence during cell proliferation and development. Several molecular mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs and 3D chromatin structures were identified to be responsible for a variety of intriguing epigenetic phenotypes observed in monocellular organisms such as yeast to multi-cellular organisms like human. For instance, epigenetic modifications undergo dynamic changes upon environmental stimuli, and are considered to enable the genome to interact with the environment (Jaenisch and Bird, 2003). With advances in next generation sequencing technologies, the study of epigenetics has been expanded into epigenome analysis focused on a multitude of chemical modifications and physical properties of the genome at a system level that control the functions of the genome (Bernstein et al., 2007). Numerous epigenetic changes have been associated with biological processes as well as pathological conditions. However, to distinguish the causality and correlation of these changes remains a challenge in this field. Development of epigenome editing tools enables a mechanistic dissection of the functional significance of individual epigenetic events. Our lab pioneered the CRISPR-based DNA methylation editing system including the fusion of a catalytically inactive Cas9 with DNMT3a and TET1 catalytic domains allowing for writing or erasing DNA methylation in the mammalian genome (Liu et al., 2016). The ease of assembly and versatility of CRISPR/dCas9 system to target epigenetic effector protein domains to any given locus allowed this approach to become available to the broad scientific community. We are now expanding the epigenome editing tool box to enable more options for epigenetic manipulations. \\u200b Molecular Basis for Memory Storage A century ago Richard Semon coined the term of engram to describe a unit of cognitive information inside the brain by which memories are stored as biophysical or biochemical changes in the brain in response to external stimuli. Regardless of the terminology human memory can last for years, and thus the storage of long-term memory requires a self-perpetuation mechanism to overcome the relatively short half-life of most biomolecules, which range from several days to months. One provocative hypothesis is that DNA methylation contributes to the storage of memory. Indeed, DNA methylation in neurons changes during memory formation, and mutations in DNA methylation modification genes Dnmt or Tet disrupt learning and memory. However, limited insight into the neurons that encode memory made this hypothesis nearly untestable at the cellular level. Recently an activity-dependent strategy was used to successfully label the neurons encoding fear memory (Liu et al., 2012). We are collaborating with Steve Ramirez’s group at Boston University, co-first author of this labeling work, to investigate the role of DNA methylation in learning and memory. \\u200b Tackle Diseases by Sculpting Epigenome Many human diseases are intermingled by the genetic mutations and environmental influences. Brain, the most complex organ in humans, is vulnerable to genetic mutations as well as extreme environmental stimuli. As the coordinator between the genome and the environment, the epigenome undergoes dynamic changes during brain activities. Several epigenetic modifier genes have been shown to play critical roles in brain functions by orchestrating the transcription network in response to environmental stimuli. Alterations of the epigenome have been observed in many types of brain disorders (Landgrave-Gomez et al., 2015), and the reversibility of epigenetic events has triggered substantial enthusiasm to tackle these brain disorders via epigenome editing approaches. With application of the DNA methylation editing tool we developed, we studied the hypermethylation of the CGG repeat expansion mutation at the 5’ UTR of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. We demonstrated that demethylation of the CGG repeats unlocked the epigenetic silencing of FMR1 and restored FMRP expression in FXS cells (Liu et al., 2018). Currently we are applying a new epigenome editing strategy to reactivate the wild type allele of MECP2 in the inactive X chromosome (Xi) of Rett Syndrome (RTT) patient-derived cells. Reactivation of the MECP2 allele in the Xi represents a new challenge as multiple layers of epigenetic repressive mechanism are involved. We are developing two additional tools allowing for targeted histone modification and artificial DNA loop. Combination of DNA methylation editing and additional epigenetic manipulations enabled by these new tools resulted in a reactivation of MECP2 in the Xi. Edited RTT neurons showed a functional rescue on soma size and electrophysical defects. We plan to apply this combination editing strategy to study other human diseases associated with epigenetic events. References: Bernstein, B.E., Meissner, A., and Lander, E.S. (2007).

His post-doctoral work was carried out in the labs of Drs. Wayne Hendrickson and Richard Axel at Columbia University. \\u200b He is a structural biologist with considerable experience in x-ray crystallography, and more recently in single particle cryo-electron microscopy, and in production and characterization of eukaryotic and prokaryotic membrane proteins for structural studies. \\u200b Dr. Mancia’s main research focus is on membrane protein – lipid interactions. Within this realm, his lab has recently determined the high-resolution structure of enzymes from three families, which process lipid substrates. (1) GtrB, a polyisoprenyl phosphate glycosyltransferase attaches glucose to a lipid carrier for membrane translocation and a glycosyl donor for subsequent reactions. This reaction represents the first step in all protein glycosylation and glycosylation of the cell wall. (2) ArnT uses sugar-charged donors produced by GtrB-like enzymes, and transfers the saccharide to lipid A on the cell surface of bacteria, altering antibiotic resistance properties. (3) The Mancia lab determined the structure of a phosphatidylinositol-phosphate (PIP) synthase – an enzyme required for inositol-lipid synthesis – with a bound CDP-diacylglycerol substrate. This enzyme is a member of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase family (CDP-APs), which catalyze the defining step in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis across all kingdoms of life. Retinoids (Vitamin A derivatives) are also lipids, and thus in this theme fits another project of the lab, aimed at understanding how STRA6-mediated cellular uptake of retinol occurs – fits into this research theme. The Mancia lab’s experience in structural biology, in overexpression of integral membrane proteins, in functional analyses of membrane proteins and in high-throughput techniques for membrane protein purification and selection, make it a unique environment for researchers interested in studying membrane protein-lipid substrate interactions, and in developing tools to advance this rapidly evolving field. \\u200b Dr. Mancia has also been a key member of the New York Consortium of Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS), located at the New York Structural Biology Center (http://nysbc.org/) where he has played a pivotal role in the design, development, implementation and optimization of the high-throughput cloning and protein production platform for prokaryotic membrane proteins successfully functioning at the NYCOMPS center. NYCOMPS has recently transitioned to a NIH-funded biomedical technology resource center named the Center on Membrane Protein Production and Analysis (COMPPÅ,https://www.comppaa.org/; Wayne Hendrickson, PI), and he serves on the executive committee for COMPPÅ.

In particular we use a variety of techniques including molecular biology, biophysics, cell biology, imaging (Live5 Zeiss Confocal), and structural biology to gain better understandings of the regulation of calcium release channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum that control excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscle. There are opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to head their own projects using any of the various techniques that we employ to examine the regulation of calcium signaling and muscle function in normal and diseased states. In addition the laboratory has developed numerous genetic mouse models (primarily knock-ins and knock-outs) that are available to address specific questions concerning the regulation of key signaling pathways that control muscle contraction - in both cardiac and skeletal systems. \\u200b Much of the work in the laboratory is \"translational\" in that it leads directly to understanding the molecular basis of human diseases including heart failure and sudden cardiac death. In addition, novel therapeutic approaches are being tested including those that fix the \"leak\" in the RyR2 calcium release channel that causes heart failure and sudden cardiac death. \\u200b In addition, there are projects focusing on gaining better understandings of cardiac muscle growth and excitability, T cell and B cell activation, as well as vascular smooth muscle proliferation.

The model incorporates an equation derived previously to describe neutrophil bactericidal activity in three dimensional fibrin gels in vitro and in sub-cutaneous bacterial infections in vivo. As with neutrophils, we have found that the concentration of antigen-specific human and mouse CD8+T-cells determines their efficacy in killing cognate antigen–expressing target cells in two dimensional tissue culture plates, in three dimensional collagen-fibrin gels, and in established melanomas in vivo. \\u200b Using limiting dilution assays we have found that only 2-2.8% of CD8+T-cells are cytolytically active, and that the cytolytically active CD8+T-cells account for all tumoricidal activity of the entire CD8+T-cell population. Cytokines, such as IL-15 and IL-21 and adjuvants such as anti-CD40, in combination with IL-2, increase the fraction of cytolytically active CD8+T-cells in a population. Quantitative analyses of these cytokine-activated CD8+T-cells show that CD8+T-cell activation in the presence of specific cytokines and/or adjuvants increases not only the percentage of cytolytically active CD8+T-cells in a population, but also the specific cytolytic activity of each T-cell. Thus, activation of CD8+T-cells in the presence of cognate antigen produces an increase in the number of antigen-specific CD8+T-cells, while activation of CD8+T-cells in the presence of antigen plus adjuvant/cytokines produces increases in both the number and quality of the cytolytic CD8+T-cells. Thus we have been able to separate, quantitatively, the effect of antigen vs. adjuvant on the quantity and quality of CD8+T-cells. \\u200b The three dimensional collagen-fibrin gel assays we employ mimic precisely the efficiency with which antigen-specific CD8+T-cells kill cognate antigen-expressing target cells in mouse spleen in vivo. Accordingly, they can be used as a “standard” for the cytolytic potential of any preparation of tumor antigen-specific CD8+T-cells. By comparing the tumoricidal activity of a given CD8+T-cell preparation in vitro with its tumoricidal activity in vivo, we can obtain a measure of the aggregate immunosuppressive activity of the intra-tumoral environment. Our studies show it is about 50% for B16 mouse melanoma. \\u200b The equation that models CD8+T-cell killing of cognate antigen-expressing target cells (bt = b0 e-kpt + gt, in which bt is the concentration of antigen-expressing target cells at time t, b0 is the concentration of antigen-expressing target cells at t = 0, k is an experimentally derived value that defines the rate of killing of antigen-expressing target cells in ml/cognate antigen-specific CD8+T-cell/min, p is the concentration of cognate antigen-specific CD8+T-cells, and g is the growth rate of antigen-expressing target cells/min), enables us to calculate the critical intra-tumoral T-cell concentration (CTC) of total and cytolytically active antigen-specific CD8+T-cells that must be achieved to control tumor growth. For B16 melanomas in syngeneic mice these concentrations are 3 x 106 total and 6 x 104 cytolytically active antigen-specific CD8+T-cells/g tumor. \\u200b Our plans for the future are to isolate populations of cytolytically active CD8+T-cells using available high throughput single cell analysis and isolation technologies, and to use these cells to answer the following questions : \\u200b 1.Is expression of cytolytic activity a stochastic or clonal property of CD8+T-cells? \\u200b 2.What are the molecular characteristics of cytolytically active CD8+T-cells that distinguish them from their cytolytically inactive siblings? \\u200b 3.Can we identify a plasma membrane marker that will enable us to identify and select the cytolytically active cells in a CD8+T-cell population? Alternatively, can we identify a plasma membrane marker that will enable us to identify and selectively remove the cytolytically inactive cells in a CD8+T-cell population? \\u200b 4.Can we identify methods to induce 10-50% of CD8+T-cells in a population to express cytolytic activity? \\u200b 5.Will populations of antigen-specific CD8+T-cells containing 10% or more cytolytically active antigen-specific CD8+T-cells produce sterilizing immunity against melanomas in mice and humans, as our calculations and studies suggest?

The lab has three primary areas of interest: analyzing the roles of stem cell signals in cancer progression, heterogeneity and therapy resistance, developing high-resolution imaging strategies to map the behavior and interactions of stem cells with the microenvironment in living animals and define how these interactions change during regeneration and cancer growth, and developing new strategies towards cancer therapy.

The laboratory has established a critical link between the UPR and a calcium-induced apoptosis pathway. This pathway involves an ER calcium-release channel called IP3R (inositol-3-phosphate receptor), a calcium-sensitive protein kinase called CaMKII (calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), and oxidative stress-generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase. Ongoing work is focused on additional pro-apoptotic processes involving mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial-calcium interaction, and the death receptor-caspase 8 pathway. Additional new studies are exploring processes that are atheroprotective through preventing advanced lesional MΦ death, defective efferocytosis, and/or inflammation. These processes include autophagy; dendritic cell-mediated regulatory T cell activation; and arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediators that promote inflammation resolution. Efferocytosis studies in the lab are investigating the role and regulation of the MΦ efferocytosis receptor MerTK and the mechanisms and consequences of efferocytosis by plaque dendritic cells. \\u200b Obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes are becoming the major drivers of atherothrombotic vascular disease worldwide. The Tabas laboratory is part of a collaborative group, funded by an NIH Program Project (PPG) and including the laboratories of Drs. Alan Tall and Domenico (Mimmo) Accili, exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this association. Recent published work from the PPG elucidated mechanisms of enhanced advanced lesional MΦ death and plaque necrosis in the setting of MΦ insulin resistance, and new work in this area has directly linked these findings to calcium-induced apoptosis (above). The PPG has also discovered new pathways in the liver that increase the risk for atherosclerosis, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia. In this context, the Tabas laboratory has recently discovered that a calcium-IP3R-CaMKII pathway in hepatocytes, similar to the one described above in MΦs, plays a key role in glucagon-mediated excessive glucose production, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and dyslipidemia in the setting of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Ongoing studies are investigating the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in this new pathway. \\u200b The ultimate goal of each of these projects is to continually pinpoint areas of therapeutic potential. The lab is particularly interested in new therapies that prevent the conversion of benign atherosclerotic lesions into disease-causing vulnerable plaques—work that is now being carried out using nanoparticles to deliver relevant compounds to atherosclerotic lesions (funded as part of an NIH Program of Excellence in Nanotechnology). The laboratory is also interested in using drugs to disrupt the aforementioned new glucagon-mediated pathway in liver, i.e., to block the generation of systemic, liver-derived atherosclerotic risk factors in the setting of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

CURRENT RESEARCH \\u200b The Woappi lab for Synthetic Regeneration and Systems Physiology aims to understand how varied cells mediate restoration of damaged tissue, with the goal of leveraging this insight to develop novel treatments for large-scale tissue injuries. We study tissue as a system and develop gene-editing tools and synthetic biotechnologies, along with 3D skin culture systems, to delineate the genetic, epigenetic, and biophysical events orchestrating distinct cells towards restoration of tissue. Our laboratory has three major research interests:1)Defining the biophysical mediators of wound healing by developing microphysiological systems (MPS) of wound mimicry,2)Developing synthetic biotechnologies to examine the regeneration potential of mammalian tissue,3)Characterizing the immunological responses to wound injury. \\u200b Wound Physiology Our research established the human skinoid culture system, which enables spatiotemporal modeling of human tissue reconstruction ex vivo. We are furthering this work by creating microphysiological systems mimicking human wound healing and using these platforms to model the cellular heterogeneity of tissue healing . \\u200b Synthetic Regeneration Our team is motivated to define the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic events enabling heterogenous cells to orchestrate restoration of damaged tissue. We are developing novel synthetic biotechnologies to functionally dissect the role of specific cell populations in tissue maintenance, neoplasia, and wound healing. \\u200b Systems Immunology of Wounds Our research seeks to understand how localized immune cells enable proximal and distal orchestration of tissue stem cells to a healing state. Our group employs quantitative systems biology to uncover novel immune contributions to tissue healing. We leverage this insight to develop synthetic immunosurveillance systems (S.I.S) with prophylactic and therapeutic potentials for wound patients.
