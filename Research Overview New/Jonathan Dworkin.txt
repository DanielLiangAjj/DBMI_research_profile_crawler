Researcher: Jonathan Dworkin
Research Overview:
Jonathan Dworkin's research predominantly revolves around the molecular dynamics of protein synthesis and regulation in bacterial systems, specifically focusing on *Bacillus subtilis*. His work encompasses key areas such as the role of elongation factor P (EF-P) in translational regulation under conditions of nutrient limitation and starvation, which triggers a stringent response involving (p)ppGpp signaling. Dworkin investigates ribosome quality control mechanisms and their influence on cellular dormancy, sporulation, and phenotypic variations in response to environmental stresses. Additionally, his research touches on various aspects of bacterial physiology, including the implications of Ser/Thr phosphorylation mediated by eukaryotic-like kinases, which contribute to cellular energetics and growth arrest during quiescence. Dworkin's studies not only illuminate fundamental bacterial processes critical for survival and adaptation but also extend to clinical implications regarding bacterial infections and strategies for addressing drug resistance, particularly in the context of endocarditis associated with intravenous drug use. Overall, his work significantly advances the understanding of bacterial resilience and adaptation mechanisms in fluctuating environments.
