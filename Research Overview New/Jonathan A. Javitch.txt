Researcher: Jonathan A. Javitch
Research Overview:
Jonathan A. Javitchâ€™s research focuses primarily on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly their signaling mechanisms, dynamics, and implications in neuronal behavior and diseases such as schizophrenia. Utilizing advanced methodologies like bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), single-molecule imaging, and machine learning approaches, Javitch investigates the conformational dynamics of GPCRs, their interactions with arrestins, and the functional consequences of receptor phosphorylation. The research emphasizes the functional role of neurotransmitters, specifically dopamine in relation to psychostimulants and cognitive behaviors, leveraging systems ranging from Drosophila models to human tissues. Furthermore, the exploration of receptor heterodimers and adhesion GPCRs reveals insights into neuropharmacology and signal transduction, with a significant implication in drug discovery and the understanding of complex neurobiological processes. Overall, his work integrates cellular mechanisms with behavioral outcomes, laying a foundation for potential therapeutic interventions in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.
