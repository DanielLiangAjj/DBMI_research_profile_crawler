Researcher: Laura A. Johnston
Research Overview:
Laura A. Johnston's research primarily focuses on the mechanisms of cell competition in Drosophila melanogaster, exploring various aspects of competitive signaling and its implications for growth, development, and cancer. Her studies investigate the roles of key proteins and signaling pathways, such as JNK, Myc, and TNF, in mediating interactions between competing cells within epithelial tissues like the wing imaginal disc. Through the examination of NimC1 mutations and Eiger/TNF signaling, her work delves into the processes of apoptosis, phagocytosis, and the underlying genetic and molecular frameworks that govern these phenomena. By leveraging models of genetic mosaicism and employing techniques such as gene targeting and immunohistochemistry, Johnston contributes to the understanding of cellular responses to competition, which has broader implications for understanding tumor biology and inflammation. Overall, her research underscores the intricate balance of growth and homeostasis, alongside the potential consequences of cellular interactions in the context of disease.
