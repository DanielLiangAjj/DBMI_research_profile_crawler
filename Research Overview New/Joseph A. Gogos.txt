Researcher: Joseph A. Gogos
Research Overview:
Joseph A. Gogos has conducted extensive research primarily focusing on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders. His studies emphasize the roles of key genetic and molecular factors, such as LSD1, MEF2, and SETD1A, in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, including working and long-term memory. Using various animal models, including the DISC1 mouse model and 22q11.2 microdeletion models, Gogos investigates how loss-of-function mutations and pharmacological interventions, such as ketamine, can reverse cognitive deficits and improve neural circuit function. His work integrates human genetics data with behavioral outcomes in animal studies, highlighting the impact of in-born errors of metabolism and metabolites on cognitive dysfunction. Overall, Gogosâ€™s research seeks to elucidate the genetic predispositions to psychiatric diseases, contributing to potential therapeutic targets for conditions like schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder.
