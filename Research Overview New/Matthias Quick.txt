Researcher: Matthias Quick
Research Overview:
Matthias Quickâ€™s research primarily focuses on the structural and functional characterization of membrane transport proteins, particularly within the context of the sodium-coupled transporters. Utilizing advanced techniques such as X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations, Quick explores the conformational changes associated with the transport mechanisms of various solute:sodium symporters, including members of the SLC6 and SLC5 families. His studies have examined the transport properties of neurotransmitters, nucleobases, and amino acids, revealing insights into binding sites, substrate specificity, and allosteric regulation. Additionally, he investigates the kinetics of transport and metal ion interactions, employing tools like scintillation proximity assays and molecular docking simulations. The findings from his work contribute significantly to the understanding of the structure-function relationships of these transporters and their implications for pharmacological applications, particularly in relation to antidepressants and psychostimulants.
