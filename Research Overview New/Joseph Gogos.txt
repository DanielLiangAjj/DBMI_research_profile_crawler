Researcher: Joseph Gogos
Research Overview:
Joseph Gogos's research primarily focuses on the genetic, molecular, and neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. He utilizes various animal models to investigate the roles of key proteins and genes, such as LSD1, MEF2, and SETD1A, in synaptic plasticity, axonal branching, and cognitive functions, particularly working memory and long-term memory. His work integrates advanced techniques, including two-photon calcium imaging and pharmacological interventions, to elucidate the impact of distinct mutations, such as those found in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, on neural circuits and perception. Gogos also explores the therapeutic potential of manipulating neurotransmitter systems, such as through ketamine or pharmacological reversals of loss-of-function mutations, as a means to address cognitive impairments linked to schizophrenia. Overall, his research aims to provide insights into the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases, with a strong emphasis on the intersections between genetics, neurodevelopment, and cognition.
