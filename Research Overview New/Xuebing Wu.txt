Researcher: Xuebing Wu
Research Overview:
Xuebing Wuâ€™s research encompasses a diverse range of topics primarily focused on the exploration and application of CRISPR technology, RNA biology, and their implications in health and disease. Key themes include the innovative use of CRISPR-Cas systems, particularly Cas9 and Cas13, to manipulate gene expression and investigate RNA dynamics, such as collateral activity and mRNA stability. Wu also employs high-throughput methods like DMS-seq and RNA metabolic labeling to analyze transcriptional regulation and RNA processing mechanisms, including cleavage and polyadenylation. Additionally, the research delves into decision-making frameworks related to dietary habits through behavioral tasks, underscoring the interplay between neurobiology and health-related choices. Wu's studies further extend to clinical aspects such as catheter-related infections and chronic renal failure, emphasizing a translational approach to understanding pathology and developing therapeutic strategies. Overall, the body of work reflects a comprehensive engagement with gene editing, RNA functions, and their relevance to both fundamental biology and applied medical sciences.
