Researcher: Richard S. Mann
Research Overview:
Richard S. Mann's research focuses on the intricate processes of gene regulation and development using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. His work intricately explores various facets of genome engineering, notably through techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 and site-specific recombination, to investigate the roles of transcription factors, particularly Hox proteins, in appendage development and body patterning. Mann employs advanced methodologies such as ChIP-seq, fluorescence microscopy, and biophysical modeling to unravel the complexities of transcriptional regulation, enhancer-promoter interactions, and the 3D architecture of genomes. His studies delve deep into the significance of gene duplication, paralogous genes, and the underlying mechanisms of morphogenesis and plasticity in development. By integrating concepts from developmental biology and genetics, his contributions offer valuable insights into the evolutionary patterns and functional dynamics of gene regulatory networks, paving the way for further advancements in understanding genome evolution and the roles of specific genetic elements in shaping organismal morphology and behavior.
