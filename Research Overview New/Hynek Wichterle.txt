Researcher: Hynek Wichterle
Research Overview:
Hynek Wichterle's research primarily focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms governing neuronal development, particularly the specification and differentiation of motor neurons and their subtypes. By investigating key transcription factors such as Isl1 and Lhx3, he explores chromatin interactions, gene regulation, and the role of noncoding DNA in shaping cellular diversity. His work encompasses advanced methodologies like CRISPR genome engineering, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-exo to dissect enhancer organization and gene expression dynamics in both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, his studies address the implications of cellular stress, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Through these interdisciplinary approaches, Wichterle aims to elucidate the underlying processes of neurogenesis, enhance our understanding of stem cell biology, and advance strategies for regenerative medicine targeting motor neuron pathologies.
