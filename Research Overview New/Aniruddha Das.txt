Researcher: Aniruddha Das
Research Overview:
Aniruddha Das's research encompasses a diverse array of topics primarily focused on the intersection of cognitive function, gerontology, and molecular biology. Central to this research is the exploration of allostatic load and social isolation among older adults, assessing their impact on global cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Das employs rigorous methodologies, including advanced imaging techniques like two-photon microscopy and various PCR techniques to study circular RNA and alternative splicing events in neurons, contributing to the burgeoning field of epigenetic research and neurophysiology. His work further extends to the investigation of lifestyle factors, such as educational attainment and social relationships, on mental health outcomes, emphasizing the significant roles of trauma, stress, and social supports. Utilizing large datasets from longitudinal studies like SHARE and HRS, Das examines the complex interactions among genetic predispositions, psychosocial factors, and health outcomes in aging populations, aiming to elucidate the multifactorial influences on cognitive decline and well-being in later life. Through this multidisciplinary approach, he seeks to enhance our understanding of aging processes and develop interventions to improve quality of life in older adults.
