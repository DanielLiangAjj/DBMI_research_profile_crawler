Researcher: Yasmine El-Shamayleh
Research Overview:
Yasmine El-Shamayleh's research centers on the complex interplay of visual perception and decision-making in nonhuman primates, particularly using rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as a model. Through advanced methodologies such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, her work investigates the neural dynamics within various brain regions, including the parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and visual areas like V4, in relation to object recognition and spatial processing. Her studies elucidate the role of GABAergic neurons and feedback signals in shaping perceptual decisions and saccadic movements, revealing critical insights into how visual information is encoded and represented in the brain. By employing techniques such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for gene transfer and immunohistochemistry for neuronal mapping, El-Shamayleh contributes to the broader understanding of visual cognition and the neural mechanisms underlying motion perception, attention, and decision-making processes in primates. Through her research, she aims to bridge gaps in our comprehension of neurological models related to visual perception, thus advancing the field of neuroscience significantly.
