Researcher: Amanda L. Bergner
Research Overview:
Amanda L. Bergner's research encompasses a broad spectrum of topics within the fields of clinical genetics and genetic counseling, emphasizing the integration of genomic technologies such as exome and genome sequencing, multigene panels, and artificial intelligence. Her work focuses significantly on pediatric populations and issues surrounding disparities in healthcare access, particularly for Spanish-speaking and underrepresented communities. By addressing the educational needs and professional development of genetic counselors, Bergner's studies investigate the cultural and communication barriers that affect genetic counseling practices, especially regarding patients with limited English proficiency. Furthermore, she explores the implications of genetic testing, informed consent, and the return of results in clinical settings, with specific attention to disorders like Neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. Ultimately, her research aims to enhance the efficacy and inclusivity of genetic counseling, bridging gaps in service delivery while fostering diversity and ethical practice within the profession.
