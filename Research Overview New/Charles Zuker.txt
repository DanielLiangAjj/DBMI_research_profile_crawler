Researcher: Charles Zuker
Research Overview:
Charles Zuker's research primarily investigates the complex interactions between sensory signaling, particularly taste perception, and behavior through the lens of neural mechanisms. His studies delve into the functioning of brain circuits, such as the amygdala and cortex, focusing on how these regions contribute to innate behaviors related to feeding and sensory coding. Zukerâ€™s work examines the role of specific ion channels, such as TRP channels, in taste and temperature representation, as well as the effects of various stimuli on memory and decision-making processes. Additionally, his research explores the neuroimmunomodulation of sensory pathways, shedding light on how inflammation and dietary preferences affect neural circuits and overall behavior. Through his use of advanced techniques like single-cell analysis and optogenetics in mouse models, Zuker has contributed significantly to understanding the neural basis of taste and its impact on feeding behavior, highlighting the intricate connections between sensory input, memory, and physiological responses.
