Researcher: Karen Marder
Research Overview:
Karen Marder's research primarily focuses on the intricate relationships between neurodegenerative diseases—especially Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)—and various factors affecting their progression and diagnosis. Utilising advanced statistical methods such as adaptive lasso, penalization methods, and generalized estimating equations, she investigates the genetic, clinical, and psychosocial dimensions of these conditions. Her studies encompass critical themes like the impact of lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, sleep) on cognitive function, the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies in clinical trials, and the implications of genetic testing and counseling for individuals at risk. By exploring neuroimaging, biomarkers, and neuropathological findings, Marder aims to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and inform better clinical outcomes. Her work also addresses the broader social and ethical challenges posed by genetic predisposition, particularly in diverse populations, ultimately striving for improved prevention strategies and patient support in the face of neurodegenerative disorders.
