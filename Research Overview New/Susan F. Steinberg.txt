Researcher: Susan F. Steinberg
Research Overview:
Susan F. Steinberg's research primarily focuses on the intricate mechanisms underlying cardiac function and pathology, particularly involving cardiomyocytes and their response to various stimuli, such as catecholamines and oxidative stress. Her work investigates the role of Î²1-adrenergic receptors, protein kinases, and post-translational modifications in cardiomyocyte signaling and function. She examines how proteolytic enzymes, including elastase and trypsin, influence these pathways, particularly through mechanisms of glycosylation and proteolysis. Additionally, her research highlights the critical involvement of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species in cardiac remodeling, apoptosis, and heart failure. By exploring the effects of various signaling pathways, such as those mediated by protein kinase C and AKT, Steinberg aims to uncover potential therapeutic targets for improving cardiac health and mitigating heart disease. Her findings contribute significantly to our understanding of heart disease mechanisms, particularly in the context of myocardial contraction, cardioprotection, and cellular signaling in cardiomyocytes.
