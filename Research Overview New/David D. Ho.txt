Researcher: David D. Ho
Research Overview:
David D. Ho's research comprehensively addresses critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1, focusing on viral dynamics, immune responses, and therapeutic strategies. His studies emphasize the decay and persistence of viruses, particularly in the context of COVID-19 treatments involving protease inhibitors like Nirmatrelvir. He investigates antiviral efficacy, drug resistance, and the implications of emerging variants such as Omicron. Utilization of mRNA vaccines and neutralizing antibodies is explored, highlighting their roles in combating viral infections and the challenges posed by immune evasion and antibody escape. Moreover, Ho's research delves into the design and optimization of monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, addressing breakthrough infections and the evolution of viral strains. By merging concepts in virology, immunology, and therapeutic innovation, his work contributes significantly to understanding and addressing the complexities of COVID-19 and HIV, reinforcing the importance of adaptive vaccine strategies and monoclonal antibody therapies in public health.
