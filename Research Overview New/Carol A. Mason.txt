Researcher: Carol A. Mason
Research Overview:
Carol A. Mason's research focuses on various aspects of neurogenesis and visual system development, particularly involving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their roles in binocular vision and albinism. Her work investigates the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the development and regeneration of axons in the retina and optic pathways. Utilizing approaches such as single-cell RNA sequencing and in utero electroporation, Mason explores the contributions of diverse cell types, including glia and microglia, in the context of traumatic brain injury and other developmental anomalies. Key themes in her studies include the effects of genetic factors, the role of cyclin D2 in cell division, and the guidance of axons within the visual pathways, including the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus. Through her investigations, Mason aims to illuminate the intricate interplay between genetic regulation, cellular differentiation, and functional outcomes in vision, ultimately seeking to enhance our understanding of regenerative processes in the nervous system.
